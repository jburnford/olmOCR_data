School,\nDelmas, Sask., Jan 12, 1837.\n\nMr. Hoey,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRev. Father U. Langlois, Provincial of the C.F., wrote to us a few days ago, he tells us that you had been very interested in reading our Thunder Report.\n\nWe are therefore greatly pleased to send you a copy. It is published every two months. This is our second number.\n\nWe are very thankful to you, Mr. Hoey, for your kind interest.\nHappy New Year\n\nWishing you a happy new year to all those we love, especially to our parents, our pastors, teachers, and benefactors. Lord, we pray for them. Give them your holy peace, may they pass in the world spreading happiness around them.\n\nWishing you a happy new year to all those who suffer and to whom life is a burden. May God give them hope which will help them to bear their tribulations.\n\nAgain, wishing you a happy new year to all our reader especially to you, our friends of the Indian school. May the coming year be one of health, success, peace and happiness.\n\nThese will be obtained through love of God and love of neighbor.\n\nMadeline Sipil\u00e4nen\n\nThe Feast of the Immaculate Conception\n\nI have seen by reading your journals that you celebrated the feast of the Immaculate Conception. We did too. At high Mass in our church we sang the \"Angel Mass.\" The altar was beautifully decorated with white roses and lilies. The choir was decked with beautiful festoons of white and blue paper. Blue shields with our monogram could be seen here and there. Fifteen big girls had the privilege of going to High Mass at the parish church, at 10 A.M. There also, it was decorated with much taste. Our recreation room was decorated in blue and white, the colours of the Blessed V.M. The statue of our...\nAn Interesting Visit.\n\nOn Dec. 21st, we had the pleasure of receiving in our class rooms the visit of Mr. Innes, our School Inspector. What a happy visit! He arrived at 2 o'clock and left at 4.\n\nFirst, we had reading, oral spelling, then a history lesson on La Verendrye. These brought us until a few minutes after three. Then Mr. Innes talked to us. Oh! I wish every one of you, readers, would have been here present. How into resting and useful it was. He talked about science, the love of nature. He told us to be always happy now, at school and later on with our surroundings. He also said not to be afraid of hard tasks. He says, there is real happiness in solving hard problems. We must also have an aim in life and we must do all we can to follow the good inspirations which will lead us to our goal.\n\nDon't think that Mr. Innes was serious all that time; no, he made us laugh very much.\n\nBefore leaving we sang our song \"Gold the Plant may blow\". This song made him think of his school up north, where he was teaching.\n\nWe are very thankful to Mr. Innes for the kind interest he shows us and the encouragement he gave us for our school paper.\n\nWe hope to see him again in February, but we also hope that he will forget his task.\n\nAlice Deschamps,\nGrade VIII\n\nA Preference\n\nSister: Here is a lolly-pop because you did your work so well today.\n\nReid: Please give me a good mark on the honor roll instead.\n\nCONGRATULATIONS\n\nWhat good Fathers we have at Belmont! Many of you know Father Inglin, he is our principal. He is a tall, clean man. His gray hair tell us that he must be between fifty and sixty. He is very kind and generous. The lovely Christmas gifts he sent us are proof of his generosity. We love him very much and only wish he would stay a long time with us.\n\nRev. Father T\u00e9treault is in charge of the parish. He is not very tall and must be around thirty-five. Much of his time is spent for his parishioners; but always finds time to come and skate with us or amuse us in our recreation room. He is the one to organize the hockey games between the white boys and us. We love him and see him much.\n\nRev. Father Mercier is a rather young priest very tall and stout. Every Sunday he goes to Mass. If he found Major Roberge to say Mass, the cold weather can keep him from going. We hope that his shortness will pass and bring back to God many souls. A great deal of his time is spent playing and encouraging us in our games. Father Mercier and T\u00e9treault are in charge of our skating rink; I should say of all our sports. They are very kind to us and try to take our duties. May they never leave us for our sorry world!\n\nRev. Father Chatelain and Maclean are not less amiable. These two young priests are studying Cree. We wish them success, and also thank them for their nice visits after supper. They come for the purpose of talking Cree and English with us, so just hope that they keep on for we like visitors.\n\nDonald Chatelain,\nGrade VII\n\nA Strange Fish for a Child\n\nRaymond: I would so much like to have a ground fish.\n\nSister: Ground? What would you do with it?\n\nRaymond: I would kiss it every night before going to sleep.\nBingo Game\n\nOn New Year's day Grades V, VI, VII, VIII had a bingo game in the class room. It lasted two hours. There were about 25 prizes. When the game was over Sister called out the names of those who had scored the highest number of marks. Maria Ladislavich had the first prize, and Donald Chastain the second. I have been so lucky so this was the next time. There had been no interesting that we didn't notice about this was playing so fast.\n\nWe will have another one next year, so we all want to invite our friends to our bingo game. There will be a big surprise sister says.\n\nStella Siskoskan,\nGrade VII\n\nChristmas Party\n\nDuring the Christmas holidays we had a fine party for the sewing girls. Decorated tables were prepared in the sewing room for lunch. During this time Sister Catherine-de-Gros was in the kitchen with a few girls making pancakes. At 3 o'clock everything was ready. After we had apples, sweets and butter lunch was followed by a bingo game. There were useful prizes for the lucky winners.\n\nI think this party will make us love our sewing room more than ever.\n\nMany thanks to Sister Catherine-de-Gros.\n\nKate Toebosis,\nGrade VII\nCHRISTMAS TESTS\n\nOur Christmas Tests were long and hard. It was a review of the four months' work. Sister was very strict in grading them. We all aimed at 100% on every subject; some did get it, but most of us did not. The smartest ones changed grades, but I didn't.\n\nWhen Sister had finished correcting our papers she wrote the names of each subject on a big piece of paper. She gave each pupil a little box or crate filled with holly, for Grade II; on a small bell for Grade I; and on a little sled for Grade III. Each pupil had his own and each was coloured in green and red. This encouraged us very much for they were going to be hung up for the whole month, in the class-room.\n\nYou may find on each drawing the results of the tests of the four pupils who came out first.\n\nElizabeth Snakeskin\nGrade VI\n\nWe had a party in our class-room. Sister gave us some candy for prizes. I will tell you what we did. We played musical-chairs, the pupils of Grade I played musical-broom, and I played the phonograph. We all had fun. For the prize time, Josephine got a little brown dress & my donkey. The girls cut out paper tails. All of us went to place the tail on the donkey. It was funny to see it with a tail on its head.\n\nThe winner was Thomas Parkinson.\n\nEmma Norris\nGrade VI\n\nCHRISTMAS DAY\n\nDid you recognize any new name for Christmas? In fact we prepared the Mass of the \"Massed Liturgy\" in Gregorian. We sang it at the midnight mass, then on Christmas day at the High Mass of the parish church.\n\nWe love to sing it for it is so lovely and pious. We also sang a new hymn \"Hail of Bethlehem\". We got up at 7:30. How anxious we were to go down for breakfast! Our plates were all filled up with candied peanuts and pop-corn.\n\nAt about six o'clock in the afternoon, we went to the girls' recreation room to see our Christmas presents.\n\nRev. Father Brindley had given all the sisters nice presents. We were lovely ladies there. Toys of all sorts, many of which were very useful and others very amusing, were there lying in front of us. Every one has been well rewarded.\n\nWe thank Rev. Brindley for the gifts and sweets we had during the holidays.\nA week before Christmas we have a beautiful decoration in our sewing room. Your girls looked at it. I am sure you all like decorating, don't you?\n\nSister M. Catherine\u2014each one in our wardroom. Could you like to know what sort of work we are doing? Most of all the girls of grades V and VI, seven to eleven years, take manual training in the forenoon while the girls of grades VII and VIII, eleven girls, have their turn in the afternoon.\n\nMuch work has to be done, such as: mending the clothes, cutting and sewing patches, while others are continually sewing at the machines. There are always new clothes to be done. At the end of the week, when our pending darning and sewing is nearly over, we are allowed to take part in an exhibition work. These are knitted woollen sweaters, shirts, knitted suits, mittens, stockings, etc., etc. Lovely embroidery work is also done. We also learn how to cook. We have each our turn in the kitchen. This work is fine.\n\nNow, if we do not know how to take care of food and how to prepare meals it will be our fault. For every opportunity is given to us on many times. I hope that we will all profit by these useful lessons.\n\nMadeline Nickerson\n\nJanuary 1st, 1913\n\nMargaret Hannah\n\nMargaret: Why do you wear glasses?\n\nMargaret: Because I can see things easily.\n\nMargaret: Would you please take them off, when you are writing your Christmas cards for me.\nThe Sisters were present as well as a few Indians of the reserves. There were songs, recitations, dialogues, jigs, pantomimes and an address.\n\nOur last wish was: \"May Mrs. Millar come stay with us many more years!\"\n\nDavid Hankinson,\nGrade VI\n\nOur Chapel\n\nOur little chapel looked so pretty this year in its decoration of tinsel points, settings, holly wreaths and silver stars. These in the sanctuary were much more dazzling than the things outside the crib, but nice it is especially in the morning when it is lighted up. You would think that they were real rocks. The red, blue and green lights give such beautiful tints on the rocks and particularly on the little Child Jesus.\n\nOn the top of the crib there are hills. It must be the hills of Judea where there can be seen a little scattered village in miniature. Electric lights are also in them. Small palm trees, eight inches high, are found here and there.\n\nFor my part I think this is the most crib I have ever seen.\n\nMary Poplar\nGrade VII\nThe Girls' Christmas Concert\n\nWe held a Christmas Concert on December 25th. It lasted about two hours. The students and grown-ups from the reserves were present. We found it very interesting. We had seventeen articles listed on the program.\n\nThere were some recitations and a few skits, one of which they found very interesting. We also sang a very nice little story.\n\nCould you send it? I would like to see it.\n\nOur family was seated amongst the fireplaces at the church. Father had just finished telling us that it is too soon to give presents. He then spoke of children who do not have enough clothes or food. We all felt very sorry for them. After the service we went outside to see the children playing in the snow. We also went to the village rink where the big boys were playing. It was still exciting.\n\nWe also had parties of all kinds: bingo, cards, checkers and little entertainments.\n\nI think I will never forget these holidays.\n\nSally Johnson\nGrade VI\n\nHow I Spent my Christmas Holidays\n\nWhat joyful holidays we all passed this year! They were not very long, from the 25th to the 3rd of January, but they were amusing.\n\nI had much fun sliding. We went to the rink to see the hockey games. It was so exciting. Once we went to the village rink. There the big boys were playing. It was still exciting.\n\nWe also had parties of all kinds: bingo, cards, checkers and little entertainments.\n\nI think I will never forget these holidays.\n\nSally Johnson\nGrade V\n\nImaginative Story\n\nNight Before Christmas\n\nAfter supper Jack and Joan were very much excited. They went upstairs looking for stockings. Jack found one but it was too small for either of them. Joan said, \"This will do for our baby brother.\" Jack went downstairs and tried to hang the little stocking on the fireplace for Santa to put some things for baby. Joan pinned a paper on the stocking. \"BABY\" was written on it.\n\nAfter sometime Jack came down screaming with two long stockings. Soon the three were well hung on the fireplace. Father who was reading his newspaper said to see in the living room, and when he saw the three stockings he said, \"Oh! Santa has to put many toys in those two long...\"\nstockings. I think maybe was the Santa\nfilled all the stockings. How glad were\nthe children in the morning.\n\nDavid Tootoosis\nGrade IV\n\nHockey Games\n\nWe had many hockey games during the\nholidays, the Indian boys against the village\nboys. These games were a kind of tough sometimes,\nwe often went to their rink. The first and\nsecond teams often go and play at the village\nrink. We are beaten sometimes. Yesterday the\nthird team of the village came to play here. They\nwere beaten six to two. I hope you boys have\njust as much fun skating as we have.\n\nErnest Atchumun\nGrade V\n\nFriendly Visit\n\nThe white children came to visit our school\nrooms on January 3rd. We had Christmas decorations\non the blackboards, in the windows and on the\nwalls. Not only our rooms but also the other\nrooms were decorated. They wished us a Happy New\nYear, and we did too.\n\nLucia Bigkwekan\nGrade V\nThe pupils from the Grade II class came to visit us. Grade II had fifty words and Grade I had twenty-five words to spell. They worked hard and they talked loudly in the afternoon. Grade I junior came to visit us because he knew about spelling. He told us that there was a big rabbit. He showed us how to spell.\n\nThis morning it was our turn to go to school. We sang our songs and recited our poems when we found in the back number of our paper. We came to school prepared. It is something new.\n\nWe played rhythm band and started to play triangles, bells and cymbals. We sang songs. We played the drums. We made a song to make the teacher laugh. On the organ they invited us to come again.\n\nFurthur Fashions,\n\nGrade III\n\nBy Toy\n\nOn Monday we had to start school. I looked at my top. What a day! I wish there were no rain.\n\nEdward Frenchman,\nGrade I\n\nNew Jersey Huskies\n\nIt's ready for winter.\n\nIn the book of rivers and ponds, there is a beaver. He builds his house in the water. He builds his house by using sticks and mud. He makes a dam across the river. The beaver lives in the dam. He lives in the dam all year round. He stores up food during the winter months.\n\nFredde Martel,\nGrade IV\n\nSurprise\n\nToday we welcome to our school two new pupils from Grade VI. They are Stella McIntosh and Donald Graham. They are both promised to arrive today. We hope that they will find our school very nice. We are sure that they will enjoy all their work. We will surely find little difficulties; I can assure myself that they will be happy at school. Our teacher will be all she can be to make you understand them.\n\nYour pupils from Grade I.\nWe all invite you for the 16th of this month, there will be a BIG HOCKEY GAME.\n\n---\n\nAt Christmas we had one snow day. We had much fun with our toys. The toys were pretty. I like my doll.\n\nMistakes made in the classroom:\n\n(a) In baptism we promise Jesus his name and his power and live according to the example of J. Christ.\n\n(b) Days of abstinence are days when we must not eat flesh meat.\n\n(c) When we baptize we must pronounce the words at the same time.\n\n(d) Confirmation, baptism and holy orders can be received but once because they imprint a mark in the soul.\n\n(e) Name an early missionary of the West? Columbus.\nA PRAYER\n\nO Lord, Father in Heaven,\nLook this prayer\nGuide me and keep me always\nUntil I climb the ladder stair.\nHelp me to take each step right,\nWith a cheerful smiling face,\nSo that when I start over,\nI reach a higher place.\nTake me a mirror child,\nIn body and in mind,\nMore and more like Thee,\nTrue, loving, kind.\nShow me how to travel the road,\nShow me the way of it.\nThat some day to Thee I'll come\nFor Thy service make me fit.\n\nThis is taken from the Western Press.\nBlue Quills Res. School\nSt. Paul, Alberta.\nFeb.17th,1938.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare and Training\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs Rev. Father Langlois requested we are sending you a copy of our school journal.\n\nWe, the teachers and pupils, feel well repaid for our work when we receive journals from other Indian Schools.\n\nThe routine of work is much the same in all Indian Schools and it is in trying to beautify these humble tasks and to render picturesque the little incidents of every day life that lies the true value of exchanging school magazines.\n\nWe feel honored, Kind Sir, to think that you will read these little compositions and see the sketches of our pupils.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nThe Teachers of The Blue Quills School.\n\n[Signatures]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, February 23, 1938.\n\nDear Sister Costello:\n\nPlease accept my most sincere thanks for your letter of the 17th instant and for the magazine enclosed therewith.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to state that I appreciate very fully the courtesy of the Reverend Sisters and pupils in writing to me at this time.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Sister C. Costello,\nBlue Quills Indian Residential School,\nSaint Paul, Alberta.\nMEMORIES OF CHRISTMAS.\n\nEvery room that we stepped in made us think of the joys of Christmas; not only by the cheerful people but by the beautiful decorations. What a sight it was to see the boys' Hall, the convent, the school, and the church, all so well arranged. Of course I think the most beautiful decoration was in our classroom, because you see, I gave a hand in putting up the trimmings! \u2014 Frank Giroux \u2014 Gr. VI.\n\nThe week before Christmas, everyone in our class was asked to have a gift ready to exchange. We each wrote our name on a slip of paper, even Sister. Those slips were then gathered and mixed, and then we each took one. We were to prepare a gift for the person whose name was written on our slip. It was most exciting. Jimmy Thomas was the lucky one to get Sister Jean's name. At last the great day came! Our classroom was decorated so beautifully. There was a nice tree under which we put all our nicely-wrapped parcels. Frank Giroux then replaced Santa Claus, by calling out the names and giving out the parcels. When our name was called, we had to go to the front and show the class what we had received, so they could laugh if someone had played a trick on us. We received nice gifts, and we were doubly happy because it was our last day in school before the wonderful holidays. \u2014 Dorothy Phillips \u2014 Gr. VIII.\n\nMy big brother, Harry, who is in his fourth year at St. John's College in Edmonton, has ranked first in his class all year, so as a reward, Rev. Father Selmer sent him some money so he could come home for the Christmas holidays. He was so glad to be here, and we were happy to have such a nice long visit with him again. My sisters Nancy also came home from St. Augustine's Academy in Peace River for the holidays. With her came Norm Mahar, Mary Jane Sinclair, and Agnes and Pauline Kindorwater who had come to spend the fastest days here. The old pupils often went up to our classroom. I wonder if they were homesick for school, or if it is because our piano is such an attraction? \u2014 Jimmy Thomas \u2014 Gr. VIII., Annie Thomas \u2014 Gr. VI.\n\nWe were all in dreamland when suddenly we heard beautiful music. It was Sister Mary A. playing the accordion, and Sisters Jean Pius, Guy, and Cecilia Rita singing a Christmas hymn. Did Sister have to ring the bell to wake us up? I should say not; we\nWere too anxious to go to see our Infant Savior.\n\nWe stayed for two Masses which were sung by Rev. Fr. Falhor. It was beautiful to see the brilliantly lighted altar and crib, the rich Mass vestments of the priest and the boys in their red cassocks. Henry Thomas, also in red, was Master of Ceremonies. Rev. Fr. Betti preached in Croc, then Rev. Fr. Kindervater spoke in English. We were all very glad to have Midnight Mass in our cathedral, as it was almost a year since we had gone to worship there, as the boys had used it for their recreation room.\n\nAfter Mass, we came back to the convent and took a light lunch. Going back to bed, I regretted that it had passed all too quickly. But we looked forward eagerly to all the joys that Christmas brings.\n\nMabel Noskeyi --- Gr. VIII.\n\nBefore our gifts were given out, we had a little program which was acted by eight boys. It was so funny! They then cleared the stage and started to call out the Christmas presents. Fr. Kindervater was our Santa Claus this year. He was very anxious for our presents because he wanted to see what we had. All our gifts came from St. John's friends at J.J.A. Viking. While they were calling our names out, we tried to take a peek. After all the presents were given, Fr. Kindervater's sister, Agnes, played on the piano and he sang after, for us in German.\n\nSome of the children had games, tops, ten pins, puzzles and so forth. After having played Santa Claus, Father passed candies and peanuts to us. Then all was finished the children went to play with their new toys. You should have heard the noise and seen all the happy faces.\n\nMargie Buddin ---- Lena Twin ---- Gr. VI.\n\nA CHANGE OF THE CLERGY\n\nOn Dec. 28th, Rev. Fr. Proulx went east to see his mother who is not expected to live. He is not back yet, and we don't know how he and his beloved mother are getting along, but we hope that God will restore her to health again. Malba Cordiall --- Gr. V.\n\nWhen we came back to school after our holidays we were sorry to hear that Fr. Proulx, our former Catechism teacher left for Ottawa but we are glad to have Fr. Kinderv...\nA PLEASANT VISIT\n\nOn Jan. 1st, Mother Provincial and Sr. Aubert paid us a visit; they came on Saturday and went back on Monday. We all thought that was too short a visit, but we had no bus; visiting other missions they had to go. I hope they will come again.\n\nSr. Aubert was very kind in removing our Club's subscription to the Catholic Messenger. We get it every month. It is a little Catholic messenger with beautiful stories which we enjoy very much. We wish to thank Sr. Aubert once more for her kindness, for this is the second year she gets the Messenger for us.\n\nJean Bollrose --- Gr. VI.\n\nSr. Louise de Bon Pasteur who had been at the Molonman Hospital since November, came back in January. She had a sore foot and could not walk. She was very glad to come back and so was everyone else. Now she is doing her work as cook in the kitchen.\n\nSr. Joseph Augustin who has been in charge of us girls was changed last week. We are very sorry when she told us that she was going to be back. Sr. Vitellia is coming to take her place.\n\nMargaret Auger --- Gr. V.\n\nINCREASE IN GROUARD POPULATION\n\nIt just seems like yesterday that Irene Cossette and Julienne Noceydi were sitting in the classroom with us -- but no! It is almost three years ago that they got married. Last month Irene's second baby boy was born. His name is Kenneth Lloyd. I wish it would have been a little girl, because girls help more than boys! Julienne has two little girls, the baby has my name: Edna. Alvino Culifer who was married:\nLast year also has a baby girl named Violet Evelyn. We wish these old schoolmates of ours much joy in their new life.\n\nEdna Fulton --- Gr VII.\n\nREADING OF THE NOTES\n\nOn Feb. 1st, Fr. Felhor came to the classrooms to read the notes. Frank Giroux got the prize in Sister 'Jean Precious' room. He and Mary Callion were both tied with an average of 95% but he got the lucky number. In our classroom Theresa Lussent was the highest, while in Sr. Mary Thelma's room William John Chalifoux was the best. Leonie Herson was the highest in Sr. Guy of the Savior's classroom. We didn't get any report cards, but we all know our points. We will try to do better next month.\n\nMary Twin --- Gr. V.\n\nWhile we were having our report cards, Mr. Sprugo the Inspector of Fisheries came with another man to visit the school. When Mr. Sprugo came to our room he asked us a few questions on the different kinds of birds and fish that are found here. We then sang a song for him. So in return he also sang two nice songs for us. We wish we were always as lucky to have visitors sing when they come and visit our classroom, for we enjoy it very much.\n\nHelen Miller --- Gr. VII.\n\nST. THERESE'S CLUB HAS A MEETING\n\nWe invited St. Valentine to our club meeting this year. It was held on the 15th of February. We invited Sister John Precious and her pupils and all those who don't come to school. After having sung our club hymn to The Little Flower, we recited the Summ of Boos as our real call. Then we dramatized \"The Pied Piper\". The rats made everyone laugh when they ran after the Pied Piper, Raymond Anott. The most important thing was the passing of the valentinos which we\nSince Sr. Amy had almost seventy pupils, Fr. Fuller, always so helpful, decided that Florence Shaw, one of our old pupils would help Sister. Florence took over some of the pupils and is now teaching them in the boys' new refectory. She also has six girls; the rest are boys. We hope she will enjoy teaching and close with her much success.\n\nAnnie Thomas --- Gr. VII.\n\nOn Feb. 17th, all the Fathers and Brothers renewed their vows. Rev. Fr. Lajoie said Mass at half past eight in the convent chapel. The Brothers sang during Mass. Rev. Fr. Lajoie preached in French and English. It was all very beautiful. Before Fr. Drouin received Holy Communion he made his vows for one year. After Mass the Fathers read their vows in Latin, followed by the Brothers. When all were finished they sang the \"Te Deum\" and \"Magnificat\". In honor of the feast, we all enjoyed it so much. In the afternoon Rev. Fr. Lajoie gave us a holiday. We all enjoyed it so much. In the afternoon we went for a walk. When we came back we listened to the radio for the rest of the afternoon until night we had potatoes.\n\nMary Callison --- Gr. VII.\n\nAN EVENING IN \"NIGERETOWN\"\n\nSeveral weeks ago, we decided that our next club meeting would be all negro songs and plays. Sister could not find a good minstrel that would suit us, so she\nasked us to bring all the negro stories and jokes we could find, and with these and all the catchy negro melodies stored away in our teacher's musical mind, Sister made up a two act play, so whom decided to make this a big affair, and to have it in the evening at the Boys' Hall. So we could invite our parents and friends. On Monday we had a rehearsal in the Boys' Hall. Rev. Fr. Giroux was there and the day pupils with the big pieces. We blochoned up so we would get used to seeing each other looking so funny. Fr. Giroux certainly enjoyed it for he laughed very much. We had great fun practising and blochoning up, putting on our costumes and laughing at one another. We were quite a sight to look at.\n\nFinally the big night came. Our Secretary called out our negro names and we answered the roll call by coming in and making a big bow or doing something like that. We sang some Negro songs and some of the negroes jiggled. Next came the show at which we'll took part. In the first act, Dinah was getting her children ready to go to a concert. The second act was the concert itself. We kept the people laughing the whole time. The part I enjoyed the most was when Chicken Bone (Victor Bourgeois) played the guitar and sang. While he was playing, Fr. Na did his best mocking him with some rhythm sticks as if he was playing a violin. Then old Joe (George Clifford) began playing the violin with his nose and pipe, and every once in a while he would take a puff from his pipe. It was so funny to see him trying to keep time with the music.\nAfter the play, Frank Giroux came in and began to sleep. Just as he started to snore he awakened with a start and said, \"Do you think he saw? A ghost standing by him. He tried to sneak out quietly but as soon as he caught sight of the white figure following him he began to run for dear life. He ran out of the hall around the refectory three times. The people just yelled each time he'd come back on to the stage followed closely by the ghost. It seemed as though his hair was standing on end. When he could not run anymore he sat down on a bench and the ghost sat right beside him. That was quite a run to hear,\" said the ghost.\n\n\"I sho' will!\" replied Frank in a breathless voice, \"and when I got my breath, we sho' gonna run somonore.\" \"Fasta, do yo' duty!!\" and with this he jumped up and ran away. Everyone just shouted with laughter at Frank because his feet were as big as saucers.\n\nIn between all the funny things, we played beautiful selections with our Rhythm Band, or sang some negro songs. Everyone seemed to enjoy it for they till they cried. So many times we had to stop talking a long while because they were laughing too much.\n\nAfter it was over, Rev. Frs. Lejoie and Falher spoke to us, saying how much they had enjoyed every bit of it. Many people came to thank our teacher for such an enjoyable evening. But many people missed it, so we were asked to report it. Sister said we would after Easter, perhaps.\n\nGrade VIII.\n\nDEATH OF BROTHER CORNET\n\nMonday afternoon we heard of the death of Rev. Br. Corneil who died at the hospital in Peace River. Br. Corneil was born in France in 1869 and had been ill over this winter. Brother was here for many years; he was the shoemaker, but the last ten years he has been at St. Augustine's Mission in Peace River. When Br. Boss\u00e9 and Dr. Cunning arrived here with the body the next night, we all went...\nto the church and after the singing of the Subvenito, we prayed for the repose of his soul. On March 3rd, a Solemn High Mass was sung by Rev. Fr. Bourgeois, the Superior of St. Augustine's Mission. He was assisted by Rev. Fr. Lejoie as deacon, and Rev. Fr. Kindervater as subdeacon. It was the first time we had heard a solemn High Mass since the departure of our Bishop. Brother Cormier was buried at the right hand side of Bishop Ground. May he rest in peace.\n\nGrade VII.\n\nAN EVENTFUL DAY - M.R. S.\n\nSo many things happened today! Early this morning Mr. Superior, who was in Midnapore making her retreat these last two weeks, came back home. We were greatly surprised when we heard that two new Sisters had come with her. One of the Sisters whose name is Sr. Vitillion is coming to replace Sr. Joseph Augustin at the Girls' end the other, Sr. Mary Prosper, is going to replace Sr. Guy in the Boy class, so that Sr. Guy can help Sr. Vitillion to take care of the girls. On the same train, Fr. Troulx returned to Ground after a two months visit to his home, we are very anxious to see him again and to hear all about his travels.\n\nAfter we had come back from the funeral this forenoon, as we were busily at work, we heard a knock on the classroom door - and to our joy and surprise, in walked Fr. Beauregard with Fr. Kindervater. Although they did not stay long because Fr. Beauregard had to leave right after dinner, we enjoyed their visit immensely. As we looked at our present and former Catechism teachers, we could not help but wish that we could keep them both. But, a few hours later, Fr. Beauregard and the Brothers were off for Peace River again, and the Sr. Bruno car took away Sr. Cecile Ritter who has been changed from here to Vassour. Thus ended an eventful day.\n\nThe day before had also been a very happy one, for the boys' new beds arrived. After having slept on the floor for fourteen months, it was \"pretty nice\" to spring up and down on brand new beds!\n\nGrade VI.\nMOCCASIN NEWS\n\nMAY 1938.\n\nVOL.

How much will you give me a word as reporter for Moccasin News?\n\nI have been bending nails for the last three weeks and some times my rulers tell me a lie so\n\nSPORT NEWS\n\nBALL\n\nOn Easter we had the best ball game ever played at Hobbs. For 2 innings Laybones and Leafors kept tied 0-0. The Referee, Manager Pat Child had a good time counting the strikes but the Scorekeeper only had runs to mark; 6 for Laybones and 7 for Leafors.\n\nAlthough it was quite cold on the other Sundays they kept on the run. It is very hard to decide who will win the old wooden cup this year. Baghors don't seem to have as much chance as all the best players like Pete Morin for instance are passing to Married Man's side.\n\nSTEER RIDING\n\nOn the 1st of May the boys started to practice for this summer's stampede. There they were at Francis Bull's place riding steers like real old Cowboys. Some of the steers though were a bit too tough and some of the riders found themselves sitting in dust all of a sudden. George Mindo Pat Rattlesnake and a few others made quite a good show.\n\nLet us hope they all make good at the stampede this summer.\nSchool Section\n\nSpring is here and we are very glad.\n\nby Celine Therese Rabbit Gr.V.\n\nA NEW FRIEND.\n\nWe have a new friend in Edmonton. Her name is Miss Huban. A year or two ago our teacher met her and told her about her Indian children. Miss Huban was kindly interested in us and sent us many very beautiful brooches. We wish to thank her for being so good to us all.\n\nMary Jane Godin Gr.IV.\n\nMRS. SPEEDY'S VISIT\n\nLast month Mrs. Speedy and two of her cousins from Red Deer came to visit our School. They seemed very interested in our work and sent us many presents. Our teacher also received a letter from Mrs. Speedy thanking her for our hospitality. We are very glad to hear she is also interesting many her friends to us. We hope to see her again in June. While expecting her visit we wish to thank her and her friends for their kindness.\n\nSophie Nepoos Gr.V.\n\nHAVING FUN ON THE SWINGS\n\nHarriet Crier Gr.

LAMBERT\n\nDear Mrs. Lambert,\n\nPlease pardon me for writing to you without knowing you... anyhow I know your name because I was told you are the kind lady who sent us the Silver Cup.\n\nI now wish to thank you for having been so kind to the Ermineskin School Boys. You might be interested to know that the Yankees won it on May 11th. They played against the Tigers and Giants. The Junior boys also have three clubs but we do not know yet the result of their games... again I thank you.\n\nAlex Simon Gr.V.\n\nLOST REWARD\n\nWe were washing the moccasins. Mary Jane and I, Sister St. Emmanuel came and called Mary Jane to work in the church. I went with them and both of us left our work. Two little girls took our place to wash the moccasins. When we came back from the church the washing was all finished. Sr. Ste-Lucie was going to reward us but we both lost our reward for leaving our work.\n\nHelen Shortnook, Gr IV\n\nLONELY LITTLE WOLVES.\n\nOn Treaty time the little Wolves did not go home because they had measles at their place. I was very sorry not to go home and thought I would be lonesome. But Fr. Pratt took us to Wetaskiwin to bring Celina Therese Rabbit home. We stopped to see Jean-Baptiste at the Hospital. Then we continued to Edmonton with Fr. Pratt #8 8245 $8.50 Mgr. Langlois. After his Mass at seven o'clock we took our supper, we went to play for a few minutes and then we had moving pictures. We enjoyed ourselves very much and I thank our good Father for the nice ride.\n\nTherese Wolfe Gr. IV.\nI was very glad to wish a Happy Feast to Sr. Superior. Monday we had holiday. I will be happy to see Fr. Moulin next Tuesday.\n\nBilly Frazer Gr.I\n\nSAD NEWS\n\nI am very sad. My little sister Mary Lightning died on May 4.

Poor Bachelors had no chance with George II...as referee. \"What's that, George?\" they would ask when they thought their player just had time to make 2nd base. \"Strike on 2nd\", said George having a hard time to keep watch on the pitching and the bases at the same time. At times the ball travelled so fast he thought they were using two balls.\n\n(more sport news on p.5)\nMARY MOTHER OF GOD.\n\nA Pastor was visiting a Catholic family. \"Well, Annie,\" he said to a bright-eyed little girl, \"do you know your prayers?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered and recited \"Our Father.\" Then she started to recite \"Hail Mary\" but the other stopped her. \"We must not pray the Virgin Mary,\" he said, \"recite the Credo.\"\n\nThe little girl began; \"I believe in God\" etc., but when she came to the words \"who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Vir...\" she stopped short. \"What am I supposed to say here?\" she asked. \"If we must not pray her, then we should not believe in her.\"\n\nThe Pastor did not know what to answer but when he came back to his house he started to think over the subject and kneeling down he caught himself reciting \"Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us, sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.\"\n\n**************\n\n\"Quick Bunny, come take my place\nI'm all in\".\n\nSEE YOU NEXT MONTH\n\n[Signature]\n\nPovesh\nDEATH OF ARCHBISHOP O'LEARY.\n\nWe were very sorry to hear that Rt. Rev. Archbishop O'Leary of Edmonton, died at Victoria quite suddenly. Our teacher, Sr. Benigna, told us what she heard about him over the radio during the Catholic Hour. She told us about his life when he was a priest, a bishop, and an archbishop and how much good he had done for his people.\n\nOn the seventh of March, Father Lejeune and Father Falher went to Edmonton for the funeral. While there, Fr. Falher got sick and had to go to the Grey Nuns Hospital to be taken care of. While he was there, he wrote a nice letter to the children. The pupils of Sr. Jean Placidus wrote to him and sent him some little jokes to make him laugh in his bed.\n\nCore Desjardins\u2014George Prasse...Gr.V.\n\nMOVING PICTURES!\n\nFather Kindervater seems to know just what we like. We were so glad when we heard that on March the thirteenth, we were going to have some moving pictures. That evening we had the story of Rin Tin Tin. As this dog was being drawn along the road, his cage happened to tip, and so he was brought up by the wolves. He grew up with wolf instincts but after he got a human master, he was always very gentle. As his master was going along as usual with some furs, his enemy shot him. Rin Tin Tin tore a piece off the enemy's clothes. Another time, Rin Tin Tin dropped another of his master's enemies down a cliff. After that, he came back to his master's home to live there happily.\n\nAlfred Thibeault...Gr.IV.\n\nOn March twenty-third, Fr. Kindervater showed us the Life of Our Lord. Long ago, they had a plague in Oberammergau, so the people promised God if He would spare them they would act the Passion Play every ten years. In the first reels, we saw the city of Oberammergau, and the woodcarvers, carving statues and crosses. We also saw the picture of Anton Lang who took the part of Our Lord in the Passion Play. After that we saw the whole life of Our Lord. We followed Him all the way from His crib to His Cross, and last of all, when He went up to Heaven. The nicest part was when they buried Our Lord. We could see the shadow of the rock while they were lifting it up. We also could see Our Lord lying in the Holy Sepulchre.\n\nTherese Aussant...Gr. V.\nGONE... BUT NOT FORGOTTEN.\n\nIt is hard to believe that Death has taken from us a classmate whom we all loved: Milton Faverque. When a letter from Harry Thomas to our teacher announced the sad news, we were all so shocked and grieved that we could say nothing. Then a telegram arrived, saying that Milton would be brought here for burial; we were all glad to think we would see him again and would be able to assist at his funeral. It was only after the funeral that we heard the details of his death.\n\nMilton had been a pupil here for seven years. The youngest of the three Faverque boys, he was always a great favourite everywhere. He was the only little boy permitted to play in the big boys' base-ball team. Everyone remembers him for his endless teasing and fun, but also for his great kindness to the little ones. Although he had been attending the Jesuit College in Edmonton for the past three years, he often wrote to us and was always telling us to enjoy our school-days here in \"the best school in the world\" as he used to call it.\n\nMilton's death was very sudden and unexpected. On Monday, March 28th, he complained of a headache. He was put to bed, but the next day, the Jesuit Fathers took him to the hospital where several of the best doctors in Edmonton did all they could to save him. But God wanted him... and on Thursday, March 31st, our dear friend Milton passed quietly away. He had been unconscious while perfectly conscious that day, and was very gay until about five hours before his death. His brother Donat was with him when he died, but George was not able to be there because of a severe headache, and their father was unable to arrive only two\nA few days later, His body was taken to the Jesuit College where the Fathers, students, and friends took their turns to watch and pray near him. On Monday morning, a funeral service was held at the College with the members of his class in their special College uniforms acting as pall-bearers. There were delegations from other schools and clubs, for Milton was widely known through his great success in sports of every kind.\n\nMr. Fovargue, George and Donat accompanied the corpse to Grouard. Before the funeral, all of us went to see Milton for the last time. It was hard to believe he would never speak, never smile at us again! At 9:00, Rev. Fr. C. Kindervater sang the Requiem Mass. The casket was very beautiful. It was grey, and lined with white silk inside and opened at the head. In the middle was a nice crucifix. On the top of the casket were beautiful natural flowers given by friends and relatives. In a pillow of flowers, Milton's name was written in golden letters. After Mass we all went to the graveyard where they buried him beside his mother.\n\nAfter we were back in school, we heard a knock at the door, and in walked Fr. Kindervater and the Brothers accompanied by Mr. Fovargue and his two sons, George and Donat. We all shook hands with them and offered them our sympathy. Donat promised our teacher that he would come to the classroom the following day to give us a speech, so we were all anxiously waiting for him. We thought that he would be too scared but when we were least expecting them they came. We were all very glad and especially when Donat gave us his promised talk. It was very interesting and we were all so sorry when he was finished. He told us all about Hilton's illness and his death. It was surely very sad. Then he told us about the hockey games and how they played other games.\n\nA card of sympathy and a Mass offering was given by the senior class in remembrance of Milton who was once a member of our \"Good Counsel Club\".\nMay he smile down on us from above and help us all to reach that beautiful Paradise about which we sang at his funeral.\n\n\"O Paradise, O Paradise!\nWho would not crave for rest?\nWho could not seek the Happy Land\nWhere they sit loved and blest?\nWhere loyal hearts and true\nStirred ever in the light -\nAll rapture through and through\nIn God's most holy sight.\"\n\nGood Counsel Club.\nOUR NEW BISHOP.\n\nOn the seventh of April, we heard that Rev. Father Langlois was to be our new Bishop. We were all so glad when we heard the news. There was a special Benediction in the church that evening. Father Father spoke in French and in Cree, telling the people the good news, which I am sure they were all glad to hear. Our new Bishop is an Oblate, and has been the Provincial Superior in Edmonton for many years. Though we do not yet know him, we are anxious for him to come. We're sure we will like him. Will he like us, I wonder?\n\nKathleen Morden\u2014Grade VI.\n\nRETURN OF FATHER FILLER.\n\nWe were all so glad to hear that our kind Superior, Rev. Father Filler, had come back to his little floc of Grouard. We were afraid that we were going to lose our dear pastor. The same afternoon, he paid us a visit in the chapel, which we enjoyed very much. He told us of how kind the nurses had been to him while he was in the hospital those four weeks. He told us many other interesting things, but that was the one I appreciated most: being kind to our dear Father.\n\nFather also spoke of Catherine Tekakwitha. He said that while he was in the hospital he prayed to Catherine, and the next morning when he got up, he took a few steps across the room and he couldn't feel any pain in his legs. He felt much better, and said that we will make a petition to the Pope so that she may be canonized. Father told us that he had spoken to our newly-named Bishop the day before returning; he said he just had to embrace Father Langlois because he was so glad. We could see he was very glad.\n\nThat evening at Benediction we sang the Te Deum to thank God Who answered our prayers even if we had to wait long.\n\nTHE FAITH THAT MOVES MOUNTAINS.\n\nWho says there is no more faith? A few weeks ago, Robert Fraser, aged six, had a very bad headache. Sister Mary, after putting him to bed, went to the convent to get him an ice bag. Coming up the stairs, she heard him talking very loudly. Being alone,\nshe wondered to whom he could be talking. This is what she heard him screaming:\n\"Brother Andrew! St. Joseph! Blessed Virgin Mary! Cure me! HURRY UP!\"\n\nPLAY BALL!!\n\nWhen the Spring season comes each year, it seems to fill our hearts with joy,\nbecause it brings back old memories to us boys, especially of when we used to play\nball with the town men and \"skin them alive.\" The first two games we played were last\nSunday. We boys played against the Brothers and some men. The score was 42 to 23 in our\nfavour. They said they'd play again after supper, so we told them they'd better take a\ngood supper if they wanted to beat us. After the evening game, the score was 36 to 23\nin their favour. We said, \"You must have taken a wonderful supper to give you such good\nmuscles!\"\n\nDavid Delorme\u2014Urban Cailleau...Grade VII.\n\nHAPPY EASTER!\n\nDuring Holy Week, Father Falher was sick, so Fr. Floch came from Whitefish Lake to\nreplace him. Fr. Lajoie preached some very nice sermons on Holy Thursday and Good\nFriday. Fr. Proulx went to Girouxville to help during Easter week.\n\nOn Easter morning, as soon as we were called, we jumped out of bed to prepare ourselves\nto receive Our Risen Lord. This seven o'clock Mass was said by Mr. Aloisio to\nwhich many people came. The altars were beautifully decorated with artificial lilies and\nchrysanthemums. After Mass, we all had our breakfast. On coming into the refectory, we\nsaw Easter eggs, doughnuts, chocolate rabbits and roosters at our places. Did we enjoy\nour breakfast? I should say we did! It tasted too good to last long!\n\nAt ten o'clock, we went to Solemn High Mass which was sung by Fr. Hindervater. It\nlooked so nice to see the older-boys and torch-bearers wearing red cassocks. After\ndinner, some went for a walk; others went to their homes. Those who stayed played ball\nor some games. We had apple pie in the afternoon, and a chocolate bar in the evening. The\nolder pupils wrote a special letter of thanks to kind Father Lajoie who had bought all\nthese nice things for Easter.\n\nGrades IV and V.\nNEGRO MINSTREL.\n\nWe repeated our Minstrel Show on Easter Tuesday night, because Sister Superior and several others had missed it when we first put it on. Many people came this time. We were glad Father Ploch could be here too, for he always enjoys seeing our shows. Father Serand and some Sisters were supposed to come from St. Bruno's, but all day it snowed and blew so that it was impossible for them to travel with the car. Father Proulx missed it again, because he could not get back from Girouxville on time.\n\nThe same jolly crowd of \"niggers\" did their best and made the audience forget their troubles for almost two hours. A few new members had been added to the program, so that even those who came to see it for the second time had some surprises. I am sure Father Bruckert, our last year's Drill Master, would have enjoyed seeing Emile Thibault (in a tight red suit!) as a private soldier obeying the French commands of Sergeant Frank Garo. George Califer as Old Black \"oe again was the biggest \"hit\" of the evening, making people just shriek with laughter. Although George and Frank were the ones who made the people laugh most, all did their parts very well we know, because everybody told us so!\n\nArnest Giroux, President, Gr.VIII.\n\nFATHER FALHER GOING AWAY.\n\nWe were very, very sorry today when we heard that our dear Father Falher is going to leave us again. He has been in bed for over a week again, and seems to be getting worse so it was decided today that Father Giroux would take him to the hospital at Baiefr, so that he can receive some special treatments there. It was the new Bishop who suggested this. Though we are sorry to see Father go, we are glad that he is going to be treated by experts so that he will soon be able to come back to us here. The children are going to pray so hard that God will not be able to refuse our prayers. Besides being the Superior of our Mission, Father Falher is also the Cree Professor of all the young priests who want to learn that language. Father is also the oldest missionary in the Vicariate. May he soon get better and come back to his old home in Grouard.\n\nDorothy Phillips, Grade VIII.\nEASTER GREETINGS\n\nThe long Lenten season is at last finished and Easter, with its spirit of joy and gladness, is here again. All are happy, in the joy of Christ's resurrection \u2014 and in the certainty that winter is past, and the beautiful season of spring is beginning. We hope that you, dear readers, also carry within your hearts, this same spirit of well-being.\n\nWe wish to thank our many friends who have written us such encouraging letters, always so full of gratitude. Bishop Cox and our inspector, Mr. Gilles, for their kind letters.\n\nHELLO EVERYBODY!\n\nHAPPY EASTER EVERYTHING!!\n\n\"LEFT RIGHT! LEFT RIGHT!!\"\nEASTERTIDE\n\nOn March 19th, our dear Bishop came home after his illness at the hospital. He stayed home all during Holy Week. Fr. Jungbluth stayed at home to help Fr. Falher while all the other young priests went out to help in different places. Fr. Beaus\u00e9jour went to McLennan; Fr. Bruckert to Girouxville, Fr. Rou\u00e9 to Lake Magloire and Fr. Proulx to Falher. On Holy Thursday morning they had removed the Communion railing to make the sanctuary bigger. The Bishop officiated and consecrated the Holy Oils. They also had the procession of the Blessed Sacrament. The repository which was nicely decorated was on the Blessed Virgin's side. That evening we made our Holy Hour. On Good Friday, Fr. Falher officiated and in the afternoon we had the Way of the Cross. On Holy Saturday, Fr. Jungbluth blessed the Easter water and said Mass. In the afternoon he and Fr. Dupont went around and blessed all the houses.\n\nLillian Harris - Gr. V.\n\nEaster is always a very joyous feast. Although we cannot use the Church since it is now the Boys' Hall, we had very nice ceremonies in the Chapel. At six o'clock there was a low Mass for the Mission pupils and at seven o'clock there was a Communion Mass for the people. At ten o'clock we had a Solemn High Mass. Bishop Guy assisted at the throne and preached very nice sermons in English and in French. Jimmy Thomas - Gr. VII ... Annie Thomas - Gr. VI.\n\nEaster Monday, Fr. Falher gave permission to the children to go and see their parents. After the Mass was finished we went to eat our breakfast. While we were eating, already some boys were called. They stayed a whole day enjoying themselves.\nThe Sisters of St. Bruno's also came to visit on Monday. When our Sisters heard that they were here we could see them hurrying from the different houses to see the Sisters that came. They all seemed so happy that day. Henry Prins - Gr. VI.\n\nMISSION TRAVELLING\n\nOn March 30th, Fr. Falher went to Fort St. John to visit Fr. Dr\u00e9au who was very ill. He stayed there almost three weeks. The roads were so bad that he had to take the airplane from Ft. St. John to Dawson Creek. It was his first trip and he said he enjoyed it very much. The day after Fr. Falher's departure, Fr. Poirier and Br. Dupont left for the east. Fr. Poirier went home to visit his parents. Br. Dupont who was here on account of his health, went back to Montreal. We are glad our good climate made him better, but we were sorry to see him leave.\n\nDanny Simleir - Gr. VIII.\n\nAfter staying here for two weeks, Bishop Guy left for Ottawa to go and report to the doctor. He went also to administer Confirmation in the East. We are anxious for the day when Bishop Guy and Fr. Cherost will be back which will be towards the end of May.\n\nFr. Marten was Sr. Paul Sugano left in a big wagon and it took them five hours to reach the station.\n\nGeorge Califer - Gr. VI.\nSister Superior went to McLennan in a buggy. The roads were very bad so it took a long time to reach the station. She went to McLennan to meet Mother Provincial who had been at Peace River and was returning. A few days later Sister Marcelle went to McLennan to bring Denise Lussant to the hospital to be operated on for appendicitis. They are all back now.\n\nHarry Frise - Gr. VI.\n\nSr. Cecile Rite came from Montreal a few weeks ago. Lizzy went across the lake in the new snowplow to get her at St. Bruno's. She is now helping Sr. Francis Desire take care of the girls. Sr. Joseph Augustine nor taking care of us boys instead of Sr. Guy Joseph who helps Sr. Superior.\n\nFrank Giroux - Gr. VI.\n\nRev. Fr. Rou\u00e9, a young Oblate who came here to learn the Cree language has been called to Sturgeon Lake. When he was here every one was glad to meet him for he was very kind. Jo boys miss him but all hope he will like his new home. Ernest Giroux - Gr. V.\n\nFEAST OF THE SOLIDITY OF ST. JOSEPH\n\nThe feast of the Solidity of St. Joseph was celebrated on April 18. We were glad when his feast was coming, for we could pray to him to give us special graces, such as to be honest, kind or charitable towards our neighbors and our enemies. Rev. Fr. Rou\u00e9 sang the solemn High Mass. Fr. Jungbluth was the Deacon and Fr. Proulx was the Subdeacon. Fr. Rou\u00e9 preached in Cree about St. Joseph while he was on earth with Our Blessed Mother, while Fr. Bruckert gave an eloquent sermon in French. He talked about the virtues of St. Joseph and how we could imitate him in our lives.\n\nJean Rollrose - Gr. V.\n\nFrank Giroux - (Just recuperating from Pneumonia) \"I had a clothing sickness; my tongue was coated, and my breath came out in short pants.\"\nCLUB MEETING\n\nThe meeting of the Good Counsel Club was held on April 20. The Fathers, Sisters, and many of the old pupils who used to be in our class a few years ago, came. Father Superior could not come but Fr. Beauchage gave a nice speech after the meeting. The Musical Travologue was enjoyed by all. It was an imaginary trip to Europe. For each country we visited, we sang a song. The thing that everybody enjoyed most was when we sang a German song, which Fr. Bruckert had taught us. Nobody understood it but they all laughed because it sounded so strange. Fr. Bruckert said we sounded like real Germans.\n\nRaymond L'Hirondelle - Gr. VIII.\n\nA mute comedy called \"Wanted: A Wife\" was played by four girls and two boys. Ernest Giroux played the part of the bachelor who advertised for a wife. He hung a sign on the door \"Wanted: A Wife\". There were many knocks on the door. The ones who came in were: Miss Cross Patch (Mary Gallion), Miss Vanity (Lena Trim), Miss Silly (Ruth Morden), and Miss Fatty Grub (Helon Miller). He did not want any of those. After a while, a woman came who had a black veil on. He liked this one and asked her to marry him. When she took her veil off, to his surprise, he found that she was a negro woman and worse still, a boy (George Califor), so he decided to remain a bachelor!\n\nEina Prudon and Lena Trim --- Gr. VI.\n\nThe ex-Secretary Superior General of way to teach\n\nof the Very Rev. the Oblates, on his Getchism to his Salt Prairie lambs.\n\nDesigner - Frank Ward - Gr. VIII.\nDISTINGUISHED PUPILS\n\nWe think our class is highly honored in having Rev. Fr. Jungbluth as a pupil. He wants to learn to speak English well, so he comes to school from one o'clock until recess time. He must find it funny to be sitting in a desk again. You can imagine how we are trying to be good so that he may thank us for our fine pupils.\n\nFr. Rou\u00e9 also came one afternoon, but we are still wondering what we did to him for he left the very next day for Sturgeon Lake. Rev. Fr. Bruckert also is studying English, but as he wishes to learn the Phonics, he goes to the Junior class. No hope he will soon be promoted to our class!\n\nWe are proud to think that our Cree language can be learned so quickly. Already three of the young Fathers have preached very nice sermons in Cree. Now that they have learned this language they are trying to learn English so that they may be able to speak to everybody, and thus win more souls to God.\n\nGod bless our Missionaries!\n\nFlorence Shaw - Gr. VIII.\n\nSORROWS\n\nApril 27th was a very sad day for two of our Sisters. Sr. Marcella received word that her father had died on Thursday. So the next morning Rev. Fr. Bruckert sang the Requiem Mass for the repose of his soul and we prayed for him. Mary Collion - Gr. VII.\n\nThat same afternoon we were taking our rests when Sr. Superior came out of our classroom. She told us the very sad news which was received by telegram, that our dear teacher's mother was very ill. They asked her to go home, but as it is nearly the end of the school year Sister couldn't possibly leave. We all prayed very hard for her mother's recovery.\n\nRuth Morden - Gr. VII.\n\nYesterday afternoon as we were playing ball, some girls told us that Sr. Jean had received a second telegram saying her mother was better, but still very weak.\nfrom heart trouble. I was just like St. Thomas! I didn't want to believe them until I asked Sister myself. She answered me with a smiling face. You could see that she was happy. We are all very glad too, and hope she will soon be well again.\n\nNobel Nockeyi - Gr. VII.\n\nJunior Club Meeting.\n\nWe had our Club Meeting on April 29th. The Fathers, Sisters and Sr. Jean Placideus and her pupils were invited. In our Enterprise work we took an imaginary trip to Europe. Frank Giroux and Emile Thibeault made our moving picture machine. We drew some pictures which showed the things we saw and all the different countries we passed through. We crossed the Atlantic then went to England to see the king. After visiting England we went to Holland to see the Dutch people. As soon as we left Holland we went through France. Harry Fraser read his composition of St. John of Arc, and Pato Gledu told the story of St. Theresa. We were anxious to hear Pato's story because she is our club patroness. The story of St. Bernadette was a little play by four girls and one boy. After having left France, we went to Rome to visit our Holy Father and St. Peter's Cathedral. Frank Giroux told us about our visit with the Pope in a very interesting way. Then we went to St. Peter's Church to visit all the different things there. Jean Bollrose told us about it in her composition. We then took the ocean liner and came back to Canada. The last thing was our Club song. All who came thought it was very nice.\n\nRosalie Hobson - Gr. V. ... George Fraser - Gr. IV.\nBALLAMES\n\nCongratulations to the Mission girls and Mission boys who beat the town girls and boys! Since the ballgame season has opened we have started playing against each other. Sunday evening was our first game. We all went home feeling happy though we were beaten because we enjoyed ourselves very much. It was a tight game at first. Fr. Besueuge, our kind Catechism teacher, was our umpire, for which we wish to thank him. The boys also had a game at the same time. There were two Brothers with Benjamin Noskeyi playing on the boys' side. All through the game, both sides were tied but towards the end, the Mission boys won. They are going to play another game soon and we hope it will be even better than the first one.\n\nLouise Tomkins - Gr. VI. (A town girl).\n\nMAY ALTARS\n\nThis morning as the pupils came into the class room, there were many \"Ohs\" and \"Ah's\" heard, for we have a lovely May Altar in our class room. In Sr. Benigna's and Sr. Bernadette's rooms also the altars are very nice. There is a nicely decorated one in the girls' hall and a beautiful grotto in the Chapel. As we look and admire these lovely reminders of the month of the Blessed Virgin, we think of our Holy Mother and pray for her help. The hymn to the Blessed Virgin sung at Mass on Sunday was very beautiful. We are indeed fortunate to have Sisters who decorate so beautifully.\n\nJennie Gordon --- Gr. VIII.\n\nIT PAYS TO ADVERTISE!\n\nSister Mary Aquinas, a friend of our teachers, who has been in California, wrote to each pupil who wrote in the last journal. We were delighted with our cards, and the nice views of Golden Gate, the new wonder-bridge of Oakland, and many other beautiful scenes of California. Mrs. Zachlin, Sr. George Wilfred's cousin, sent us\nlovely views of Cleveland Ohio. We surely appreciate these acts of kindness and wish to thank Sr. Mary Aquinas and Mrs. Zachin. We are getting educated in an interesting way this year! Frank Ward - GR. VIII ------ Charles McLeod - GR.

Perhaps the reason why (for once) Helen enjoyed writing a bit of rhyme is that she did it on the sly!!\nEaster Bingo\n\nOn Easter evening our dear Father Princapol gave us a Bingo party. All the tables were decorated with pretty little baskets filled with Easter eggs which were bought for that occasion. Everyone had his own box and was glad to have at party that evening.\n\nThe Sisters and all the Sisters were invited and answered the invitation. Everyone enjoyed the party.\n\nHoly Week\n\nWe had plenty praying time. If we were without any trouble or worry, we could be in a comfortable place. It was late in the evening when we left for the dormitory.\n\nMichele Mironow. Grade II.\n\nJesus, Friend of the Children\n\nWhen I take Holy Communion you receive Our Lord into your heart.\n\nRemember that He is told, \"Save me, Jesus Who did so many wonderful things for the children of men? We can not see Him. That we know He sees us and watches over us. He hears every word we say; He sees everything we do.\n\nJesus loves children. He loves you. Ask Him to help you and to help all your relatives and friends.\n\nBook Copy\nA Visit To My Home\n\nSome time ago I went home to see my Father who was sick. Father Rheamook and Mr. Gilbert were there also. We had a nice time together. Although I felt not I enjoyed my trip. We stopped at Loaf's because Mr. Gilbert lives there and we thought we would visit his parents. His parents have been very kind to us. Then we started for my home which is in Gold Lake. We got there seen for it is only 10 miles from Loaf's. We stopped at the mission and met our priest Father Silvain came with us to the hospital.\n\nThat a joy to see my Father and what a pleasure for him to see us, thank you to our kind Father Perdew. From the hospital we went to my home where I found my mother, my little brother and many other friends who wanted to see us. We were gone two days when we came back three days late, same by once back with us we were at school again on time for supper.\n\nMary Kent, Grade III.\n\nThe Month of May\n\nMay is the month of our dear beloved Mother, we call it the month of Mary, we like to pray the Blessed Virgin during her month. She is the mother of the infant Jesus and ours too because He gave to us. She loves all the children, she likes to pray for them, she gives us the graces we need, and do bless our parents, the Sisters, all our friends and the sick people. Gr. 3.\n\nIn our chapel we have a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary. It is a large one, Sister had decorated it with flowers. Every evening we hail the Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament at 7:30 p.m., sang hymn to the Blessed Sacrament and we liked it. The statue in our chapel room was decorated with natural plants.\n\nThe month of June has come now it is in the month of the Sacred Heart, we pray Him to bless us and all ours. May He listen to us.\n\nDuring our Easter Holidays, we visited his farm. Our Master had prepared a special lunch for us. As soon as dinner was over, we went to the kitchen. We helped make the cake. It was finished. I ate until I could not eat anymore. We then had lunch. After lunch, we walked to the farm. When we reached the place it was a long walk to back here. I run part of the way with the others boys and we almost lost our way but we finally reached home safely, very tired. Henry Grace Go\nDear Readers:\n\nGood-bye!

For a long time you have looked ahead for this happy moment. Yes go back to your beloved parents. Have you deserved this long rest? Yes, for your physical benefit. Your application has been good and success followed consequently. We are proud of you for your sincere piety and love of your Religion. Again all the year along you have been taught \"how to know God, to love Him and to serve Him.\" This you shall never forget and always you shall be faithful to your God and Religion, remembering that there is no rest in the practice of our Religion.\n\nTherefore, every Sunday, my Good Children come to assist at Mass, remembering that one missing Mass on Sunday without serious reason will commit a big mortal sin. Be also faithful to your daily morning and evening prayers. Be obedient to your parents, trying your very best to show them how you love them. May your conduct be good and I can assure you all that you shall be very happy during those days of rest and freedom.\n\nContinue to love your School always have a kind thought towards your School and try to bring some new children with you next Fall.\n\nMay God bless you always,\nFather Pratt, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nOur star Cowboys, of course you know I mean George Mind and myself, went to the Stampede at Morley the other day. It was a pretty good one. The horses were wild and we were the steers and so were the riders. George Mind won second prize and I won nothing. When we were decided to go home we were broke and had to bum a ride.\n\nPat Mattesnake.\n\nTRIP TO WINTERBURN.\n\nWhen Father Moulin went back after his visit I got on with him up to St. Albert. I got off there with my Mrs. and we went to visit at Winterburn. They received us well over there and I came back to Hobbe-ma on the bus with two black ducks under my arms. My friends at Winterburn had given them to me.\n\nTom Bull.\n\nHUNTING.\n\nLast week I had the good luck of seeing a nice dear. It did not take me long to shoot him down with my good rifle.

Twenty-three runs, one hundred and sixty-five hits, no errors. Blasted Bull Color. But I wonder if they would not sing another song were they to meet Yankees, Giants or some of those big shots.\n\nOn the 29th they hired a professional Scorekeeper from Bull Reserve, Jos Deschamps by name. True, the game was a hot one. Pat R. Snake won 14-11 against Fred Hogston. Then L.

After saying our morning Offering, Sist told us she thought this would be a good day to remember our departed Members, by fixing their graves. So off we started! As soon as we reached the cemetery, we knelt down by Milton's grave and recited the prayer for the dead; we then sang our Club Hymn. How touching and beautiful the words seemed there in the silent graveyard. I think all of us had very serious thoughts as we sang and prayed.\n\nThe big boys went to get some fresh soil, while the others pulled out the weeds and cleaned the graves. Others made a fire outside of the cemetery and cooked some potatoes. When we had cooked about two dozen, we called the others. Sister Joseph Napoleon sent us a nice lunch, which we enjoyed very much after our hard work. After our lunch, we girls went down to the lake shore to get some stones to make a border around the grave. When we came back, Sister had the boys paint the names white. A large flat white stone was then placed at the head of the grave, and then Milton's and Mary Rose's names were printed on them with black paint. It looks very nice. Around three o'clock, all was finished. Since then we have planted flowers on their graves, and must go daily to water them. But we are glad to be able to do this much for the dear old classmates we loved. We are sorry that our other departed classmate, Lilly McDermott was not buried here, so we could do the same for her. When we are dead and gone, we hope somebody will think of us too. \"What you do for others will be given back to you.\"\n\nHelen Miller..... Grade VII.\n\nTO MILTON.\n\nIt was a shock and sad to hear, That on to us, who was so dear,\nHas left us one and all. In answer to the Master's call.\nSo, let us ever pray and hope, That St. Peter, our first and greatest Pope\nHas gladly opened the Golden Gate, For one who could not dodge the Hand of Fate.\nAnd smiling, showed him his stintly berth, Which he loved and fought for\non this earth.\n\nBy Harry Gregory... Dawson Creek, B.C.\n\nThe above verse was written by one of our old schoolmates on learning of the death\nof Milton Boyer. Harry also wrote another poem about leaving school which we are\nglad to put into the pages of our school paper. If there are other poets amongst our\nold pupils, just send your verses in and we will put them in print for you!\n\nSCHOOL D.I.'s.\n\n'Twas in '36, I made a sad mistake, When from my boyhood friends did break,\nI left behind the golden days of school, Many of which I spent as a regular fool.\nI left with a feather mind, but a heavy heart,'Cause from you, 'twas hard to part.\nYou may call it false pretence, Though I thought it was common sense.\n\nThree good friends I took with me, You know them all as I can plainly see,\nBrown eyed Archie, smart Alec, and lonesome Sam, who, on quitting school, thought\nit time to roam.\nThey went their way, and I went mine, Just two years, but it's more like nine.\nBut you, we never did, and can't forget, You can wage your life, and win the bet!\n\nSome days I'm happy, on others blue, But always my thoughts stray back to you,\nNot listen close, you girls and boys, I'll pass the sorrows and my joys.\nBut I'll stop to give you good advice, For which I've had to pay the price:\nLIFE IS NOT YOU MAKE IT! In the game For which you have just yourself to blame.\n\nAnswer the bell with a ringing heart, For you'll never get another start,\nDo it gladly and learn to read and write,'Cause you'll need it in this earthly fight.\nThen too, they only give you once The chance not to stray a common dunces,\nYou have the teachers, the very best, And I'd say more: the choicest of the West.\nEven now as I wander o'er the track, I know I'll never find the trail to lead me back,\nTo those golden days of pleasure, and if used aright, the future will hold some treasure,\nI'm sure our school there's none can press, So show them its rightful class.\nFor when we put our school amongst the rest, It's the grandest and the best!\nHarry Gregory... Class '32.\n\nThe Month of May.\n\nDuring the month of May we had Benediction every night in the church. On May the first\nwhen we came in our classroom, the very first thing we noticed was the beautiful May\naltar near the piano. There were lovely roses all around the Blessed Mother, also vigil\nlights and flower vases. In Sister Benigna's class, there was also a very nice altar.\n\nOn May 26th, before the afternoon Benediction, it was very nice to see the girls all\ndressed in white, and carrying wreaths for the crowning of the Blessed Mother. They made\na procession round the church during which they sang hymns. After all the girls had\nbrought their wreaths, Mary Collins crowned the blessed Virgin, then she recited the\nAct of Consecration. Father Floch gave a nice talk to the Children of Mary.\n\nEveryone was very glad when they came to Mass on Ascension Thursday, to see Father\nFather back home again after his long illness in Banff. He is feeling much better now,\nand we are still hoping that he won't have to leave us again to go so far away.\n\nRuth Morden...... Grade VIII.\n\nTruck Rides.\n\nWe girls felt a little bit jealous when we heard that the boys were going for a ride\nin the truck. The Children of Mary were having a conference that afternoon, and though it\nwas very interesting, we kept looking out of the window, trying to see the lucky boys.\nIt was not until they came back that we learned that we were to go too. Were we glad?!?\nWe just kept jumping the whole while we were waiting! We had great fun when we reached\nthe bridge. The truck was going very fast, and at the same time our hair was just flying\nfor it was such a swift ride. We had to take our turns off in case they would fall in the-\nwater. We stopped at one place where Brother Boss\u00e9 and a few of us girls put out some fire, so you see we are quite good at it, even if we are JUST GIRLS!\n\nWe didn't forget to thank the Sisters who were keeping us and the driver too, got his share of thanks and cheers. The little boys and girls who hadn't had their ride in the afternoon went after supper. They went just as far as we did, but it took them a long time to come back. When they arrived we were playing Base Ball and Volley Ball. That night we dreamed wonderful dreams!\n\nMabel Noskowi... Grade VIII Maggie Budskin... Grade VI.\n\nVisit of Mr. Gilles.\n\nOn May 16th, after school, we were surprised to see our school inspector, Mr. Gilles, come walking up to the school with Father Proulx. He was just passing through this district so he decided to pay us a visit. We missed our chance of seeing him this time, but our teacher and a few others had the privilege of speaking to him. The next day was to be a hard day for us, as Sister had told us that she was going to give us some tests. When we saw Mr. Gilles, we were very glad because we thought he would come to our class the next day and then we wouldn't have to take our tests. Imagine our disappointment when we saw him driving back to McLennan that very evening! The next time he comes, we hope his visit will be much longer.\n\nA Happy Day at Ground.\n\nFather Floc'h celebrated his patronal feast on the nineteenth of May. The Grade six pupils had the honor of writing some letters to him to offer him our best wishes. That morning, when we woke up we didn't know that we were going to have such a nice surprise. We came to school as usual, but at eleven o'clock, Sister dismissed us. We were then told to get our dishes because we were going to the park for dinner. The biggest boys carried the food, so we were soon all sorted on the grass, enjoying our picnic lunch. After we had finished, we played ball against the boys. Three guesses who won? We stayed till one-thirty, then it was time for school so we returned to the classroom. I think it was a\nHappy day for everyone because it was the first time we have dinner in the park this year. We also had a holiday on May 24th because it was Victoria Day. The Fathers went to Jossard for a meeting, and after a pleasant morning, we children went to the park with some of the Sisters. We stayed all the rest of the day. We played Volley Ball and soft ball. I think that nothing can equal a holiday... for school children anyway.\n\nDorothy Phillips...Edna Pruden...Grade VII.\n\nVisitors from Far and Near:\n\nOne evening, we saw a big car driving up. We could see that it was somebody very important because the Sisters all seemed so happy. We soon found out that the car had brought Mother Provincial and Sister Geraldine from Hindupore, also Sisters St. Therese and Dominic from Sturgeon Lake. The next day, the Sisters from St. Bruno's came to see them too, so there were many Sisters here.\n\nAfter High Mass, we had the Blessed Sacrament exposed in the church until five o'clock so we could take part in the Eucharistic Congress of Budapest too. All our visitors made the holy hour in the afternoon. It seemed as if we were having the Congress here, for there were representatives from Fort Vermilion (Fr. Hoby), Whitefish Lake (Fr. Floch), Hindupore, Sturgeon Lake, Jossard and Ground. Towards evening, all the visitors went away again.\n\nMary Collen...Grade VIII.\n\nSchool Closed:\n\nThe dry pupils couldn't come to school for a week because there was an epidemic of Scarlet Fever going around. We were sorry to have to miss school, but Sister told us that if we went well, we could come back in a little while. The Mission children came to school only in the mornings, so they could be outside more and keep well. During this time the Sisters did their best to keep us from getting sick. We also prayed very hard to the Sacred Heart so He would pity us and so the sickness would soon be over with. So now we are back in school, well and happy, and we hope that there will be no more distractions till the end of the year.\n\nKathleen Morden...Jean Bellrose...Grade VI.\nPLAY BALL!\n\nIt was an enjoyable trip\u2014we big girls and boys had to Jousserd on the ninth of June. We had received an invitation to go and play ball with the pupils of St. Bruno Mission, and Father Falher who is always so happy when he can give us pleasure, sent the big red truck to take us to Jousserd. Father Kindervater and three Sisters came too. On the road near Jousserd, we saw two deer. They were small, but I don't think I could have caught them running! As soon as we reached the Mission, we played a game of Soft Ball against the Mission Boys. When the ninth inning was over, the score was nineteen to two, in favor of the Grouard boys. The girls then played a game. Father Kindervater was Umpire. Our girls won by just one score. It was just by luck that they won, for it was a very close game.\n\nWhen I first went into the field, I felt nervous and excited. But after a while I calmed down and then I said to myself, \"It's only a game after all... I don't care!\" The Jousserd boys are very good at playing Baseball... perhaps if we had not played Soft Ball, we would not have won so easily. After we had had a good rest, we were ready for another game. Just then, Father Gould came along with his High Prairie boys. They were going to play against Jousserd, but instead, they played with us. After a lot of fun and teasing, the game was again over, and I'm proud to say that we won again. The score was 10 to 3. They then gave three cheers for the Grouard winners. Many congratulated us, and we in turn thanked them for such an enjoyable day. At dusk we were on our way to Home, Sweet Home again, tired but very happy. At least we didn't go for nothing; we had a sixty mile ride and we won all the games.\n\nErnest Giroux... Grade VIII... David Delorme... Grade VI.\nJumbled Thoughts .... Before Exams.\n\nSit up straight and listen right, For exams are right in sight,\nNow it's time to sort out our heads, (I sometimes think mine's made of lead!)\n\nNow we rush in and take our book, It's high time we took a look!\nAll the old things to review....But we always miss a few.\n\nIf you whisper... ten marks off! So just pretend that it's a cough;\nFor it happens to us all, when we hear our teacher call.\n\n........................................................\n\nNow Vacation's here at last, and those old exams are past,\nNor I may not just like a clown, Going riding to the town!\n\nHelen Miller (Grade VII... Our clown!)\n\nAn Enjoyable Hike.\n\nLast Thursday, \"all the children of Mary went for a hike with their Director and Director. We certainly had a good time.\nSome girls were picking and eating nice, sour cherries all the way, but others wanted to pick wild roses for the classrooms. While we were on our way back, it started to rain. But that didn't scare us! When we arrived, Fr. Kindervater took our picture, then we had to go into the classroom because it was raining. Little Sister Jean played the piano and we sang several songs, then we went to the...\nkitchen to get the lunch. Sister Louis had made some nice sandwiches, cake and punch for us... you can imagine how good it tasted after our long walk. After thanking Father and Sister very heartily for the lovely afternoon, we all went back to our hall.\n\nMelba Cardinal... Grade V.\n\nCorpus Christi\n\nThe feast of Corpus Christi was on the 16th of June, but we had the procession on the next Sunday. There was only one altar outside this year because the Fathers' house was not ready yet, as they are putting in a new cement basement there. Sister Superior had fixed everything very nicely with Sister Marcella and all the Sisters and other helpers. We sang hymns during the procession. I like to hear the singing out in the open air. When we got back in church we sang the Te Deum which is a hymn of thanksgiving. There were many people there. It took one hour for the procession.\n\nRoy Smith ...... Grade V.\n\nTILL WE MEET AGAIN.\n\n(Sincerely dedicated to my three teachers: Fr. Kindervater, Sisters Benigne and Jean.\n\nVacation days are drawing near, We hate to leave our school so dear,\nAnd our teachers whom we love, To us, they're as kind as gentle doves.\n\nTo us, they're worth a bag of gold, So don't be surprised when you are told,\nThat our teachers are just and fair, Of us they take such kindly care.\n\nI will think of them in sweetest thoughts, Although we'll be so far apart,\nLike them, my life's bottles will be sought To ever please the Sacred Heart.\n\nI will oft their memory recall, For thoughts of school are dearest than all,\nAnd I know my longings will not be in vain, -- For I'll hear their voices again.\nThough no words you will hear me say, When it comes to the closing day,\nI will leave with a sad sigh, But God will help, for He is ever nigh.\n\nWould you like to leave behind Those teachers so very good and kind?\nYou too would like to stay by their side, Since they are such friends and guides!\nJohn Bullrose ...... Grade VII.\n\nPertaining Thoughts of a Graduate.\n\nJust three more days... and then school life will be a thing of the past for me!\nSomehow, the idea does not tickle me half as much as it used to... When I cleaned out my desk this afternoon and left my books in order for the pupils who will inherit my place next year, I almost wished I would fail in my exams, so that I could come back, just one more year!\nWhen I look at my teacher, and realize that I won't be one of her pupils any more, I feel queer... very queer.\nAnd when I look around at all the lovely things we have... the piano, the radio, the library, I wish I were just beginning instead of finishing my Grade VIII. I'll miss Fr. Kindervater's fun mixed in with his serious lessons, I'll miss all the friendly teasing of schoolmates,... yes, I'll even miss the kittens!\nBut then, I know I cannot remain in school all my life. My teachers have done their best to make a worthwhile person out of me, so I must go now and put into practice what I have learned here.\nGoodbye, dear old school.... I leave you with regret! Goodbye, beloved teacher... never will I forget. Goodbye, happy hearted-schoolmates,... please don't forget your friends the Grade Eight class of 1938.\n\nErnest Giroux, Jimmy Thomas, George Califer, Mary Callon, Ruth Morden, Mabel Moskeyl, Dorothy Phillips.\nTO OUR READERS.\n\nAnd so, we come to the last page of the last issue of the \"Grouard Echoes\". We have enjoyed \"broadcasting\" the little and great events which make up our daily lives, and it is our sincere hope that our readers also derived some enjoyment from the perusal of these pages.\n\nWe are sorry that the great events connected with our new Bishop's arrival and enthronization will occur during the summer holidays; we would have been happy to give our readers an account of it, but at present it is only possible for us to say that His Excellency will arrive in Grouard on July the fourteenth, an account of all the festivities will undoubtedly be in the front pages of the September issue of the \"Echoes\" (IF the \"Echoes\" are published next year!)\n\nBefore saying Goodbye for this year, the Editors would like to offer sincerest thanks to all the good friends who have been so very kind throughout the year. Such encouragement made our task lighter... and we deeply appreciate it. And so, to all, we wish a pleasant summer, good luck, and God's choicest blessings.\n\nSister Benigna of Jesus.... Sister Jean Placidus.\nEDITORIAL\n\nA special newspaper, however small, seems to be very badly needed by our Indian population. To support this statement I can bring the following reasons: First, our Indians are brought up in our schools, with the knowledge of the English language, the ideals of the white people, and therefore it seems necessary to devise some means of following up with the civic and religious education, the rudiments of which were given in the school: a monthly, or better still, a weekly news bulletin, answers this need in part. Second, it is a widespread belief that evils must be counteracted by the spreading of truth; here again a newspaper can have a great influence on its readers: the different movements of the day need analysis and explanations which only a paper can give, on account of its frequency and facility of distribution. Third, our Indians have not generally speaking, a very well-developed sense of culture: a bulletin or newsheet, regularly distributed to them, might help them acquire a desire for information, a platform to exchange ideas, and most of all, another efficacious mean for the authorities to teach civics, health and sanitation, moral advice, and to suggest divers means of bettering their lives. Fourth: in a paper such as ours aims to be, we seek to create a link between the parents and their children who are away from them for the greater part of the year, a link which the parents appreciate very much indeed. Fifth: the distribution of a specifically Catholic paper in the Catholic homes is intended to teach two lessons: (1) the need of Catholic literature in the home, (2) the need of supplementing secular reading on Sunday with some religious and devotional reading. Not only children, but adult Protestants belong to Sunday School classes, and every one goes home with a religious paper, which he or she is expected to read as a pious exercise.\n\nToo many Catholics, on the other hand, feel that they do not need a Catholic paper, because they attended denominational schools, where they had a course of religious instruction extending over many years. Yet they find themselves unable to answer questions asked about their religion by their friends, or about pagan practices which the Church disapproves, or about accusations directed against Catholics, occasionally, in secular papers or magazines.\n\nStudy clubs are growing rapidly among people who are interested in questions and problems of the day. Now, a short sermon, attended by a few, or a conference given occasionally, does not suffice to instruct the minds in a sufficient degree to enable them to counteract all the errors and all the evils which are brought to the homes by the non-religious dailies or magazines.\n\nIn every Catholic school the children are taught to be obedient to all authority, civil as well as ecclesiastical, and to be reverent, and to love GOD above all things, to love his neighbor as himself, and to cultivate habits of virtue.\n\nThe Catholic Press, especially, brings to the homes these same teachings. It is therefore the duty of all Catholic people to patronize the Catholic Press, and to read it, in order that they may learn the truth of what is happening in the Kingdom of Christ, co-extensive with the world. It is certainly unpardonable to read, with avidity, every day happenings of a secular nature and to be indifferent about learning what is going on in the world of religion. In reading the daily press, Catholic news, whether international or local, are often unintentionally distorted by non-Catholic reporters who do not very often comprehend the things behind the news.\n\nIn conclusion, we might express the wish that in our paper, we want the whole-hearted co-operation of all those who are able to give to us. We want to make this little paper as interesting and as useful as possible to those for whom it is intended. Every field: educational, religious, medical, historical, and even scientific (such as agriculture or home economics), will be given attention. The news element will be taken mostly from happenings at the Boarding Schools, and in the Missions, because the daily press, and other means of information can bring other news much sooner than a monthly bulletin.\n\nG. L., O.M.I.\n\nSon of Old French Family Heads School for Indians\n\nA chance meeting with a friendly churchman has oft changed the future course of a life. No better example could be found in Saskatchewan than the incident that brought the successor of Rev. J. Hugonard, O.M.I., the noted founder of the Qu'Appelle Indian School at Lebret.\n\nThe man is Rev. Fr. Maurice de Bretagne, O.M.I., a son of Old France, now the director of the Qu'Appelle Indian School.\n\nRev. Fr. Maurice de Bretagne\n\nFr. de Bretagne was not born in surroundings that would mark him for a future life of service among the Indians. He was born and knew in surroundings that would send him to the priesthood of the church.\n\nBorn in Northern France, nurtured in an atmosphere of learning and devotion, the future priest attended school in Belgium and learned of the illustrious service of his forefathers in the magistracy and courts of France.\n\nThe time came for military service, and he joined the 3rd regiment of the Lille infantry. War was broken out. The \"43rd\" went to meet the advancing enemy that ravaged northern France. At Charleroi with the \"Old Contemptibles,\" Soldier de Bretagne tasted the worst battle at Gouze in Belgium. There the French made a\n\nHungry Indians Cut Off by Snow as Drifts Reach New Peaks\n\nRobert W. Ogle, resident of the Wood Mountain area, in a letter to the Leader-Post told of aged Indian folk sitting in cold cabins with no kerosene for lamps, no coal for heating and little wood\u2014nearly percent of the cattle dead, 7 percent of the horses gone, he wrote.\n\n\"Indians in the Wood Mountain district are starving from lack of food. Since the drought and severe winter, the game they had formerly lived on, have died away or have moved on.\n\n\"Their monthly rations are insufficient that in a week they are entirely out of food. The aged people are found sitting in the dark because of no kerosene nor coal and very little wood. Kerosene, coal and matches are not included in their rations that have been sent them from the farmers, who are all on relief and are unable to give a hand.\n\n\"An old squaw, known as the 'Crazy Woman,' who is 86 years old, goes out into the woods, cuts her own wood and hauls it on her back to her house.

It was not the wealthy civilization of the Aztecs which amazed Cortez and the Spaniards in the XVI century when they came in conquests of Mexico. What struck everybody was the number of temples of the two hundred or more temples of the Montezuma's city, dominated by the pyramidal temple of the war-god, a the altar of white, up to the red steps, were offered each year, thousands of human victims as a sacrifice. The whole life of the nation, economic, social and military, had religion for a dominating factor.\n\nIn the XVII century, the first French missionaries reported carefully the beliefs, traditions and customs of the Indians of the prairie and of the forest. Their nomadic life did not allow them to build temples but certain details show that the old Indians were eminently religious. And that, in spite of many mistakes, their religion is an outstanding instance of what is called Tradition. As their language, the beautiful and intricate grammatical rules of which, are the astonishment of the white people, were kept from generation to generation without being written down so that traditions were the only source of knowledge enlightened with the purity of natural religion and moral law and the last glimpses of the primitive revelation, made by God to the first man.\n\nAt least 2000 years before Moses wrote down the laws of the Sacred Books, God gave to mankind a Revelation which was kept jealously by the Patriarchs. Yet, it is from that common treasure that all nations in the world drew the main lines of their religions. Moses, in his time, tells us that, with the exception of the Jews who had a special alliance with God, ignorance, greed, private interests, national pride and shameful passions had obscured the mind of the nations. The Revelation of God, Idolatry and immorality became the cancers of the religious, which, without the direct control of God as for the Jews, became what we call Paganism.\n\nThe particular case of the Indians displays the entire loss and the lamentable mistakes of mankind, lost in exile far away from the common Father of Heaven, sinful, yet longing for the lost Paradise in the long waiting for the Redeemer. Scattered over the world, differentiated in many races, under the variety of climates and ways of life, they remained bound by the same ideal and the same common belief. The white or the black, the red or the yellow, the savage with their common origin the same common religiosity. But, once more, among those who cling in the best to the first Revelation are the Indians who kept a great deal of it. God, our Maker, Abba, who wills to save and punish, the need of prayer, of penance, of sacrifice; the cult of the dead; the necessity of morality and many other truths became overburdened with superstitious rituals and bloody practices; how it lost the respect for human life and compromised itself with immorality. Yet, the young Indians should respect their old people, pagans of the old type, in order to learn from them what is right and what is wrong in their belief, and help them climb toward the light of God and find the true Faith. I respect the old pagan who is godless, but I pity the modern pagan who is godless. I have seen the light, tasted the Love of God, but who through immorality, laziness, selfishness, a shameful and sinful life, has lost the faith, believes no more or throws himself back to paganism and its horrors. The spiritually pagan is climbing the mountain toward the Light, the modern godless pagan is falling down, away from God, to animality.\u2014Fr. Guy de Bretagne, O.M.I.\n\nThe Indian Hospital at Fort Qu'Appelle, Sask.\n\nA thoroughly modern hospital for 60 patients was built at Fort-Qu'Appelle, Sask., two years ago, to replace the one at Lortie. Dr. A. B. Simes, M.D., is the medical superintendent of the hospital, and also for the Qu'Appelle health unit. Miss H. Gilbert is the matron.\n\nThe hospital has a fully equipped operating room, and an entire flat is reserved for T.B. patients. Much work has been done in the past years for the care of T.B. patients, and in a few years it is to be hoped that the disease will be practically stamped out on the Indian Reservations.\n\nPatients are taken in the hospital from all parts of Saskatchewan. Dr. Wall, trained specialist, has been working in our unit lately, and has made a good survey of the case, and has taken efficacious measures in fighting the dreaded eye ailment.\n\nDr. Simes has shown great interest in our paper, and we will give him space every month in our column for an article on Tuberculosis, its prevention and its cure.\u2014G.L., O.M.I.\n\nPasqua Reserve, Moscow, Sask.: Joe McDonald, aged 25, died at the Indian hospital, on Feb. 6th. He leaves his wife, Eva Thomas and three children.\n\nFather M. de Bretagne\n\n(Continued from page 1)\n\nstand, and the young soldier received a severe wound in his left arm, a tearing tendon-cutting wound when a German shell exploded.\n\nIn a hospital, later, he met Lieutenant Plourde, a \"buddy\" of the battlefield, whom he had saved from death during the battle by covering himself with one of the most vicious bombardments of the enemy. Together, they recuperated in hospital, and then had a holiday in southern France.\n\nAgain Soldier de Bretagne joined the forces, this time in the auto-mechanics section, ending up his war service in the East under Marshall Franchet D'Esperery, his cousin, in charge of the allied armies in the Orient. Discharged at Constantinople in April, 1919, at the age of 38, he went back to his family and then helped in restoring the old chateau, partly ruined by the bombardments.\n\nIn January, 1920, Soldier de Bretagne came to western Canada. His habit was to learn agriculture at first hand, and decided to fit his calling to becoming a farmer. He engaged with farmers, worked early and late, at all menial tasks.\n\nIt was during his service on the farms of the West that he met with an Oblate priest who was a friendly soul. They had a chat, and Maurice de Bretagne joined the Oblates. At Montreal, he then studied at Edmonton, and came to Lebrecht in 1929; he went to teach at Gravelbourg College. He stayed there for one year, then was sent to the Saut-eux Indian missions on Lake Winnipegosis. He learned the Indian language, to navigate the daw boat during his ministry to the missions on the shores of the lake, and suffered the privations of the pioneers of the north hinterland.\n\nHe was then acting-principal of the Canadian Indian school, for about six months. Again his superiors needed him in mission work, and for two years he labored in the sparsely settled regions of northern Manitoba and in Indian Reserves. In 1934 he became principal of the Indian School at Fort Frances, Ontario, and there he spent two years in reorganization work. After two years at Fort Frances, Fr. de Bretagne was sent to Lebrecht in July, 1936.\n\nOf his present work, Fr. de Bretagne says: \"There is much to do here; so many different tribes of Indians send their children here. But the apostolate is wonderful, and my inspiration will be the giant of yesterday, P\u00e8re Hugonard, whom I would humbly follow and emulate.\"\n\nInterschool Correspondence\n\nThe editor wishes to thank the following Rev. Fathers for their words of appreciation and their precious advice: Very Rev. Fr. Lamontagne, St. Boniface, Man.; Very Rev. Fr. Langlois, Edmonton, Alta.; Rev. Fr. Charron, Cardinal, Alta.; Rev. Fr. Ruest, Fort-Alexander, Man.; Rev. Fr. J. Berens, Berens River, Man.; Rev. Fr. Dubois, Duck Lake, Sask.; Rev. Bro. Patience, Richelieu, P. Q.\n\nRev. Fr. Paradis, principal of St. Philip School, in Sask. writes to us: \"You have done me a great satisfaction; you have encouraged me in the work you have started, and we hope that the little bulletin will become very popular among the Indians.\"\n\nWe are pleased to publish part of a letter written by Fr. Lesaray, missionary among the Blackfoot Indians at Crow Agency. He talks to his friends (five Sioux boys he has known some years ago at the Lebrecht School): \"I am now among Blackfoot boys and the first time I spoke to them in public I was terrified; they were like the Sioux boys I have known at Lebrecht. We have a nice bunch of boys here. I make moving pictures to them once in a while, just like I used to do in my printing room at the Seminary for you, and we go in public schools within I teach their catechism also. The Blackfeet are very proud Indians but when you like them, they like you also . . . Here we have an old school, built in 1913, but the Government is adding a new wing to it. Every month I go in public schools to see people who are interested in the school. One is called \"OKE NAPE\" which means the same thing as \"HO RODA,\" (hello friend); and the other is called \"CROWFOOT JOUR-NAPE.\" In those papers the children (Continued on page 8, Col. 1)\nMARCH, 1938\n\nTHE INDIAN MISSIONARY RECORD\n\nPAGE 3\n\nthemselves will tell you all what we do here. Many times we have Indian hand games and Indian dances. They like it very much... The Indians here have a great big Reservation, the second biggest in Canada; the biggest is at Cardston, where the Bloods are. The Blood Indians are the same race, stock feet and speak exactly the same language, but they had different chiefs at the time of the Treaty, so now they are separate. This Reservation is very rich one. There are farms all over the place, also range land for thousands of cattle and horses. There are five coal mines where the Indians themselves mine coal for their own profit and sell it to the white people.\"\n\nLESTOCK, Sask.\u2014Rev. Fr. Jeanette, Principal of Lestock Indian School writes to us that he is very pleased with the Indian Record and subscribes to 100 copies, every month. He will make every effort in distributing it in his Indian Reserve. Next month we will read about his school and his work among the Saukoux of Muscowequan and Poorman Reserves.\n\nST. PHILIPS, Sask.\n\nThank you to the Editor of this little bulletin, we, the students of the St. Philips Indian Residential School, will have the privilege of informing the readers of our local activities.\n\nFor those who may not know St. Philips, let us first introduce it to them. St. Philips is one of the oldest missions of the Oblate Fathers; it is not a town, but has an Indian School, a church, a Post-Office and a few other houses; it is a beautiful spot on the slope of the Duck Mountain, 16 miles west of the Canadian boundary, 1 mile North of Kamiskak and 50 miles from Yorkton.\n\nLong ago, before we were born, when this was a good hunting district, and the Indians, of course, were residing there, this place was known as Fort Polly. Father Decorby is said to be the first and only Oblate missionary to visit this region from 1878 until he took up residence in 1888; he built his first log house near the creek which flows into the Duck River, that is 15 miles West from where he erected, 15 years later, a bigger house with logs, using also some lumber which he hauled himself with horses from Yorkton, a distance of 20 miles. The first house was to be St. Philips First Boarding School where our Indian fathers and mothers took lessons from lay teachers as Mr. Barton, our Post-Master, and a little later, from the Sisters de la Croix and the Oblate Sisters. Our actual Sister Superior was one of them.\n\nWe are now in 1910. St. Philips is growing in population; many white settlers had helped the Indians to form a considerable parish; a new church was built and that completed Father Decorby's dream as founded the mission. He was growing old and sickness took him away to St. Boniface, where he died in 1913. We have no doubt that Father Decorby was one of the greatest missionaries of the west. During a life full of zeal and heroism, he had scoured this country so many times that he was known by every inhabitant 75 miles around. He had won the hearts of the Indians, and even the he met; old timers of other creeds still speak of him in praise.\n\nThe Boarding School was closed not long after he died and the Indian students were sent to the Lebret School; meanwhile, many Oblates came to take charge of the mission. In 1927, the Government built a new School for us and Father Brouillette was our Principal for the first 8 years. During his last two years, he was assisted by Father Wille, whose zeal and energy will be long remembered. On October 30, 1934, Father Paradis took his place as assistant and soon became Principal when a sudden death ended the harassed career of Father Brouillette on Feb. 3, 1935. Father Paradis has been our Principal in charge of the School and Missions for 8 months, until Fathers Poulet, Perreault and Bousquet were successively sent to take charge of the Parish and Missions.\n\nWith Father Paradis and Father Bousquet we have the actual staff of 2 Fathers, 9 Sisters, all co-operating in making us happy and learned in our school life under their spiritual and temporal care.\n\nBeing only 10 pupils, we live close together and a great family spirit reigns in the School. We also have the advantage of seeing our parents every Sunday. We will, in future issues, have more to say about our daily doings. The students of St. Philips School.\n\nLEBRET, Sask.\u2014We have had the visit of His Excellency, Msgr. Monahan of Regina, on Sunday, February 6th.\n\nThe Brothers from the seminary were kind enough to show us six reels of old pictures on Carleton Treaties, ceremonies, on Duck Lake, Sask., St. Pierre, Man. and a summer camp in Eastern Canada, owned by the Oblate Fathers.\n\nFather Paradis de la Croix gives us lessons with slides twice a week on the Life of our Lord. On Sunday, Feb. 6th, Fr. Laviolette gave us the first of a series of conferences with slides on Church History.\n\nOne of the pupils now has two visits from Therese Desnomie and Therese Kayassawatam. Let us wish them success in this undertaking.\n\nA class of Organ pupils is also progressing favorably. It includes: Boys\u2014Fr. Paradis, Isaac, Grade 1\u2014Girle II\u2014Andrew Carrere, Nootesnomie, Daniel Dumont; Grade I\u2014William Dubois, John Sioux; Beginners\u2014Alec Severite, George Rider; Girls: (Sister Gilbert, Instructor) Rosalie Tamar, Mary Adhemar, Marie Rochefonder, Ella Rope, Stella Lavallee, Clara Anaqued, Gladys McLeod.\n\nThose who have known and loved Sister Marius will be sorry to learn that she has been very ill. We ask our old friends to kindly offer a prayer for her speedy return to health.\n\nValentine Party\u2014Thursday, Feb. 17, the boys and girls had a get-together which turned out to be an impressive affair. The programme varied with selections by a 10 piece orchestra, dancing by the Intermediate and Senior Girls singing by the boys and girls, and a few numbers by the Harmony Humming composed of 16 Seniors. Mr. Forget also entertained with his guitar. A touch of comedy was added to the proceedings by the Lost Rider who made his way to the party and kept the gathering in laughs by his antics and pranks. After 3 hours of fun all went to the inevitable beer. One of the girls, speaking for her companions, expressed to Father Principal the gratitude of the children for permitting such a night of enjoyment. The Junior Boys also entertained their girl classmates at a bingo party in their hall. It is said that the Lost Rider attended this party also, but that he had to leave because of the rough treatment \"Davy Ranger,\" his horse received at the hands of the junior boys.\n\nHockey News, Lebret: On Feb. 1st, our senior boys invaded Fort Qu'Appelle and defeated the combined Fort and Sanatorium teams with a score of 2-0. On Feb. 19th, in a return game, the School boys were defeated 3-0.\n\nOn Sunday, Feb. 20, the Senior Boys eked out a 4-3 victory over the Lebret Seniors in a hard fought game played on the town rink.\n\nRadio Artists: The Five Hills Redskins, an old time instrumental quartet composed of M. Norman Krewatin, Willie Dumont, Edwin Nokusis, and George L. Creely, was heard over CKCK on Feb. 19th, on an amateur program. Two numbers, \"Collection Campaign\" and \"My Blue Ridge Mountain Home\" were well enjoyed by their friends\u2014E.L.\n\nKinebikons or Little Snake\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nIn the year 1902, was born in the woods of Northern Ontario, near Rainy Lake, an Indian girl named Kinebikons, Little Snake. Her mother, a woman of the Odjibwe tribe, died when the child was two; her father departed for the happy hunting grounds three years later.\n\nSo the Indian girl was left an orphan; none to care for her but her mischievous looking grandmother called Tewegan\u2014the Drum. This squaw was already seventy years of age, and the great sorceress of the place.\n\nBoth of them, the child and her guardian, lived in an old shack, built some twenty-five years ago, on an elevation in the centre of the Indian Reservation of Scandjicaming.\n\nThirty-five other families made up the entire population of this village. In recent years, many of the men had died. Tuberculosis and the abuse of intoxicating liquor were the two principal causes of their early deaths.\n\nSome fifteen miles away from Scandjicaming, opposite the Indian School of Fort Frances, on the other side of the lake, was situated a small American town called Rainier. The Indians used to come here to sell their pelts, furs, fish, and berries, and in return received very often only fishworms for their pay. The mode of transportation of the Redmen, in those days, was very primitive and frail. They had only the weak birch bark canoe to travel in. One day a strong wind rose, when the storm suddenly rose on the lake and the Indian was driven into very dangerous. Whole families are known to have perished that way and are buried forever in the deep waters of Rainy Lake. Many others who escaped the fury of the waves were killed on the railroad track, running through the Couchiching reserve.\n\nOne winter afternoon, two Grey Nuns and the Missionary of the Fort Frances Indian Boarding School went out to visit the poor people of Scandjicaming. It was in the middle of January, the weather was very cold and a heavy blanket of snow covered the surface of Rainy Lake. Thirty-five cabins stood there in the open, looking far away over the great lakes; a thick bush of poplar trees protected the village from the north wind. We could see a number of white smoke curling into the air from most of the houses. But one cabin seemed to be without fire. This one we visited first. And what did we see there? In one of the corners of the old dilapidated shack, on a pile of green spruce branches, was lying a little girl. She cried when she saw us coming to her. With one hand, she covered\nKitchitwa Joseph (Cree)\n\nKeketch nistanako akimitji Niekipisim ke kitchikokilikamit kitichitwa Joseph.

By praying we try to say every day \"Oh Jesus I love You.\" This is to make a little better for the little Babe who is going to have His birthday on Christmas. We will be glad to come into our souls where a little helper will make Him very small there other nice things will be found. He will be comfortable in our hearts.\n\nI hope everybody will have a clean and beautiful soul to receive our dear Little Jesus.\n\nLittle Breland VI.\n\nDecember, the Month of Jesus.\n\nTo all know that December is the month of Jesus. We should try to offer Him many little sacrifices. On the first day of Advent our teacher gave us each a picture to offer to Little Jesus. I have to abstain from eating until Christmas. It is quite hard for me.\n\nWe are all working together to make a nice warm place in our hearts for Jesus. We are all anxious for Christmas not only because we are going to have presents but to receive Jesus. He will be very glad to find that we have prepared for Him a nice resting place.\n\nFred Breland VI.\nParish Bazaar.\n\nThe Bazaar was at the Parish Hall on December 6-5, to help the Church.\n\nSunday was for the people and Monday for the children of the Convent and of the Public School.\n\nRight after class, we got ready to go to the hall. There were all kinds of beautiful things and nice decorations. We each had our own money, some had over a dollar, from exhibition works of last year. Our kind Sister Superior gave some money to those who did not have any.\n\nI went with all my friends to play the Horse Name Race. There were two different games of Horse Races; one was Horse Name Race and the other Horse Number Race. I took Seabiscuit and I won six pennies. Reverend Fathers Bidault and Cr\u00e9peau and Mr. Ouellette called out the two games.\n\nThen at the Bingo stand I played four times but got nothing. We next went to the Fishing Pond and fished four times and had a bag of peanuts, a box of popcorn, a game and a horn. Some who were with me were lucky and had some nice things.\n\nWe came to a table where there were beautiful articles to raffle. I took a chance and some others too. Then I bought a set of comb, looking glass and a finger file for fifteen cents.\n\nAt 5 o'clock we came back for our supper. At 7-30 there was an entertainment given but we did not go. A large attendance was expected.\n\nLouise Ward VII\nThe Immaculate Conception.\n\nThe feast of the Immaculate Conception of our Blessed Mother is celebrated on December 8. It is the greatest feast of the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\nDo you know when this feast became better known? It was a little girl by the name of Bernadette to whom the Blessed Virgin appeared eighteen times, that made it known. Bernadette told the world about that but he didn't believe her. One of the Fathers told her to ask that lady what her name was. Bernadette asked her. The Blessed Virgin said: \"I am the Immaculate Conception.\"\n\nOn Columbus' second voyage to America, he took along a priest. When they reached a certain place in the West Indies, in 1493, on December 8, he there said the first mass on American soil.\n\nThe Immaculate Conception is the patronal feast of America.\n\nHenry Calder VII.\n\nThe Employees' Gift.\n\nOn the 200th anniversary of the foundation of the Order of Grey Nuns, the employees of the convent presented to Sister Superior flowers for the decoration of the altars. Unhappily they arrived too late to be used on their day.\n\nOn the feast of the Immaculate Conception, Reverend Sister Superior had the altars beautifully decorated with them. White, mauve and pink are the colors of these.\n\nClara House, VII.\nCongratulations.\n\nI wish to congratulate Blue Quills and Cluny Schools for using their own mother tongue in several articles of their school magazine. This shows that they are proud of writing and reading their own language. We are sorry that we cannot do the same. We can talk it, but our parents read and write in their own language.\n\nI think that every nation should keep to the mother tongue and be proud of it.\n\nEmilienne Kootenay, VII.\n\nAmong Us Again.\n\nReverend Father Simard returned from the eastern part of Canada last Wednesday night. We were all glad to see him again.\n\nHe was preaching retreats in different churches. We prayed for him every day so that he would be successful in his preachings. He said he prayed for us too every day.\n\nHe was surprised to find changes in the classrooms.\n\nEmilien Paul, VII.\nThe New Barn.\n\nOur new barn was built by the hired men. They broke down the other barn because it was too old. We all worked at it. We were glad when it was taken down as it gave a bigger playground to the small boys.\n\nIt is about a hundred yards away from the other one. It is divided into three sections. One is for the little calves, the other for the bigger calves, and the middle part for the cows.\n\nIt is very pretty, as you see by the picture. It is painted red and yellow. Now we have a fine shelter for all the cows.\n\nHenry Calder, VII.\nAmong Us Again.\n\nReverend Father Simard returned from the eastern part of Canada last Wednesday night. We were all glad to see him again. He was preaching retreats in different churches. We prayed for him every day so that he would be successful in his preachings. He said he prayed for us too every day. He was surprised to find changes in the classrooms.\n\nEmilion Paul, VII.\n\nOur Skating Rink.\n\nWe started skating in December 5. Our skating rink is fine. We have it in a new place this year. It is beside the summer house and last year it was beside the barn. We worked at it very hard because winter was here and we could not skate. When it is cold at night we flood it again as to put another coat of ice on it and to fill up the cracks. We are glad now that it is finished and every now and then when we have some spare time we go and skate. All the big boys have their own skates. We hope to have a hockey game with the Public School boys.\n\nWalter Salliho, VII.\nPainting Our Classes.\n\nOur classes are being painted. Our good Sister Superior had the men do this just to please us. We were making our retreat during that time. They took three days to finish the classes and those were the three days of our retreat. The classes are beautiful now and we wish to keep them that way all the time. The walls are painted pale yellow and the ceiling white. The hall too is painted white and yellow but most of it is white.\n\nI hope you will come and see our school some day. We like it better than before because it makes us happy and gay when we look at it. We thank dear Sister Superior for this great favor.\n\nBessie Lefthand, VII.\n\nChristmas Decorations.\n\nA few days before Christmas, we clean all the rooms and classes, then we decorate them. Just to look at the pretty decorations makes you happy. The music hall should be the most pretty because on Christmas all the children go there to get their presents.\n\nThe parents are there to encourage their children, and at the same time they see what they have done in the rooms or in the classes.\n\nHector Callihoo, VI.\nAn Agreeable Surprise.\n\nOn December 19, all of Grade VII pupils were in school at work, when a knock was heard at the door; then in stepped Mr. Laight with a cordial morning greeting. We too greeted him as nicely as we could. Sister presented him a chair, then he spoke to us. He asked us if we were in good health, and a few other questions.\n\nWhat pleased us most was when our teacher offered him our class magazine. He seemed delighted and he asked Sister to put him on her list and not fail to send him our \"Enchanted Hill Echoes.\" We were very happy to see our Agent and we hope to see him more often.\n\nHe left us with his best wishes for a \"Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.\" We wished him the same.\n\nEmilienne Kootenay VII.\n\nReverend Father Lessard's Remarks.\n\nWe have to agree with Reverend Father Lessard's remarks to parents in the Okanagan, that most of the children lose in weight during vacations.\n\nThe same has been noticed here, but since September all gained, and most of them from five to thirteen pounds. This is a proof that school is the best place for good health.\n\nWe hope that all will keep the proper weight so as to be in good condition when we get older.\n\nGeorge Stamp, VII.\nDecorators.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, the Sister in charge of the Reception Hall asked for two girls to decorate the Christmas Tree. Louise Ward and I were chosen.\n\nHow privileged we felt to prepare the Christmas Tree. We had bells, silver, red, green and blue ornaments purposely for decorating trees, also cotton and silver tinsel to imitate snow and icicles. We were trying to see who would do best, but it was hard to tell, for the tree was pretty and shiny all over.\n\nBoys also can be fine decorators, for our class is very pretty indeed, and George Stamp decorated it with our Teacher.\n\nEmilienne Kootenay VII.\n\nPublic School Concert.\n\nOn December 23, we were invited to a concert at the parish hall, given by the Public School Children.\n\nWe were certainly pleased to be invited. We liked to see other school children act. We went at about two o'clock and it lasted two hours. We enjoyed every part of it but the last was the best because it was in English and a comedy.\n\nEmilienne K. Walter C. VII.\nMidnight Mass.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, we all went to bed early, because we had to be up for the Midnight Mass.\n\nWhen our Sister called us, we hurried to dress. We entered the chapel in procession, along the middle aisle singing a Christmas hymn. All went to the Crib to greet the Sweet Babe, then filed to their seats.\n\nWe assisted at two masses only, and we sang during both.\n\nMany of our parents were present and received holy communion.\n\nReverend Father Simard gave a sermon after the first mass.\n\nAfter the second mass, we all went to the dormitory, and five big girls went down to the kitchen for some lunch. After lunch we all went to bed and slept until seven o'clock.\n\nClara House, VII.\n\nChristmas Tree.\n\nAlthough Christmas Day was cold, many parents came to see their children. They attended the Midnight Mass and received holy communion.\n\nIn the afternoon, at two o'clock was the Christmas Tree. The Reverend Fathers and the Brothers of the parish attended.\n\nA dust was played, followed by a little play in which the Old Year dressed in purple bid farewell and the New Year dressed in white greeted a little girl. The old Year\nheld a scroll in his hand which contained\nthe good and the bad deeds done by the\nlittle girl. The New Year came in quickly\nwith another scroll ready to take in the\nlittle girl's deeds. A very fine lesson\nwas found for us all in this little play.\n\nThe Christmas presents were distributed\nby Mons Cardinal, Bessie Lefthand, Emilienne\nKootenay and myself, but were presented by\nthe Fathers and dear Sister Superior.\n\nTo close, we sang a lovely Christmas song.\n\nLouise Ward, VII.\n\nOur Parents Visit the Convent.\n\nThe parents were asked if they would\nlike to visit the house on Christmas after-\nnoon. Four Sisters took them around.\nThey were very much pleased with the\nplayroom and the sleeping rooms. They were\nglad that their children had such nice\ncomfortable beds.\n\nThe Sisters took them to the sewing room;\nhere they saw many pieces of sewing done by\nthe girls. The parents said the girls sewed\nwell.\n\nThey were especially glad to visit the\nclassrooms. Many of them said that they were\nin this school, and were sorry they had to\nleave it.\n\nAlphonse Paul VII J.\nAn Appreciated Invitation.\n\nAt first, I thought there would be no fun after Christmas, but we boys were all surprised when the girls told us they were going to invite us to a party. I tell you, we were all very anxious for it to come.\n\nThat evening, at about seven o'clock, Sister came into the room where we were playing. She said, \"Why don't the boys go to the party?\" We told her that we were waiting for her to tell us to go. Sister told us to dress quickly not to be late. We tried to look the best we could. At last, we were all ready to go to the party, given in the big girl's room.\n\nMichel Arcand started to play mouth organ and a number of boys and girls jigged. We then played Bingo. Fifty played at one time. Many won prizes. One of the Sisters won a prize but she was kind enough to give it back and this allowed us to play another turn.\n\nWe enjoyed the party very much, and we hope the girls will be kind enough to invite us to another soon.\n\nPatrick Thomas VI.\n\nWe Entertain Our Friends.\n\nDuring the Christmas Holidays, Sister Houle said that we should make a party and invite all the children to our room. This took place on Tuesday evening, December 27. We were well prepared for it.\n\nWhen we heard the children coming we all stood up to greet them. Some Sisters came too,\nand Reverend Sister Superior among them.\n\nOur room was full; we hardly had space enough to carry on the different games planned.\n\nThe first thing on the program was a jig by a number of boys and girls. After this we played Beano, which is the same as Bingo, seated in groups of four. Various prizes were given to the winners.\n\nSome girls served refreshments. All the children felt happy because we gave them a splendid evening.\n\nEmilienne Kootenay VII S.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nNew Year's Day.\n\n-----------\n\nEarly in the morning we wished each other a Happy New Year, then went to mass in our own chapel.\n\nAbout 9 o'clock we had the pleasure of wishing the Sisters a Happy New Year. When we came down to our room, we had a surprise. The little boys were there to wish us a Happy New Year, and then we followed them to the girls' room to give them our best wishes for the year.\n\nThis over, we went to church to assist at high mass; during this mass we prayed for our parents and those interested in our welfare.\n\nAfter dinner, we all went skating until supper time. The evening was also spent very joyously.\n\nEmilien Paul VII S.\n\n-------------------------------\nWith every good wishes to you\nand to those dear to you.\n\nHAPPY NEW YEAR\nSweets from Father Bidault.\n\nOn January 2, all the children went to the Music Hall to meet Reverend Father Bidault. When we were all placed on the stage, Father came in and we sang a New Year song for him. After the song, Father gave us each a big bag of candy. Three little girls then spoke a piece to thank him. We are all very grateful for his kindness.\n\nHector Callihoo VI.\n\nAmong Us Again.\n\nDoris Cardinal did not come back in September because she was allowed to stay home to care for her mother who was very sick. On December 19, Mr. Laight came to visit us and he told us that Doris's mother had died. We felt very sorry for her. We did not forget to pray for both.\n\nThursday afternoon, December 23, our friend Doris was once more among us. We all tried our best to encourage her by being kind to her. God will accept our prayer for her mother for she was a very faithful and holy woman.\n\nEmilienne, Clara, Louise VII S.\nWe Shall Remember.\n\nHis Excellency Archbishop MacDonald was so very kind as to take some of his precious time to write a long letter to us. He wrote in his own hand-writing that he likes our little class magazine very much.\n\nWE SHALL REMEMBER the good advice that he gives us, with regard to our pastors and parents, and we will try to be his consolation now, and more so after we have left school.\n\nWalter Callihoo VII.\n\nA Fine Projector.\n\nReverend Father Simard, who is chaplain of our school, gave us a lesson with his new projector. Father must have thought of us a great deal while he was in the East, since he bought for us that fine machine.\n\nHe gave us a lesson the night before King's Day. He showed us some pictures of our Lord's life, and of martyrs how they were persecuted long ago. He explained what he thought we could not quite understand.\n\nWe all enjoyed our evening very much. We hope that Father will come again with his projector. We all pray for him in return.\n\nHenry Calder VII J.\nA Highly Valued Message.\n\nIn answer to our New Year letter, Reverend and dear Mother General sent us a lovely message in which she expressed her wishes for a very happy New Year to our beloved parents and to each one of us.\n\nWe shall never forget her advice and we shall be very obedient to our teachers as she requested it in her dear letter.\n\nHow much honored we felt on receiving this loving message from Reverend Mother General.\n\nEmilienne Kootenay VII.\n\nThe Girls' Concert.\n\nOn Friday, Kings Day, the girls gave a concert. It was to give pleasure to the pupils of the school. We were all very much pleased to attend the entertainment.\n\nThe following were seen: A Fan Drill by the big girls and a Doll Drill by the small girls. Both were very pretty. Mouth organ was played by two girls accompanied on the piano by our music teacher. The best one was \"The Precious Pickles.\" This playlet was very well done.\n\nIt will be our turn some day to give a concert. I hope that we will do just as well as the girls did theirs.\n\nHenry Calder, VII J.\nYouville Indian Residential School\nSt. Albert, Alberta\nJanuary 9, 1856.\n\nMiss Agnes Sutherland,\nFort Chipewyan,\nAlberta.\n\nDear Friend,\n\nWe were very much pleased with your letter telling us that you enjoyed reading our journal. We shall gladly send it to you every two months.\n\nWe also had fine weather here until Christmas, but the week after was very cold. The thermometer went down so below zero say.\n\nAll the boys wish there were caribou over here too. What a swell time they would have hunting them! And the girls would enjoy a good earlick steak!\n\nWe only wish we could visit your classrooms to see the beautiful decorations you have made for Christmas.\n\nWe enjoyed our holidays. We had a party in the girls' ward. We played Bingo and other games. On King's Day the girls, large and small, gave a concert partly prepared by themselves as an agreeable pastime for all the convent people.\n\nThe boys will give theirs at the beginning of next month. All the Chipewyan children are invited, and do not forget to bring with you your kind Sister Superior, our Teacher's sister.\n\nWe hope to hear from you again, and whenever you can send your class magazine, we shall read it with great pleasure.\n\nYour sincere friend,\nGeorge Stapp VII S.\nThe Old Timers.\n\nThe Old Timers were here again on the 8th of January. We were glad to meet them again and they too were glad to come on such a fine weather as we had that day.\n\nWhen the Old Timers came all the children went to the hall and they gave us apples, oranges and candies. When we had our sweets, we were not going to let the kind Old Timers go without thanking them and showing them that they made us happy, so we gave them a little concert.\n\nOur program began with a welcome song. A song \"The General's Fast Asleep\" was next, after that, \"Drill, Dumb-bells,\" then a \"Doll Drill\" followed by the Old Timers Song. Next came the Pan Drill by the large girls, and lastly, \"The Old Year's Lesson.\"\n\nThe Old Timers seemed well pleased. They made speeches which we were glad to hear. Some gave us good advice.\n\nAfter all the speeches, everybody, with a happy heart, sang God Save the King.\n\nJane Belcourt VI.\n\nTaking Pictures.\n\nReverend Father Philippot came here to take our pictures on January 7. We were all glad to have them taken.\n\nFather took those of all the children together, then the children of each reserve separately. After dinner he took the picture of the boys of the League of the Sacred Heart, then the altar boys in surplices.\nHe took our pictures because he might illustrate with them one of his books, for he is a writer.\n\nHenry Calder VII J.\n\n------------------------\n\nA Trip to Australia.\n\n................\n\nThere will be an Easter Show held in Australia, by the Royal New South Wales Agricultural Society, in Sidney.\n\nThere will be eight Indian boys sent to represent our tribes. Among these will be two Stonies from Alberta, Douglas Kootenay and Johnny LeftHand.\n\nThey will leave in February. They will be surprised when they get there, because it will be summer time. They will land at Port Sidney, and there they will show what they can do as cowboys and also as dancers. They will be accompanied by a Canadian Royal Mounted Police.\n\nAlphonse Paul VII J.\n\n------------------------\n\nThe Church Unity Octave.\n\n......................\n\nThese eight days of prayer for the Church unity was established in the United States. It was begun in a Convent, then spread in several dioceses, then finally all dioceses of the States adopted it. Pope Benedict XV established it all over the world.\n\nDuring these eight days, starting January 18, here, in the convent, we have Benediction of\nthe Blessed Sacrament at 4 o'clock and\nthe prayer for the intention of each day,\nso that those who are not followers of\nthe true Church, such as Anglicans, Calvinists,\nLutherans and so on, may come back to the\ntrue Fold, the Church of God. And as to those\nwho have not heard the word of God yet, that\nsome missionaries might be sent to them.\n\nLouise Ward VII S.\n\nA Great Honor.\n\nOur Holy Father, the Pope sent the\n\"Bene Merenti\" medal to Reverend Mother\nGallant, on the two hundredth anniversary\nof her Order.\n\nHis Eminence, Cardinal Antoniutti the\nPope's Legate, presented it to Mother General\nand told her that it was sent in recognition\nof the many good works done by the Order of\nthe Grey Nuns.\n\nWe rejoice that such an honor was\nbestowed on the teachers under whose care we\nare.\n\nClara House. VII S.\n\nMovies.\n\nReverend Father Bidault was good enough\nto invite us to a picture show last Monday\nnight in the music room of our school.\nThis show was very funny. It made all the\nchildren happy because they like to see pictures.\nof that kind. They were about Mickey Mouse, a man in a cart, and custard pies. How we laugh to see Mickey Mouse running here and there with pies between his fore-paws!\n\nWe enjoyed the picture show, and we thank Father for his kindness.\n\nBessie Lefthand VII J.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nAn Exciting Hockey Game.\n\n------------------------\n\nLast Sunday afternoon, we had a hockey game with the boys of the Public School.\n\nEarly a great number of boys were waiting at the rink to see the game. Our Captain was Henry Calder and our goalie Michael Kootenay, the best goalie around. We were sorry that two of our best players were sick.\n\nWe started off half past two. In the first period we won six to zero, and in the second we scored 4. We were supposed to play up to fifteen goals but the outsiders gave up.\n\nThey said they were coming again next Sunday. We hope to beat them once more.\n\nWe were very sorry for not inviting our Chaplain for this game, but we will next time.\n\nGeorge Stamp, Walter Callihoo\nVII S.\nOur Blessed Mother must be pleased to see so many names on the Honor Roll during the month of her HOLY ROSARY.\nOctober 1938\n\nOur Guardian Angel.\n\nEverybody knows that when God first made the heavens, he created the Angels. God was so good that he created man too, and put an angel by each one to protect him. He also placed one over every village, city and country to watch over it.\n\nOur Angels serve, adore and respect God and help us to do so ourselves. They are so good that they will never leave us till the judgment day... We should think sometimes to say, \"Thank You,\" to our dear Angels.\n\nWe should try to do our best so that when we die, we may be happy with him in heaven for all eternity.\n\nJean Belcourt VI.\n\nVisitors from far off Australia.\n\nLast week, we had visitors from two Universities of Australia, one was from Melbourne and the other from Sidney... Reverend Brother Memoriam brought them here for a visit on Wednesday October 2... They said, they were very glad to come here... With them came three professors from the university of Alberta. The pupils of Grades 2, 3 and 4 sang in Cree for them. They were very glad to listen to it. People from far off like to hear other languages.\n\nJean Belcourt VI.\nThe First Snowstorm.\n\nWe were very glad to see the snow-flakes twinkling down from the sky last week.\n\nThat day, the snow was soft. It was good to make balls. We had fun in snowball fighting, but the snow thawed that first day.... We had another fall and we hope it will stay until spring.\n\nWe are starting to make bob-sleighs to slide down the hill. We have five ready.\n\nWe all enjoy sliding for it gives us fine exercise and plenty of fresh air... Thus we hope that this will give us the best of health and success in our school work.\n\nGeorge Walter Emilian VII S.\n\nOur Last Picnic.\n\nAfter picking potatoes for two days, we were given a picnic... After our breakfast we hurried with our work and prepared our lunch. Then we made each a sling shot for hunting rabbits and ducks.\n\nWe started off before ten... We reached the steep hill near the tracks and we played until we heard Master's car tooting the car horn for dinner... After taking a good meal, we decided to walk to the big lake where we saw men shooting ducks and when we got back, we were just in time for supper.\n\nWe played until half past seven, then returned and went to bed for good times have to come to an end.\n\nGeorge Stamp VII S.\nIn the Potato Field.\n\n...........\n\nWe picked potatoes this year on October 6 and 7. We all put on old dresses and stockings, sweaters and old soldier caps. I like picking potatoes. We were at it two days only when we expected to take three days.\n\nOn Thursday we picked fifty rows and Friday sixty-one rows and that meant 1600 sacks.\n\nWe had our lunch on the field and we liked it. We surely enjoyed eating for we were hungry although we ate raw potatoes while we were picking.\n\nThe Sisters came and they seemed to enjoy looking at the children at work because there were so many in the field.\n\nI was holding the bags with Emilienne Kootenay and we enjoyed it as much as those who pitched.\n\nOur Good Sister Superior gave us a fine picnic because we did the work well.\n\nBessie Lefthand VII J.\nThe Flour Mill on Fire.\n\nOn Friday night about 12 o'clock, I awoke and saw a red light coming into our bedroom. I got up to see what was the matter and saw the flour mill on fire.\n\nI saw the firemen trying to stop it. It was terrible to hear the roaring of flames. I went back to bed and as soon as I got up I went to look; it was still burning, and is burning yet after five days.\n\nEverybody was speaking of it the next morning, and in the afternoon some of the Sisters and the children went to see it. We could see the grain, flour sacks and all that was in it. There were men helping to take the grain out.\n\nIt started by the elevator... On Friday morning the miller could smell something burning but did not find fire. During the night it burst out. Nobody was hurt, but it is a big loss.\n\nAdeline Leblanc VII J.\n\nThanksgiving Day.\n\nChildren, would you be glad to hear of the Pilgrim Fathers who gave wealth, health, happiness and friends for a place where they could praise God the way they liked.\nThey landed on the New England shore where the peaceful village of Plymouth now lies in 1620.\n\nThere they built their cabins where the Red Men lived... even the bravest of them could feel his blood running cold for fear these Indians would burn their homes. Before spring many of the band died of sickness, cold and hunger.\n\nWhen harvest time came, the next year, the patient mothers smiled as they thanked God for the good crops. Governor Bradford, like a good man, to praise and thank God, ordered a day be set apart, which he called Thanksgiving Day.\n\nJean Belcourt VII.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nThanksgiving Day.\n\n...........\n\nThis old feast day\u2014sweet scenes recalling Thanksgiving Day brings praise and cheer while all thank God for precious blessings showered on all throughout the year.\n\nEmilienne Kootenay VII.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nIn October the harvest done,\nThanksgiving comes with all its fun,\nGiving the season a happy good-bye\nWhile thanking God for what has gone by.\n\nLouise Ward VII.\nOctober with its festal day\nFills Homes with sweetest cheer\nMakes children's hearts so gay,\nMay they remain thus all the year.\n\nGeorge Stamp VII.\n\nOur Three Days' Retreat.\n\nWe had a retreat of three days. It started on Tuesday October 23.\n\nThe preacher was Reverend Father Gagnon. How we gladly greeted him for we knew him before as he preached a retreat to us last year.\n\nWe had Mass at 7 o'clock, Rosary at 9 and 1:30 sermons at 10, 4:30 and 7; Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament... The three days were this order until Friday - retreat ended with the mass.\n\nOn Friday morning, Father blessed our religious articles, such as medals, holy pictures, beads etc.\n\nAll the sermons he gave us were very beautiful and interesting. Even the smallest who were in the chapel did not sleep because they were listening with their two ears wide open.\n\nWe and the Cluny children were very fortunate to have such an extra preacher and a retreat in which numberless graces and favors were given to us through the kind Heart of Jesus. This retreat has been a success we hope.\n\nWe thank most sincerely Sister Superior who asked a missionary to preach to us, and for having sent for such a good one as Father Gagnon.\nIn a special manner we thank Father Gagnon for having done such good to our souls.\n\nEmilienne Kootenay VII S.\n\nOur Retreat.\n\nWe had a retreat again this year. We were glad to make it and try to make it better than last year.\n\nReverend Father Crepeau had to begin preaching the first day's instructions...\n\nThe next day, Reverend Father Gagnon came back from Cluny where he preached a retreat to the Crowfoot School.\n\nAt the beginning of the retreat Father told us if we were happy to make a retreat, it was a good sign and if we were not happy, it meant that we needed to take one.\n\nWe had three days for the retreat and three instructions during each of those days. We were not always in silence. We had recreation from 12 to 1 o'clock.\n\nOn the last day of our retreat we made our confession and the next day received Holy Communion... We were happy after making a good retreat and I am sure God too was pleased.\n\nJean Belcourt VI.\n\nCleanings from our Retreat.\n\nTo keep good, we must pray and make sacrifices.\n\nJean Belcourt VI.\n1. When we do something wrong, it is not because we are bad but because we forget ourselves.\n\nJean Belcourt VI.\n\n2. Suffer the little ones to come unto me for the kingdom of heaven is theirs.\n\nEmilienne Kootenay VII.\n\n3. We should always chase away temptations otherwise we will live a bad life.\n\nAdeline Leblanc VII J.\n\n4. Pray that missionaries be sent to places where God is not yet known.\n\nLouise Ward VII S.\n\n5. Pray for more priests and nuns because there are not enough of them to do God's work.\n\nLouise Ward VII S.\n\n6. When we commit a sin the devil turns and says to Jesus: \"He does not love you.\"\n\nFred Breland VI.\n\n7. I think that a retreat for children is good as it helps us to think of our sins.\n\nLottie Breland VI.\n\n8. We should start a good life while we are young.\n\nEmilien Paul VII S.\n\n9. We should pray for the Church so that the knowledge of the true God may spread all over the world.\n\nBessie Lefthand VII J.\n\n10. Those who have a devotion to the Blessed Virgin are sure to be saved.\n\nWalter Callihoo VII S.\n\n11. Make sacrifices for the propagation of the faith.\n\nAlphonse Paul VII J.\n\n12. If we take a bad habit when young, we will never get rid of it.\n\nWalter Callihoo\n16. Overcome bad passions or they will become a habit. \u2014 Emilian Paul VII S.\n\n18. God want the little ones to come to Him for He loves them. \u2014 George Stamp VII S.\n\nOur Visit to the Cemetery.\n\nThe Parishioners, Convent Children, Sisters and Priests went to the graveyard at 3 o'clock on October 9.\n\nReverend Father Naessens blessed the graves and then the choir sang the \"Libera.\" After the hymn, Reverend Father Crepeau gave a sermon, first in French, then in English.\n\nWhen he spoke English, he said that the souls of our friends or parents that are in the grave are, we hope enjoying happiness in heaven, but he also said that there might be some calling for your prayers and help being yet in purgatory. It is therefore a duty of justice to help them by our prayers, but especially by the holy sacrifice of the mass.\n\nAfter the sermon we went back to the church, and on our way, we said the beads. We had Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament in church.\n\nClara House VII S.\nTHE BLAZON\nOF THE GREY NUNS.\nTwo Hundredth Anniversary.\n\nThe year 1938 marks the 200th anniversary of the foundation of the Grey Nuns by Mother d'Youville. Adam Youville started this order with three companions in Montreal in 1735. Now there are five branches numbering about 5000 Sisters.\n\nIn Montreal, on September 27, this Feast was celebrated at the Lother House. There was a banquet at which three hundred of the poorest people of Montreal took part. The Archbishop presided the banquet. After this, gifts of clothing were distributed to them.\n\nThere are Grey Nuns now spread all over from the Southern States to Alaska, north of the Arctic Circle.\n\nThere was here, in St. Albert, after high mass on Sunday, \"Te Deum\" sung in thanksgiving for the graces and benefits that God has showered on the Grey Nuns.\n\nOn Friday, November 12, there will be a mass of Requiem for the deceased benefactors of the Grey Nuns. All the parishioners are invited.\n\nIn remembrance of these two centuries of foundation we had here a celebration for the employees of the convent. There was a mass for them, after which a banquet followed, presided by Reverend Father Bidault and Reverend Father Philippot was there also. They had their day off.\n\nWe will have some other celebrations yet... These will be announced later.\n\nEmilienne Kootenay VII S.\nThe Employees' Day.\n\nA celebration was organized on November 3, for all the employees of the Convent, on the two-hundredth anniversary of the foundation of the Order of the Grey Nuns, our teachers.\n\nFirst there was a mass said at 9 o'clock during which all the men received holy communion. All the children and Sisters assisted at the mass.\n\nAfter the mass, they were led to St. Mary's room which was made into a banquet room. It was beautifully decorated with yellow and white crepe paper. The lights were painted red to give a pleasing effect. The statue of Mother d'Youville was placed near the side wall, facing the tables, and decorated with flowers of lovely colors. The tables covered with nice table cloths, lovely dishes, and platters of delicious fruits looked very pretty.\n\nReverend Father Bidault presided and Reverend Father Philippot was there too.\n\nThe employees each had a picture of Mother d'Youville as a souvenir and were given a day off.\n\nEmilienne, Clara H., Louise W., VII S.\n\nReverend Father Bidault's Return.\n\nFather Bidault was absent from September 4, to October 27.\n\nWhen he came back, he told us that he was on the train for three days and three nights to reach Montreal, and from Montreal to Cherbourg, he took five days and five nights in an immense boat.\nWhen he got off at Cherbourg, an officer asked him what his name was and he handed him a telegram saying that the good Father Grandin who was going to feast his diamond jubilee was about to leave this world. As soon as he heard that he took a taxi to go to the place where he was, and when he got there it was after midnight.\n\nHe just had time to talk to him and show him the Spiritual Bouquet that the Grey Nuns in Montreal made for him, but containing our prayers. That saintly Father died the next morning. Reverend Father Bidault was at his funeral and he said all the people of that city were sorry because he was a good priest.\n\nReverend Father Bidault went to the church of St. Teresa de Lisieux and stayed there for three days. Then he went to Lourdes and again he stayed there and prayed for three days. He said there were about a thousand people praying every day at Lourdes. He bought there some medals and had them touch the rock where our Blessed Lady appeared to St. Bernadette and he brought those to us and told us to keep them as a souvenir of him. This we shall do.\n\nBessie Lefthand VII J.\n\nA Hallowe'en Joke.\n\nDick, Jim and Bill were planning Hallowe'en jokes on their neighbors, especially those that were cranky and old.\n\nThey decided that they would take off Johnson's gate and put it on the roof of his barn; take the tires off Scot's car and smear\nMrs. Jones bakery window with flour.\n\nBill's sister Kathleen was writing at her desk in the living room. She heard the plotters plans and she came out to them and said: \"Listen boys, try to think of other jokes that nobody ever thought of or did. Why not put up a basket for Mrs. Quinn. She is a poor widow with four children.\"\n\nThe boys eagerly listened to her plan for she was a favorite with them, as she often gave them hot gingerbread and homemade candies. Kathleen added: \"We can put a bag of flour, potatoes and some jars of jam, vegetables and a pumpkin to show the Hallowe'en joke.\"\n\nDick said: \"I'll ask mother for a pumpkin, I am sure she will give me one if I tell her why I want it.\" Kathleen said: \"Mrs. Jones will give me a bag of flour if I ask her for it.\" Bill added: \"Mother will give me some strawberry jam if I ask for some.\" We have some potatoes, I am sure I can have some,\" said Jim. Mr. Johnson and Mr. Scott will do their part if I ask them. Said Kathleen. They are not so odd as they seem to be.\"\n\nThe boys were glad that Kathleen spoke for them, and this was the best Hallowe'en that they ever had.\n\nEmilienne Kootenay VII S.\n\nAll Saints' Day\n\nAll Saints' Day is now November 1. It is a feast of obligation. We all went to mass on that day. All the alters in the church...\nand in our chapel were well decorated and\nthe singing was beautiful.\nWe wore our white veils and red dresses.\nAll Saints' Day is the feast of all the\nSaints in heaven, where they will rejoice\nforever.\n\nSister told us that as soon as we wake\nup in the morning, the first saint we think\nof should be our patron Saint during all the\nyear... Mine was St. Cecilia. On that day I\nobtain a grace from her. This shows that she\nwill be faithful to me all the year. It is\nthirteen days since and she has obtained\nmany favors for me. I have a great devotion\nto her now.\n\nAdeline Leblanc. VII J.\n\nRemembrance Day.\n\nRemembrance Day is celebrated on November\n11. The World War ended at that date in 1918,\nand since then Canada has been at peace,\ntherefore has been so for twenty years.\nThe people in Canada were so glad when\nwar ended that they made great celebrations\neverywhere by putting up parades etc.\nBut right now there is a war between\nChina and Japan... There was to be a war in\nEurope last month but matters were arranged.\nLet us hope there will not be one there,\nand we hope there will never be one here, in\nCanada.\n\nLottie Ireland. VI.\nAn Enjoyable Evening.\n\nThe evening I enjoyed most was last night at our playroom. We played games that Sister Deslauriers taught us. We enjoyed them very much.\n\nSister comes to our play room every Sunday night. We played a new game last night. Sister have a paper made like a big cake with a string for each of us coming out of it... There was a surprise at the inner end of each string. We were all ready now. Sister told us that when she said, \"Got game,\" one pull his string. The boys were anxious to see what was the surprise that they could hardly wait for the signal. Finally it was given and we pulled out each a candy wrapped in paper.\n\nMany thanks to the Sisters who come to give us a good time. We hope that Sister Deslauriers will come and keep us again.\n\nHenry Calder VII J.\n\nOur Inspector's Visit.\n\nMr. LeBlanc our inspector was here on November 18th to visit the school. He came in our classes, grades VI and VII.\n\nWe greeted him very heartily, as he came in, and we were all glad to see him, for we had not seen him for over a year.\n\nHe asked some of our lessons such as spelling, reading, writing etc.\n\nHe also gave a look at our ink writing books.\n\nWe did our best and we were glad of our day for Mr. LeBlanc seemed pleased with us.\n\nEmilienne Kootenay, VII S.\nPROGRAM\n\n1.

Every year we feast our kind Sister Superior.\n\nAn entertainment was given by the children of our school in her honor. It opened with a piano duet followed by a festal song. Then an address was nicely given by one of the big boys of St. Joseph's Ward, George Stamp. The offering of the Spiritual Bouquet was done by the smallest boy here, Eddie Benoit.... The concert followed.\n\nThe most interesting number to me, was \"Tekakwitha or the Lily of the Mohawks,\" a drama in two acts and 15 scenes.\n\nA few people who had received an invitation and Sisters from Edmonton assisted at our entertainment.... The reception hall was full.\n\nThis must have pleased dear Sister Superior to see so many come to show her how grateful they are towards her.\n\nAs you know, the bouquet was the best gift that our hearts could offer her. This offering contained masses heard, communions, Stations of the Cross, etc.\n\nHow happy Reverend Sister Superior felt on hearing all that took place that night, and we too were happy to show our gratitude towards her, for all she does for us.\n\nEmilienne Kootenay. VII S.\nA Joyful Holiday.\n\nIt was on November 24. We had that holiday because it was Sister Superior's feast, and we had a grand time.\n\nYou should have been here just to see our breakfast and our dinner... It made us hungry just to see all the good things we had.\n\nAfter dinner, at about half past two, we went sliding down the hill, and we played there all afternoon until supper time.\n\nOn our return, Sister Superior gave us a treat - Chocolate Bars.\n\nAfter our supper we went outside to play Hide-and-Seek till dark. All the boys then went to bed.\n\nThe next day we worked hard in school and did satisfactory work.\n\nWalter Callihoo VII S.\nSt. Albert\n\nSt. Albert is the Patron Saint of the parish... This parish was so called because when Bishop Tach\u00e9 came with Father Lacombe, he said he would call it St. Albert in honour of Father Lacombe's patron saint.\n\nWe celebrate his feast on November 21. St. Albert lived in Louvain. He was very good and many people loved him.... They did not have a bishop so the Pope named him Bishop of Louvain.... But the Emperor of Germany did not like it because he did not ask him if he wanted Albert so he sent one of his choice to the seat and sent Albert away.\n\nAlbert went to Rome where he saw the Pope and told him all about this. The Pope had him consecrated Bishop.\n\nWhen the Emperor heard that he became very angry and wanted to put him to death. So, one day he sent seven men to his house. He received them well and they ate at his table for sixty-six days.... Then the Bishop left on a pilgrimage to the tomb of St. Remi. When he passed through the forest, he saw those seven men and they took their spears and gave him thirteen mortal wounds.\n\nEdith Callihoo VI.\nArbitration Day.\n\nOn November 11, we had a pleasant surprise. Sister told us we were going to Frenchman's Butte for a celebration held there.\n\nWe were three girls to go - Marie Louise Chacon, Josie Harris and I.\n\nWe rehearsed the songs the day before.\n\nWe started out at about nine o'clock and got there a little before eleven.\n\nTwo of us girls were sick on the way, it seemed such a long time before we reached the place.\n\nA crowd of people had already gathered for the celebration which began as soon as we were ready.\n\nFather Principal gave a short speech on the Fallen Soldiers of the Great World War, etc.\n\nWhen all was over we went to the home of Mr. and Mrs. Clark for dinner. We left there about three o'clock. We went to the store, Father bought some souvenirs and other things to take home with us.\n\nWe enjoyed our trip very much indeed. Now we are trying to do our very best because we might have other chances again.\n\nThree cheers for Father Principal who does so much to please us in everything.\n\nEdna Carlson,\nGrade 8.\n\nA Visit to my Home.\n\nDuring the holidays, Father was called to visit the sick.\n\nHe took a few children who lived near these people, and while he went to see the sick, we visited our parents for a short time.\n\nI was very glad to have the chance of seeing my home, even though the time was so short.\n\nOn our way back Father bought some candy and oranges for us to eat on our way home.\n\nMany thanks to our dear Father Principal.\n\nEdward Wilfer,\nGrade 8.\nIn the afternoon of the feast of the Immaculate Conception, we went to help our teacher that afternoon. We had a big game of hockey. The game was very exciting. When it was over, the bell rang.\n\nWe were all in our places waiting for the Fathers and Sisters to come. We sang a song when they came into the garden behind. We sang your and then to English, French and Irish tunes. The Fathers sang a song to give too. They came singing, the place where we had plenty of fun and everyone enjoyed something nice.\n\nAfter lunch was over we sang a last song which I suppose you all know. The words, aren't:\n\nBonnie Harris & Agnes Walter\nGrades 7 & 5.\n\nThis year, we had our retreat in December. It lasted three days and ended on the eleventh. The Feast of the Immaculate Conception was proclaimed by Reverend Father Guiltier, who is a missionary here. We had an invocation twice a day. It was very interesting.\n\nIs one of our great feasts. Sister made a grotto like the one where the Blessed Virgin appeared to little Bernadette at Lourdes in France. It was decorated with small pink flowers here and there in the two grottos.\n\nAfter the High Mass one of the seniors and girls, wearing a long white veil went and knelt near the altar of the Blessed Virgin and read a Consecration in the name of all the pupils of the school.\n\nThe Benediction took place after this consecration.\n\nEleanor Carlson,\nGrade 8.\nFather Green to Edmonton:\nWe are always interested to know what Father Green does. We watch anxiously when he comes back from his trip. We are very excited when we see the truck coming. Look at all kinds of big bundles all tied up with bows and ribbons.\n\nIn the early part of December he went out with lots of things. We saw some of the things brought back. We also saw a large toboggan for the little boys, hockey sticks, sweaters for the players and nice warm boots. He cannot thank him enough.\n\nRodger Balder\nGrade 7\n\nFree Entrance:\n\nDuring our Christmas holidays our director had the kindness to open a room where we had many games such as checkers, cards, shuffling boards, etc. We played games like Monopoly, etc. When we could enjoy ourselves we would go there where luck we liked to play.\n\nJoseph Gaakalat\nGrade XII\n\nNew Shed for the Big Girls:\n\nA few weeks ago Brother Germain made us a nice double runner. It is made like an automobile for the front. It has a hood like over the engine. The front lights (two) are painted a bright red. The back is all painted a bright red. We put it down the gliding board. How can we be unhappy with so many people interested in our behalf? We also made new smaller ones for the little girls. This was nice. So nice that a few of the boys who are 4\u00bd stopped to enjoy our luck of having it, but I'm sure they have asked which we haven't got. I think we are about even.\n\nRosa Jacky\nGrade 7\nAnother Visit from Santa Claus.\n\nThis year Santa Claus came to see us two times. He came on Christmas Day as usual, for we knew he was likely five miles from the station and as the roads were very bad, he could not reach our school on Christmas Eve as he does in most other places.\n\nOn Jan. second, a few minutes after supper, Sister came into our recreation room. She seemed to be in a great hurry and told us to take our own places for we were sure to have a visitor.\n\nIn a jiffy we were ready, overall taken off and we put on our red sweaters. A few of the boys here have new shoes, pants, mitts or rubber boots.\n\nThen as Slater opened the door, I heard the authors coming down the stairs. They were talking to someone who said, he had been driven back by the snowstorms, that his airplane could not go any further, he also said that he wished to see the boys of this school once more, around the next morning if the storm stopped.\n\nSo our great surprise. Father Principal walked in with Santa Claus accompanied by two other strangers whom we didn't know. They carried big bags. Santa Claus didn't talk very much, he seemed to have a cold, because he made many stops and talked very softly. I don't know what language the other two spoke, but they make signs too and shook hands very long with the boys when they gave us some things.\n\nThe Little Boys' Hockey Game.\n\nOne afternoon the little boys had a hockey game on our rink. They took their hockey sticks, skates, and went down the hill to the lake. We big boys didn't skate but watched the little ones playing. They even used our puck, it was a little too heavy for them to shoot. It was funny to look at them, some could barely stand on their skates. When the whistle blew for them to get ready, they all went to their places. Sure as soon as they touched the puck fell down. One of the goalies seeing the puck flying to him, seemed to close his eyes and wave his hand to catch the puck, but missed it. He cheered and laughed and the little fellow began to cry so another goalie replaced him.\n\nOne of the defense men was a little fellow who didn't seem to care about catching the puck, was just standing there looking at his skaters, when somebody got the puck and hit him on the leg. This woke him up and he started the chase. The score at the end was three to two.\n\nGrade 7.\nOn Christmas Day, in the afternoon we had benediction, after which we all gathered in the classroom where we had been charged into an arrangement that by opening the folding doors, which serve as a hall during school time.\n\nWell, Mr. Rev. Father Provincial, Sisters, brothers, the Chief with many of our parents. The room was crowded and noisy but so still in the hall.\n\nSanta Claus was accompanied by two boys, the seniors who took the gifts from the tree and gave them to him. He then gave them to the happy people who shook hands with each other.\n\nFather Provincial, whom he met there for the first time, with Father Principal he shook hands as though they were old friends, and happy to meet again. But he seemed more than pleased to meet Mr. and Mrs. Ouellette. Can you guess why? Santa Claus was very funny this year; he made us laugh very much. Many times he made fun with our toys. When the little girls received a doll, he made believe to put it asleep or wake it up. Walk, if a boy received a gun, he tried to shoot etc.\n\nWe received many beautiful gifts even Rev. Father Provincial who had arrived only the night before, had not been forgotten by him, and Santa Claus greeted him first and gave him a nice gift.\n\nSimeon Bighead,\nGrade 5.\nDuring Advent, we were preparing for the coming of Jesus in our hearts by doing our best at every thing at this time. We made our little sacrifices by Sister Harris. Every day we had five minutes to write them down.\n\nSister also helped us by putting up a list of different kinds of sacrifices for each day. In our recreation room, sometimes at night, at prayer time, she would remind us of what we had to do, and would even help us to make some.\n\nThen on Christmas Day, as we gathered for the Christmas Tree, a Cradle had been put up on the middle of the stage and our sacrifices were put in a tin box in front of the Cradle to be burnt as our offerings and gifts to the Divine Infant.\n\nWe were very happy to have such a gift for Him, to show that we knew that Christmas is first of all His Feast, and on that day not only those who receive presents but also those who give them. Sometimes it makes us happier to give than to receive.\n\nRosa Harris\nGrade 7\n\nA Little Fun\n\nDuring the holidays, we went to get the clothes from the Sisters outside, hiding last night with one of our friends. After we had finished and were coming back, Mr. Lorraine, our baker, happened to be building wood for the bakery.\n\nWe asked him to give us a ride on his telegram. To please him, he agreed, but so not on his sled.\n\nHe was standing on it when he pulled quickly with such a jerk that we both fell to the ground, without being hurt.\n\nAfter having put away the clothes, plus, we went to offer ourselves to bring in the wood for him.\n\nWhen we were through with the job, Sister called us to reward us with ice cream.\n\nThat a good surprise it was for us.\n\nMary Hart,\nGrade 4\nVisitors at our card party.\n\nWhile we were playing cards, on Jan. sixth, we were very surprised to see the curtains open on the stage. At one end of it had been prepared a Crib of the Infant Jesus. It was in a great big rock. In the Crib were also the Blessing Virgin and St. Joseph kneeling near Him. We saw the three wise kings coming from the east. They were clad in silks and very rich. Sarvovich Zing went to the Child in the manner to offer their gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. Then they disappeared after having knelt in adoration for a few minutes.\n\nAlec Harner, Grade 6.\n\nNow I Missed my School days.\n\nDear readers, I would like to tell you how and why I missed many of my school days and I am very sorry I was forced to do so on account of an operation I had last summer.\n\nDuring vacation my sister and I went to Elk Point with my mother to see the doctor. We went by train, and as soon as we got there we went to his house, he examined both of us, here, he all went to the hospital where we had an operation. I was put to sleep, and I didn't feel anything; but my sister could not be put to sleep, so she didn't have so much trouble as I did afterwards.\n\nWe stayed in the hospital for ten days, then went back home. We were very glad to be back home now.\n\nGrade 5.\n\nStarting Time.\n\nSome of the older boys of the school have been allowed to get shares for rabbits during the Christmas holidays. The rabbits which we caught were given to our master to take home. Many boys caught five or six but I myself had the good luck of catching only one.\n\nThe last day of our holiday time was up, so I took up our shares for sharing time was up. We were very sorry, and only wished we could be allowed to keep up for there's so much fun better way to share.\n\nAlec Harner.\nA Sleighride.\n\nOne of my sister's friends who lives at the school, and my sister wanted to go for a ride one afternoon, so they asked me to drive for them. I was very glad to do so. I harnessed the horse and took them for a ride in the sleigh. When I came back I took my mother a one of the Sisters came along too. We did not go very far, about a mile, out on the reserve. It was a beautiful afternoon, and we enjoyed it very much.\n\nArrived Oneillette,\nGrade 6.\n\nJoseph Swan,\nGrade 6.\n\nWhist Party.\n\nJanuary the sixth, Sister told us to come to have a whist party that night. After dinner we went to the dormitory to put on our Sunday clothes where the tables were set up for the reception from where our places. The fathers and Sisters were invited also. The party began by a song by the smaller boys. Then we played cards for a while. We didn't change place once because we thought he would pass the next table so the lucky winners would pass the next table. Many tricks were going on so the lucky winners and we enjoyed ourselves very much.\n\nThe first prize was given to one of the boys, but the second prize was given to Joseph Swan & George Smith. Grade 6.\n\nKings Oak.\n\nI am sure you will like to know who had the bean and the pea that had been placed in our cakes on Jan. the 6th. Every boy and girl was anxious to have it. Well, little Nest found the bean and Charlie Waskewitch had the pea. They were well crowned and decorated during all the evening and we had a good time.\n\nLottie Jackson, Grade III.\nWe enjoyed our holidays very much, especially when we would play cards at night.\n\nThe boys had a real what party on Friday night, Jan. the sixth. We were going to have one too, but as we wanted to have the Sisters come, we postponed it until later. We felt rather jealous of the boys' party.\n\nOur turn came quicker than we expected, for two days later, on Sunday night, we decided to have one in honor of Miss Laliberte, whose birthday we were celebrating.\n\nThe tiny little girls of the baby class presented her a tray filled with nice how pictures, and a little manger with a little Infant Jesus about one and one half inches long.\n\nAll the Sisters, Father, Brothers came. We were very sorry our dear Father Principal was away, for I am sure he would have enjoyed it.\n\nWe thank the kind Sisters for having devoted so much of their time in making our holidays such pleasant ones.\n\nEdna Carlson,\nGrade 8.\n\nAids for Better Conduct.\n\nThis year again we have a crib which our teacher had prepared.\n\nIt is in the right front corner of our classroom; it is very pretty and the little Infant Jesus seems to be very much at home. He seems to invite us to be more pious, obedient, humble etc., although we wish to have all those virtues, our success is not always very bright, but we have the pleasure of having tried. We pray Him to make us better.\n\nJoanne Paddy & Victoria Chocon,\nGrade 4.\nOUR NEW INSPECTOR.\n\nUsually they say that the thirteenth is an unlucky day, but the thirteenth of December was not unlucky this year, for on that day we met our new school inspector for the first time. We used to have Mr. Wilson for our inspector, and we liked him very much. When he went away, Mr. Gilles came. He was so kind and pleasant that we were very sorry when we heard that he was going to Peace River or that we could have a new Inspector again. But Mr. Stehelin made us kind of shy and nervous. He gave us many tests to see how Indian and Half-Breed children compare with white children. He stayed in our room all afternoon, then the next day he visited the other classes, but after school he came into our room again before we were dismissed, so Sister had us sing and play our Rhythm Band. Mr. Stehelin said he had heard many Rhythm Bands, but ours was as good as any of those he had heard in big places. He was so nice at this last visit that we were sorry when it was time for us to go. The next time he comes, maybe we won't feel so shy with him.\n\nGeorge Fraser-Victor Twin. Gr.6.\n\nA GRAND CHRISTMAS SEASON.\n\nHow glad we are when it is time to start decorating for Christmas! We love the smell of the Christmas trees. This year our class looked nicer than ever, because we seemed to know how to decorate better and Sister had received some nice things from Sister Noreen from Vancouver which made our walls look so nice. The last two days before the holidays began, the pupils would bring a gift and put it under the tree near Sister's desk.\n\nThen at last we had the Gift Exchange. Each year, we put our names on a little slip of paper and put them in a box. Next, each pupil draws a name, and the name he gets is the one he must get a present for. Sometimes, it is very funny for we like to play tricks on one another. This year, everyone was jealous when two of the boys got parcels from the kitchen girl because Sr. M. Adelia had let the girls make each a nice little cake, all covered with icing, and some candy, for their parcel. Almost all of us had something nice... and we were all so gay when we went home, after saying Merry Christmas to our teacher.\n\nEdna Prudon.... Grade VII.\nThe Concert.\n\nThe day before the concert, we had the general exercise. For the opening song, Sister wanted to place the biggest pupils right on the stage. When about fifteen of the girls were placed, the stage caved right in. There was a big scream from everybody, because we thought it was an earthquake or something, but when we saw that it was not dangerous, we all started to laugh. It was so funny to see them, especially Sr. M. Thistle, who was with them. They looked so scared. So we had to go through our pieces without the stage that day, but the men came and fixed it up right away.\n\nMargaret Auger - Grade VI.\n\nOn December twenty-third, we had our big concert. Many people came from Emils, High Prairie and other places. The number I enjoyed the most was the Boys' Drill. They marched all together like real soldiers, then Norman Phillips who was dressed like an aviator, came and sang the solo of the boys' song. Everybody cheered, for he is so small to sing such a big song! Everything was nice, but the piece \"The Battle With the Giant\" surprised and pleased everybody. The giant was Ernie Cunningham, who made us laugh each time he came on the stage. Frank Giroux was King, and of course he acted his part very well, even if it was not funny. Another very good actor was Jim Smith, who dressed like a little old woman to play a trick on the giant. But the nicest was the band of little soldiers who played music as they came in to guard the King. The people would clap each time they would come in.\n\nWe had to leave our concert during Ymas break, because many had missed it, and many others wanted to come and see it again. Bishop Langlois and Father Felton both talked to the people afterwards, and said that they thought it was one of the nicest programs we have had, we enjoyed it too.\n\nSimonne Dubreuil - Grade VII.\n\nNOEL! NOEL! NOEL!\n\nWe had gone to bed early on Christmas Eve. All were dreaming of happy things, when suddenly we woke up hearing some singing and violins. Those who had never been here before could not understand what it was, and I guess they thought it was the Christmas angels who thought around was Bethlehem.\nBut I knew what it was, because every year the Sisters always come and wake us up for \"midnight Mass by singing a Christmas hymn before the lights are on. It makes us feel like Christmas. Before going to Church, the singers went to drink something hot.\n\nThe Church looked so nice, with its nice crib and all the lights and decorations. Bishop Longlois sang Pontifical High Mass. Rev. Fr. Plhor was Deacon, while Fr. Giroux was Sub-Deacon. There were eighteen boys serving, but we did not get mixed up because Brother Paquette, Master of Ceremonies, and Henry Thomas were there to take care of us. Everybody enjoyed hearing the Bishop when he preached in English and in French. Father Falher preached well too in Cree. After the first Mass, Bishop Longlois gave us another special Benediction in the name of Pope Pius XI.\n\nRoy Smith - Grade VI.\n\nThis year we got our toys on Christmas morning. When we came to breakfast, our presents were at our places on the table. We were just so glad and excited! We had such nice toys and games from our kind friends at St. Joseph's Academy in Valparaiso, Washington. They like to play Santa Claus, for they have been sending us our toys each year since Sr. Jean is here. We had such a nice breakfast. We are glad Fr. Giroux's hens had laid so many eggs. We could have some for our breakfast. Sister St. Adolphe had the girls make so many good things for us... pies, cakes, and over a thousand doughnuts! After making those, the girls did not need to put rouge on their faces!\n\nPete Gladu - Grade VI.\n\nOn December 25th, at eight o'clock, there was a double wedding in our chapel: Isabel Gladu and Paul Noskeyi; Mary Whitehead and David Lebouche from Whitefish Lake. Sister Jean played \"Here Comes the Bride\" when they marched in, then we sang some Cree hymns. Rev. Father Giroux married them. After Mass, they went to have breakfast at the Fathers' house. We wish these old pupils good luck.\n\nMelba Cardinal - Grade VI.\n\"KISSING DAY.\"\n\nIn Cree, we do not call January first \"New Year's Day,\" we call it \"Kissing Day\" because on that day, we kiss all our relatives and friends to show them that we wish them good luck. This year, there was a terrible blizzard, but that did not stop the people from coming to Mass. After that they all stayed to shake hands with the Sisters, and then they went to wish a happy New Year to the Bishop and the Fathers. Many of the children went to have dinner with their parents.\n\nAt night we all went to the \"Boys' Hall,\" because Bishop Langlois wanted to have a family reunion, as he called it. When the Bishop and Fathers came in, we all clapped, because the Brothers and young Fathers each had a flute, and they were marching and playing as heralds of the Bishop just as Sr. M. Thecle's little soldiers had done for the King in the play. We had a very good time. The Bishop, Fathers and Brothers and even some of the Sisters sang some songs, and we children did our best to act and sing. Then we had a nice treat of candy and peanuts. Don't you think we're lucky children?\n\nLen. Gladu - Grade VI.\n\nKING'S DAY.\n\nEvery year on this day (Jan. 6) we have a special cake with a raisin or button in it. The one who gets the button will be King or Queen. This year the king and queen of the children were Maggie Bussard and Victor Trim. They were about the same size; usually they aren't, and so it is funnier. Maggie was dressed like a queen, and she sat on the throne with the king in the front of the room where everyone could see them. We had a nice little program for them.\n\nThe funniest play was the Mock Wedding. All the actors were boys, but some were dressed like women. Ernie Cunningham got married to Frank Giroux. We all knew that Frank is a real monkey for acting, and he made us laugh so much when he was talking away like a girl with a high voice. Harry Thomas was the Justice of Peace who married them, and at the end, Frank wanted to kiss him, but the Justice wouldn't let him. Before they went out, all of them went and shook hands with...\nthe Bishop and Fathers who laughed so much when they got a good look at the bride and her bridesmaids, for their rouge and powder did not look as if it had been put on by experts.\n\nAfter a very nice evening, we all agreed that this last day of our Christmas tea had been a pleasant one for all.\n\nJulia Dollard - Grade VIII.\n\nA WELCOMING VISITATION IN OUR CLASS.\n\nJust before Harry came's left to go back to College, he paid us a visit in the classroom which he enjoyed very much. After a little teasing, Harry proceeded to playing the piano for us was kept. He played his songs with Sister which he greatly enjoyed. But, I'm surprised he hasn't seen that he sang for us. Most of us had never heard him sing before, but that day he sang the Club Hymn for us, or the \"Way To All The Sweet Home.\" He told us many interesting things about his life at the college which we were glad to hear. He then asked Ellen Brunelle to sing us a song, so she did, but we laughed so much that she got mixed up and had to stop.\n\nHarry stopped in the other classes to say Goodbye to all, and when he got in the Baby Class, Sr. Guy asked him to sing for her pupils, so he sang the \"A B C\" song to make the little ones laugh. Harry was lucky to go to Edmonton that night, for Bishop Langelois went on the same train as he was going to the hospital for treatment.\n\nSimonne Dubreuil - Grade VII... R. Smith - Grade VI.\n\nOTHER PROVINCE'S FEAST.\n\nOn January eighteenth was another Province's feast. It was such a beautiful day out that we were delighted when Sr. Jean Placide said we could celebrate by going for a short walk after the last recess. We girls talked and talked with Sister while the boys ran ahead and did all kinds of foolish things, such as hiding under bridges till we had passed, washing one another's faces, and throwing snowballs when we came back we met Sr. Guy and her pupils, also Sr. M. Theol's sisters. You could tell it was a feast for the Sisters because we saw so many of them out for a walk, or going to visit the sick.\n\nCorin Dosjordiis - Grade VI.\nRADIO FANS.\n\nWe had been telling Sister often that on Jan 25th would be the big fight between Joe Louis and John Henry Lewis, and we were hoping very much that Sister would give us the joy of listening to it. How glad we were when Sister told us that she would bring us to the classroom this night so we could listen in. We came early, and had the best luck, because there was some nice old-time music and cowboy songs which we like so much. Sister kept promising us an old rocking chair, for she does not like cowboy songs and yodeling.\n\nHow excited we were when the fight began! In the afternoon we had bet on the one we thought would win. Most of us wrote Joe Louis to get beaten. Sister laughed right out when she saw Isabel \"glares\" with big tears in her eyes because J.H. Lewis was knocked out! It didn't last long, so we were on time to go to bed with the others.\n\nVictor Bollrome - Grade VI.\n\nDays of Joy.\n\nThree guests who came to visit us two weeks ago? I'm sure you cannot guess, so I'll tell you right away. It was our dear BISHOP GUY! We had such a joyous surprise on the morning of January 27th when we heard that Bishop Guy had arrived from Edmonton the morning with Bishop Longlois. We could hardly wait to have a chance to talk to him. Just like he always did, Bishop Guy came to say Mass for us in our chapel each morning that he was here. It was not hard to sing at those Masses for we were so happy, we wanted to sing.\n\nIt seemed like old times to see him going around, visiting his old home. He knew us all, and had something to say to each one, especially to the little ones who used to be the babies when he was here. It was like seeing a father who has been gone a long time. Bishop Guy left Ground on the 30th of January. He may call it a long visit, but it seemed just like a short peek to me. We all hope that he will come back again soon again, for we never get tired of seeing that jolly smiling face of his.\n\nIt was nice to see out the Bishops walking around the Mission together. We were wishing we could always keep the two of them here with us.\n\nFrank Giroux - Grade VII.\nGREGORIAN SINGING.\n\nSince our holy Father, the Pope has asked that Gregorian chant be sung everywhere, Mr. Langlois bought some books so we could learn it too. We have been practicing in the Boys' Hall ever since Christmas, and we sing all the Benedictions in Gregorian note. Sr. Mary Immaculate had asked the Bishop to come while we were learning some new pieces, but he got sick so he came just last week. We were glad to have him come, and of course everyone tried hard to sing the way he told them to. Bishop said we were learning it very well, we like to hear him sing with us in the chapel; we all try harder then. I don't sing, but I like him and singing better than the old way, and there are many others who like it too. The singers are all anxious for Mr. Langlois to come to another singing exercise in the hall.\n\nAlfred Thibeault - Grade V.\n\nOUR LANGUAGE.\n\nOne of the things that Bishop Langlois wants us to do is to pray in our own language. So Father Salter translated all the Mass prayers, the Angelus, and the Divine Praises into Cree, and then he, with Father Tondier and Father Naphin, taught us all these prayers. We appreciate their kindness, for it was much work for them. The Bishop, Fathers' Brothers, and Sisters pray in Cree with us, and most of them are learning to speak Cree too. We like to speak in our own language, although many of us cannot talk it well.\n\nI am sure many of the people who read the \"Echoes\" have never seen Cree written in letters or in characters. Everyone says our words are very long. Here are the Divine Praises:\n\nPitane mamitchimit kisemanitow.\nPitane mivoyitchikateyik oniyomin.\nPitane mamitchimit Jesus Christ esi manitoriit mine esii\nayisilyinimit tegno.\nPitane mivoyitchikateyik Jesus owiyorin.\nPitane mamitchimit Jesus owiyorin.\nPitane mamitchimit Jesus ayinihoesakonowin'k.\nPitane mamitchimit kitchitew Marie Kisemanitowa wekwimikut-\nPitano manitoiyitkaniyik Marie okanatchisyisiyiniwiniwin ka kitchitrayik.\nPitano niwayitshiketoyik Marie oniyowin wekwemit kisik mitohimstihii kometehkwekut.\nPitano manitohimit kitchitew Joseph ka ki wikimat kometehkamayit keteinu.\nPitano manitohimit akamoniito okisikonok mine o kitchitewisinan.\n\nDo you think you could read it? The characters are very easy to learn, because they are all sounds. Many of the older Indians know how to read and write just in Cree signs.\n\nIrene Ward - Grade VI.\nNEW CREE STUDENTS.\n\nFather Falter is a very busy teacher again, because he has two more new pupils for his Cree classes. They are Rev. Fr. Hegar, O.M.I., and Rev. Fr. Klein, O.M.I., of Freidenstahl. They came about a week ago and started to study right away. We hope they will like Grouard. It is nice to see so many Fathers here again.\n\nGerard Thibault - Grade VI.\n\nSICKNESS.\n\nJanuary was a bad month for it brought much sickness. Bishop Langlois got sick right after New Years, so he went to Edmonton for about six weeks. He is home again and is better now. Our little boy, Francis Johnson, and two of our little girls, Louise Chalifoux and Mith Legrand, had to go to the hospital at High Prairie. Louise and Francis came back, but Faith is still there. Then Sister Victoire and Sister Rose Germaine got sick and went to the Mohawkian Hospital. We were glad that Sr. Rose Germaine could not come back at the same time as Sr. Victoire. We hope she will soon be better. Sister Ray is taking her place at the Boys'.\n\nFather Giroux is having his turn of sickness now. He was very sick so they were going to take him to the hospital in Edmonton. The roads were very bad, and there was a big storm. They went part of the way in the bus, part of the way in the car, and then in the snow-plow, but they missed the train, so they took Father to the hospital in High Prairie. We are praying that he will soon get better and come back to Grouard.\n\nMargaret Fraser - Grade IV.\n\nOUR SEWING CLASSES.\n\nThis year we are having some interesting sewing. Our sewing teacher is Sr. M. Isabella. Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, Sister holds the circle of the big class and shows us how to sew and to knit. We all know how to knit stockings, mittens, caps and sweaters, but Sister is an expert at knitting and she is showing us how to knit sweater, little dresses and other pretty things. We are all so anxious to learn. We will send some of our sewing and other work to the Indian Exhibit in Calgary; that's why we are doing our best. On those\nsame afternoons, Sr. M. Ambrose teaches the big girls who do not go to school how to make moccasins, gloves, and other Indian work. Sister Superior is much interested in our work, and does all she can to help us out. We will be glad to know how to make all these things later on.\n\nLeni Gladu - Grade VI.\n\nMANUAL TRAINING CLASSES:\n\nThe big boys have a chance to learn how to make many things this year. Two afternoons a week, we go to the shop and there Brother Michel shows us many things. Joe Bottle who is a good carpenter, is there too to help Brother. We have all learned how to plane wood already, and now we are going to learn how to make snow-shoes, sleighs, and many other useful things. It is Father Falher who got this class for us, and we thank him very much. We hope he will like the things we make. He said we would soon have some tools from the Government so we can each have our own place and things to work with.\n\nErnie Cunningham - Grade IV.\n\nOUR OLD PUPILS:\n\nWe are always happy to hear from the old pupils, and we are sure all those who used to be in Grouard will be glad to read what has happened to some of their old friends.\n\nAt Christmas time, we heard that Harry Gregory had had an accident while he was working. A tree branch hit him in the eye. After being in the Dawson Creek hospital for a while he was advised to go to Edmonton if he did not want to lose the eye. He was to go to the Mission Hospital, but we have not heard since how he is getting along. Charles Gregg is getting along all right at the Shishka for the Deaf.\n\nWe have heard twice from George and Donat Fovargue. Don said he had a grand trip crossing the Atlantic, but George was sick most of the time. They are enjoying England so much that they will not come back to Canada for at least seven years, for they have joined the Royal Air Force. Don will go in for engineering, but George will take up Wireless.\n\nLeo Dufresne is still working near Edmonton. He came home for Xmas, but went back about the same time as Harry and Nan Thomas, after enjoying their holidays at Grouard.\nJanet Collins, who is District Nurse at Athabasca, wrote a very interesting letter to the Sister last week. Sister Jean read it to Janet and she went to Calgary in an airplane to take two patients to the hospital, and later on, she went out by trail with the policeman to take some prisoners to Edmonton.\n\nSister received a very interesting letter from Evelyn Polton, our first Club secretory, who is in Montreal with her family, and she will get married with a German-Scotch in April.\n\nSam Miller and Jimmy Thomas write sometimes. Both seem to be doing good work up in northern B.C.\n\nThe marriage of Elmores Shaw and John Edward Cunningham is announced for next week, also another of our former pupils: Charles Jenkins, who is to be married to Lona Anderson. I wonder if someone will give Charles an alarm clock for a wedding present?\n\nHelen Miller - Grade VIII.\n\nDEATH OF OUR HOLY FATHER.\n\nLast Thursday night, my sister and I were listening to the radio. At nine o'clock, they said that our Holy Father the Pope was sleeping but that two male nurses and a doctor were staying up with him all night. Then at nine-thirty, they announced that our Holy Father had just died. We were sure nobody had heard the news at the Mission, so my brother-in-law came over and told Father rather the sad news.\n\nThe next morning before Mass, the Bishop told the Sisters and children the sad news and asked everybody to pray for the repose of the soul of the \"Pope of the Missions\". This morning, at nine o'clock, we had a High Requiem Mass for the Pope. The chapel was all in black. There was a black coffin in the front of the chapel with a white mitre on it, to make us think it was the Pope who is dead. Rev. Father Floch sang the Mass, assisted by Rev. Father Naphin and Mr. Tessier. We are anxious to know who our new Pope will be.\n\nAnnie Thomas - Grade VIII.\nPope Pius XI\n\nWe wish to express our grief in written word and join the entire Christian world in mourning the passing of Christ's Vicar on earth, Pope Pius XI. He died at the age of 81, on Fri., Feb. 10, two days before the 17th anniversary of his coronation as the 261st successor of St. Peter.\n\nIt is indeed a worthy action to record the last words he whispered during the final moments of his life: \"St. Theresa of the Infant Jesus is near us. God is merciful... May His Divine Will be done... Peace! Peace!\"\n\nHow very well this reminds us that to last minute of his long career, as leader of the Holy Catholic Church, he has striven above all to restore peace to the world which so greatly needs it! He offered himself as a victim so that the world might return to God and thus be saved. Let us follow his noble example by continuing to invoke Pope Pius XI's favorite St. Theresa for peace in the world, peace in the family and peace within our souls.\n\nBut to us, Pius XI will always be remembered as the Pope of the Missions. More than any other Pope, he has devoted time and work to the progress of the Missions throughout the world. From 1932 to 1939, 6,000,000 pagans have been brought within the folds of the Holy Catholic Church. During the last 3 years only, the number of annual conversions in the Missions has risen to nearly half a million souls.\n\nLet us thank Heaven for having given all the Missions an able Protector and let us pray that God may grant him Eternal Happiness, which he so often preached to his millions of followers to be the only Reward that is really worth striving for.\n\nMontas\nLent \u2014\u2014\n\nWe have now entered the season of Lent. As we all know it has been established by the Catholic Church as a time for penance. Therefore, we are not alone in our efforts to repent our sins. So let us consider that since all of us can be called sinners, we must remember that Christ came into this world to save our souls by his sufferings and death. In return, he demands that our sins be expiated by Penance.\n\nTherefore, if we wish to obtain the Eternal Reward set aside for the just and avoid the Everlasting Punishment due to sinners, let us do our share towards expiating our sins.\n\nSurely, we have grave sins to expiate; others just vented shall never see them. They reveal us to make sure that we shall escape them fully and most generously. Give us the supreme example of love. Let us return love for love in sentiments of true contrition, firm purpose of betterment and generous sacrifice.\n\nBy therefore making good use of this time of Lent prepared to enter Eternal Happiness without having to pass by the purifying fires of Purgatory.\n\nHoly Scripture gives this to remember and let us not forget it:\n\n\"In all thy works remember thy last end, and thou shalt never sin.\" (Ecclus. VII, 40)\n\nMonte's\n\nHere and There\n\nOn Feb. 18th, Solemn Mass of the Holy Ghost was sung in the M'st Church for the repose of the soul of our Holy Father.\n\nRoquiem was sung in the M'st Church for the repose of the soul of our Holy Father.\nLOOK OUT!... \"SCHOOL SECTION\"\n\nNot having our kind Archbishop's letter on hand for the Jan. issue we did not mention its reception because we wished all our readers to enjoy its contents.\n\nAlthough our grateful sentiments have already reached him through Sophie Nepocs' letter, we want our Moccasin News to express publicly our most sincere and grateful thanks.\n\nNor judge by yourself how interested he is in all Indian activities:\n\nMy Dear Children:\n\nI just want to wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.\n\nI hope you have all been well this year, good health is one of the things I wish you for next year. Money and such things are not worth half so much as good health.\n\nI suppose you are all wishing one another a happy new year. I hope you mean it; and that you will really try to make one another happy in every way you can. There are so many ways in which we can make others happy; and we would be mean if we did not use them.\n\nThink how happy our parents and teachers are when they know that we are making good use of the chances we have to get a good education. And your chances, my dear children, are better than those that most people have. It could be too bad then, if you did not learn something every day that would help you to be better men and women after you grow up, better farmers, better citizens, better to love and help one another. These are some of the things that you should be doing at school; and we feel sorry when we hear that you did not make good use of your time.\n\nPraying God to bless all the boys and girls, as well as their kind teachers,\n\nI remain,\n\nSincerely in the Lord,\n\nSigned: J.H. Macdonald\n\nArchbishop of Edmonton.\n\nR.I.P.\n\nOn Feb. the 13th in the Church, Rev. Father Moulin sang a High Mass for the repose of the soul of our Holy Father, Pope Pius XI, who are all sorry, because he was the Pope of the missions and has helped a great deal in the conversion of souls by having many missionaries in far off countries. He also was the Pope of Peace having given his life for this purpose, we ardently hope that God will not permit any \"World War\".\n\nMary Jane Gedin\u2014Gr.5\n\nLENT\n\n| No | candies |\n|----|---------|\n|    | for me  |\n\nOn Ash Wed., Sister N.de G. reminded us that Lent was starting, and that we were obliged to do penance for our sins. The grown-up people have to fast, but the children are not obliged, so we must make sacrifices instead. We all took a good resolution and all made our little chart as the one I drew. All our class is trying to keep their own resolution, but if we happen to miss, we mark the number of times and start over the next day.\n\nSophie Nepocs\u2014Gr.6\nFather Provincial's Visit\n\nOn Feb. the 26th, Rev. Father Routhier, Provincial of the Oblate Fathers came and stayed with us for 2 days. All were very glad to see him with Father Lebrun who is the Provincial Visitor. Monday morning he visited the class rooms and questioned us in our Catechism; he tried to puzzle us, we hid our best although we did not speak very loud. After his little test he spoke kind words to us. We all would have liked to hear him longer because he was very interesting. All hope he will come back and give us a long talk on the training of our character.\n\nCeline T. Rabbit\u2014Gr. 6\n\n---\n\nA SMILE\n\nA smile is such a little thing\nAnd yet it means so much.....\nAnd those whose way is rough and steep\nWould miss its magic touch.\n\n'Tis like a tonic to the sick,\nAnd sunshine to the sad,\nSo scatter smiles along the miles,\nTo make the old world glad.\n\n---\n\nAnother Surprise\n\nLast Monday while we were all working at our Enterprise, we heard a knock at the door. Mr. Schmidt, Colonel Lewis and Father Pratt came in. They were visiting the School, but our kind Inspector, Mr. Schmidt spoke to us, asked us a few questions about our Trip and congratulated us for this good idea as well as for our Moccasin News. We then asked him to speak in Cree. This he did willingly and made us laugh with a good joke, but he does not want us to publish his \"New Dictionary\".......we thank him for his nice visit and hope to see him again soon.\n\nMary Jane Godin\u2014Gr. 5\n\n---\n\nOperation\n\nGrade One Pupils all feel sorry because their teacher, Sister Am\u00e9d\u00e9e de Savoie, feeling sick since a week or so, was finally brought to the Edmonton Misericordia Hospital. About a day or two after, we heard that she had been operated. Sister Superior who came back on Sunday, gave us good news about her, and all seemed to be going on fine, but Sister, during the singing period told us that Sister, in Edmonton, was feeling so good and asked us a few sacrifices so she would get better. We hope she'll pull through and come back with us again. So we are praying for her fast cure.\n\nSophie Lapois\u2014Gr. 6\n\n---\n\nCleaning...cleaning....\n\nDuring the last week of Feb., we were three working in the kitchen; Alice MacKanaw, Isabelle Bull and I. When we had finished cooking our meals, we washed the wall, cupboards, windows and floor, because Sr. Louise-Marguerite, who was the cook, since Sept., is going to change job. There is another Sister from the East who will replace her, she will find the kitchen nice and clean and we hope she will be as good a cook as Sister Louise-Marguerite was.\n\nHelen Gutknife\u2014Gr. 5\n\n---\n\nLots of Wood\n\nThe Indians have been working hard since a week. The wood yard is blocked with wood they have sold to the School. I have counted up to twenty-five loads one day. Just now they are hauling gravel for the School's new building. I am anxious to see the carpenters start.\n\nJoe Shortback\u2014Gr. 4\nOne day Father Pratt went to Edmonton while he was gone a big snowstorm came up and blocked the roads. When he came back with Father Molin he was unable to pass. The car was stuck between George Field's house and the School. So Father Molin walked up to the School and asked Mr. Erroll and a few boys to go and help. We worked quite hard and came back all wet. Just look at us.\n\nRadio Television\n\nHaving finished Problem 2 in our enterprise we thought of celebrating St Valentine's Day by a radio to television program. We had our own broadcasting station - L.R.S. Alex Simon was the announcer. He and others gave a series of talks about different topics while the rest of the pupils represented different things about Pioneer life. But a real radio casting which Joe Wolfe borrowed from his home had made \"enthusiastic\" service to little the speakers who had the chance of speaking through a real loud speaker which we had purchased from an old gramophone. While preparing this program we asked the audience to let us know what they thought of it, but the compliments are so nice I don't dare mention them here.\n\nA Surprise\n\nAt the beginning of Feb. Father Pratt pleased with the School's library. They took 19 boys to see very interesting pictures. We were very glad when we came back to School. Father Pratt paid for our entry fee and taking Mr. Frank Doll, M.R., Hill Penski to drive us over.\n\nSnow Flight\n\nOn Feb. the party had a snow-ball fight. One side was Canada, the other side was England. One flight started at 2 o'clock. Alex Simon was the captain for Canada. Charlie Johnson for England. It was very cold. It was very fun.\nOur teacher is sickly. Missy Cooesaw\n\nWe are very sorry, Throfingers.\n\nWe prayed for he Eastside Negroes.\n\nWe went to read for Gr. 34567.\n\nOur lesson was \"Peter Rabbit.\"\n\nI was Peter Rabbit.\n\nI had long orange ears.\n\nI was Bunny Rabbit.\n\nI had yellow ears.\n\nI was White Rabbit.\n\nI had green ears.\n\nI was Bobtail.\n\nMy ears were purple.\n\nOur teacher now is Sister Fran\u00e7oise de Lisieux, White Bear.\n\nIn a few days, Mr. Foureyes will take the nice tickets from Mr. Trutch who helped us a lot. We bought our tickets. It took lots of money because we are class one. Each one has his own cabin and a first class seat. Maybe we'll get sea-sick but I hope this does not happen to us because it's only an imagination trip.\n\nGeorge Foureyes\u2014Gr. 5\nOur Rejoicing Day\n\nOn Shrove Tuesday we played \"Lotto\" and he all tried to place the ball in the right place. Lot very many had it, but I put mine on the nose. We had lots of fun that day.\n\nYvonne Dier---Gr.2\n\nLast Sunday all the girls who had good marks played Bingo. In my picture you see the sister at the end of the table. Her name is Miss Anna Verna. She had lots of prizes. Ro bad, I did not get any.\n\nAnnette Brown---Gr.2\n\nWhat I Would Like\n\nOn Tuesday night Father Pratt gave some movies. I laughed very much. I saw my picture during the show. Father Levert took it when it was Starlight on the Carson Reserve. I like to play hockey, but I like the skis also. Maybe when I am big I will try them.\n\nPeter Farris---Gr.2\n\nHockey Game\n\nAll the little boys went to the village to play hockey. I tried to be good, but I had to stay here with some little girls. I am not glad. Next time I want to go.\n\nRobert Burttall---Gr.2\n\nToo bad...\n\nOn Thursday mornings when the girls are darning the stockings, we go in the woods to hunt rabbits with Mr. Frosti. Nor we all have our snare and go has a pretty little rabbit. So after setting rabbit and go for an ordinary hare. So after setting our snare we came back to named George F. and Alex S.\n\nE.A.C.---Grade 6\n\nTo Each His Own...\n\nWe enjoy the bright sun; but those last few days he has been too kind. Our skating rink was very nice and we were having lots of fun. Last year we were sorry and ready to see lots of rain. This year the yard is full of snow and we had our skating rink. We hope it will last until the flood early in the morning.\n\nCharlie Housting---Gr.5\n\nDoctor's Advice\n\nDoctors say I won't want to the stable and helped not very long ago. When I started the cow tried to kick me. I tried to hold its leg very hard, but she sat right on me. I did not get badly hurt, but the doctor came to see me. He said: Next time don't let the cow sit on you, but you sit on her.\n\n(W. Standing on the R.)\nOur Sister...\n\nI suppose you all heard that Lancy Lightnin' two years ago came to us to become a Sister. In the first year she did become one by making her vows. Her name is now Sister Florence. I hope she will be a good Sister and contribute all her skills among the Indians to the school children. Congratulations to her and wish her a happy and long life among the Indians in Hoboken.\n\nColling T. Rabbitt\u2014Gr. 6\n\nNote: FILM\n\nI think we have already spoken about Father Pratt's new film he recorded from our school. A week ago we saw a good portion of the film featuring us doing ski and other winter sports. I'd like to know if anyone else has seen it? We will be going back soon to show it to others. Remember to clean him once more for his kindness. Mary Jane Godin.\n\nOne day we were practicing a little chorus which we like to sing in two parts. Here are the words:\n\nRow, row, row your boat,\nGently down the stream,\nMerrily, merrily, merrily,\nLife is but a dream.\n\nWe were doing our best. But at the end some voices made mistakes so we stopped ready to start over when we heard the Senior Grades. Gladly they all about they were preparing. Victor Rattlesnake\u2014Gr. 3\n\nFollow It or Not\n\nAs I was talking along with my friend Mary Godin after our work at the Father's house, we heard someone yelling. \"My friend said,\" Listen, there must be a cowboy around here, let's try and find him.\n\nSo we looked around and around when suddenly we saw him near the kitchen. She was singing in her own language. \"Well, it sounded,\" I'm yelling my way back home. We went in, but our appearance frightened her and she ran back to her home.\n\nHattie to Dion\u2014Gr. 6\n\nNew Cook\n\nNo have heard that a new Sister is coming to our school. She is from the Province of Quebec. It must be a great sacrifice for her to leave her family and come far off in the west. We hope she will enjoy her new work because all the Kitchenuh girls will do their best to help her. Mary Jane Petts\u2014Gr. 6\nLaundry work\n\nEvery Monday three or four girls are named to wash at the Laundry for the whole day with Sister St. Emmanuel who is in charge of this department. We each have our tub and wash board in which we wash the stockings underwear and etc., but Beril is there also to supervise all the machines.\n\nWe enjoy our work...and...have the chance of speaking as loud as we wish because the machines make a lot of noise! Helen Whitehouse\u2014Gr. 5\n\nA Gift\n\nJust as we were printing the last page of our Christmas News last January, Ricor, our night watchman went to Edmonton and came back with a nice airplane which his brother had at School. He is all very anxious to see it fly because it is made for that purpose. All we need to do is to put a long and strong elastic just near it so it is hanging up the ceiling. You can come and see it.\n\nJennie Simon\u2014Gr. 5\n\nCoal\n\nWe had so much cold weather that Father Pratt had to buy lots of coal. This year instead of hauling it with the sleighs, they are now going to the School in great big trucks. It is nice to see their green and red lights shining in the dark.\n\nChristina Saddleback\u2014Gr. 4\n\nLet the Edmonton Journal start by telling you about our two last games against outside teams:\n\nIndian School Team Wins\n\nHobema, Bob 3-Indian School Ermines nosed out Hobema Juniors 5-4 in a speedy game played here recently. Joe Wolfe led the attack for the Indian School lads when he scored four times with G. Fouryes with F. Morin and L. Wolfe getting one apiece.\n\nJos. Wolfe scored 3\n\nAs Hobema Tied\n\nHobema Feb. 17\u2014Jos. Wolfe scored three times as he led the Indian School Ermines to a 4-4 tie with the Wetaskiwin Intermediate school team there last Sat. Ermines had to come from behind three times to gain the split.\n\nWetaskiwin scored the first goal, then the score was tied and then Wetaskiwin scored again to lead 2-1 at the end of the first. Ermines tied it up at 3-3 in the second period and then a long shot by E. Martin saved the day for the Indians in the third, after Wetaskiwin had gone in front again.\n\nVenbuzon of Wetaskiwin scored twice with C. Lyons and L. Geir notching the others.\nOne Saturday afternoon all the little boys went to play hockey at the village against the White Boys. We had a lot of fun. At the end of the game we had a tie: 1-1. Our goalie Victor Rattlesnake was good. Victor Guttermouth is the one who made the score.\n\nAnother Saturday, it was the White Boys' turn to come and play against us. This time the game was hot, but Myers Dion, our best player, made 3 scores, while Jack Law only made 1 for his side.\n\nOur last game was a good one too, the score being 4-3. We hope to continue and have as much luck as possible until now.\n\nP.S.: Yellowbird\u2014Gr. 4\n\nA Sincere Appreciation!\n\nOur pee-wee team has been more fortunate than our seniors. They have already chalked up 3 victories.

The whole world now mourns a friend, a protector, a king in the person of our great Pope Pius XI. Throughout the world he is known as the \"Pope of Peace\", for his greatest wish was to maintain peace between nations and individuals.\nA month ago one of our missionaries Father Chatignier received a lovely statue of Our Lady of Lourdes in France. It was sent to him as a present from some of his friends in France.\n\nOur Lady is dressed quite differently from the others. Around her waist she has a girdle instead of a blue sash. Her pure white dress falls down in graceful folds up to her feet. Her shoes are white. A wreath of pink, red, white and yellow roses forms a circle around her. From her hands issue silver rays which represent the graces which she pours over the sinners.\n\nShe is also known as \"Mother all Merciful.\"\n\nOur Lady of Lourdes appeared for the first time to St. Joseph Paquette on the 16th of Feb., 1876. It occurred on Monday night. This young lady had been sick nearly all her life. At her first vision she was told that she would be cured on the following Saturday. It happened just as the Lady had told her. After a few hours all traces of her sickness had disappeared. How astonished were the doctors and all those who had known her.\n\nIf I had more space I would relate to you the fifteen visions she had. In every one of her visits to St. Joseph a secret was revealed or a special mission was confided to her care which she had to tell the world about.\n\nFather Chatignier then distributed scapulars to some children.\n\nI am from Poveshell Reserve. How anxious I am to see the statue in our new church next summer.\n\nLucie Chatignier,\nGrade VII\n\nIMMACULATE CONCEPTION\n\nWhenever I think of the Blessed Virgin I think of little Bernadette. How lucky she was.\n\nLittle Bernadette saw her in a pure white dress and with a long veil while her mantle was of a light blue. Two beautiful roses were resting on her feet. In her arm was a pearl rosary. She was surrounded by a light of wonderful brightness. The vision was so glorious and the blessed Mother's smile so sweet, that little Bernadette who was kneeling below forgot everything else around her. Around the Mother's head were seen the words spoken by her during the vision \"I am the Immaculate Conception\".\n\nWe have therefore chosen December 8th for our patronal feast. The altar had a special decoration of lilies. Our sewing and recreation rooms were decorated in white and sky-blue, the colors of the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\nAt dinner was our usual banquet prepared by the Sisters and some of the older girls.\n\nHow thankful we are to Sister Superior who devotes a part of her time for us, and who never neglects an occasion to please us.\n\nMany thanks also to Rev. Father Principal for the lovely medals of the Blessed Virgin he gave us.\n\nMarie Ad\u00e8le Desrochers,\nGrade VII\n\nOur Midnight Mass\n\nA week before Christmas sister with the help of a few girls decorated the chapel for the coming feast. We were more anxious for Christmas after seeing the lovely decoration.\n\nOn Christmas Eve we all went to bed early. I could not go to sleep for I thought of the midnight mass. At eleven o'clock sister rang the bell for us to get up. There was a little excitement.\nLONG LIVE\nTHE POPES\n\nLong live the Pope!\nHis praises sound\nAgain and yet again\nHis rule is over space & time\nHis throne the hearts of men\nAll hail the Shepherd King of Rome\nThe theme of loving song:\nLet all the earth his glory sing,\nAnd heav'n the strain prolong,\nLet all the earth his glory sing,\nAnd heav'n the strain prolong.\n\nHis signet is the Fisherman's;\nHis scepter does he bear\nIn weak and lowly state\nHe rules from Peter's chair\nAnd yet from every tribe and tongue,\nWhen every clime and zone\nThree hundred million voices sing,\nThe glory of his throne\nThree hundred million voices sing,\nThe glory of his throne.\n\nThen raise the chant with heart and voice\nIn church and school and home\n\"Long live the Shepherd of the Flock!\"\n\"Long live the Pope of Rome!\"\nAlmighty Father, bless his work,\nProtect him in his way\nReceive his prayer, fulfill his hopes\nAnd grant him \"length of days\"\nReceive his prayers, fulfill his hopes\nAnd grant him \"length of days\"\nIndian School Indians battle to a 4-4 overtime draw with Hobson Indians in a speedy hockey game played last Saturday in Ermineskin. The Indians opened the scoring with a burst and had a two-goal lead at the end of the first period. The Squaw tied it up in the second and from there on the Indians never got far ahead. Fifteen minutes of overtime failed to break the tie.\n\nG. I. Beaton scored three of the Indians' goals while G. Bessette netting the other. Scoring honors were split between J. Hofer and G. Pfeifer.\n\nThe Indians are now 1-1-2 while the Squaw is 1-1-3. The Indians have a chance to win their next game against the Squaw.\n\nIn Hobson, the Indians are 1-1-2 while the Squaw is 1-1-3.

They are certainly conducive to giving people a different slant on Indian children's school life and what you people are striving to do for them.\"\n\nFather Lavert, our ex-editor also writes and says:\n\n\"It is always with pleasure that I receive the dear little Moccasin News. As Annie Rooney would say: 'It makes me feel glad all over.' I like your articles and drawings and I am very happy to see that you have kept your interest in your little 'masinahigan'.\"\n\nCompliments from Delmas, Onion Lake, Fort McMurray etc., is it not our fortunate duty to thank you all dear Readers for the keen interest you take in our little paper. If some of you do as Mr. and Mrs. Buehner from Edmonton: Rush at the mail box and try and get the Moccasin News so as to be the first to read it, you can be sure that your encouragement stimulates our \"pep\" and pleases every one of us.\n\nWe promise to continue doing our best. Thanks to all...and...come again!\n\nThe Committee\n\nNice Letters\n\nAt the beginning of this month, some of us were surprised in receiving letters from S. Marie-Ludovic and S.S. Monique. Our old cook told us all kinds of news about her new place. We are glad to hear that they like their new homes and hope to read them soon.\n\nHelen Cutknife\u2014Gr.5\n\nOur Midnight Mass\n\nIf I remember well, we told you in our Xmas Number that we were preparing ourselves to sing a nice mass on Xmas Night. I think we succeeded because our teacher who is quite strict about our way of singing, called all the singers to try their luck at a Bingo Game.\n\nHaving a good friend in the city of Edmonton, Sister was very rich that day because Miss Horban had given her a big box with all kinds of nice presents.\n\nSophie Nepoos was more than lucky; she had 3 prizes. I had done my best at singing, but did not win any. At the next Bingo game, I'll sneak around Sister and whisper the number missing......Do you think I'll have a better chance?...........\n\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se Wolfe\u2014Gr.5\n\nOur Xmas Holidays\n\nI think that we will be obliged to work very hard until the end of June, because our kind Father Pratt gave us a nice long holiday. We thank him very much and promise to do our best, so that in June, when the promotion tests will be here, we will try and pass into a higher grade.\n\nChristina Saddleback\u2014Gr.4\nOur Concert\n\nHow many of our readers enjoyed their holidays preparing the feast to please their friends? Well, this has been our lot at our school this year. As soon as Christmas was over all the girls were rushing here and there getting ready for a concert. Everything got ready on New Year's Eve. They only wanted to amuse themselves but at last all turned out nicely so we invited the Sister and all the boys after seeing our programme cover would you like to know what it contained?\n\n1.

But this year we are changed, but while we are there, Sister Louise Marguerite shows us how to cook our own meals.\n\nFor New Years she had us make some pies. They were real good and all we shed, we had some more Saskatoon pie, prepared exactly the way the Indians prepare them. Heard the boys say they tasted good, so did the girls. So don't hope we will have the chance of making other kinds of pies.\n\nMary Jane Potts, Gr. 6\n\nA.M.I.\n\nOne morning very early, I was awakened by a great noise. I got up and looked outside. What do you see? It was a lighted airplane. It was a lighted airplane. Every day and carries the mail from Edmonton to Lethbridge.\n\nJoseph Shortneck\nTrip to Paris\n\nHere I am to let you know that Alex Simon in his play was going to visit his cousin in Paris. When he arrived there he was surprised to have a big procession of relatives living with this cousin. Just read about their names:\n\n\"Herc is my father... Jimmie Johnson\nMy mother... Mildred Johnson\nMy brother... Lawrence Sooszie\nMy sister... Alice Orton\nMy cousin... Harold Whitefowl\nMy uncle... Simon O'Connell\nMy aunt... Mildred O'Connell\nMy cousin... May... Cowboy Princess\nMy cousin... Jack... Cowboy Prince\n\nThe funny part was to see the boys dressed as girls and who were trying their best to imitate their way of powwowing. I hope we have some more of these stories.\n\nSimon O'Connell\u2014Gr. 4\n\nAn Unpleasant Fall\n\nNot very long ago, one morning in the kitchen, I dropped a big dish of porridge on the floor just as the girls were coming to eat. I suppose this happened because I sometimes get nervous. I began wiping the floor scalding hot, so I thought every thing was OK. So I wait for my mother for minutes. It turned out to be slippery.\n\nBum! All the girls tumbled around and saw nothing nor suspect the floor to be slippery.\n\nGeorge Pitche\u2014Gr. 5\n\nAnother Trip\n\nIt would take too much space to start talking about the \"Trip to Paris\" so I'll tell you about a trip which Mr. Feather Brett and Colonel Lewis promised me. We are all working hard to go to Edmonton and visit the tobacco plant 'cause who wants to talk about it.\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nBelieve it or not.\n\nThere has never been any space for this good joke but we did not forget it. Here it is: \"When the dentist came over last autumn Laura Ball was sitting on the chair ready for her tooth to be pulled out.\" The dentist said: \"When does your tooth hurt?\" \"It hurts only when I chew gum.\" \"Oh! no. It hurts only during your meals?\" \"Well, is it during your meals?\" \"It hurts only when I chew gum.\"\n\nMary Jane Godin\u2014Gr. 5\n\nMovies\n\nLast Sunday Father Pratt gave us a picture show. All the girls did not go. Some did not have enough good notes. They went to bed. I am glad because I went. We laughed very much and we hope to have some more.\n\nJeanette Saddleback\u2014Gr. 3\n\nHide and Go Seek\n\nThere were three playing this game: Joe Lightning, Frank and I. As it was Frank's turn to go he said: \"Let's count up to 100.\" He took his time and in our hiding place could see his feet. We tried to count up to 100, he took his seat again. I took some new and threw it out. It came just in his mouth. We laughed so much that he heard us and found us. Look at him...\n\nAlex Grube\u2014Gr. 4\n\nHard\u2014hearing\n\nOne day all the big girls and boys were asked to go and sing at a funeral. So Sister told the girls to bring the Cree Books. How we have English Hymn Books which have a green ede. So here came Helen Whitebear and Therese with a pile of \"Green Books\". But she didn't say anything. At 3:30 p.m. during the singing period she asked the girls why they had brought the English books? \"Because you told us to take the \"Green Books\". Everybody purred out laughing... even Sister who said she would have the Dr. examine their ears....\"\n\nJimmie Omoseew\u2014Gr. 7\n\nResults...\n\nWe had Xras Tests before enjoying our holidays.

Sister McSweeney gave me a radio program and I heard my sister give me a radio program and I heard only no Bobbinet. It's all day everyone loses me and I don't care what name I get. I could stay near the radio all day and enjoy the beautiful music and learn many Con-Boy songs. Then it's my turn to laugh and tease the others because I can show them more than they can show me.\n\nAllie MacKenzie\u2014Gr.6\n\nOur teacher and the Gr.1 teacher are doing a song for us musical.

We are partying for their cure, because it's no fun to be in bed all day.\n\nCharlie Roasting\u2014Gr. 5\n\nAre you Patient 2?\nLawrence Mackenaw has a good test, and lots of hail. He says that if you can count them all, you're a patient person.\n\nWe want to encourage our Grade 1 companions as well as all the others. If they keep on they might beat the rest of us. Don't you think so?\nA Great Accident\n\nOur little friend Rosie (eyes old) had a doll for Christmas. She was so proud of it that she carried it wherever she went. One day while walking she again had it in her arms; but she was walking with her nose sticking up all of a sudden she dropped it and walked very fast, she didn't have time to stop and so she stepped on it and broke it to pieces. She cried and friends wouldn't play with her dolly. I pity her because I know it's no fun to be without a friend...\n\nHarriette Dion\u2014Gr. 6\n\nLaundry Movies\n\nAll the boys had a party in the laundry. The show began at 7 p.m. Father Pratt gave us movies and besides gave us also some peanuts. We saw a big mountain lion and two men hunting him. They caught him in a trap made of ropes. We also saw many cowboys. This is the part I liked best, because when I'm a big man I want to be a cowboy. We thank Father very much and hope we will have come more movies.\n\nVictor Rattlesnake\u2014Gr. 3\n\nLots of Fun\n\nWhile the boys were having their party in the laundry, we also had lots of fun playing with the nice dolls Santa gave us for Christmas. I made a nice silk dress for mine, a white apron so she will not get dirty, and some stockings so she will not get cold. My friends then came to my house and we had a party. I had a good time. I love my Dolly and will make her some more clothes.\n\nTheresa Linde\u2014Gr. 3\n\nWhat I Heard Best\n\nWhat I liked best during the holidays were the new skates Father Pratt bought for the boys. They are very sharp. I thank him very much. They are very sharp.\n\nGordon Buffalo\u2014Gr. 5\nOUR INTER-UNITAL HOCKEY LEAGUE\n\nOne Sunday during the Xmas holidays Mr. Frotti had the big boys vote for three captains. Joe Wolfe with 10 votes, George Foureyes with 9, George Fiehle with 7 votes, were elected. The new captains then chose their players as well as the names of the teams. Read the list below:\n\n**CANADIANS:** J. Wolfe, L. Boosy, J. Ocketamir, R. Simon, G. Buffalo, S. Yellowbird.\n\n**BLACK HAWKS:** G. Foureyes, A. Simon, L. Mocketanaw, P. Firestone, D. Champs, W. Standing on the Road.\n\n**MAPLE LEAFS:** G. Foureyes, S. Kirraw, C. Roasting, John.\n\nJust now the champions are the Canadians and the \"cellar-dwellers\" are the unfortunate Maple Leafs.\n\n---\n\n**INDIAN SIGNS**\n\nIndians when speaking to those of another tribe used a sign language. In making all kinds of silent words with the hands, the fingers or other parts of the body they understood each other in the pictures above; words have been chosen which need no motions.\n\nAxo... Rest the elbow on the right arm in the left hand. Move arm up and down.\n\nDeer... Hold the hands on both sides of the head and spread out the fingers to represent the antlers.\n\nBlanket... Raise and cross the arms in front of the heart close to the shoulders.\n\nSun... Raise the right hand above the head, with thumb and first finger forming a circle.\n\nTrees... Hold the hand flat and pointing upward on either side of the head.\n\n( This is a lesson we had in our Nature and Language Book. I like these lessons very much because we learn many things about nature. )\n\nWalter White\u2014Gr. 5\n\n---\n\n**HOBBS' TIMORS AND ERNIES DEADLOCKED**\n\nHobbs' Jan. 22.\u2014On Sun. we had a very nice game vs. the White Boys at the end of the 1st period the score was 2-0 in favor of the Ernies. G. Fiehle & J. Wolfe each made a goal.\n\nAt the end of the 2nd period the Ernies were still ahead but the score was 3-2, the Hobbs' J.R. having scored 2 goals. I. Hunt got both of them. G. Fiehle noted the other tally for Ernies.\n\nAt the beginning of the 3rd period the Village Boys tied the score, but soon after J. Wolfe on a solo rush put the Ernies back in the lead.\n\nHowever, I. Frotti ruined our chances of winning by equalizing the count: 4-4.\nDuring a 15 min. period of overtime, both teams failed to find any opening in either goal.\n\nLINEUPS\nHOBEMA JUNIORS: H.Saskatchewan, T.Bonet, M.Bonet, G.Rentz, S.Rentz, G.Bisgus, M.West, G.MacLeod.\nERMINES: L.Mackanaw, C.Roasting, J.Welte, A.Simon, G.Fisher, G.Foureyes, P.Firestone, L.Socsiw, S.O'Kimaw, Jim. Omecser.\nREFEREE: L.H. Protti,\n(Jimmie Omecser)\n\nLOOKING THE GAME OVER\n\nThe Ermines seem quite proud of themselves after skating off the ice with a 4-4 tie. No wonder... they have just experienced the thrill of their very first hockey game against an outside team. As most of them have learned how to play real hockey this year, they naturally felt a bit excited upon jumping on the ice.\n\n1st Period: They were surprised at seeing themselves ahead by a score of 2-0.\n\n2nd Period: This encouraged them during this period to face their visitors with more audacity than precaution and therefore the neat combination plays exhibited in the first stanza lacked and the score turned out to be 3-2 the Ermines holding a single goal ahead.\n\n3rd Period: So confident were they that they threw precaution to the winds and forgot all systematic plays learned during their occasional practices. The Hobema Jrs scored 2 more goals while the Ermines added one more, making the score 4-4.\n\nA 15 min. overtime period did not impress its importance upon them; they played as if they had the whole day to get the goal which would have given them a rightful decision.\n\nSo, considering that the Hobema Jrs. had not practiced together before this game, we think that the Ermines have failed in not getting the winning goal which they could have easily scored had they kept in mind the great importance of teamwork and combination plays.\n\nBut there's time before the next game and the Ermine are going to win........eh! boys.....\n\nCoach\nBLESSED ARE THE DEAD\n\nIt is hard to realize that our dear pastor, Father Falher, has left us never to return. His illness was so brief and so sudden, that Father is dead. But each time we look out of the classroom window towards the cemetery and see the fresh mound there, we know all about his death.\n\nWHO DIE IN THE LORD\n\nOn March 23rd, after school, we were so surprised to hear that Father was very ill, because that morning, he had come to teach the children of his Cree Gethsemane class, and had taught them their Cree lessons all day as usual. At four-thirty that afternoon, he stopped in at the Fathers' kitchen and gave Sr. Joseph Naultie some Cree hymns that he had translated for Sr. Mary A., to teach the children. I was working there with some other girls, and he stopped a minute to tease us. While he was talking, he began to rub his cheek, and he laughed and said, \"Well, isn't it strange? I seem to be talking so querely?\" He left immediately because he felt sick. We didn't know he would never come to the kitchen again.\nOn the way to his room, he met Brother Paquette, and already his tongue was very thick, and Brother had a hard time to understand him... all he could understand was Father Giroux's name. The Fathers sent for Sister Superior and Sr. Marcella right away. He could not speak except by signs, and a few little words. He did not want to go to hospital, so they kept him here and took the best care of him night and day. The Fathers and Brothers took their turns watching by him all the time. But the next day, he was worse, so Fr. Lejole gave him the Last Sacraments and they sent a telegram to Bishop Langlois who was visiting Wabasee.\n\nSimon Dufresne-Lone Gladu\u2014Grade VII.\n\nOur Last Visit to Father Falter.\n\nWhen we knew that Father would not live, our one wish was to see him again, so Sr. Jean Placidus took all of the pupils in our class to see him on Thursday morning. How pitiful it was to see him gasping for breath. We went in small groups and just stayed a minute looking at him in silence. Many people came to see him too. They would kneel down by his bed to pray, and when they'd come out, they'd all be crying, because they knew he was their best friend. Sister took us to the chapel where we said the prayers for the dying. At the same time, the Fathers and Sisters were around him, saying the prayers for the dying, for we expected to hear any moment that he was dead, but no, he lived a day longer. Though Father seemed unconscious, they think he could hear and knew what was going on, for the first days, the Sisters would speak to him, and when they would ask him for his blessing, he would raise his hand and try to make the sign of the cross.\n\nAnnie Thomas\u2014Grade VIII.\n\nDeath on March 18th.\n\nEveryone thought Father would die before the Bishop could get back from his trip to Wabasee, but God heard our prayers, and the Bishop was able to see him before he died. The priests who were with Father Falter said he died very peace-\nfully at half past one on Saturday morning. I guess Father had waited to die on the Blessed Virgin's day.\n\nThat morning at six o'clock, Sister told us that Father Falher was dead. All those who had not intended to go to Mass that morning changed their mind when they heard the sad news, and we all went to hear Mass for him. Still, I can't believe he is dead; it seems like I can still see him coming out from his class with all the children crowding around him, for they liked him so much for their teacher, because he would make them sing Crou hymns and would always have such wonderful stories to make them understand about God. The last time he talked to us in the chapel on the First Friday, he told us he thought he was going to die very soon, maybe before a month, he said. He often used to ask us, \"Children, if you should die right now, would you be ready?\" I hope and pray that I will be ready like he was when it comes my turn to die, and may his soul rest in peace!\n\nEdna Pruden -- Grade VII.\n\nOur Pastor is Laid to Rest.\n\nOn Sunday after Benediction, the body of Father Falher was brought into the Church where many people came to see him and pray. The next day, March 26th, was his funeral. Bishop Langlois sang the High Mass. The Deacon and Sub-Deacon were Frs. Tessier and Klein. Fr. Lalonde was the Assistant Priest, with Frs. Proulx and Jamar as his deacon and Sub-deacon. The whole church was beautifully decorated in black. The Bishop preached in French, while Fr. Troux spoke to the people in Cree. They said many nice things about Fr. Falher which made the people cry.\n\nThe church was crowded with people who had come from all the reserves around. The roads were too bad for the white people to come with their cars, but the Indians came from everywhere in their sleighs or on horseback, or on foot. How\nIN MEMORIAM.\n\nOur precious friend has left this life, In answer to the Master's call,\nHis days of grief and heroic strife are o'er,-He need ne'er fear to fall!\n\nGod was his all. Did he not give \"his heart, his soul, his strength, his will,\nTo Christ, his Love, that he might live in Him? God will His word fulfill.\n\nThree vows still be his journey's fare to heaven, and his burning zeal\nNor souls will free his own from care, And will his priestly mark reveal.\n\nThen will his purest virtues shine, and bathe his soul in beaming light,\n\"A crown of glory shall be thine, thou gallant victor in the fight.\"\n\nThus will the kindly Judge, we pray, Address his humble servant-friend.\nSend thou, O sainted priest, a ray of light, to help us gain our end!\nA Contribution from the Manual Training Instructor.\n\nThe industrial training in the shop for the big boys which started on Feb. 7th, was rather tiresome and tedious work at first, for it was that of planing rough plank but fortunately the eight boys in this class are quite brave and did not get discouraged. They seem to respond to the favor offered them and realize it is not like a picnic or only to be allowed to go out of the common routine for a few hours. It is surely a pleasure to see the boys coming directly from the school house to the shop in a group, not scattered and going to talk here and there, and the same picture is show when they go back after work. We cannot praise them too much for this because this is absolutely necessary for keeping good order and is always an important point. I am sure the boys will also continue their good behaviour in the shop for they show that discipline is a marvel to anybody who wants to learn any kind of work.\n\nThe boys are very grateful to all those who have been instrumental in organizing this class for them, and thank especially Mr. Schmidt who is always so devoted and interested in all the Indian schools of his district. Now I know that the boys will do their very best to prove their gratitude and to show the result of the training they are now receiving.\n\nBrother T. Michel, O.M.I.\n\nDeparture of Rev. Father Naphin, C.S.B.R.\n\nOne day we were very sad, for Father Naphin, our kind Catechism teacher, had to leave us and go back to his mission in Grande Prairie. He had been here since September studying Cree. We liked him very much because he used to know what we liked and would make our Catechism lessons so interesting and jolly. We hope he will come and visit us some time and sing with us again.\n\nGeorge Frager - Grade VI.\nBishop's Visit to Fort Vermillion.\n\nOur new Bishop went to visit Ft. Vermillion for the first time on Feb. 13th. He went by airplane. While he was there he confirmed the policeman who was converted. The people there must have been glad to see the Bishop because he has been here almost a year now. He came back the same week, and he said he had enjoyed his trip to the far-away mission.\n\nBertha Morron - Grade V.\n\nSt. Theresa Club Has a Meeting.\n\nOur last Club meeting was held on Feb. 15th, we invited the pupils of Dr. John Macdonald room. The first thing we did after saying our Club hymn was to give a show with our moving picture machine. We showed how the Bad Habit Family got into the Kingdom of Heaven. Some of us were saying some pieces about each one of the family. While I was our pie leader, I was narrating the medallion stories about their places. Another thing we liked was \"A Little Pond\" acted out by W. John Chaffaux and Margaret Fraser. The visitors enjoyed the songs. Mary had a little cold. She had a little heart-bush on our sand-table and I enjoyed seeing them fluttering in the air. The last thing we did was to pass the Valentines to the girls and boys. I got one too, but I had to guess who gave it to me.\n\nEdith Giddo IV.\n\nNow Brothers.\n\nThere are two new Brothers in Grouard now. One is Brother Ben Cunningham, and the other is Brother Lambert from Father. Brother Cunningham was engineering here before, and we used to call him Dan then because he wasn't a Brother yet. We are glad he is going to be a Brother, and we are proud too, because he is the first Cree Brother we have known. We hope they will like it here until they have to go away to learn more about being Brothers. Maybe some of the other boys will follow their example in the future.\n\nHarry Twin - Grade IV.\n\nSister Superior Goes to Madrasore.\n\nSister Superior went for her retreat on Feb. 17th. Sister Norbert took her place while she was gone. We missed Sister Superior very much for she was gone about two weeks.\nOne morning, we were so glad to see her praying in the chapel. After breakfast, she came to see us in the refectory. It was nice to see her home again. Sister Victoire was sick, so she went to Midnapore. Sister Adelia came from New Westminster to keep the girls. A few of the girls knew her because she was here about ten years ago. We are glad to have her keeping us, for she is very kind to us. She is also very neat.\n\nMargaret Fraser \u2014 Grade IV.\n\nOur Last Sleigh Ride This Year\n\nLast month, the boys and girls went for a ride as far as the bridge. There were six teams. Some of the Sisters came with us too. We turned at the Bridge. But Brother Drouin and John Giroux played a trick on the rest of us and went further out on the lake. This tossed the other four teams, so they waited about a mile from the mission till the other two teams caught up, then they had so much fun, snow-balling and playing all sorts of tricks. It was funny to see Uncle Cunningham getting his feet washed by Brother Boss\u00e9. But Brother had a little snow on his face too before he hopped into the sleigh again.\n\nSome of us were in Brother Boss\u00e9's sleigh to talk to him. This was his last sleigh ride with us. We were asking him why, but all he could say was, \"You will find out later on, just wait and see.\" Well, we soon found out that he was going to Ft. Vermillion to replace Brother Gaucher who has been here since Christmas. We were all sorry he had to leave because everybody knew Brother Boss\u00e9 and began to smile as soon as they saw him because he is so jolly and is always playing tricks. I guess the boys will miss him very much when they start playing ball, for he was their best player, and he used to make the games lively by teasing the players all the time. We surely hope he likes his new home.\n\nMelba Cardinal \u2014 Grade VI.\n\nSenior Club Meeting\n\nThe Fathers, Sisters, St. Theresa Club and other guests seemed to enjoy the Club program we had on March 21st. In a little play called \"Foxy Grandpa\", Victor Twin made everyone laugh, because he was dressed like an old woman, and spoke in a thin little\nvoice. As a preparation for Lent which was beginning the next day, our president, Frank Giroux, read one of Father Ryan's beautiful poems about Death. Father Falhor said he liked that number best. He spoke so nicely to us afterwards, we surely didn't think this was the last time he would ever come to our Club meeting. We will think of him and miss him the next time we have a program.\n\nLouise St. Arnold - Gr. VI.\n\nReturn of Rev. Father LaJoie.\n\nJust before Christmas, Fr. LaJoie left for the East to go and buy some clothes and other things for all the boys and girls of all the Indian missions. He came back at the end of February. He gave us so many nice things to wear and is always very good to us. The way we can show our thanks is by trying our best to be as good as we can.\n\nEunice Cunningham - Grade IV.\n\nBrother Allie came back from Labrador where he had been for almost two years. He is going to paint the church inside and outside. He went to Edmonton to buy the paint already. He stayed there about a week. I am anxious to see the church. We hope it will be finished for our Bishop's Silver Jubilee in June.\n\nLaura Anderson - Gr. IV.\n\nHow Nice To Have a Radio at School!\n\nWe were surely glad to have a radio on March second. It was our radio that brought the news of the Pope's election. During recess, Sister happened to remember the Conciliation so she opened the radio and we just on time to hear the glad news. She went quickly to tell the Sisters and Fathers who knew nothing about it yet. When the pupils came in a few minutes later, we were all so interested, we forgot to sit down, but just stood behind our chairs ... with our mouths open! We heard the rest of the broadcast till eleven o'clock. It was wonderful to hear the bells ringing.\n\nEmile Thibault - Gr. VII.\n\nOur Bishop Goes To Labrador Mission.\n\nBishop Langlois left for his first visit to Labrador on March seventh. When he came a little ways from the Mission, he saw Fr. Bruckert with his dog-teams. Other dog-teams were there too, all gayly decorated to welcome the Bishop. Bishop said it was funny to...\nsee Fr. Bruckert cracking his whip and shouting to keep his dogs just ahead of the Bishop's sleigh. But the visit was a short one, for just a few days after his arrival, Bishop got a telegram that Fr. Falher was very sick, so he had to come right back.\n\nHere in Grouard, we were all praying hard that Fr. Falher would not die before His Excellency arrived. One noon, while we were washing dishes, we saw a big car coming in, and we saw a man in the front near the driver who was Bishop Langlois, we were sure. Mary Collison ran to tell the Sisters \"Bishop is here!\" So all ran outside... and you should have seen how happy Sr. Duray was, being sure that her prayers had been answered! A few of the Sisters looked out to see the Bishop, but just then, he got out, and instead of seeing Bishop Langlois, we saw Dr. McIntyre getting out of the car! We were sorry; but we couldn't help laughing. But the next day, we got our wish, for Father was still living, and the Bishop had the consolation (and the consolation) of blessing his oldest missionary before he died.\n\nVictoria Bollrose - Grade VI.\n\nVisit of Former Teachers.\n\nThe day before St. Patrick's, Father Beauchage and Fr. Lindervator came to visit our school. We were all so glad to see them both again, for they were both our Catechism teachers before. Father Beauchage had come here with our school inspector who was on his way to visit at Salt Prairie. They had a hard time coming, for the roads were very bad and Fr. Beauchage said they went in the ditch much easier than they got out! We hope the inspector will come this way often, so Fr. Beauchage can come again. Fr. Lindervator came from Joussard in a caboose. They came to see Fr. Falher for the last time. They had both been his Cree students, so they were very sorry to see him so ill. Some of us were kind of nervous when Fr. Beauchage was looking at our conduct card! They told us about their work and their trips and made us laugh very much. They visited all the other class rooms too.\n\nEileen Brunelle - Victor Twin - Grade VI.\n\nArrival of Father Floc'h from Whitefish Lake.\n\nFather Floc'h has just arrived from White Fish Lake with seven children who are coming to stay here. He had been away on his far-away missions for the last two weeks.\nwhere he couldn't get any news, so Father Falher had been buried a week before he even knew that he was sick. It was a terrible shock for Father Floch to hear the sad news, for he had been with Fr. Falher as a missionary for so many years. One of Fr. Floch's first visits after he got to Groundwood was to the cemetery.\n\nFather said this last trip had been one of the hardest he had ever had. He went to Prairie Lake which is forty miles away from Whitewater, but the roads were so bad, he had a hard time getting through. After a few days here, he had to go to Loon Lake which was about thirty miles further. After much trouble, he got there, said Mass, visited the people and got some of the children who were going to come back with him. One day they traveled only six miles, because the frozen snow would cut the horses' legs and make them bleed. At each stop, the horses would break through the crust and sink in deep. The little boys ran ahead and didn't mind, for they wouldn't break through, but Father and the man would sink. They had to camp out in the open because they couldn't reach the place they intended to stay in. It was snowing and raining all night, and all they had was a couple of blankets to put over them. When they got up in the morning, there was about three inches of snow over their blankets!\n\nThey were very cold, hungry and tired when they got to White Fish Lake, but there Willie Hamelin was there with fresh horses from Groundwood to take them home, so they got here the next night. We are glad to see Father Floch again, and are sorry he had such a hard trip, but of course he is a real missionary, so he doesn't mind.\n\nHolton Miller\u2014Grade VIII\u2014-Irene Ward\u2014Grade VI.\n\nLenten Devotions.\n\nDuring Lent, everyone has been trying to be as good as possible. We all have slips to fill in every day to encourage us to go to Mass. We are proud to get up or stay in bed three times a week, but in our room there are seven who have not missed Mass once since Lent started. Every Friday and Sunday, the Way of the Cross is made in Cree. We have been very lucky on Sunday, for the Bishop has preached three or four times. How nice it is to hear him preach! Everyone understands every word he says, because it is so...\ninteresting, we just have to listen. We are very lucky children to have a Bishop preach to us so often. Last Sunday, His Excellency talked about the Annunciation, and told us about the time he went to say Mass in the house where the Angel had announced to Mary that she would be the Mother of God.\n\nOn Monday morning, instead of Composition, Sister asked us to write a short account of the Bishop's sermon. After we had finished, we nodded our heads. Suddenly Sister began to laugh, and when she heard us Pete Glidu's composition, we laughed too. This is what Pete had written: \"The Angel Gabriel appeared to the Blessed Virgin and told her that she was going to be the mother of Christ. The Angel said, 'Hail, Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.' And Mary answered, 'Blessed art thou amongst women!'\" Frank Giroux \u2014 Grade VII.\n\nEASTER GREETINGS TO ALL OUR FRIENDS!\n\nWe're joining the Easter parade to bring you our greetings and wish you a very happy Easter!\nSt. Joseph Patron\nHappy death pray\nfor us\n\nWhat are\nyou doing\nfor Lent?\nSt. Joseph Patron\nof a\nHappy death pray\nfor us\n\nWhat are\nyou doing\nfor Lent?\nOn Monday night February 13th the girls got ready for St Valentine's Day. They made Valentine pictures for each other. Miss Strain made a big box to put them in and hang up.\n\nOn Tuesday night February 14th we had a party. The girls wore caps and dresses. They were there at the party.\n\nThe girls fixed the tables and they put a little table in the middle. They hung streamers and the Valentine box on it. After wards the boys walked down to see the girls. They stayed there for a little time and sat up tables. Only Miss Harrigan stayed away. Then Miss Strain told the girls to sit down on the boxes. She and Miss Chabot read the stories out for the evening. Nelly Rine was first on to be called. Then Miss Strain's name was called and she dropped our cards. Miss Chabot's was called and she always goes when she has all time to have lunch. Some girls played games. The little girls went to bed. Then the big girls called their night prayers. We all thanked Miss Strain for the nice time she gave us. Then we went to bed and went fast to dream land.

Of course I didn't refuse the great opportunity offered me. I told her I would be ready in about a week or so.\n\nThe next day, for it was Monday, I started to pack. First I packed all the things that I thought I would need. I took a large piece of a broken mirror too. I was told in Japan that Japanese folks didn't know how to break glass. So I thought I would show them.\n\nTo my surprise, my pack grew quickly up and even before I knew it I was on the large steamer sailing across the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIt was a very slow journey and we didn't forget to pray so that we might not have a terrible wreck some place. I made friends with people that I never met before. There were a lot of people on all races on the steamer. Some of them were ladies like ourselves and I was afraid to go near them.\n\nWhen we were quite near the Island of Japan we saw the beautiful mountains of Fujiyama. The houses were made of all colours. We saw the beautiful green fields of rice and tea which grew in long straight rows. The little Japanese girls and boys called at us as we passed down the streets of the industrious Kyoto and Chizen. We visited an old man's house and I was much surprised to see that his house was made of cardboard.\n\nThen when our visit was ended we had to come back to Canada. On our way back we saw a large whale not far from the ship. One of the men threw a long iron pole something like a spear at it. The pole hit its mark and the great water beast died. I was rather glad to get back home again for I think that Canada is the best country of all.\n\nMY SKATES\n\nI have a pair of roller skates although too small for me.

One day a voice said to him, \"Valentine, do little things, they are the best.\" Valentine asked what the little things were but there was no reply. He had to find out for himself.\n\nValentine took care of the garden. His white lilies and violets were the biggest and nicest of all. There was hardly any bride in town who didn't wear blossoms on her wedding day.\n\nValentine came to know everybody's birthday. He used to hang a little gift made by his own hands on their doors. His flowers were given to little children on their way to school.\n\nWhen Saint Valentine died everyone came to look for the last time at the pretty kind face in the rude coffin. The people cried for Valentine. A Brother told them not to weep but to try their very best to please God as Valentine did.\n\nAfter Valentine died people never forgot his kindness to everybody.

The night was dark and cold. I took my coat and hat, put them on and started for the door. As I opened it a strange light surrounded me. I was so filled with wonder that I quite forget my name. As I was thinking of it the light faded away. There stood a little girl dressed all in white. A bright gold crown was on her head and a beautiful wand in her hand. Then she spoke in a voice so sweet that I just couldn't stop wondering who she was.\n\nI trembled a little while I calmed down. She said in a sweet but gentle voice, \"What is your name my little girl?\" I stepped closer and caught my breath and said in a low shy way, \"My name is Florence Nightingale.\" Then she said to me: \"Would you like to go to Fairyland? I can't ride who I am any longer, so I will tell you, I am the queen of the fairies.\"\n\nAnd then she asked me if I wanted to go. I said \"Yes, But how will we get there?\" Just then two beautiful white horses with a wagon came walking up the path. The fairy waived her hand and the driver stopped at once. She told me to get on. She jumped on after me. In an hour or two I caught sight of a beautiful village. The driver stopped at a golden gate in front of a large palace. He ordered me to jump off and help her to step out of the wagon. I asked to know where he put the horses. He said they stayed where they were all day long. If any fairy wanted to go for a ride she could just have to jump on.\n\nAfter we had talked for a little while the driver pointed over to the palace. I looked up and there I saw the most beautiful sight of my whole short life. Coming towards the queen, the driver said my sight was a line of fairies led by a little fairy boy dressed all in white. When they got up to us they all made a bow to the queen. The little queen said to me: \"Do you see this little boy? He is the king of the fairies.\" She put me in front of all and told me to go to the king. When I got up one step I found a doll I gave to the king. He told me to keep it.\n\nThis is what happened when I got to the palace. There in one of the rooms was a big table with many things to eat. I couldn't eat from excitement. After a little while some Brownies came hopping into the room. They got in a ring around the table. After they had gone around ten times the fairies got up and took their places. The Brownies ate the rest of the dinner. Some of the fairies and brownies stayed to wash and put away the things.\n\nWhen night came the queen took me to a little room in the palace and said: \"This is the room you'll sleep in to night. You don't have to go to bed now. Come out in the garden and play.\"\nA VISIT TO FAIRYLAND\n\nOne of the fairies danced, some played tag and the others sat around and told stories to me about Fairyland. They were the most wonderful stories I have ever heard. The king and the queen sat on their throne and watched the little fairies play. When it was time for bed my little pets, \"Fairyland\" was shut up. About ten everything was so quiet you could hear a little mouse run across the floor.\n\nI stayed in Fairyland about a month and a half. One night when I was almost asleep I had a dream I had to leave. When I woke up next morning there she I bef I was not in a beautiful golden palace but in my little house in Spanish. I wondered and wondered how I got back. I wondered so much that my hair became gray. But you must not forget that I am your little friend Florence Nightingale. Do you think you'd like to take a trip to Fairyland?\n\nElizabeth Zachary\nGrade IV\n\nVALENTINE'S DAY\n\nOn Valentine's Day\nWhich is not far away\nI'll talk of you all\nNeither big or small.\n\nI'll send you all a present\nWhich will make it pleasant\nAnd please think of me\nWhen my gift you see.\n\nGrade VII\n\nA RACE\n\nThere is a little girl; her name is Grace\nShe always seems to like to race\nBut when she wins she's always glad\nBut when she loses she's very sad.\nAnother died - I forget his name - Mr. Edgington also died.

Our Mandan Indians need us more than ever.\n\nBelieve it or not,\n\nPaul Fredericks\nA little note just to let you know what's going on here. We've been very busy preparing for the new school year.\n\nWe've been working hard to get everything ready for the students who will be joining us soon. The teachers have been busy planning lessons and organizing materials.\n\nThe students have been excited about the new school and are eager to start their studies. We're looking forward to welcoming them back to Wikwemikong.\n\nThank you for all your support and encouragement. We couldn't have done it without you.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nMr. Phillips Phelan\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ontario\nSince our last number a great change has taken place. Reverend Father Pratt, our Principal here since February 1936, has been transferred to Blue Quills School at Saint Paul and Reverend Father Rheaume, formerly of our School, has arrived here from Saint Paul to take over the duties of Principal.\n\nTo Reverend Father Pratt we wish to publicly express our thanks once more for the great work he has done amongst us. The important material changes in and about the School will always stand as a worthy memorial of his devotedness towards the comfort and well-being of our Indian children.\n\nTo Rev. Father Rheaume, our new Principal, we wish to express our most sincere submission. Regardless of the fact that there are more difficulties to be faced here than in any other schools he has yet visited, we know that Father Rheaume is willingly ready to give all he has for the betterment of all those who are under his direction.\n\nSo let us all unite and generously work together for our own good as well as to relieve our Principal of some of the enormous duties imposed upon him.\n\nFor this purpose an appeal is made to the young boys who have just left School and to the young men on the Reserves. Why not each and every one of you try to realize all the worry and trouble you try to realize all the worry and trouble\nyou cause by roaming around the School at the most undesirable times. Try to imagine yourselves in the position of those who have been appointed to take care of your brothers and sisters in the name of your parents. Think of the damage you can cause by bad example and of the punishment you will receive, if not in this world, most certainly in the next.\n\nBut it is never too late. Be generous to yourselves and to your fellow-companions. Respect yourselves and all those about you. As you all know, you are not supposed to forget the training you received at your School. Now is the time to put it into practice and thus show your gratitude to all those who have left their country, their parents and friends; who have given up almost dear to them, to give you the best of all things\u2014a good Christian education.\n\n---\n\nAlleluia.......This is the joyous word so often sung during the Holy time of Easter. Do you ever stop to realize its meaning? It has been used for centuries to express thanksgiving, joy and triumph. This is the reason why the Church uses it so often during this time of the year to express her joy and thanksgiving upon the occasion of Christ's Resurrection which marks our Savior's triumph over sin and death.\n\nEaster is the principle feast of the year. Commemorating the Death of the true Lamb of God and the Resurrection of Christ, the corner-stone upon which faith is built, it is also the oldest feast of the Christian Church, as old as Christianity, the connecting link between the Old and New Testament.\n\nAnd now that Easter is here, can each and everyone of us sincerely join our Savior in His triumph over sin. Can we join our joy with His and say: \"O Lord I have done my best during this past season of Lent to expiate my sins and thus relieve Thee of some of the innumerable sorrows which I have caused Thee.\"\n\nBut to please Jesus above all, let us not forget our Easter Confession and our Easter Communion. Let each one of us do it most sincerely and most faithfully. Let us by so doing receive God's grace and participate of the infinite merits of Christ, our Savior's glorious Resurrection. This is the wish we express to our readers.\n\nSeven baptisms and six deaths have been registered this month in the Mission's Record. Among the deceased were L.Tchiskim Allard, and Arnes Shortneck. The four others were infants. To their parents and relatives we wish to express our most sincere sympathy.\n\nThe following is a story that has often been repeated. We think that it will show our readers the Christian spirit that animates some of our Indians.\n\nRecently, when Sister Pierre-Ap\u00f4tre was here to visit many of the Indians whom she had known, came to see her and congratulate her upon her entry into religion. They felt proud that one of their own blood had given up her life to God for His service and the service of the souls.\n\nThomas Bull, an old friend, visited her one day and upon shaking hands with her said:\n\n\"Well, I should also do something. I cannot be a priest, but maybe I could be a Brother.\"\n\nA Sister, who happened to be passing by, ventured:\n\n\"Be careful, Thomas, you would have to cut your hair. Oh! no\u2014I would keep it to be like Jesus. He will love me better. Don't you think so, Sister?\"\n\nMonias\nSad Hearts\n\nI suppose many of you already know about the departure of our good Father Pratt. Yes, he has gone to St. Paul, at the Blue Quill School, to help Father Blier as bursar of this school. We all felt sorry to see him go because he has been very good to all of us. Although our thanks have reached him to the eye of his departure, we wish to tell him once more that we will not forget to pray for him, and we hope to see him again in the Brule\u00f1oskin School.\n\nOur New Principal\n\nWe felt very sad to see our good Father Pratt leaving us for the Blue Quill's School, but God was good to us... He sent us Father Athanase who also knew \"his\" as now our Principal and seems to do his best for us all. He came in our class-room last week and told us he was happy to be back among us. He wants the Indian Boys and Girls to learn as much as they can while in School, so that when they will be out they will be able to earn their living just as well as any white people.\n\nCalma Lightning.\n\nSchool Section\n\nThe preparing and editing of a School Paper demands quite a considerable amount of time and work, how much more so when considering the competition preferred by such other School Papers as the \"Oke Mape\", \"Thunder Report\", \"Menominee Telegram\", \"Enchanted Hill Echoes\", etc.\n\nThis helps and encourages us to print but the best and the most interesting articles. A widespread cooperation is certainly a great aid and we are therefore very thankful to all the Schools who send us their reviews.\n\nCommittee.\nA Trip to Edmonton\n\nOn Saturday, March 18th, our Hockey Club traveled to Edmonton in order to play against St. John's College. However, warm weather had done so much damage to the ice that the game had to be postponed. This turned out to be quite a disappointment for both teams, but nevertheless it seems that the Ermines had a splendid time in Edmonton. Let's read what some of them have to say about it.\n\nGeorge Fitch (right wing on our first line) will tell us about his visit to the Edmonton City Dairy. Going in the E.C.D. building, we went to see how milk was being tested. A man there showed us how it is done by making experiments which surprised us. We went on to another room where a man was emptying the milk cans into a big tank. The milk goes into another tank where it is sterilized. Then it goes up and comes down on the rollers at the top of these rollers the milk is boiled by the heat arrives at the bottle filler. From here the milk goes to the bottle filler. In another room we saw boxes filled with empty bottles coming on a roller belt. These bottles go into a tank where they are thoroughly washed. A man stands there and takes the clean bottles and puts them on another belt. These are ready for the milk. They are now filled... a man takes the bottles and puts them in the boxes. He then takes them to the butter machines where also explained. Here are not the only ones working in the dairy\u2014I saw a lady there wrapping the butter. I forgot to tell the nicest part\u2014yes, we had our picture taken. All had their sweetest smiles\u2014so I do hope it turns out to be the best one. E.C.D. has ever taken. And the Ice Cream treat! Even at the end of our visit I must not forget either. For this end course and for the kindness of those who made our visit so interesting I wish to say in the name of all my companions a very sincere \"Thank You.\"\n\nJiminto Checsecow (sub left wing) will now drive us back to the Edmonton Airport. As soon as we visited the E.C.D., we went directly to the Edmonton Airport. As we were nearing the field, a small plane was circling above in the air. Mr. Roll himself manager of the airport, was very kind in showing us around the hangars. In the first there was a huge plane of Italian making whose wings were about 65 ft. long. It was the largest plane we saw. Farther we also saw another smaller but much faster plane which could go at the rate of 200 miles per hour. In the next hangar we saw more planes, the nearest of which was a big twin motor plane belonging to the Yukon Southern Lines and which flies regularly very much like the T.C.A. planes. If the Air Mail flights could ever be run on time that day, we would have been very pleased. But Mr. Roll told us just how hard it had been to get up to the altitude when it passes over Buteons. He also explained the use of the radio during the flights. We also heard about the trip.\nSaint Patrick's Day\n\nAs dinner was waiting, the Ermines rushed back to the College where, after a very hearty breakfast, we were taken about the College to visit all the different parts. Our visit ended in the College's splendid recitation room where physical training exercises were being held\u2014demonstration of our plans for the Ermines' games, followed by a few hours of fun for the pupils.\n\nWe then drove up to the Archibald house to see the second-year students who had been there for the weekend. We arrived just in time for them to have played our game, and we were delighted to see them.\n\nAfter our visit to the Archibald house, we went to the Borden Park. It was time for us to say \"good-bye\" to Borden, and now it's time for us to say \"thank-you\" to Rev. Father Rheume and Mr. Protel for organizing this interesting tour.\n\nIndoor Games\n\nWhen the snow was melting, many boys made nice airplanes. Alex Simon made a bombardier and tried to build a double four-eyes. It took him three days to make it.\n\nWe have a new game on the girls' side. The name is \"Group Smiling,\" and we love this game very much. We try to get them to smile and laugh.\n\nOne night the boys made snow to play for a hockey game. Alec Simon made the bison and they won. The score was 3-1.\n\nLet's sit is the rules which are:\n\nLightning\u20142\nJoe (Ferdinand) Bull\nColonel's Conference\n\nWe are still travelling around the world and our friend Mr. Smith has left us behind in Liverpool. He took us along the western coast to see the different important places. Shopping in London he told us how the King and Queen's jewels are kept, as well as the most important buildings in this city. He nearly went away without showing us his and Mrs. Bowles' shoes, but we asked him so he went back to the shop and showed us them, which is his home and where he lives.\n\nMr. Smith is Mr. Lewis' friend, and we wish to think him very sincerely because his talk was very interesting and useful. We hope he will come over again and tell us all about India.\n\nOur Gift\n\nBefore leaving us Father Pratt gave a nice cedar chest to our teacher. This chest will be one of the finest prizes at the end of the year. So Sister told us that the pupil who won the most A's during the whole year would be the lucky child. We did our best and here to win 14 A's thanks to our kind Father Pratt for thinking of us till the very last minute.\n\nTherese Wolfe\n\nNew Pictures\n\nIf you happen to drop in our school, you will be surprised to see the lovely pictures of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in natural colours. They are hanging up in each class-room; all we wish now is a frame to have them look nicer. This might come if we keep on helping!\n\nMary Jane Potts\n\nArithmetic Hockey Games\n\nOnce the snow ran the ice all melted we have organized three different teams to play hockey in the glass-room. George Louvrey is captain for the Maple Leafs Ernest Storck Lawrence Sousy are for the Boston Bruins. We play our games either in Rapid Calculation or in Spelling, we sure have a good time multiplying, reducing adding or dividing. The nicest part in it is that the girls play just as well as the boys.\n\nHow did the Indians come to America?\n\nNot very long ago, our teacher who likes to puzzle us with funny questions asked us while we were having a lesson in Bible History, \"how did the Indians ever come to America?\" We put on our thinking caps and started to answer. Seeing we were having a hard time she produced a pencil, a piece of paper and as soon as she wrote on it pencil, we all ran in different directions. Someone said, \"ask Father O'Callaghan,\" others to Mr. Pratt and I thought it was our turn to ask Father O'Callaghan. At last our guessing work was over and found out the answer which we had written. We did get our 50\u00a2's which gave us a good push for our I.R.P.\n\nSophie Neppeos\u2014Gr. 6\nOur Study on France\n\nWe left London and sailed to the place where Father Loulin was awaiting us. It was 1:30 p.m. when we took the train and drove around the principal cities of France. We first visited Paris, then Mantes, Bordeaux, Lille, etc., and told us what a beautiful country was her rich in its natural products as well as in manufactured items. His postcards gave us a better understanding of all the beauties of his native land. Thanks to our dear and kind Father Loulin for his interesting talk.\n\nJr. Tile Greaser\u2014Gr. 7\n\nLuck... Well, we did not hope in vain... The trip to Wataskiwin is over, but I had quite a hard time to catch up with the other kids. They had many more adventures than I. All the places were more crowded because Father's cars were very big. We arrived in Wataskiwin at 2:00 p.m. Although the wind was blowing very hard outside, we didn't mind because we were visiting the Flour Mill. I think I'd better give you all about the mill.\n\nJennie Simon\n\nGr. 5\n\nAre we right? Are we right? Are we right?\n\nIn reading \"Oko Nip\", the Sablier class pupils were very interested in the puzzle. I go \"All tried their best to find those different names.\"\n\nAux Simon\u2014Gr. 6\nWe wish a Happy Easter to all our Grade I friends.\n\nMy teacher was in the Hospital.\n\nShe was very sick.\n\nShe came back not long ago.\n\nShe is better now.\n\nI am glad she came back.\n\nWe are making an enterprise.\n\nCharlie Roasting\n\nMeeting\n\nOn March 25th, Rev. Father Kellis, our Director, came to the chapel and gave us our usual instruction, which takes place every second Sunday of the month. Those who are out of the School and who are members of this society spend the night with us, so that the next morning they are ready to join in the General Communion.\n\nWe thought we would have new members this time, but no changes took place. After the Instruction, Sister S. Lucy had prepared a nice tea for all of us. Father Rheault joined our good Father Moulin and we had a great time. Many thanks to our kind Directress.\n\nSophie Nepoos (President)\n\nWill it be our Treat?.......\n\nWe very often see Sister Superior running to the old oven-shop. Don't you think we have guessed why?........ Usually on Easter Sunday morning we enjoy eating real eggs!! I'm quite sure she is picking as many as she can so that every one will have his or her share. Thank you, Sister Superior, we know you love us all.\n\nWilfrid Dier.\n\nA Surprise.\n\nWhen Father Pratt left us, we felt sorry! But on April 2nd, Father Altenau came over with a motorcycle he bought from Father Boucher. That night we went to bed at 9:00 p.m. The $100 I liked best was the secret of the lock. Many thanks to our dear Father Altenau.\n\nElsie Threetingers\n\nIda White\n\nLillian Deschaus\n\nDaniel Whitebear\n\nMuriel Wolfe\nTurning the Hide\n\nAt the beginning of Feb., Colonel Louis Sutherland, Agent received a letter from a pupil of his in Badgerwick, asking instructions how to tan the hide. So Colonel asked our teacher to have a pupil of her class to answer this letter. We all made our composition and asked you all to know about this subject.\n\nOther animals they skin it. They then cut 4 or 5 trees in the hide (in the edge) so that they may fit it on the tree. Then they string or tie piece of sinew the hide. We then hang the hide to the branch of a tree or put it flat on the ground. Then take an instrument sharp at the end and scrape the fat or the flesh that was left on the skin. Let the skin dry.\n\nThen use another instrument made of the bone of an animal at its end there is a piece of iron flat and sharp with which we take off all the hair on the hide. We then grease the hide with brains of any animal and bury it for a while so that the grease will go in the hide. Then soak it in warm water and leave it for night. Next morning rinse it, wring it well and put it in the sun to let it dry but rub it all the time while it is drying, this will be the skin nice and soft. But if you want it to be of golden brown, place it over the hole so that the smoke will turn it to nice golden colour.\n\nAlthough spring is already here, we still have two more hockey games to report. As these reports have been very well written up by the Edmonton Journal, we will reproduce them here below:\n\nERMINES GIVEN\n6-2 WINNING\n\n(Special to the Journal)\n\nWith playoffs near and soon right in the middle of deciding series, hockey games at district points are spooling up and the crowds are being treated to some really fine contests. Following is a recent game report:\n\nHOBBEMA\u2014Playing indifferent hockey the Indian School Ermines were handed an 8-2 lading by an all-star team from Hottona town.

The game was fast and well played all through, but Hobema displayed a better finish around the goal.\n\nAnd now we have something to boast about\u2014the birth of a new organization, the A.A.C., or the Ermins' Athletic Club. This we hope will help the boys to learn how to organize themselves, whenever such an occasion will offer itself in later life. We hope it will show them that unity and collaboration are important factors for the success of any public enterprise where the common good is at stake.\n\nLittle by little, but as quickly as possible, we expect to make strong and healthy athletes out of our boys.\n\nHere are the members of the sports committee:\n\nPresident\u2014Joseph H.

We sincerely congratulate you in your earnest effort, especially in your ideal to aim in a charitable and christian manner towards our benefit, by exchange of thoughts and prayers. We gladly join you in this last great task, kind friends.\n\nWe have read in the last journal the interesting article \"Across the Sea\" about Reverend Father Bidault's trip to France. We were sorry to read later about the death of Reverend V. Grandin. We trust he celebrated his diamond Jubilee in the heavenly bliss.\n\nI am a boy of the age of thirteen and was promoted to grade V last September. My teacher is Sister St. Adelin. She is a very good and kind teacher. Sister has been in the Beauval School over twenty-nine years, and we wish her many more years in our midst.\n\nShe had many of our parents for her pupils. They certainly did appreciate their school days. Our teacher is also the sister of your teacher, that is why we have the\nchance to write new words in the St. Albert's Journal.\n\nOnce more we gratefully thank you and send you our sincere wishes for this New Year.\n\nYours Sincerely,\nVictor Morin.\n\nYouville Indian Res.

We were pleased on hearing that you have enjoyed reading our weekly publications. We feel that our teacher is doing good to us, for we realize we are improving in that subject.\n\nWe are now sending many more copies of our journal, to kind people who are interested in us, and to several schools.\n\nWe were glad to hear that your teacher is our teacher's sister. We hope that you will keep your good teacher many more years, as she is a great help to you, now that she knows you so well.\n\nWe must now close, but before we wish to assure you that we shall ask blessings and graces from our dear Lord, for you, dear friends.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nThe Pupils of Grades VI - VII's\nPer Emilienne Kootenay VII S.\nBoys' Day.\n\nEarly in the morning on Boys' Day we went to mass and received Holy Communion. We boys sang during the mass.\n\nAfter mass we went down to our room. We had a very good breakfast, and I am very sure that everybody enjoyed it. The master told us we could talk during meals all day.\n\nThat morning the boys had much fun playing all kinds of games. After that we got ready for school.\n\nWe thought we were going to do hard work in school but our teacher only gave us a half an hour on Catechism. Then she brought some new books which we enjoyed reading.\n\nAt 4 o'clock we boys again sang for the Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament.\n\nThat night at seven o'clock, we gave a concert to the Sisters and the girls. We hope they liked it.\n\nThe next day, which was the first Friday of the month, we made it a day of reparation as our Lord's part in our celebration.\n\nAlphonse P.-Patrick T.\n\n---\n\nThe Boys' Concert.\n\nOn February 2, we went to an entertainment given by the boys, and which was the most enjoyable time of the Boys' Day.\n\nThe concert began at 7:30 P.M. The opening number was a violin solo accompanied at the piano by Sister. There were fourteen numbers on their program. The most interesting was a comedy in two parts.\u2014The Tramp Barbers.\u2014\ngiven by the big boys.\n\nThe last number was the presentation of a card containing masses heard, holy communions, rosaries, half hours adoration offered to the Sacred Heart on the First Friday as our Lord's part in their celebration of Boys' Day. This card was placed by Sister Superior herself near the Blessed Sacrament where it remained all day.\n\nIt was really a pleasant evening for everybody because every part of the concert was nicely performed.\n\nEmilienne Koetanny VII S.\n\n------------------------\n\nA Hockey Game.\n\n..............\n\nLast Saturday we were invited to go to the Edmonton Indian Residential School for a hockey game. We went in the truck.\n\nWhen we reached the school, the boys got on their skates and went on the ice to practice. Then the whistle blew and the game started.\n\nThere were four periods of fifteen minutes each and ten minutes rest. At every period the players warmed themselves in a house where they have fire and wood.\n\nAt the last period the score was 5-5. We were defeated.\n\nAfter the game, we were all invited to lunch with the players of their school. After lunch, we came back, enjoying also the ride home.\n\nGeorge Stamp VII-VIII.\n\n------------------------\nOUR POETS.\n\nAway from Home.\n\nMany miles away from home,\nAway from where I love to roam,\nAnd where the sky is always bright\nAnd where my heart is happy and light.\nPatrick Thomas VI.\n\nTruthfulness.\n\nOne thing that boys and girls should do,\nTo reach real happiness always,\nIn all they do let there be truth,\nAnd let them try this day by day.\nHenry Calder VII J.\n\nSt. Valentine.\n\nSt. Valentine our good old friend,\nGladens our hearts with love and cheer,\nShowering gifts on young and old,\nOn his feast day, every year.\nEmilienne Kootenay VII.\nDenying the Holy Habit.\n\nThis ceremony started at half past eight this morning, February 6, and lasted until ten o'clock.\n\nTwo sisters received the Holy Habit. They were Sister Droulx and Sister Burns. They seemed to be very glad to give themselves to our dear Lord who is so good.\n\nThere was a mass said and Reverend Father Bidault preached very nicely. His sermon was on how nice it is to give oneself to God and serve Him well.\n\nWe will pray for them that they may do all the good they wish to do.\n\nBessie Lefthand VII J.\n\nSix Postulants.\n\nOn February 6, in the afternoon, six girls from different places entered as postulants.\n\nAs they came in they were dressed in black with a white bonnet. The Novices sang a beautiful hymn as they entered. When they knelt at the communion rail, they recited some prayers with the priest. Then Reverend Father Simard said a few words to them. Immediately followed the Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament.\n\nDoris Cardinal VII J.\nSeventeen years ago, on February 13th, our Holy Father, Pius XI, was crowned Pope, as the 261st successor of St. Peter.\n\nHe was one of the greatest Popes that ever sat in the chair of St. Peter. He ruled over 330,000,000 Catholics.\n\nHe wrote many encyclicals during these seventeen years and in these letters he mentioned in a special way, the question of Communism, of Marriage and of Education.\n\nOn February 10th, the sad news of his death was heard over the radio. We prayed for him, for he had the responsibility of the whole world, that God may take him to his eternal rest.\n\nWe also hope that God will give us another grand Pope like him.\n\nEmilienne Kootenay VIII\nBlessing of the Children\n\nWe had the blessing of children on February 5 in the church.\n\nJust before the procession, Reverend Father Bidault preached a little while. When he had finished speaking, some little boys of the village took the statue of the Little Jesus and carried it all around the church and the Convent boys followed.\n\nIn the choir, some girls sang the hymn \"Little King so Fair and Sweet,\" while the boys went around.\n\nWhen the procession was over, Father Bidault blessed all the children. Then we said the Holy Rosary and Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament followed.\n\nRosalie Burnstick VI.\n\nA Young Organist.\n\nLast week, we were all anxious for Sunday to come, because one of our friends Miss Emilienne Kootenay was to play the organ during mass on that morning.\n\nOur music teacher took all of Grade VII's girls to sing. Emilienne accompanied us. Everybody was glad to hear her play and all said she sang very well.\n\nSister will bring other girls who will be heard later; one from each reserve, if possible.\n\nWe were all proud of Emilienne Kootenay and we thank our kind sister for taking so much of her time teaching music to us.\n\nClara House VII S.\nReligious Profession.\n\nThe profession of seven novices took place on Wednesday, February 15.\n\nAt 8:30, His Excellency, Archbishop Mac Donald entered the chapel, blessing us. After a few minutes, the seven Sisters came in carrying lighted candles and led by Reverend Mother Provincial and the Mistress of Novices. They all took their place at the front.\n\nA hymn was sung, then Reverend Father Simard gave a sermon in French. After the sermon, the novices went to the altar to take their vows, then they were given their domino and their cross.\n\nAfter the mass, said by our beloved Archbishop, he spoke to the young sisters and to their parents.\n\nThen they went to see their good parents who made a big sacrifice in letting their daughters become sisters, and do good to the poor.\n\nLouise Ward VII S.\n\nAnother Picture Show.\n\nReverend Father Bidault had said that he would come again to give us another show because the last time a film could not be used. He kept his promise and came last Friday night.\n\nHe gave us three films. The first was about volcanoes breaking into mountain, houses; lava boiling over like water, building of cones by irruption of lava, etc. The second was the Niagara Falls. It surely was interesting to all of us, although we did not understand all of it, but our Teacher explained it to us the following week. The last was a comic to make us laugh before we went to bed.\n\nDoris Cardinal VII J.\nOur Work Shop.\n\nWe were greatly pleased to hear that we were to have a carpenter shop of our own. It is where the old laundry used to be. It is about 25 ft long and 20 ft wide. We have all the tools we need.\n\nWe, boys of Junior VII have not started our exhibition work yet. I hope that we will start soon. The boys of Senior VII and a few boys from the other class have begun.\n\nWe thank all those in charge of us who gave us such a nice shop and the tools we need.\n\nHenry Calder VII J.\n\nMumps.\n\nWe, big boys, all had the mumps!! One night, Sister Quenneville put some iodine on every one of us and when we came back to our room, we looked and we were called little gophers.\n\nI was the most swollen because I was the thirteenth one to have them and it is said that that's an unlucky number.\n\nNot only did we look like gophers but we felt like them, when caught in a trap, for we were confined to our room ---- no school and no play outside.\n\nWe are all better now and most are back to school.\n\nWalter Callihoo VII S.\n\nTeacher: - Why did Christ's soul go to the Limbo of the Patriarchs?\nPupil: - To see if they were all there.\nOUR BEST PRINTERS.\n\nWhen you've work to do,\nDo it with a will,\nThey who reach the top,\nFirst must climb the hill.\n\nStanding at the foot,\nGazing at the sky,\nHow can you get up,\nIf you never try.\n\nCloud House.\n\nFill I am so hope to be I owe\nto my angel mother.\nAbraham Lincoln.\nRosalie Burnstick.\nHigh School Girls' Concert.\n\nOn February 25, the St. Albert public school girls gave a three act entertainment in the parish hall. The name of the play is \"Jessica's Journey.\"\n\nIn the first act the two Foster girls were discussing on what they were going to do to pay the taxes and keep their home. But they were heel over head in debts and didn't know what to do because they were advised that they were going to lose their home in three days.\n\nIn the second act, they have company. Six high school girls and their teacher who had a wash out on their way to Ottawa, came to stay overnight in the Foster's home. A telegram announced the coming of their aunt on a short visit. The school girls managed a scheme not to let the aunt know the poor condition of the house and their debts. They did this by playing a trick. They had the Foster Girls dressed in their own ball dresses and the school girls dressed as maids with their teacher as the housekeeper.\n\nIn the third act, the old lady is too wise for them and they are discovered in their scheme. The old aunt appreciated their entertainment but she rebuked them for trying to act that way with an old lady, but when the reason was given her, she was touched, and told her niece about an uncle who died leaving her all his wealth. She pays the debts and she adds, there is still enough for all. As to the clever miss who tried to put this over her, she rewards by taking her for a trip around the world.\n\nIt surely was a swell entertainment, I enjoyed it very much.\n\nLawrence Morin VIII.\n\n+ IO -\nThe Conclave\n\nWe were given a test on the Conclave.

Pope Pius XII was elected on his 63rd birthday. We hope he will have a long, happy reign.\n\nAlphonse Paul VII J.\n\nCardinal Eugenio Pacelli is now Pope.\n\nCardinal Pacelli was elected Pope, as Pius XII on his 63rd birthday. He was born March 2, 1876, in Rome.\n\nIn 1899, at the age of twenty-four, he was ordained priest. Some years later, he was consecrated Archbishop.\n\nHe was sent to Germany during the World War, as Apostolic Nuncio, to present a chart which Pope Benedict XV had planned for the peace of the world.\n\nAfter duly accomplishing this hard task, he went back to Rome. In recognition of his ability and courage, Pope Benedict XV made him a member of the Sacred College as Cardinal Pacelli. He was made the Papal Secretary of State of our recent Pope, Pius XI from 1929 until his death.\n\nThe ardent desire of his life had been that of remaining in priesthood duties\u2014hearing confessions, giving sermons, etc. It surely was a great sacrifice for him to become a Cardinal.\n\nIn a sermon he preached on that day he said: \"God desires the sacrifice of the body sometimes, but more often he wants the sacrifice of the heart.\"\n\nAs March 12, was the Coronation of our Holy Father, we also joined in praises and thanksgiving, by singing the \"Te Deum\". There were 150,000 people expected at St. Peter's for this happy day.\n\nEmilienne Kootenay VII S.\nPope Pius XII\n\nCardinal Pacelli was elected Pope on his sixty-third birthday, March 2.\n\nAt the age of twenty-four Eugenio Pacelli became a priest. His Superiors were so much impressed with his ability that they placed him in the office of Papal Secretary of State, and later, Pope Benedict XV placed him at its head.\n\nAt the time of the World War he was sent to Munich as Apostolic Nuncio, and in the same year he was made an Archbishop.\n\nIn 1929, having done so well his difficult work, he entered the Sacred College of Cardinals and he became the Secretary of State of Pope Pius XI until his death.\n\nIt is said that he is the first Pope who ever toured by aeroplane. He went to South America, where a Eucharistic Congress was held in Argentina.\n\nIn 1936, he went to the United States and visited the four American Cardinals and many Archbishops. President Roosevelt entertained him at his home, in Hyde Park.\n\nLast Sunday, March 12, the Coronation of our Holy Father, Pope Pius XII, took place, at the huge church of St. Peter. 150,000 people were expected for the magnificent ceremony. We who are not attending, should offer our hearts in thanksgiving. The \"Te Deum\" was sung after High Mass here, in the church, in our desire to join in praise with the 335,000,000 Catholics of the world.\n\nLouise Ward VII S.\nOur New Catechism Teacher.\n\nReverend Father Simard left here about a month ago. He is gone East to preach retreats. We expect him back in a short time now.\n\nMeanwhile, Reverend Father Cr\u00e9peau kindly gives us a part of his time to come teach us Catechism. Although he has other work to do, for he visits schools out in the country, and the sick of the village, still he comes to our different classes every day.\n\nHe is kind and gentle to everyone. The boys seem to be his favorites. He has very good ways of asking questions in Catechism. We all like him because we know he loves us.\n\nLawrence Morin VII S.\n\nSt. Patrick's Concert.\n\nLast Saturday, March 18, we were invited to a concert at the Parish Hall, given by the Grandin Dramatic Club.\n\nAt quarter to two, we got ready for the Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament in our chapel, and as we came down, we went directly to the hall.\n\nIt was three o'clock when the concert started. It was a pleasant Irish play. Between each act, Irish songs were played by the town orchestra. A few minutes after five, the concert ended and we sang, \"God Save the King.\" We all hope to be invited again, for it gives us much pleasure to go.\n\nGeorge Stamo VII S.\nForty Hours' Devotions.\n\nWe had the Forty Hours' Devotions in the parish church on March 24-26, in reparation for the sins committed against the loving Heart of Jesus.\n\nThese Holy Exercises were opened by the holy mass at 8 o'clock, and the exposition of the Blessed Sacrament.\n\nDuring these three days of reparation, there were many adorers making their Holy Hour. We were also faithful to this for we, children went to church by turns during these days. We also went to the evening holy hour.\n\nOn the first day, the sermon was on the Sacrament of Penance. The next two days on Holy Eucharist and on Holy Mass. These interesting sermons were preached by Reverend Father Bidaud, our parish priest.\n\nThese Forty Hours have given us numberless graces for which we can never be too thankful. We are very lucky that these were during the Lenten Season. We all hope that we have benefitted by these three days of prayer, for we shall be happier for it in the next life.\n\nEmilienne Kootenay VII S.\n\nA Cree Retreat.\n\nA three days' retreat will start on Thursday for the Cree people of the village. It will end on Sunday morning. Reverend Father Calais will be here again as preacher.\n\nThere will be a low mass and a sermon at 8 o'clock in the morning. At night at 7:30, there will be a sermon, Rosary and Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament.\n\nThe bigger girls and boys of the convent\nThe bigger girls and boys of the convent will follow this retreat. Reverend Father Bidault is very kind to get a good Cree speaker that we will understand to make our Easter duty better. I hope the people will appreciate this and have a happy Easter after making their peace with God.\n\nDoris Cardinal VII J.\n\n---\n\nHappy Easter\n\nDear Readers\nOKE NAPE:\n\nNearly two months since the last edition of Oke Nape has reached you. Did you miss your monthly paper from Crowfoot School? Then you will be in the right frame of mind to listen to what we have to say.\n\nOld Man sickness had caught up with us; and lying day after day in bed, doing nothing but follow the pattern of a few cracks in the ceiling, got tiresome. So we set out to figure how we were doing in financing Oke Nape.\n\nOur thoughts only sent our fever all the higher. We are in the red again this year! We had decided on a fervent appeal.... Numerous plans were presented..... But we finally decided that only to mention our difficulty, would bring a generous response from our readers.\n\nSoon the annual payment of lease-money will give a chance to our Indian readers to give us a little help; and we profit of the occasion to ask of our readers all over the country to help us with a few cents for a subscription.\n\n* * *\n\nWe will meet again in May. Till then, Oke Nape, Hello Friend.\n\nNatoyekissum\n\nJ. Lessard C.I.T.\nCrowfoot Indian School\nCluny Alberta\nEASTER MESSAGE\n\n\"Christ is risen.\" Those words of the Angel to the folk, \"Jesus at the Sepulchre are also for us,\" says Jesus is living.\n\nHis apostles had to the first Christians say when He ascended to heaven, It was with the promise that by the working of the Holy Ghost He would remain with us till the end of the world. On Easter Day itself, He walked from Jerusalem to the tomb of Lazarus with two of His disciples. They did not know Him. Their eyes were opened only when He spoke and blessed them. But then they were able to say to one another, Our hearts burn within us when He spoke to us on the way. So it is with us today. We will still cling and do not know Him. Yet He will still speak to us by the Church. He will still comfort us in our trials and He will still prepare for us our eternal home. He has risen! God has raised Him from the dead. In holy Communion we receive His Body and Blood.

We played war, had races and made airplanes. The girls played on the large back porch. They skipped, played with dolls, checkers and many road stories.\n\nFor a special lunch we had jam and apples with our bread.\n\nIt was a very good holiday.\n\nAlice Red Gun.\nCecile Sleigh\n\nAnother holiday.\n\nOn the 27th of March all the pupils were very glad... why?

The boys played baseball and the girls softball and volleyball.\n\nIn the afternoon Sister Junior came to the hills and passed to every child a bag of candies with a prize in each.

We all have a pan with a little knife. Then Sister opens the little door of the machine, the potatoes fall out; we take them in our pans and pick out the eyes.\n\nSister is very kind to the potato girls. Sometimes she gives us a special lunch with some apples and cookies.\n\nWhen we have finished, two of us stay to clean the room. Then we put the pans in the new cupboard and go to the hall.\n\nCharlotte Leffugh.\n\nCLASSROOM SECTION\n\nSenior Classroom:\n\nDo you know why we are anxious to get to class now because we have an airplane race. Every period of the day count a mark. Every day at 4 o'clock the airplanes are pushed ahead. If we did not miss any marks, we are trying very hard not to miss our school works. The one that comes in first at the end of the month comes in first.\n\nFor the month of March there were five girls that finished in the first place, so they had to draw for the prize, Rosa Running Rabbit got it and we were all around trying to get our share. For the month of April, the prize is a pair of rosary beads. We are all enjoying our airplane race.\n\nRosie Morceine Shild\n\nBIRTHDAYS\n\nSome of the boys and girls did not know their birthdays. So Father made a long list of birthdays from the baptism register. The first one in our classroom to celebrate her birthday was Patricia Sun Shoe and she got a little parcel from Sister with these words on it: Happy Birthday Patricia.\n\nThe next one was Jos. Fanning Rabbit and the boys gave him their bumps. In the playroom all the boys have birthday parties often and all the boys are sure to get the bumps when their turn comes.\n\nMarguerite Cat Face\nPaul Scalp Lock\nJunior classroom:\n\nOur hockey game for March ended in favor of the White Roses, 7 to 6. This month we have a kind of curling game. There is a big rink on a yellow card board with a big stone for each side. So far the Red Roses have hit the middle of the circle twice. The White Roses do not need to think that they will win every game, but the end of the month will tell who are the winners.\n\nJane Drunken Chief\nLeo Pretty Young Man.\n\nOUTDOOR FUN\n\nWhen we go outside after supper we play baseball or football. We always have a good time with our sports. Sometimes the ex-pupils come to play with us. We played with them on Easter Sunday, but we do not think they are fast runners. They are probably getting too soft. But we hope they will come often so that we will beat them.\n\nFrancis Big Tobacco.\n\nHOLY WEEK\n\nOn Wednesday was the last day of school. Most of the children went to confession and we made our Easter duty on Thursday morning. We assisted at all the beautiful Church ceremonies on Holy Thursday, Holy Friday and Holy Saturday.\n\nOn Easter Sunday morning, the weather was not very nice, but many Indians came. Most of them had their breakfast in the children's dining room. We spent the rest of the day with our parents.\n\nWe also each had an Easter basket and other nice things.\n\nLouise Spring Chief.\n\nFOOTBALL GAME\n\nIn the afternoon of Easter Sunday, the weather cleared up and we had a foot-ball game with the ex-pupils. Everybody tried to make a score and many of us were kicked in the shin. The score was 2-1 the the outside boys said they were coming again soon to take their revenge.\n\nAleck Standing at the Door.\n\nHOLIDAY at HOME\n\nOn Easter Sunday, Father Riou told our parents to come and get us on Easter Monday if it was not too cold. After our breakfast we were in a hurry to put on our coats and go to the parlor when we were called. Most of us went home for the whole day. Some parents did not come for their children and they had to stay. We all had a good time at home.\n\nAll the boys and girls were smart and were back at the school by 8 o'clock. Sister was very glad and told us that Father did not mind when we go home as long as we come back on time. Father was very kind to let us have this holiday at home with our parents and we thank him for it.\n\nJosephine Prairie Chicken\nFREESTORK\n\nSister Superior made us a nice surprise on April 11th. After the morning recess our teacher came in the class room with an armful of books. She told us she had a big surprise, then she held up a fret work outfit that she had hidden under the books. We thank Sister Superior very much for this outfit. The tools will be used for wood work and fancy work for the Exhibition and for other articles too.\n\nLeila Right Hand.\n\nNEW JOURNAL.\n\nFather received a school paper from the children of Idaho.

If I can do that, then I shall be of great help to the people. Now, then, I am going to hunt and collect all the medicine skins I can find, and stay at home, take care of the lodge, gather wood, and cook plenty of fat meat along with the skins. We need I shall bring in plenty of fat meat.\n\nThe man went hunting every day, when the woman remained at home. One day, when the man was gone, she thought she heard singing; beautiful singing; but took where she would she could find no singers. She spoke to the man about it when he returned home that evening, and made him feel uneasy; if you hear it again, look about more carefully,\" he told her.\n\nShe heard it the next day, and this time located it right under the lodge. She went out to the bank of the river and looked at the bank; there under the water, were beaver \"gales in it,\" and beaver cuttings up on the sandy bottom; by that she knew that the lodges had been set up above a dark beaver's home, and that the beavers were the singers.\n\nShe went back to the lodges, lay down and plainly heard the sound. Their singing was so good that it was all she could do to stop listening to them and begin cooking the evening meal.\n\nThen Long Bull came home that night, she told him what she had learned, but he could not hear it plainly although he put his ear close to the ground. Nor could he hear the singing the next day, nor the next, although his women could hear it plainly. So now the woman got her knife and cut a round hole in the ground, and looking down he could see the beavers sitting in their homes, singing beautiful songs, and dancing strange and beautiful dances in time to them.\n\n\"Brothers, have pity on me,\" he cried. \"Oh! my younger brothers, teach me your medicine.\"\n\nThey looked up and saw him, and one answered, \"We have the hole that you have made, because the night disturbs us, and we will soon be with you.\" They soon came in through the doorway, four fine-looking men, beautifully dressed. They had changed themselves from beavers to men.\n\nLong Bull, \"Brother, what is it that you want of us? You can help us?\"\n\nLong Bull told them what it was; his great desire to obtain natural oaks and grow it for the people, that plant. Like us it is from the water, a very precious medicine, but before you can use it, you have to learn songs, much to learn. You have to learn all our songs and prayers and dances and different ceremonies, and gather for the ceremonies skin of every animal and bird that is of the water, one of each, except the beavers, and of them there must be two. You must not hunt all the other birds; but fish hook and all the other birds that get the fish from the life of the water. Why? Because there are two great life-givers in this world: the sun, which gives heat, and water, that makes growth, and in our ceremonies the skins of these different animals are symbols of the water. I shall collect them all, so teach me everything,\" Long Bull told them. And they began that very night, Long Bull hunted the animals and birds, brought in their skins for his women to carve, and night after night the beavers taught him their medicine, all the sacred prayers and dances and ceremonies of it. And at last he knew them all thoroughly.\n\nThen one night, the beaver chief handed him some stalks of natural oaks, the top\nIN AND ABOUT THE SCHOOL\n\nWhen is pay-day? When is pay-day?

While they were on the stage getting themselves ready they could hear the people coming in.\n\n\"Alright girls, Attention!\" The Prefect stood aside, then oh! the curtains were really going back and you could hear the first soft notes of the piano getting louder and louder. Then the girls sang forth their Jubilee Song. At the words \"Oh Ring! Ring! Ring!\" there was a soft tinkle of little bells. When the song was over the girls marched off the stage by rows.\n\nThen came the \"Little Grandma\" Play.\n\nAfter that the \"Costume Box\" was played. All the girls had sewing bags and bonnets.

His father did not believe in Christianity. Tom tried every way to get his father to become a Catholic, but his father did not listen to him. His mother died when he was only six years old. His grandmother took care of him.\n\nOne day when his father was very sick Tom went up to his room. He told his father how much he wished he were a member of the Catholic Church and he also told him about Jesus. Soon his father could not wriggle away. He told his son that he was very sorry that he had not listen to him before. He told Tom to call a priest. Now Tom was very happy to know he had converted his father. He tried in every way to please him while he was in bed.\n\nGrade IV\nA GREAT FRIGHT\n\nLouise and Mary had to stay home all alone in the house one evening. Their father had gone to work and their mother was visiting her friends quite a way off.\n\nThey didn't wish to go out that night with their mother because it was so cold. They thought they would rather stay home all alone and see what it was like.\n\nThey lived in the country and their nearest neighbors lived about three miles away from them.\n\nTheir house was only one story high, but it was always kept neat and tidy by Louise and Mary. It was painted white and the windows were trimmed with green.\n\nLouise and Mary had a good time playing with their dolls and their new set of dishes. They put all their dolls and dishes away and tidied up the room. They sat down near the fire for a little while telling stories. Louise was telling Mary a ghost story which was very exciting and frightening to hear. After that they both said each other good night and went to sleep.\n\nDuring the night Mary was awakened by a strange sound which frightened her very much. Mary got up and went to Louise's room. She found Louise wide awake too. Both girls were very frightened by the strange noise. They got up to see what it was all about. While they were wandering about the dark room they heard the same noise again. Mary was so frightened that she began to cry. She said to Louise: Perhaps it is one of the ghosts you were talking about last night. Louise was frightened too, but she didn't want to show it. She said: Never mind, let us get back to our room and forget about it. Mary went to her room very obediently but neither of the two slept for the rest of the night. At the break of day Mary got up and ran to Louise's room. They looked all about the room and at last they found out that it had been just the windmill outside squeaking. Louise and Mary looked at each other and burst into laughter at the thought of the noise which kept them awake that night.\n\nDoris Canadian\nOnce upon a time there was a little girl. Her name was Alice. She lived in a little red house with her father and mother and two sisters. Their father was a Protestant but they were Catholics. Every day he went to work and in the evening he came home. The priest used to go and visit the children. He told them to tell their father to go to Church.\n\nOne day the mother made a little altar for the children to pray at. She put two red candles and a little statue of the Virgin on it. The little children used to kneel beside the altar every day. Alice was the eldest in the family.\n\nOne evening when their father came home, all was set out for supper and they sat down to eat. But their father didn't want to sit so he got up and walked all around the room and said that someone was pushing him. He said over again \"There is someone in here\". His wife said to him: \"Oh you are mistaken\". The father said: \"No, there is someone in here\", so he got up from the table and went into the other room. When he came back he said: \"This is what made me think\". He said: \"I did not want any of this in here\". Alice ran to her mother and said: \"Oh, father we always pray that you will become Catholic\". They all knelt to say a little prayer for their father. Then they went to Church and their father went to Confession. They became Catholics. They went to Church every Sunday after that.\n\nMargaret answered\n\nGrade IV\n\nSPRING\n\nHurray for Spring!

He called his men and told them to throw him to the Inchcape Rock. He cut off the bell from the fleet. He said: \"The next who comes to the rock won't bless the Athlet.\"\n\nYears later the same man came back. The sky darkened with black clouds. They didn't hear any bell and soon after they bumped into the Inchcape Rock. The boat kept sinking down, down, down, until it was at the bottom.

Good health generally has prevailed; discipline has been easier and conduct better; we believe the religious life of the School is on the upgrade; a fine spirit of good fellowship and co-operation is increasingly manifest.\n\nYesterday was graduation day; twenty graduated, and prizes were distributed as follows: Grade I, Clara Thomas; Grade II, Catherine Walker; Grade III, Rosalie Wacanta; Grade IV, Henry Swanson; Grade V, Norman Belanger; Grade VI, John Charles Spence; Grade VII, Mary Ryder; Grade VIII, Agnes Flett; Grade IX, Irene Gaddie; Grade X, Gladys Bear. John Charles Spence had the highest average in all grades. The Inspector's report was gratifying in every particular. Eight students attended Collegiate, two in Grade XII, one in Domestic Art, and five taking Grade XI. Results of examinations of these grades are not yet available. A group of senior boys attended the Agricultural Short Course in Brandon.\n\nPlans are under way by which increased attention will be given to practical courses in the training of our pupils; the special class in cooking will be continued, emphasizing food values and balanced menus; courses of instruction are also planned in regard to field crops, stock raising, dairying, and bacteriology, poultry, and bee keeping. We are hoping that in a very few years we will be issuing certificates for all who attain certain standards in these Departments.\n\nThose desiring to send pupils, please send in your applications as early as possible. I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. A. Dyer\n\nPRINCIPAL.\n\nBrandon, Man.\nJune 26, 1939.\nOF SPECIAL NOTE.\n\nA number of changes are recorded in the personnel of the School Staff. Mr. W.M. Reid, senior teacher, being called to a position in the Treasury Department at Ottawa, had to leave at Easter time, and Mr. Ernest McIwen, B.A., is back with us again to supply the vacancy. We are pleased to announce that Mr. Norman McIwen, B.A., will take charge of this room for the coming School year. Mr. G.W. Mathias of Winnipeg, who has had wide experience in the north end with the Indian people, has come to the School as Engineer. Miss Margaret Cochrane, of Carlyle, Saskatchewan, now has charge of the Laundry. Miss L. Maguire of Portage la Prairie, has been appointed as Assistant in the Sewing Department. Mr. Walter Anderson of Moffat, Ontario, who supplied during the absence of Mr. Zoeland last winter, is remaining with us until after the Shorthorn Cattle Sale in September.\n\nA special feature of morning prayers during this calendar year is the rendering of a \"thought for the day,\" a concise nugget of truth. January was taken by the Staff members; the pupils supplied the \"thoughts\" for February, and did splendidly. Here is a sample of what they contributed: \"Life is not a goblet to be drained, but a measure to be filled.\" Our church officers and leaders kindly responded to our request and supply a \"thought for the day\" for the month of June, which gave us the opportunity of telling the School about our Church, its work and leaders; and we appreciate this service they have rendered us. Thirty ex-pupils gave \"thoughts\" for April, and we want them to have November also. Please send them in when you acknowledge receipt of this Year Book.\n\nNine of the girls took a St. John's Ambulance Course in Home Nursing and First Aid this winter. Classes were held once a week and the girls were keenly interested. Most of the work was done in the hospital wards, the girls learning how to make beds, take temperatures, give medicines, apply poultices, etc., as well as bandaging. The examination was held June 23; the girls all passed and will receive diplomas.\nTo my fellow graduates, who elected me as valedictorian, I wish to express my gratitude, for I count it both an honor and a privilege. I sincerely hope I shall prove worthy of this honor which has been bestowed upon me.\n\nIt is my purpose in this article to glance back over the years gone by and locate the purpose behind them; and then to glimpse ahead and see as far as young eyes can just what the future might hold for us who are graduating; and finally, to say farewell on behalf of the class to the School and its associates.\n\nOur days of school work have come to an end and we are upon the eve of a new life, a life which will call for the best we can offer. We are going out into a world which is full of difficulties and snares, and which is also rich with possibilities, charm and beauty; so we must walk cautiously and choose wisely.\n\nWe are at a critical stage in our life's drama. No longer shall we have the kindly guidance of our Principal and his Staff, but must come to our own decisions. We must face such enemies as carelessness, indifference, laziness, and many other things so apt to defeat our better selves. We are now the captain of our own ship of life. We shall decide our own course, fight the storms that arise, and seek the port that we want.\n\nAs we leave this School, may each of us realize his or her responsibility. We know that our School stands for the good in life and if we, graduates, can live as we have been taught, we shall not only find the best in life, but we shall strengthen this great School which is doing its utmost for our race. It will be strengthened by every successful graduate and weakened by every failure. Let us then resolve to do our best by our race and by those who have an interest in us.\nMay our personal lives reflect the great moral teaching of this School. We have been taught to be honest in all matters, pure in thought and deed, kind and sympathetic in our dealings with others, mindful of the rules that govern, good sports in our games, clean and neat about our appearance, and at all times to possess a deep sense of reverence for our God and Creator. These great lessons have been tested in the ages past and their worth proven. May we enrich our lives, and the lives of those around us by living at our best at all times.\n\nTo Dr. Doyle, and to the members of his Staff, I want to say that in the years to come, when we are searching out the course of our lives, he and his associates will be as bright beacon lights, lighting up the dark places, and all that we have learned will be as a store from which we can draw.\n\nI now come to the unpleasant task of saying farewell. We graduates shall have many pleasant memories of our experiences here. This building, and its surrounding beautiful gardens and trees have helped us to see God's work in nature; the twinkling of the city lights viewed from the dormitory windows, the rattle of the key in the door at six o'clock in the morning, filing in and out of chapel, and the quiet period of prayer, shall linger with us as long as we live.\n\nNow, I say farewell to the Staff and thank you sincerely for all you have done for our class; and to the students remaining, good-bye and may your days here be fruitful; and to my fellow graduates, Godspeed, and success in all you undertake; and may we all be spared to meet again.\n\nIrene Black.\n\nOne ship drives East, the other drives West\nBy the self-same wind that blows.\n'Tis the set of the sails and not the gales\nThat decides which way it goes.\nWith the coming of spring our badminton, hockey, and basketball equipment was tucked away; and our attention turned to outdoor sports. Football, softball, and \"treck\" took the attention of the boys, while softball and folkdancing occupied the girls. The enthusiasm in all branches of sport has been wonderful. At the beginning of the season many defeats came our way, but now as the season wears on our teams are commencing to hold their own.\n\nROYAL SPORTS DAY.\n\nThe first great victory of the season was the three mile road race. Albert Thompson, our star three-miler, running against a field of eight competitors, fought his way through to victory. Second place was taken by Hanson Hart, who edged out Angus Anderson after a hard struggle, giving the first three places to the School.\n\nThe afternoon of the 24th was spent in the playing of games on the athletic grounds. Four mixed softball teams were chosen and an exciting tournament followed. No one is quite sure which team was the winner but everyone reports a good time.\nWe have a number of teams in this branch of our sports, and space does not permit a full discussion of what each team has accomplished. Our senior girls, after losing two games at the commencement of the season, defeated Alexander Junior High, 13-0. The following week, however, the Earl Oxford Girls turned them back with a score of 5-3.\n\nFOOTBALL.\n\nOur senior football has not been so successful. They, as yet, have not won \u2014 but are still hopeful. The juniors have a better record, having won two and lost one.\n\nEXCHANGE GAMES WITH PORTAGE.\n\nOn May 20th a junior football team of the Portage Indian School played an exhibition game here. It was a real old battle, which resulted in a victory for us of 3-1. The return game, played two weeks later at Portage, was even closer. In fact all that saved our team was the stellar performance of our goalie, Edwin Ryder, who just could not be beaten. Charlie Crow scored the only goal, to give us the game, 1-0.\n\nPortage, however, came back on June 17th with a team of junior girls softballers that \"turned the trick\". They hit and ran like professionals. Space does not permit mention of the score.\n\nGOLFING.\n\nDuring the past few weeks the fancy of our most \"sporty athletes\" seems to be golfing. Anything resembling the shape of a golf stick is used and there is no shortage of balls. The occasional shout of \"fore\" and the \"whiz\" of the ball may be heard when work is done in the evening.\nITEMS OF INTEREST\n\nWe are delighted to note that the Hon. Ivan Schultz, Minister of Education, has included the name of Miss Gladys Haywane, a recent graduate from our School, who for the past year has been teaching in the Sunny Valley School, as one of the rural teachers to receive as a reward for merit, $60.00 toward her summer school course this year. Congratulations, Gladys.\n\nThe 24th of May was a red-letter day on the School calendar. After the sports programme in the afternoon, and the picnic supper at night, the climax of the day was the trip to town to see Their Majesties, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. An excellent view could be had from the section reserved for us\u2014in fact the little children in the front rows could almost touch the Royal Couple. The thrill of seeing their King and his lovely Queen is one which the pupils will never forget.\n\nThe best reports have come in concerning Miss Elsie McLaren who has completed her year teaching at Cross Lake. She has rendered valuable service in connection with the C.G.I.T. programme which she organized for the girls. We are looking forward with pleasure to seeing her in the near future, as she is out to attend summer school.\n\nAs a further help in home making, a small group of the senior girls have taken a course of eight lessons in cooking, food values, and balanced menus. keen interest and pleasure pervaded all the classes. The ginger bread and pies were much appreciated by the Staff!\n\nWe congratulate Mr. William M. Reid on having received his B.A. Degree.\n\nJohn Bomar is now employed at the Round Lake School.\n\nMaurice Gray is back on his tractor job at Broadview Agency.\nDuring the past year a large number of graduates have visited the School, and we are always glad to see them. On graduation day no less than fourteen former pupils were in the School, among them Ewart Monias and Mrs. Monias (who was Jessie Bear) and little son Leslie, from Nelson House, where Ewart is now the teacher; Walter Maidwood, a graduate of the Agricultural College, now engaged on the University Farm at Winnipeg; Dora Maidwood who is west on a holiday from Hamilton where she is employed; Marita Hart, now on the staff at the Round Lake Indian Residential School; the other nine were young men and women employed on farms and in homes in Brandon and vicinity.\n\nTen years ago the fine School herd of Dual-Purpose Shorthorns was established, with some splendid foundation cows and an imported sire; and every year secures more than its share of prizes in the Brandon Fair. For the past two years a group from this herd stood first in the local field day judging contest. The herd has so increased that we are compelled this year to hold a sale of our surplus stock, which will take place on September 27.\n\nThe annual School Banquet was held on April 21. \"The Marionettes of Life\" was the theme chosen. The tables were artistically decorated with clowns, favours, and place cards, all carrying out the marionette motif. Miss Gladys Dreaver made a very charming chairman. Her remarks and introductions were very ably handled. The marionette play was put on by the group of girls who had been working on it during the winter. Mrs. Cragg gave the address which was based on the theme of the banquet and was greatly enjoyed by all. Rev. and Mrs. James, Inspector and Mrs. Robertson, Dr. Cragg, Mr. Reid, Miss Davies, and Miss R. Yeomans were among the guests of the evening. All voted it one of the best banquets yet.\n\nMarionettes! What a fascinating hobby! To see cloth and cotton-batting forming into a distinct personality under one's hand is indeed a thrilling experience. This thrill came to seven of our C.G.I.T. girls last winter. Will any one of us forget our cross' old Joanne, our weak-kneed Pedro, the old-fashioned Lord and Lady Baltimore, and best of all, dear old Wilfred, our comical clown. I think Staff and pupils alike were amazed when the marionettes performed so successfully at the Banquet in April; and\u2014whisper it low!\u2014we, behind the scenes felt pricks of pride running up and down our spines as we heard the laughter and applause coming from beyond the footlights. Altogether we voted marionettes a most interesting and profitable project, and we hope to do more with it next year.\nGRADUATES\n\nLAVINA BEAR. A very intelligent girl, and full of fun is Lav. At the Collegiate she is reported to be the all-star basketball player. It's hard to believe, isn't it? We've never seen the good cooking Lavina can do, but they say she can make good gingerbread. Is it true, Lav?\n\nMABEL ANTHONY. One of the Old School is our little Mexican. Wish we knew Mabel a first class seamstress is going out into the world. She's good at baseball and basketball too, and a perfect hair dresser\u2014if you don't believe it, ask Miss Smith.\n\nLILSIE HART. A quiet bookworm in our little Gray Goat, very popular with the girls. And if you girls ever want some curls on the top of your head, go to Lilsie, she'll gladly do it.\n\nIRMA BLACK. Another song-bird leaving us. What will we do without Irma. Have you seen her pitch? Boy! She hasn't done much of it this year, but if you did see her you wouldn't see the ball.\n\nNORA WADDEN. A heavy bitter and an excellent softball player is about to remove herself from the B.I.S. She's a good basketball player and skater\u2014in fact a good all round sport. She wishes they could play hockey on the green grass, oh, Nora?\n\nFRANCES LODGE. The girl with the hearty laugh. A good singer and a fine dancer, and the School's kindergarten teacher.\n\nAGNES HAYARE. Better known as \"Bea\". A good all round sport, fond of softball and any kind of sport. She's going to have a baseball team of her own in full swing during the summer months, and we hope it's a success. Good luck, \"Bea\".\nMORLEY WILLIAMS. A great favourite with all the boys, a friend to anyone in need, a hard worker in both sport and manual labour. In walking he has a \"gait\" that is all his own.\n\nALBERT THOMPSON. Better known as \"John Big John\". We owe our thanks to Albert for bringing home the \"bacon\" in the three mile road race. A good basketball player, and a fast forward football player.\n\nRODNEY THOMAS. A rather quiet fellow, deeply interested in sports. A good worker, and a real friend when one is needed.\n\nARTHUR MURDOCK. Better known as \"Butcher\", a hard worker, a good goal custodian in hockey, and a sensation as a full-back in football.\n\nCHARLIE CROW. A very talkative fellow, full of comedy and brainy jokes; a good golfer as far as \"socking the ball\" is concerned; a tricky football player, and somewhat of a sports commentator.\n\nSAM WADELESSA. A rather boisterous young man. Occasionally gets his words mixed. A real tease to the other boys, but knows when to stop.\n\nFRASER KESTICK. \"Bricky\" has been here only eight months, but in that time he has made many friends. We don't know him as well as some of the pupils who have been here longer, but we do know that when he strikes those balls he's really meaning it; and a real good sport is our Drummer Boy.\n\n-ooOoo-\n\nA \"THOUGHT\" FOR THE GRADUATES.\n\nOh, do not pray for easy lives. Pray to be stronger men! Do not pray for tasks equal to your powers. Pray for powers equal to your tasks! Then the doing of your work shall be no miracle. But you shall be a miracle. Even as you shall wonder at yourself, at the richness of life which has come in you by the grace of God.\n\nPhillips Brooks.\nMOCCASIN NEWS\n\nHOBBEMA - ALBERTA\nGreetings\n\nThe Locosin News will continue with its work at this school. Mr. Frohri is the editor and our boys and girls remain feature artists and reporters.\n\nI take this occasion to wish both boys and girls the best of success in their new work, the boys, on the farm and in their new Manual Training Shop; the girls in the different occupations offered them by a practical course on Household Economics.\n\nAnd as Christmas and the New Year will soon be here, I wish to address my greetings to the staff, to the children of the School and to all the readers of our little paper. A most blessed Christmas to yours and may God's Blessings descend upon you and upon all you do throughout the New Year!\nThere is not much space here for excuses concerning our very lengthy silence. We will just try to assure you that starting this year with our Christmas number, we will continue hereafter as regularly as before.\n\nHere's this for New Year's Resolution. Let's hope it sticks to it till the end of the school year!\n\nIt may be news to many of you to know that in addition to our school, which holds a large recreation hall for the boys in the basement, four classrooms above this and a dormitory for the boys on its second storey, alongside of this building a general manual training shop has been built. This serves the purpose of giving the boys a good practical preparation for adult life on the farm. They spend their mornings in the classroom; while their afternoons are spent working on the farm, repairing shoes or doing work in the shop. Household economics, on the other hand, is the afternoon occupation of the girls.\n\nTo complete this, health and recreation are combined in a physical training course given by an instructor, not only to the school boys but also to the young men of the Reserve, who wish to come to the meetings. And above all, the spiritual welfare of the people of the Reserves is continually striving for.\n\nIt may well be mentioned here that the staff has already considered the possibility of the school being transferred to other locations until next year. We have been sent here to take over this old church. In the name of the children our heartfelt thanks are addressed to all of them and a lot of others, though it may be, is directed to all the newest arrivals to our School.\n\nSpecial mention for our School, Sir Isaac Brock, Justice and Strength, must be made for your Spanish Touch of Spirit and Character. Doubtless the students will find that they will last for a long time, which will be amply enough to read in the near future. The Thunder Report! Our sincere wishes for success!\n\nIt is also with heartfelt sincerity that our hearts rise for you, dear friends, of all ages and conditions, who have worked so hard and faithfully for the advancement of the new school, and who have been so kind and generous in your support of the school. May God bless you all around through the coming year, and may His grace and mercy be with you always.\n\nIn conclusion, we wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy and Successful New Year!\nI come to school to learn how to read write count and speak English\n\nAlex Oldpan\n\nEx. I\nWe wish a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to everybody.\n\nIf you're good, Santa Claus will bring you many things.\n\nSam Yellowbird\nQUIZ\n\n1. When was meat the highest?\n2.

He said Mass for us at 6:30. All the children came to Mass and sang. After Mass he spoke to us, for a few minutes. He told us to be good children to please Jesus, and to try to receive him often.\n\nEdgerton Houle, Grade II.\n\nWe are always very glad when some Fathers come and visit us. Our kind Father Routier came twice since we are back from home. We love him very much because he speaks nice to us. He told us that we should receive Jesus daily if we want to remain good.\n\nWilfred McFeeters, Grade II.\n\nOUR CLASS ROOM\n\nOur class room is full this year. We have 43 pupils in our grade. We have three new pupils from Good Fish Lake.\n\nBeatrice Favel, Grade 2\nENTERPRISE WORK.\n\nWe forget to tell you in our last Magazine, that we are doing some enterprise work this year. We began the last of November. One for each of our grades. Grade 4 has one on \"Life of the Eskimos\". Grades VII and VIII did one on \"Poland\" and we are still at ours about a trip to \"China\" and \"Japan\". We gather information and pictures to help explain our stories. We have what we call the community enterprise on the art board and each boy has his enterprise book which is about the same as the one we are doing in common. The Trip to Japan required twenty illustrated stories. For example, in the first we try to think what the country looks like and show that by pictures along with this first story.\n\nThe second is getting on the train from St. Paul. We get a picture that looks as much as possible like a train stepped at St. Paul Station and the boys getting on. Then we study the train itself, the engine, the tender coach and the rail-\nThe next story is done in the same way about Edmonton and the fourth, about crossing the great plains and the mountains. We follow along to Vancouver and learn about a port city, the harbor with its warfs and finally we explore the ship that is to take us across. What stories and pictures we produce are about the big ocean! We found the work so pleasant that we learned writing spelling and geography without knowing that we did so; because we were on an exciting trip far away Japan. We had stories and pictures about the Chinese eating with chopsticks and they took us through their city in their jinrickshas. We visited their tea and rice fields and we went fishing with them.\n\nEach of these required a separate story and picture to illustrate. When visitors come to our school we like to show them our enterprise work.\n\nFrancis Janvier\n\nGrade VI.\nA VISIT FROM FATHER RHEAUME.\n\nOn Thursday January the 11th we had the visit of Father E. Rheaume Principal of Hobema School. A year ago he was assistant Principal here. He taught us Catechism and he helped us along with our sports. We were all glad to see him back. When he went away we were sorry to see him leave us so soon. It was pleasant to see him again and we hope that he will visit us again often.\n\nNorbert Gibeault.\n\nGrade IV.\n\nPRAISE FOR THE HOCKEY!\n\nThis year our skating rink is big. It is about the size of the one in St. Paul. We could not make the ice for a long time, because it was not cold enough.\n\nNow our ice is very good and we enjoy skating in the daytime. We also like to skate at night because we have light. We have hockey from two to four\nWe have two teams for the school. Father Pratt is the President of our club and Mr. Pitre is our Manager. Next week we are going to play with a team and we hope to win........ In our next paper we will tell you if we won and which team played with us.\n\nAlbert Zapatak.\n\nGrade VII.\nOUR SKATING RINK.\n\nThis year we have a lovely \"skating rink\". Every one of the boys except the four smallest ones have a pair of skates. Santa Claus brought 4 dozens of new skates for those who didn't have any. Every one was so happy!!!! During the Christmas Vacation we enjoyed ourselves very much on the skating rink.\n\nFreddie Cadwe. Grade II.\n\nOUR CHRISTMAS VACATION.\n\nWe had much fun at Christmas. Santa brought me a nice pair of skates, and a gun, and a bag of candy.\n\nGeorge Youngchief. Grade II.\n\nI was very happy at Christmas. I went to pray at the Crib. My mother bought me a nice doll with clothes to dress her up.\n\nBeatrice Hunter. Grade II.\nFather Pratt is very kind to us. When he went to Edmonton he begged the people to give him some toys for us. They were very generous because Father had enough to give to everyone a little bit. Some had guns, some had cars, some had hockey sticks, others had skates. We also had lots of candies. I had a little car and when my mama came I gave it to my little brother.\n\nNorman Wood, Grade II.\n\nOur Christmas Tree.\n\nThe Christmas Tree was in the girls' room. Fran\u00e7ois Janvier was dressed up like Santa Claus. He gave the things to the little ones. We sang for him. We were so happy to have our toys.\n\nElie Minoose, Grade II.\n\nSchool Again.\n\nOn the 2nd of January we were at school again. We were all glad to see our teachers. We will study hard now because we promised the little Jesus at Christmas.\n\nMary Barton, Grade II.\nMR. BOUVIER'S PICTURE SHOW\n\nWe just had a good picture show and it was talkies. It was given by Mr. Bouvier of Edmonton. The first picture was funny and it made us laugh very much. In the next picture we were shown the visit of the King and Queen to Canada. That was a very beautiful picture. Then it showed the King going through some of the streets of Edmonton. I thought maybe we could see where the Blue Quills' bunch were sitting; when we went there last summer. We also saw a picture of the war. It showed how they fight on land, in the air and on the sea. We think that war must be very bad.\n\nRaphael Blackman,\nGrade VI.\n\nARCHBISHOP J. H. MACDONALD AT BLUE QUILLS\n\nHis excellency Archbishop Macdonald paid us a visit to our school on January the 12th. He came about noon. We were all gathered in the girls' room when he arrived. We greeted him with a song sung by all the boys and girls. He spoke to us and\nWe were happy to hear him. He told us to always do our work as well as we could. The good things we learn, we should tell our parents and friends. He said that we should learn better than our parents because the schools are better now. He gave us all his blessing, and a nice \"holiday\"... May his Excellency be able to come and see us again soon. We love him very much.\n\nThomas Cardinal.\n\nGrade VI.\n\nOUR CHRISTMAS CONCERT.\n\nOn the Thursday before Christmas we gave the Concert, we had been preparing for sometimes. The three Fathers of the school were present, the sisters also, and the men of the staff. There were also the families of the married men who work for the school. All the pupils were in the room also. It made a good big crowd. Many of the sisters had prepared some boys and girls to give some numbers. Some were Drills and some\nWe like the one where Santa Claus comes in and the one where small boys and girls were dressed like old-time men and women. The pupils in the senior boy's room gave a little play taken from our school books. It is called \"Twice is too much\". We were dressed like people in Arabia. It made the people laugh many times.\n\nDuring the programme the boys and the girls read a pretty Address to our Reverend Fathers, thanking them for being so good and kind to them. The sisters worked very hard to get this concert ready and we thank them very much.\n\nDavid Martial.\n\nGrade VI.\n\nHello dear old Santa Claus................\n\nI would like to have a nice pair of skates...........\n\nDon't forget to come to Blue Quills, there are lots of little Indian boys and girls that would like to see you.\n\nCatherine Leth.\n\nGrade II.\nChristmas Programs\n\n1.

We were very glad to have him come and we all tried to do our best to pray and listen to him when he preached to us. We will never forget his kind words and in return we will pray for him.\n\nAlice Bashneyuk\u2014Grade VII.\n\nBad News.\n\nOn Dec. 4th my step-mother died at the hospital in St. Paul. She had been in the hospital for two years with tuberculosis. The Sister in the hospital told me that she had a good death. When she first came to the hospital she was not a Catholic but she asked to become one soon after she went there. On Dec. 6th Father Bouchard brought me home for the funeral. When I got home I saw my auntie, Mrs. David Makokie, who was\ndying too. She died on Dec. 6th at night. She left five children, one was a little baby-boy. She was buried on Dec. 9th and my step-mother, Mrs. Ben Moses, was buried on Dec. 8th.\n\nAlice Neyettatik\u2014Grade VI.\n\nA Banquet for The Children of Mary.\n\nOn the 6th of Dec., we had a pleasant surprise. Our directress, Sister Champagne, told us that the children of Mary were going to have a banquet. It was to be held in our Recreation Room. When we learned this how we hustled around to help prepare the table. At 12 o'clock the table was set. How nice it looked with all kinds of delicious food! Rev. Father Pratt was present and he seemed to enjoy it very much and we surely all did too. We thank Father Pratt and the Sisters for being so devoted to prepare our banquet.\n\nAlice Paskweyak \u2014 Grade VII.\nA Trip to St. Paul.\n\nOn Dec. 8th after supper all the Children of Mary got ready to go to St. Paul. Before going Rev. Father Pratt gave us each ten cents to spend at the Bazaar which was held that same evening. We went in the big truck. Our directress Sister Champagne, with another sister came with us. We first went to the Bazaar, then at half past seven we went to the Church, where some of the girls from St. Paul were to be received into the Sodality of the Children of Mary.\n\nRev. Father Lavoie, who is in charge of the Children of Mary at St. Paul, gave us a sermon on taking the Blessed Virgin Mary for our Mother. He first spoke in English and then in French. The people said the Hears in French. After this the new members said their Act of Consecration. These new members and the Aspirants sang very nice hymns. Then came the\nShe stayed there for eleven years. The two daughters stayed in the Convent. At last the police found out that the mother was not guilty so she was set free. She went to see her two girls but they did not know their mother.\n\nWe enjoyed this picture show. There were some of the Indians who came in to see it.\n\nThen there was another on the Sunday before Christmas and on Christmas Day. Then the last one was on Thursday, Jan. 11th.\n\nWe enjoyed the last show because it was about the Royal Visit. We heard the King and the Queen speak. Then Mr. Bouvier showed us about the war. We saw all the big machines that they use in the war. We always enjoy the talking movies. Minnie Houle\u2014Grade VI.\n\nOur Christmas Concert.\n\nBefore Christmas the teachers were preparing a concert for Christmas. On Dec. 21st we\nBenediction of the Blessed Sacrament. After Benediction we came back home. We enjoyed our trip very much and we hope to have another one some other time.\n\nCaroline Janvier\u2014Grade VII.\n\nTalking Movies.\n\nMr. Bouvier came to give us talking movies four times this year. We enjoyed them very much.\n\nThe first talking movies we saw was about a lady who was called a drunkard. The doctor said that she had killed her little son. Then they brought her to the Court. Then the Judge asked her if she had killed her little son. She said, \"No.\" Then a man brought the lady's two daughters in the Court. They stood in the middle of the floor. The Judge asked them questions about their mother. However, they brought the mother to jail.\nhad the Concert for the Reverend Fathers in the Boys' Room.\n\nOne of the most interesting items was a Motion Song about Rheumatism by twelve little girls and boys. They were dressed up like little old men and women.\n\nThere was a recitation by Beatrice Hunter, \"Christmas Comes but Once a Year\". But she said she wished it would come every day.\n\nAt the end when the Concert was over Rev. Father Balter spoke a few words to us. He mentioned about the recitation. He said that Christmas could come every day by receiving Holy Communion every morning.\n\nWe gave the Concert on two other days for our parents.\n\nJane Whiskyjack\u2014Grade VI.\n\nNews Item\n\nOn Dec. 29th, 1939 at St. Theresa's\nHospital, St. Paul, a daughter was born to Mr. and Mrs. Alphonse Makokis of Saddle Lake. Mrs. Makokis was formerly Margaret Pankweyak.\n\nA New Convent at St. Paul.\n\nFather Rheaume with another priest from Hobbema visited our School. We were very glad to see him again. They came for the Blessing of the new convent of the Sisters of the Assumption at St. Paul. On Thursday, Jan. 11th four Sisters and three Fathers from here went over. About three o'clock in the afternoon, the new convent was blessed by Archbishop MacDonald of Edmonton. In the evening the Archbishop, the Fathers and some other men, who were invited, had a banquet. The next morning the Archbishop said Mass at the convent.\n\nOn his way to Edmonton, His Excellency stopped here to see the children. We sang for him.\nand he spoke to us. His Excellency asked us if we would like to have a holiday and we all said, \"Yes\". He did not stay long but we were all very glad to see him again.\n\nCaroline Piche -- Grade VI.\n\nExamination for Tuberculosis.\n\nOn January 16th, Dr. McPherson of Edmonton came to our School. He took the skin test for tuberculosis of the new pupils and those who were negative to the test last year. On Jan. 16th, and 17th, he examined the lungs of all the pupils in the School. I hope that none of the pupils will have T.B.\n\nAlice Nayottatik -- Grade VI.\n\nSenior Girls' Class-room.\n\nThe girls in grades V, VI, VII are making a scrap-book for cooking recipes. We receive the Home Service Magazine, Canadian Utilities, Calgary. We paste these recipes in our book.\n\nG. Piche -- Gr. VI.\nCHRISTMAS AT BLUE QUILLS\n\nWe had a very pleasant and merry Christmas this year. Our school was beautifully decorated for the occasion. The main corridor was pretty with its decorations, and so were our class room and recreation rooms, refectory etc. We enjoyed our midnight Mass very much; and we like to look at the little Jesus in the Crib. The sisters always have the so pretty. We gave our Christmas Concert and had plenty of toys and Christmas cheer. As usual the Fathers were very good to us, and made a pleasure for all the pupils. We are thanking them in this letter for all this. We promise to be good and do our best. There has not been one run-away this year. We try to be grateful. We also thank Father for our big skating rink, and for giving all the boys a nice pair of skates.\n\nHenry Shirts Grade VII.\n\nOne of our pupils Albert Cardinal has entered St. John's College in Edmonton to continue his course. Albert has spent his Christmas holidays with us and has written an article about his college life.\n\nMy Life At St. John's College\n\nOn September 6th 1939 I left for Edmonton to go\nSt. John's College. I was with four boys and a priest from St. Paul. On our way we had a good time but we came to a place where the road was not very good and we had a flat tire. We fixed up the tire and away we went. We started from Blue Quill School around eight o'clock and we arrived at the college at half-past twelve. We took our suit cases out from the car and brought them in.\n\nAt first I was not very happy to be away from my friends of Blue Quill's. This lasted about two months but now everything is alright. I hope I will keep on with the college and also finish my time. We are five Indian boys. We started our class work on Sept. 8th and we were to get done on Dec. 13th for the Christmas holidays.\n\nReverend Father Walter and P. Pratt sometimes come to the college to see me whenever they come to the city of Edmonton. We played a lot of hockey games already. There are three skating rinks at the\ncollege. One for the big boys, one for the midgets and one for the little boys.\n\nNow I am on my holidays. I came back on the train to St. Paul to see my friends. I found the trip pretty long to amuse myself. We are a big bunch of boys from St. Paul who go to St. John's College. We have about two weeks of vacation and I enjoy them. I skate with the boys. Their skating rink is a little bit bigger this year. The ice is not very good yet because they started late but it will get better. I hope we may always keep friendly to each other and in a near future we shall be happy to meet together.\n\nAlbert Cardinal\n\nThe Rheumatiz Song\n\nIn one number of our Christmas concert we were six little boys and girls dressed up as little old men women. We put on our black suits and the girls wore black dresses and bonnets. We went downstairs for our piece. This is what we sang. We old folks like to\nto chat a while of this when we were young, the many happy days we spent. The jolly songs we sang but now our backs are bent with ages and wrinkled lines on our face but worst of all is this\u2014so we're off the rheumatiz. So we all say such! Our goes my rheumatiz. Everybody was laughing at our grins. The old man took their lips and smoked. One old woman passed some snuff to the others. Then we all danced together.\n\nErnest Collins\n\nGrade 3\n\nBINGO PARTY\n\nWe had a bingo party in the kitchen during our holidays. Sr. Chibert was very delighted to give us a bingo party that night. We boys who work for the kitchen were glad to have it. We were twelve boys playing Bingo and then we had a good lunch after the game Sister gave prizes to the winners.\nWe also rewarded us for our work with pictures and handkerchiefs. We enjoyed our party very much.\n\nGene Steinhauer\nGrade 3.\n\nThe Boys' Bingo Party\n\nThe boys who help to fix up the Boy's clothes had a Bingo party on January 8th. There were sixteen boys at the party. We played bingo for a long time and other nice prizes. We had oranges and sweet biscuits for our lunch. Mr. Tuck came to see how much we were enjoying ourselves. We treated him with sweets and coffee. Then we went to bed. We enjoyed our party very much. We thank Sr. Perreault for having given us this pleasure.\n\nHarry Cardinal\nGrade 3.\nCHOOOUTLA SCHOOL\u2014CARCROSS\n\n(Rev. H. C. M. Grant)\n\nThe wonderful winter weather has been much enjoyed by pupils and staff here, many happy hours of sleighing, skating and skiing have been had and the boys and girls have been doing very well. Good old Santa found us in our new quarters and was as good as ever to the boys and girls of the school. On December 23rd the several branches of the W.A. took part in a pageant commemorating some of the best known carols, the pageant was very beautiful and reflected much credit on our teacher who had worked very hard in getting together suitable costumes. At other times we have always had a store of costumes in the attic of the school to draw from, but this time there was no attic to visit. After the Pageant various members of our club were on hand a brain trust to enable the W.A. to raise a few extra dollars towards the Archbishop Stringer and Johnson Memorial Fund. Everyone was well satisfied with the success of the whole undertaking. Our thanks are due to the local station agent who kindly allowed us to use the Section House for the pageant and for the two parties for the children and their friends which were given one at Christmas and one at New Year. Without this kindly cooperation many of our native friends would not have attended and our present quarters would scarcely permit us to accommodate the number who attend these gatherings.\n\nThe various branches of the W.A. held their annual meetings early in January and the election of officers took place and all reports of last year's work have been forwarded to the Diocese Officers.\n\nWe welcome to our staff Miss J. Wright as Boys' Supervisor; Miss H. Hewett as Kitchen Matron and Captain Johannes of the Church Army as General Assistant.\n\nST. SAVIOUR'S CHURCH\n\n(Rev. H. C. M. Grant)\n\nOur regular services have been very well attended this winter, our largest congregation being on Christmas Eve when a very busy carol service was held and much enjoyed. The church was tastefully decorated by the staff and elder girls of the Chootla School. On Christmas day Captain Johannes came preacher and gave a very helpful address.\n\nThe scholars of the Sunday School had their Christmas party on the last Saturday of the year and began by enjoying an elephant's ride and ended up by the children receiving gifts and candles from the tree.\n\nThe village W.A. were again glad to be able to give gifts to some forty-five children of Carcross Village and district. These were hung on the Chootla School tree and given out by old Santa himself.\n\nIn spite of the war clouds which hang over us we look back with a year of prayer and encouragement at St. Saviour's Church for which we thank God and pray for richer blessings in the year that is ahead.\nJoys of a Travelling Missionary\n\nThe Editor has asked for material with the work dealing with the tasks of the travelling Missionary among the native people of the Yukon. There is so much to tell that one is at a loss to know where to begin or what to say. The work to be done is great, yet we are able to accomplish very little in comparison therewith. However, the means and the work blessed by the Lord are plentiful.\n\nThe Bishop of the Diocese visited the mission House for a ten day period. He was joined by Rev. W. Vasey (Rev. W. Vasey) who was also visiting the mission House. The Bishop of the Diocese went to the afternoon of December 24th, with the Christmas tree and party for the children. Nineteen children were present and a happy time was had by all. The confirmation was held of two of our Indian boys, the eldest of the white settlement, girls were presented, after which gifts were distributed to all by Miss L. V. Brower on behalf of Santa Claus, and the children finished the evening by singing carols. On Sunday, December 29th, several of the services and the school children were well known during Evening prayer by Rev. Mr. Brower, followed by Christmas Day service at 11 a.m., and our thanks to the W.A. for their generous gift of toys for the young children who attended. This morning's services were fittingly concluded with a service of Holy Baptism.\n\nAn Indian camp is sighted as we travel along the river and almost at once the children see our small red canoe and come out to meet us. We land, pitch our tents and make camp. Our camp is simple, yet we are able to accomplish very little in comparison therewith, yet the men come forward to shake hands while the women stand behind respectfully to await those they may meet. The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few. (Amen) Bill Little\n\nFor the past few years Rev. Mr. Brower has been working among the Indians in the various In- dian encampments along the Yukon River, and he has been very successful in converting many to the faith. This involves travelling by boat and horseback through the wilderness, learning and speaking the two languages, French and English, native and missionary. The Indians are very friendly and welcoming, and the talk while news is being exchanged is very interesting. The regular duties of school teaching do transmit the teachings of the Bible and movements of the church. I am sure that the Indians will benefit from my stay here, and I am confident that they will be converted to the faith. It is a privilege to be able to serve in such a capacity, and I am grateful for the opportunity to do so.\n\nFOXES AND MINK Livestock and Pelts\n\nWATSON'S FUR FARM\n\nGARFIELD, YUKON, CANADA\nST. MARY'S\nMayo\n\nThe world silver market has caused a good deal of uncertainty and some anxiety in the Mayo district. There are doubts as to whether operations will continue, but the people generally are optimistic. There have been a number of people who have moved out for various reasons due to the outbreak of war, but on the whole things are going along normally. Some of the placer workings have had a good year.\n\nThe Discussion Group which met last year is getting under way again with enthusiasm.\n\nThe Church was very tastefully decorated for the Harvest Thanksgiving service on the first Sunday in September. The service was very hearty and well attended. We were very fortunate in the day we chose as heavy frost killed all the flowers on the Monday night following.\n\nThe W. A. Sale of Work and Supper on November 3rd, was an unqualified success with a total of close to five hundred dollars raised, and a demonstration on the part of the residents of their appreciation of the church in their midst.\n\nST. MARK'S CHURCH\nMayo Indian Village\n\nThe congregation are happy and proud of their new church bell which was procured by the Bishop. It was put in place and used for the first time on the last Sunday in October.\n\nThe services have had to be somewhat irregular in September and October at the Indian village partly due to the hunting season, and also to the slow freeze-up. For the first time in memory the Stewart River jammed about three miles above Mayo, with the result that there is open water from Mayo to the Indian Village. Usually the river jams at Mayo. But the channel is narrow and there is enough ice flowing to make the use of an outboard motor difficult.\n\nThose who knew the late Rev. John Murray will be interested to hear of the wedding in October of his daughter, Mary, to David Moses.\n\nHIGH GRADE\nFOXES AND MINK\nLivestock and Pelts\nWATSON'S FUR FARM\nCARCROSS, YUKON, CANADA\nVACATION TIME\n\nWhen the long vacation comes,\nThen no more must call in vain\nAll the myriad boyhood chums\nFrom outside the schoolroom pane.\nBird and brook and beckoning flowers\nSky and grass and sun in rhyme\u2014\nComrades such as these are ours\nIn the long vacation time.\n\nO'er the shady swimming hole\nBends the willow as of yore,\nLike a gnarled enchanted troll\nWatching by a treasure store.\nAnd the pickurcl, Tom Grey,\nLaughs his cloe in pantomime\nAs he thinks of jokos he'll play\nIn the long vacation time.\n\nWoodland mysteries await\nJust the touch of youthful hands,\nTo unlock the magic gate\nLeading into wondrous lands.\nAnd the fish must deeper glide,\nAnd the hangbird higher climb,\nAnd the chipmunk quicker hide,\nIn the long vacation time.\n\nWhen the long vacation comes,\nIn the belfry sleeps the bell;\nUndisturbed the blackboard sums,\nLies the crayon where it fell.\nAnd the river goes the brook,\nAnd the hills are crusted sublime,\nAnd the fields are golden seas,\nIn the long vacation time.\nA Timely Review and Appreciation\n\nAt the end of this school year I wish to express my thanks to the parents who have cooperated with the staff towards a better education for their children. At the same time, I beg of all others to try to understand a little better the aim of the school, totally directed towards the entire welfare of their children, be it physically or morally, for the present or for the future.\n\nYou are all aware now, that with the cooperation of the Indian Agency, we have established a regular manual training course at this school. During the past year we were given some 50 acres of land by the Ermineskin Band. This will help immensely towards the training of the boys in farm work. We have also received sets of tools from the Indian Department. These are used by the boys in their manual training shop.\n\nSatisfying results have been obtained by the boys at their work on our new buildings, on the farm and in the shop. Our senior boys have had the opportunity of following a course on physical training, which has brought them better health, skill in the performance of many thrilling stunts, and great improvement in posture. In the line of sports our boys have worthily played for the honor of the school.\n\nOur senior girls have also accomplished some wonderful work under the direction of the Sisters of the Assumption. Those who have attended the School Exhibit and Concert held here on June the 19th, have seen the results of a year's patient labor at sewing, bead work, knitting, reed work, weaving, cooking and music. The girls also work in the garden, look after the chickens and occasionally milk the cows. In a word, they are well prepared to undertake the daily task, which is the common lot of a housewife living on the farm.\n\nNext September an ex-pupils' Club will be organized and directed by the Principal and the school teachers. Meetings will be held every month. A sewing Club will also be included in this scheme.\n\nI wish to take this opportunity to congratulate all the children for the good work they have been doing this year, and to each and every one of them, I want to wish the best of holidays. Amuse yourselves well, but remember at all times what you have been taught at school. Be kind and useful at home. Make good use of your religion, which is and always will be the guiding light of your life and the secret of your happiness.\n\nEd. Rh\u00e9aume O.M.I.\nPrincipal\n\nLOCAL STATISTICS.......\n\nThis is the first in a series of articles, which we hope to continue next year. It has been compiled in order to answer the many queries by those who are more particularly interested in the standard of educational attainment of Indian children. What is said here, however, cannot be repeated for Indian children elsewhere. It stands for this school only.\n\nConsidering local obstacles, such as lower standard of ideals, late entry of children to school, parents who insist on keeping their children past the normal age of admittance, or who wish to withdraw them before they have reached the age limit of sixteen, one can realize the difficulties that have impeded, and that unfortunately still impede the\nprogress of education.\n\nThe figures below show the number of children entering this school at specified ages, as well as the percentage of grade attainment upon dismissal.\n\nSince July 1st 1895 to the present day, nearly 700 children have been admitted. However, a certain number of children, who have passed away while at school, and others whose ages have remained unknown, have not been classified here. The following figures are therefore computed from 551 entries in the School Register.\n\n| Age on entering | No. of chil. | Age on entering | No. of chil. |\n|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|\n| School          | 'entering at' | School          | 'entering at' |\n|                 | this age     |                 | this age     |\n| 3               | 2            | 10              | 80           |\n| 4               | 1            | 11              | 63           |\n| 5               | 9            | 12              | 53           |\n| 6               | 21           | 13              | 35           |\n| 7               | 95           | 14              | 18           |\n| 8               | 94           | 15              | 9            |\n| 9               | 70           | 16              | 1            |\n\nTo date the average grade attainment upon dismissal can be classified thus:\n\n| Grade I         | 13.6%        | Grade V         | 16%          |\n| Grade II        | 11           | Grade VI        | 13           |\n| Grade III       | 14           | Grade VII       | 7            |\n| Grade IV        | 24           | Grade VIII      | 14           |\n\nThis summary, we believe, shows quite clearly the need of cooperation on the part of the parents, at least as far as the early entry of the children is concerned. However, as will be shown later, very few early entries attain the normal standard of white children. (To be continued).\n\nTwo or three important events have taken place here recently. Thanks to the cooperation of the Edmonton Journal and their correspondent at Hobbema, Miss W. McLeod, we are now able to copy the following articles:\n\nCEREMONY MARKS OPENING OF CHURCH\nColorful Parade Of Indians Welcomes Catholic Archbishop\n\nHOBBERMA RESERVE\n\nHobbema, June 11 - Official opening and blessing of the new Roman Catholic church at the Indian Residential school, on the Ermineskin reserve, was held recently. Archbishop J.H. MacDonald, of Edmonton, conducted the opening.\n\nOn his arrival he was met at the Indian agency, half a mile east of the church and school, by a number of horseback riders carrying flags and banners and headed by Constable McGregor, of the R.C.M.P.\n\nThe students' band of St. John's College, Edmonton, furnished the music in the parade.\n\nThe church was crowded and among those present included: Father A. Anglair, vicar provincial of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate; Father A. Madean, rector of St. John's College, Edmonton; Father Donohue, St. Joseph's seminary, Edmonton; Father McDonald, Wetaskiwin; Bro. Ansbert, rector of St. Joseph's College; Father T. Bouchard, St. Paul; Father P. G\u00e9meche, of Winterburn.\n\nArchbishop MacDonald complimented Bro. Kael for his excellent work in building the new church. Rev. Father Rh\u00e9aume is the parish priest of the new church, assisted by Father Moulin, who has been a missionary among the Indian people here for about 35 years.\n\nA banquet was served after the service.\nRESIDENTIAL SCHOOL HOLDS OPEN HOUSE\n\nHOPEMA, June 21.\u2014Emmiskin Indian Residential School held open house for the public, exhibiting all their handcraft work for two years. Reed work, beadwork, painting, drawing, quilting, knitting, weaving, and blanket making on their own loom were shown by the girls.\n\nIn the morning they entertained the village school children by showing them all through the school and putting on a program. Tea was served in the afternoon, gifts were also shown through the school, and a program was staged by the children.\n\nLoved by speeches by Col. A.G. Blakes, deputy minister of education, and Mr. J.H. Ross, director for health recreation in Alberta.\n\nEMMISKIN DEBATE AMNESTY FOUND\n\nDecision to donate an ambulance to the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps was made at a Sunday meeting of the Samsen, Kootenay, and South Bull bands of the Cree Indians. It will be on the goldfield reserve. It was announced by Col. A.G. Blakes, who reserve Indian agent, members of the bands had signed an agreement made by local chiefs to donate the proceeds from the sale of the ambulance to the Samsen band.\n\nThe bands are composed of about 1,700 members. They will make the donation primarily to the reserve. Alberta unit of the corps the money will be drawn from interest on funds owned by the bands, which ordinarily would be distributed among members on a per capita basis.\n\nCol. and Mrs. A.G. Blakes have recently returned from their holidays in the east.\n\nSCHOOL SECTION\n\nBefore starting this section we wish to express our most sincere sympathies to Rev. Father Molin, who recently received word from France of the passing away of his mother. The children of the Erminski School wishing to show the gratitude for all he has done for them, have offered a rich spiritual bouquet.\n\nOur \"Graduates\"\n\nThis is a flattering name indeed for the eleven girls and ten boys who are about to be discharged from our school. All these girls and all those boys respectfully will be leaving with the same baggage of clothing. However this cannot be said of the baggage of learning. As the following list will show, all the grades from 1 to 7 excepting grade 5 are represented. Let us hope that in a very few years our graduates will all leave fully equipped with all the learning they can acquire during their stay at school.\n\nHere are their names ages and grades:\n\nMary Jane Potts, 18, Grade 7\nSam Potts, 16, Grade 5\nLawrence Soozy, 16, Grade 5\nSophie Neepoose, 16, Grade 7\nCharles Roasting, 16, Grade 5\nJustine Oliphant, 19, Grade 7\nGeorge Fourways, 16, Grade 5\nCalline T.

Ed.\nGrade II\n\nA Pleasant Afternoon\n\nOne afternoon after recess we went for a rest in the woods. We took our lunch and played ball over there. We had much fun. Boys and girls had a race. The six first ones got two buns as a reward. Then we came back home. We were glad to have such a fine time. It was a rest from school work.\n\nDelilah Omoose\n\nSoft ball games.\n\nThe children from our school are counting the days left before their summer vacation.

We had a good time running around. Mr. Frost gave us some coins which we spent in the store. We bought all kinds of things with them. We went to the library and read our newspapers.\n\nThen we had a tug-of-war match. Naturally the boys were so eager against the girls. Naturally the girls won. We played softball and then came back to school and got ready for the next day's work.\n\nThe weather was fine and we had a good time.\n\nA Jumble Contest\n\nThis spring we followed a Geography Jumble Contest, which was given by the \"Library Magazine.\" We had to find the names of famous towns and cities in North America. The hard part was to unmix the letters of every word and we spent many of our free periods trying to find those names. Everything went all right until the last two or three weeks when the contest became \"mucks\" and there were 5 words we could not unmix. There were 100 mixed-up words in this contest. Here are the ones we could not find:\n\nGastisim, Highcooking, Nakbetronkou, Harboyno, Utigoodum, Bird peasea, Ogwenlrb, Liberty this month but we did not need them. If you have good brains try to find these names.\n\nGood Luck! - Joe (Tordrimond) Bull Gr. 5.\n\nHunting Trips\n\nSince spring has come we often go out in the bush to hunt for some eggs. We have several kinds of eggs now. We keep them in our classroom. Then we bring them in and take a pin and make two holes at each end so that we can blow the fuses out.\n\nWe are starting to have a nice collection of birds' eggs. Here are the samples we have:\n\nrow magpie, chi coidie, sparrow robin, blackbird, woodpecker and wild canaries or yellow birds.\n\nWe destroyed many crow's eggs and some magpies!\n\nPatriot Yellowbird Gr. 5\n\nATTENTION MR. GLADONI\n\nWe received a letter from our ex-super-\n\nvisor Mr. Gladoni. He wrote that he was very pleased with the boys' progress. He said that they were doing well and that he was very proud of them.\n\nI will name them. They are G. Poureyes, J. Ball, J. Shortnook, M. Lightening, V. Rattlesnake, P. Hill, H. Barfallo, H. Wolfe and myself. Only Shortnook and M. Lightening cried because they had their bumps hard.\n\nI suppose many of you boys and girls had the bumps already and found it tough. - George Gr. 5.\nBoys... talk about a suitcases!...\n\nTen boys will be leaving the school soon. They have each a suitcase full of blankets and some new clothes. They are very proud of their suitcases especially George Fournier and Wilfrid (Cheapskate) Dion who speak about them every minute or the day. Here is their picture. They want everybody to see their suitcases. Even if we laugh at them and make fun of them, they will succeed in their suitcases. Luck and success in their suitcases.\n\nDionne 1110. Monk Gr. 4\n\nOur Trip to Edmonton\n\nOn April 24th 8 boys went to Edmonton to see the Physical Training display at the Arena. We went with Mr. Ross and Mr. Crooks and as we had time to visit our clothes store, Langlois showed us all over the store. We also walked around 101st Street and had a good look at the Army & Navy Dept. store the 5-10-15 cents store and many others. But it was Wednesday and we could not go inside. So we had supper and then went to the airport where we saw six aeroplanes. I was surprised when I saw the biggest aeroplane in the P.A.F. display. It was very nice but the part I liked best was when four men did all kinds of tricks. When it was finished we said \"God save the King\" and then came home to bed. It was 11:30 p.m.\n\nFrancis a Child Gr. 4\n\nOur Work in the Garden\n\nThe other day after finishing our work at the house we went to help Sister in the garden. We weeded it, and after we had gone over all the rows growing our vegetables, we went to play till supper time. I like to know how to take care of the garden and how to go the best out of it.\n\nTherese Munde Gr. 4\n\nFire Drill\n\nTwo weeks ago, during the night while we were sleeping soundly, the fire alarm went off. Many of us did not hear but Sister came and clapped her hands very loudly and called to Sister in the other dormitory and said: \"Fire!\" We jumped out of bed, I ran to get my little sister, and we were all outside in a very few minutes. As soon as we reached the ground, we turned our heads to look to see where the fire was, but there was none. It was 2:30 in the morning. We went back to bed very happy to get a few more hours of sleep again.\n\nTherese Munde Gr. 4\nDoleful Quarantine and the Blessing of the New Church\n\n(Special to the Moccasin News)\n\nCallina Lightning Allie Minde\n\nWe were quarantined for six weeks before the Blessing of the new church. Our little sister was the first one to be sick and she was taken to the hospital at once so that we would not be quarantined at the same time. The Blessing of the new church was held on the side of the new school where we could see and hear them. They played for us for about an hour and finished by singing a few songs. We all enjoyed it very much and we want to thank them.\n\nCONCERT\n\nBy Lawrence Mackanaw Gr.5\n\nOn May 19th we had a concert for Father Rh\u00e9aume. The girls gave us an operetta. It was about a little girl who wanted to become a poppy and a poppy who wanted to become a little girl. A fairy changed the little girl into a poppy and the poppy took the little girl's place. But both became unhappy for having changed until they were turned into what they were beforehand. After that the boys gave a display of physical training. There was a tour of us G. Four eyes, J. Bull, L. Scootie and myself. On June 19th, we gave this same concert for many visitors from Edmonton, Calgary, Fort Saskatchewan, Poplar Forest, Okanagan, Colonels Lakes, Doctor McNally, Deputy Minister of Education, Mr. Ross, Director of Youth Training in Alberta, Mr. McLean and they said that they hoped like wise that more of our friends will come to see so much.\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nFor Household and Chicken Yard\n\nKitchen Stool - The top of this stool is 12 inches across.

However, we were surprised one day to hear that Doctor Hill had come to see if there was any progress made in the treatments and also if there were any new cases. But the children of our school must be doing their share by taking better care of their eyes because all of them were cured\u2014led from the \"Black List\" by Dr. Robb!\nThe boys have had a very active softball season.

Although they lost by a score of 17-2 in favor of the other side, the game was played fairly.\n\nOccasional games of basketball, baseball, and football are played by the seniors. Sometimes they play on display, such as for example, when the school band plays at the town hall. Other times they play on the playground or on the field where the seniors practice their routines and songs.\n\nAgainst the Hobbes Reserve School boys and girls just the senior team played. The Hobbes School will no doubt improve next year.\n\n1. Why do hens only lay at night?\n2. Why is a farmer like a hen?\n3. When may two people be said to be half-witted?\n4.

The editors have done an excellent job in presenting the various aspects of our diocese. We particularly enjoyed the article by Rev. Geoffrey P. Gover of Edmonton, titled \"The Story of Appointments and Appeals.\" It provides insight and foresight into the workings of our diocese.\n\nRev. Geoffrey P. Gover is the Editor-in-Chief of Edmonton, the official publication of the Edmonton Diocese. He has been a member of the diocese for many years and has served as a parish priest in several parishes within the diocese. His article provides a comprehensive overview of the various aspects of our diocese, including the story of appointments and appeals.\n\nIn conclusion, we highly recommend this annual to all members of the Edmonton Diocese. It is a valuable resource that provides insight and foresight into the workings of our diocese.\n\nWARNING! The First Quarterly Installments for 1940 Are Now Overdue.\n\nHALF THE SOLUTION\n\nThe recent Special Appeal for the Red Cross was successful, but there is still much work to be done. We urge everyone to continue supporting the cause of the Red Cross.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n1. In spite of Special Appeal, M.S.C.C. will still have to face shortage for the current year of approximately $35,000.00.\n\n2. M.S.C.C. must work on $5 of receipts.\n\nMORALS\n\n1. Pay 1940 Apportionments in full!\n\n2. Pay 1940 Apportionments in full!\nThen the school master of Exeter was asked to visit a church in Canterbury. His task was to explain his religious beliefs to the congregation.\n\nThat \"hardworking man,\" as he was called in the press, visited the Diocese of Athabasca in 1923. He died from hunger and exhaustion during his time there.\n\nThe diocese, located in the northern part of Canada, is vast and difficult to reach by road. The mission has been approved by the Board of Missions.\n\nBishop Hobart had visited the diocese earlier, but he returned to England without seeing much progress. However, his successor continued the work, and things have improved significantly.\n\nWomen's Work in Western Canada\n\nAmong the White Settlers in the Diocese of Athabasca\n\nIt is interesting to learn how the services of trained Churchwomen are being used in western Canada. In the diocese\u5fd9there are bitter winters, snow and storms, which may keep the Bishop from visitting the district every few weeks. To the more northern races, the Diocese of Athabasca is new territory to be entered. In the diocese of Bristol and Caledonia under the famous Mrs. Rector and Mrs. Stott, there is no such lack of work. Thousands have been trained there by means of missionary schools, skilled helpers and serious devotion. This is partly due to the cold and difficulties of climate, but other causes have also been helpful. Peace River and other distant settlements have seen a dramatic growth in their church life. Visitors from the east have been pouring into Peace River and other surrounding areas for missionary training.\n\nMiss Hazel and the Western Canada Caravan Fund\n\nThrough the generosity of Mr. Eagleson, Miss Hazel's home, near the Peoria Forks station, will always be remembered with thankfulness. A church and fellow residents may be among those who benefited from this action.\n\nPeople at lonely places, like Fort Good Hope, always needed help from others. Dick Bowden, a former resident of the area, was among those who helped the people. Dick's wife,who lived nearby, supported the work at the request of the Bishop.\n\nMiss Hazel's home was built in 1931. Miss Nolen's House, built in 1932, was used as a hospital. Miss Wood, an assistant Secretary, lived in the house.\n\nMiss Eagleson and Miss Hazel are now cared for through the S S U T, under Miss Eagleson. Miss Eagleson and Miss Hazel are the only full-time Christian Witnesses in the north of North America.\n\nDiocese of Montreal\n\nThe eighty-first annual session of the Diocese of Montreal was held recently.\n\nThe Bishop explained that the sessions are held annually, except when there is a vacancy in the position of Bishop. The last day of the session was spent in prayer and fasting.\n\nMiss Eagleson and Miss Hazel are both members of the Diocese of Montreal.\n\nThe theme of the session was \"Christian Unity.\"\n\nThe Rev. H.M. Lafe has announced the resignation of Mr. and Mrs. Hayes, of the Church of the Good Shepherd.\n\nThe Rev. 1. H. Holy Orders, who had been ordained a deacon, is now being ordained as a priest.\n\nMiss Eagleson and Miss Hazel are being sent back to England by the Diocese of Montreal, as they are needed there.\n\nMrs. Eagleson and Miss Hazel are the only full-time Christian Witnesses in the north of North America.\nThe Lore of the Month \u2014 June\n\nBy C.J.

Fathers and Sisters for their kind doings on our behalf. We do not always exteriorly show our love and gratitude, but on the eve of our departure we feel it is our duty to ring out a most sincere and heartfelt \"THANK YOU\".\n\nIt must also be remembered that we have in Mr. Ostrander, a very interested and kind Indian Agent: His monthly school inspections were a proof of his love for us all. Was it not Mr. Ostrander who first suggested that our school put up our Principal's concert in Battleford and was it not he again who arranged all means of transportation. See the following pages. We wish to thank him for his interest in us.\n\nKate Tootoosis.\nBattleford Trip\n\nBefore writing about our trip to Battleford, we are happy to let you read an extract from the newspaper Phoenix Star.\n\nBATTLEFORD: \"Camouflage\" was the name of a play excellently performed on Thursday evening in Battleford Town Hall by a number of pupils of the Indian Residential School. The performance was part of a fine program staged in aid of the Battleford Patriotic Service League and contained a rhythm band selection, mimeograph exhibition, garland drill, chorus dialogue and an exhibition of pantomime. Sixty children took part in the entertainment which was a remarkable demonstration of thorough and effective training. The children appeared in a variety of costumes and the several items gave delight to their many patrons. J.P. Ostrander of the Indian Office made a fitting reference to the accomplishments of the children and the interest of the school in the patriotic work of the community.\n\nOur Principal's Feast\n\nAs usual, we celebrated our Principal's feast not exactly on his birthday but the week after, which brought the solemnity of the occasion and many were excited and couldn't stay in place. The bell rang at last for the people on the stage ready to lift the curtain at open. It would be too long to enumerate the details of the concert and so I shall give you the full programme:\n\n- Choir\n- Tin Soldier Parade\n- Forebearance\n- Camouflage Spectacles\n- Garland Drill\n- Happy Children We\n- Orchestra\n- Camouflage\n- The Strike\n\nAfter the concert, Father Anglin spoke kind words to us and best of all, granted a long, long holiday. The next morning, we sang at Low Mass and we did our best to please God, but also to please our good Principal who we love very much, and for whom we pray every day at mass.\n\nDoree Benson.\n\nWallace's drawing shows you the many cars took us to Battleford. We left on May 9th at 11:30 A.M. to arrive in Battleford for a last rehearsal during the afternoon. Then around 5 Sister Superior took us to the school ground where we enjoyed an open air lunch. Since the concert was taking place at 8 P.M., we hurried back to the Hall for the last preparations.\n\nAt last, the solemn hour did ring and here we were with our brightest smiles, doing the best we could. Happily\nthings went on quite smoothly amid cheers and applause, so that by 10.30 we were packing up for home. Now, let's tell you that we were anxious to care for our beds and dream of this happy day by 1 a.m., but the 60 children and their teachers were in the real land of dreams, dear friends, thanks to the organizers of this trip to Battleford, where we were glad to meet our white friends.\n\nM. Madeleine Lalibert\u00e9\n\nwatching... the War!\n\nAlthough we will be leaving in a few days for our holidays, our hearts are sad and we cannot help sighing at the thought that so many poor soldiers won't enjoy a much needed rest for another unlimited time.\n\nThe drastic news of Nazis progress has stirred our fervor and since 6 or 7 days I know that the girls have been making a novena a day during 9 days; we, the boys did not make novenas, but we have been making sacrifices and other special prayers, so that the Allies may win the final victory.\n\nLong Live The King!\n\nWallace Simagnis\n\nMonth of May\n\nI imagine that we were not the only ones to pray more and better than usual during the daily devotions to our dear Mother in Heaven. This war has awakened our faith and shows us that God's anger is overflowing. We therefore asked our Heavenly Queen to stop and appease God's Justice and to grant us peace. We did our best to praise the Mother of God, not only in our hearts but externally, by singing her glories as well as we could. At the beginning of the month all the grades went up to the choir, but then we took turns. The girls were alone for the second week, then as of May 2nd and the kindergarten class. These latter ones were very sweet to hear and had the honor of singing twice. May our prayers be heard! Lucia Sipiweskan.\n\nFresh Paint\n\nIn our Easter edition we spoke about the men breaking down the plastered walls throughout the school. All this is completed and nice cream color ed walls and ceilings are to be seen. Mr. Tellier & B. & L. Righard were on the job. Mr. Dupont worked the wood but when it was done he went back home, surely enjoyed his jiggling and good jokes, as well as those of the three painters who were always in the best of humour.\n\nAll is over now and we can enjoy living in a nice clean school which we... will try to keep this way after our holidays.\n\nFrank Benson\nTwo Good Hikes\n\nDuring the first days of spring, we were told that the ice was \"melting\" up in the river near the ferry. We asked Sister Directrice to go and watch this rather unusual float.\n\nPermission granted, we all climbed up and started at 2 p.m. Three Sisters came by the \"steps\" and finally arrived to see great blocks of ice racing down the current. We aimed at them but our bullets sunk in the river and the big chunks of ice remained unhurt.\n\nWe then took another road to come back. We could soon hear the first group having lots of fun; they did not stop to tell us anything. But we soon discovered that the river had flooded the road and it was still very muddy. We enjoyed it, but the Sisters were not so pleased; some had brand new shoes, others nice clean dresses. Yet they managed to hang on the branches near by and save themselves from the biggest holes.\n\nThe second hike was to Battle River, but the boys with Father Allard were the only ones to go. They started off at 12:30 p.m. and had a 10 mile walk that day. Half way down, they took off their shoes, rested a while, had their lunch and reached the river to enjoy a swim. Nobody would have ever guessed that, because they came back as black as tigers. I imagine they had a very good sleep that night, and that Father Allard's legs were rather stiff the next day.\n\nPHILomene Peychev\u2014G. Acheynum\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nA Chinaman passing through the customs was asked his name, \"Ah Choot,\" he replied.\n\nThe custom man started at him and said in a puzzled voice: \"Is that your native name?\"\n\n\"No, I had it translated in English.\"\n\n\"Then what is your native name?\"\n\n\"Ah Choot.\"\nOur First Communion\n\nOn Trinity Sunday, we were happy children because little Jesus came to visit us for the first time. We asked Him to make us good and to bless our dear Parents and to stop the war. Kind Sister Superior gave us a very good breakfast and very nice holy pictures, and prayer-beads! Now little Jesus often comes to us, and we love Him very much!\n\nFlorestine Gaudre.\n\nThe Month of May\n\nThe last week of May we were invited to sing for the B.V. Mary in the church for the benediction. All the little ones went. We were very glad to sing to our dear Mother Mary. We sang the hymn \"Mother dearest, Mother fairest.\" We hope to go again! Goodbye! Francis Albert\n\nHappy Holidays to all our Friends!\n\nGilbert Favel.\nBad luck for us all! Why? Well, we haven't the pleasure of the lamps burnt out. Mr. Desjardin took it to Battleford unfortunately no repairs can be made there, so Mr. Desjardin will be sending an order to the U.S.A. to have them done in favour of world peace. The Fathers had theirs burnt too, and Father Allard was seen coming back and forth with our radio under his arm, morning & night, in order to follow the news.\n\nCherish we will be listening during the holidays, because we will be here during that time, my sisters!\n\nNadeline and I. \u2014ooo 0 oo\u2014\n\nA Visitor\n\nLast week we had the pleasure of greeting a Sister of the Providence from the Battleford Hospital. She came for the first time among Indians children far up north. Her name is Sr. Alfred-de-la-Croix.\n\nWhen we went for our class picnic she came along and even raced not with us but with the Sisters. She seems to be very jolly and we felt a little sad whom we saw her going back to her patients. We will pray for her so that God will grant her a real strong health.\n\nCecilia Wright.\n\nGardening\n\nSpring, with its beautifying effect always brings in more work to those who really want to make life worth living. So one morning after the usual breakfast show we were called to the garden. Here Father Augin was seen coming along to show us how to soil the school's garden.\n\nWe set to work and soon radishes, corn, beans, onions, turnips, lettuce, beans, peas, cucumbers, etc., etc., were very glad to have the opportunity of earning this work so that when we have our own farms, we will be able to put into practice the famous enterprise getting ready for winter.\n\nAfter our garden is springing up magically, I hope that when harvest time comes along we will enjoy eating a lot of vegetables which are so healthy to boys and girls.\n\nEncantamiento Kisikotagan\n\nRG-M.R. ?????\n\nA few weeks ago many heads were seen peeping in the Parlor. No wonder, two mountain boys were there asking to see Mr. Smith, the school boy. What was the matter? No one could say, until after a half-hour's time Mr. Smith came out. Bunton was called, you can imagine how anxious all felt. Ray and Horatio and I were then called. We were questioned about a certain man from the reserve. When they asked their questions our answers were written down. At last after this half-hour (which seemed longer than that) was passed they left us but our hearts were beating very fast, all thought we acted as witness. I know what it feels to be facing a real police, and hope this won't happen any more.\n\nLeo Roy Jr.\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nDr. Wall's Visit\n\nDuring the whole year, Sister Marie-de-la-Protection the nursing sister treated the trachoma cases; and one day she told us that Dr. Wall was coming to our school. He comes to see if there is any new cases. In the treatments and if there are any new cases.\n\nAs expected no arrived and examined us all. To his satisfaction and much more to our delight, he cancelled our cases from the white list! We now have only 10 cases, 3 of which have copper stick, while the other were treated with copper chloride ointment and a tablet which has been discontinued recently. We were glad of the result and we wish to thank Sister for the good care she has given to all.\n\nNew Back Stop\n\nWe would be very ungrateful if we did not thank Father for the excellent job he did in the making of our football backstop. I think that in one way we have been very lucky to have it because the boys have got through it. Of course they had their skating rink during winter, so that our turn has come.\n\nIt would be very interesting for me to tell you about the boy's games played after the diamond was through, but I should be cheating all the girls who refer to the Sport Page. A thousand thanks, Father Tetreault for all your work done in the girls' school yard.\n\nThe Demas Oil Well\n\nI wonder why the Gr. 7 and 9 girls don't speak about their trip to the Oil Well? Whatever the reason is, I'm sure the best I can do is tell you what they said their teacher to go and visit the Oil Well. Sister gave her consent but said to go and visit the Oil Well. Sister sent them to Rev. Fr. Principal. You should have seen them rushing to the Rectory. Their wings were very swift that morning and their faces shinning brightly when they came out. They had the permission of the Rev. Fr. Tetreault to take the car down in his car. As they arrived, they were a little afraid to see that the employees were drilling the well. They were surprised to see the size of the pipes sent into the ground as well as the height of the \"tower\" holding the giant pally. Father took them all over and explained the functioning of the steam engine, the use of the different instruments of the steam engine, a little more of an oil and gas well. All thanked the kind Father for the ride and enjoyed a good dinner.\n\nAfter working hard the whole year through and harder still during the Promotion tests, we were very happy to get the result of our year's work. So last Sunday, the promotions were given as well as the money prizes. Father Anglin gives each year. We were all in the girls' hall on the stage where seen Father Anglin, our good Principal, all the sisters including the visiting Sr. of the Providence. To our joy and relief, only a few failed quite a number passed conditionally, yet the majority passed.\n\nHere are the names of those who were first in class:\n\nGr. 8: M.

How can it be proved that a horse has six legs?\n2. What has a mouth but never talks?\n3. What has three feet and cannot walk?\n4. Why does a book resemble a tree in summer?\n5.

It will be reduced to a quarterly number, however, due to the many duties incumbent on the new staff as well as their financial conditions.\n\nOur earnest endeavor will be to make up for quantity by quality, and since all great undertakings have humble beginnings, we hope that \"Crowfoot Arrows\" will grow with the years and fulfill our optimistic dreams.\n\nTo our many friends we present---\n\n\"CROWFOOT ARROWS\".\nCROWFOOT ARROWS.\n\nSpeed thee onward, little arrows,\nTo the land of rising sunlight,\nTo the lands of golden glory\nTo the far-off horo of East-wind.\n\nTo the purple clouds of sunset,\nO'er the lofty mountains westward\nWhere the fiery sun descending\nBurns his way across the heavens.\n\nTowards the melancholy North-wind,\nMeaning sadly thro' the pine trees,\nTo the land of mourning silence,\nSpeed thee onward on thy errand.\n\nSpeed thee towards the gentle south-wind,\nTo the land of laughing sunshine,\nTo the land of birds and flowers\nTo the land of peace and freedom.\n\nGo where meadows wave with blossoms,\nGo where woodlands ring with music,\nGo where trees are dark with foliage,\nGo where icy snows now gather.\n\nNoble arrows, bring a message,\nWords of peace, of tender greeting,\nWords that break the spell of sorrow,\nWords that raise the heart to heaven.\n\nTo the Master of all music,\nTo the Master of all singing,\nTo the great and loving Spirit,\nBring the memories of our dear ones.\n\nSpeed thee onwards to the North-wind,\nSpeed thee onwards to the South-wind,\nTo the East-wind and the West-wind,\nLittle arrows, bring our greetings.\nSept. 3rd...\n\nSchool Bells Ring.\n\nOn Sept. 3rd, the school bells called us back to school. We were very glad to start school again. All the boys and girls that were in my grade had passed their grades, so we moved to the Senior class. My brother and three other small boys came to school for the first time. There are six new girls since school opened. We are happy in our school and we hope this year will be a good one all through.\n\nAlma Crowchief.\n\nSept. 27th...\n\nSister Superior's Feast.\n\nOn Sept. 27th, it was Sister Superior's patronal feast. We all went to mass, sang hymns and received Holy Communion for her intentions. After our meal and work, we went to the hall and played games, Chinese checkers, Monopoly, etc. Sister Superior came and played Bingo with us, and gave each winner a prize. Sister Superior gave us a treat of candy and peanuts, and we enjoyed ourselves very much on that day. We hope she will give us more holidays of this kind.\n\nElizabeth Little Chief.\n\nSept. 30th...\n\nPicture Shows.\n\nWe have been having catechism picture shows since last Sept., and we like them very much. We pay 1\u00a2 for a show and when Sister has enough she gets a moving picture reel with the money. Some of the movies we have so far are: Robinson Crusoe, Son of Tarzan, The Little Defender, Australia, Tin Hoss, London on Parade and The Lightning War, also some Indian and Educational pictures. The Lightning War was very exciting, but sad; it gave us an idea of the sufferings the people of Europe had to endure when their country was bombed. I am glad I am a Canadian. We all pray for peace every day.\n\nClara Calf Robe.\n\nOct. 15th...\n\nForty Hours Devotion and Retreat.\n\nOur annual retreat begins today and co-incides with the ceremonies of Forty Hours Devotion. Rev. Fr. Olde, the pastor of Holy Family parish in Calgary presides at all the exercises and instructions, and knows how to hold the interest of his audience. We will strive to put into practice the fatherly advice he gives us, and make our lives truly Christian ones in order to save our souls and help others to do so.\n\nMichael Cat Face.\n\nOct. 16th...\n\nX-Ray and Clinic.\n\nOur clinic and X-Ray days took place this month. The car made many trips before we all had our turn. When we had finished some of us went to pay a visit to Helen Spring Chief who is a patient at the hospital. After a few weeks two doctors of the clinic returned for the reports. There are just a few observation cases this year which goes to show that the good care we are getting is gradually stamping out the dreaded disease of T.B.\n\nMaggie Storm.\nOct. 23rd.\n\nNetoy-kissus: Loves,\n\nWe are all sorry to see our dear Father Lessard leave us today. He has gone to take charge of the parish in Cochrane. When he left we were all standing at the gate to bid him a last Goodbye. He had a new car; it is a coupe. Later on Father Gaudet went to see him; when he came back he told us that Father Lessard would come to visit us the following week. We were very glad to see him again. We thanked him for his visit and asked him to come again. We hope you are well, Father.\n\nBetsy Cutter.\n\nGod English.\n\nWhen we came back in Sept., Sister Superior told us that she wanted us to learn the English language very well, and that we were to speak English all the time except on Thursdays and Sundays. The one that spoke the most English was to wear a medal with a gold cross upon it, so under the cross the word \"English\".\n\nOne day Sister Superior came into the senior class-room and asked who had won the medal. All the boys and girls said that Clarence LeHugh and I spoke the most, so we drew for the prize. I got the prize, which was one dollar, but as Clarence had worked hard too, I gave him half of it. We thanked Sister Superior for her kindness and promised to do our very best in \"English\".\n\nFlorence Carrier.\n\nOct. 30th.\n\n\"Spooks\"\n\nWe had our Halloween party on Thursday night. We dressed in our best and went downstairs to the boy's hall, which was nicely decorated for the occasion. The Fathers and Sisters were there also, and when they arrived we started to play games. The first game was blowing out candles in a pumpkin with our eyes blindfolded. Sister named those that were to play so that every one would have the chance at some game. The last one was playing a tail on a large cat. Every winner had a prize after the games were over. Sister Superior gave us some candies, popcorn, and apples. A movie of Felix the Cat at the north pole ended our party and we went to bed tired but happy.\n\nCecile Slough.\n\nNov. 9th.\n\nPrimary teacher leaves.\n\nOur primary teacher, Sister Ernest Marie, left for her annual retreat and did not return. We all miss her very much, especially her pupils, who has gone to Peace River, and Sister Superior is now teaching the babies until a new teacher comes.\n\nJulia Thayer Sams.\n\nA.B.C. Apple Pie.\n\n1. Take pie- B. cut off a piece- C. cut another slice- D. deal with some of the waste- E. elevated the plate- F. thought to have it down- G. got it from them- H. hid it from G.- I. lent fond of pie- J. joined K. kept his place- L. longed her more- M. might steal it- N. nodded No. O. opened his mouth so wider- P. put a large piece inside- Q. quarrelled for the rest- R. run away with the crust- S. stole the inside- T. took the plate- U. unhappy at the fate- V. vexed at the whole affair- W. wondered what to do- X. Y. and Z all cried Boo Hoo what an apple pie.\nDomestic Science.\n\nThis year the girls of Grades V and VI have Domestic Science training in the morning. We do not go to school at all in the morning. We take turns at sewing, cooking, baking, etc. In our sewing course we learn to do plain sewing, embroidery, mending and knitting. Last month Sister told us we were to make a set of new aprons soon; we wanted to make them right away, so she let us start. When the aprons are finished we will make a set of dresses. We will wear our new aprons at Easter.\n\nIn our cooking classes we learn how to cook, to prepare and serve meals. We make fancy dishes and like to decorate the cakes and salads, etc. This will help us for our future life, so that we will be good housekeepers later on.\n\nFlorence Carrier.\n\nNov. 17th\n\nDeath of one of our Pupils.\n\nHelen Spring Chief was a T.B. patient; she spent a month in the school infirmary then went to the San. After a few months she came home and then stayed at the hospital. Then one Friday night, Sister told me to go with one of Helen's best friends to see her as she was dying. We went with Father Gaudet who gave her the last Sacraments. My older sister was there too, Helen was glad to see us. On the following Sunday the nurse phoned to say that she had died. It was a sad day for us. My parents came to take me home. The next morning we had the funeral mass here in the church. The pupils sang the Mass. I am sure Helen is in heaven for she had a great devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary. When she burned a vigil night she would ask Sister to open the chapel door so she could see it at the Blessed Virgin's statue. She always called her \"My Mary\". I miss my little sister very much.\n\nMary Louise Spring Chief.\n\nDec. 5th\n\nSchool Inspector's Visit.\n\nMr. McCullough our school inspector came to see us. He went to the Junior class first. In the p.m. he came to the seniors. He asked us to sing for him, then talked about the stampede. He said he would come again later, and he did so. We like to have him come, he is very interesting and we feel very much at home with him.\n\nPhilip Many Bears.\n\nDec. 23rd\n\nQuarantine.\n\nOur agent, Mr. Gooderham, put a notice on the door prohibiting useless visits. We are also forbidden to go out. This precaution is taken to prevent contagion from the various epidemics breaking out on the reserve.\n\nAlma Crowchief.\nDec. 24th.\n\nMidnight Mass.\n\nWe had Midnight mass in our chapel on Christmas eve. The sisters awakened us by singing carols and playing musical instruments. Sister Mary was playing the violin. Some of us thought we were dreaming; it was very nice. We were all able to be in the chapel as no outsiders came because of the quarantine. The school choir sang the High Mass, and sang Christmas hymns at the second Mass. The following children made their First Holy Communion at Midnight Mass:\nDoreen Running Rabbit---- Doris Owl Child---- Mable Black Kettle-----\nAudrey Calf Child---- John Red Gun---- Ronald McHugh---- Cecilia Many Bears. The altar was decorated with natural yellow chrysanthemums. It all looked very nice. There were natural flowers at the crib also.\n\nClarence McHugh.\n\nDec. 25th.\n\nConcert and Christmas tree.\n\nOn Christmas morning when we came to the breakfast table we each had an orange and some candies at our place. After breakfast we did our work then played outside all the rest of the morning. For dinner there was turkey with all its trimmings and pie for dessert. It was a real Christmas dinner. At 2 p.m. we had Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament after that we had our concert. Our parents could not come because of the quarantine. Some of the numbers on the program were: The making of the British Flag..... A Japanese drill..... The Snowflakes..... and Bernice Black sang a song called \"Everybody calls me Tommy\". She was dressed in black. Just before last song Santa's load arrived with all the toys. We boys received two nice toboggans from Sister Superior, a big one for the older boys and a smaller one for the little fellows. We were very pleased and we gave three good cheers for her. Many of the boys had new skates and hockey sticks. We have lots of fun playing hockey, skating, and tobogganing down the hill.\n\nAlexander Scalp Lock.\n\nNew Uniform for our Band.\n\nWhen we played our rhythm band at the concert we had new uniforms on; nice red caps with caps to match trimmed in yellow. They looked very nice all together on the stage. The instruments were also decked out in the same colors. We like them very much and are grateful to Sister for making them. It is too bad our parents could not see us.\n\nCecilia Many Bears.\n\nJan. 1st.\n\nNew Years Day.\n\nWe greeted the New Year with attendance at Holy Mass. The altar was so pretty with its natural flowers and colored lights. After Mass we went down to a nice breakfast of Puffed Wheat, doughnuts and fruit. Then we did our work. After that we went to the hall and played games. Sister Superior came and played Bingo with us; she gave prizes to the winners. Then came a nice treat of candy. After a big turkey dinner we went sleighriding with our new toboggans. We started the year by having lots of fun.\n\nAnnie Leather.\nJan. 4th.\n\nTwin Wedding Bells.\n\nWe had a double wedding in our church. Gilbert Bear Hat and Neil Selway both ex-pupils were married to girls from the Anglican School. The two girls spent a few weeks here before Christmas taking instructions from Father Riou, in order to be received into the church. They were both baptized before their marriage. The two couples looked very nice; the two brides were dressed alike in floor-length white silk dresses, with long white veils and each carried a nice bouquet of roses. The pupils sang the mass; we had to wait quite a while for them to come, as it took the brides a long time to dress up. After the mass they had their pictures taken.\n\nAlec Red Gun.\n\nFeb. 3rd.\n\nPatient To The Hospital.\n\nOne of the pupils, Evelyn Black, left today for the hospital. She was sick only a few days, and nearly died. Father went to give her the last sacraments, then she got better. We prayed for her and made sacrifices for her too. She is not well enough to come back to school yet, we will be glad to see her back.\n\nMany babies died this year on the reserve from the whooping cough and the flu. We were very lucky, as none of the children here got any of these sicknesses.\n\nCharlotte McHugh.\n\nChanges.\n\nMany changes took place among the sisters this year. Sister Clara Etc., Sister Agnes Rita have both been changed and sent to other missions. The sisters who came to replace them are Sister Alino of Charity, who is in the girl's Department, and Sister Boncuit, who takes the dairy work. Some of our parents know Sister Boncuit, as she was here many years ago, and they were very glad to see her back. Sister Gabriel Alphonse teaches the beginners class.\n\nRadios in the Classrooms.\n\nWhen the inspector came he asked to have the radios installed in the classrooms so that we might listen to the news and the different programs on school work. Every Wednesday we listen to the program given by the Lethbridge School. We enjoy our radios very much.\n\nAnnie Leather.\n\nFeb. 14th.\n\nValentino Party.\n\nOn Valentino day we had a party in our classroom. We invited the other classes to attend our party. First we sang a song of welcome, then we were ready for our Valentino box of candies. To get this box each one had to do the stunt that was written on the slip of paper in the box. Some were very funny and although we were a bit shy to perform these stunts before the pupils, we did not shirk the task. We all got a box well earned. Then we had some races, games, etc., with prizes for the winners. Sister Hildobert had made a large cookie for the little class, oh it was such a large cookie, each one had to take a big bite.\ntake a big bite, but there was still much left, so each one had two more bites. Then the Valentines were given out. We enjoyed our Valentine party.\n\nRosie Medicine Shield.\n\nFeb. 21st.\n\nThe Story of Fabiola.\n\nEvery Friday afternoon we all gather in the one classroom to hear the story of Fabiola. We are to have the movies of this story on Easter Sunday. Sister is telling us the story so we will understand the movies better. The film is quite expensive so we are giving each ten cents to help pay for it. It will also be shown to the Indians of the Reserve for the same price. This is a story about the martyrs during the time of the persecution of the Christians in Rome. It will help us to appreciate our beautiful religion still more.\n\nJane Drunken Chief.\n\nFeb. 22nd.\n\nThe quarantine is at last lifted from our doors. It was there as a measure of precaution, and not because we had any contagious disease. But, hurrah! today it has been removed and we are free to go out once more. We were allowed a full day, so our parents came very early in the morning to take us home. The weather was very nice and nearly everyone went home. Those who had to stay at the school because their parents lived too far, said they had a good time also. Now we go home every Saturday.\n\nIrene Cutter.\n\nFeb. 28th\n\nA nice Surprise.\n\nOn the 28th some sisters went to Midnapore to be present at the profession of vows of two sisters. What was our surprise when two of the girls were chosen to accompany them. I was one of the lucky ones and the other was Bernice Blank. We got up very early in the morning and went down for some breakfast. We had to hurry, for Mr. F. Corbiell our driver, was waiting for us. We started off when the children were just getting up.\n\nWhen we got near Calgary something went wrong with the car but we were near a garage and soon had it fixed. We were late for the Profession ceremonies but on time for Mass. The Bishop and many priests and sisters were present. The children sang hymns and they sing very well. We had dinner and went to Benediction. When it was all over we went to the playroom and Bernice sang for the girls. Sister gave her some candy and a little girl called Dolly gave her a little Scotch doll. The girls at Midnapore are always very nice to us when we go there, and it makes us feel like wanting to stay with them. We are glad to have them as our friends. We started for home at 4 p.m., and arrived here at 6 p.m. We enjoyed our trip very much and were told it was a reward for our good conduct. I am very glad now that I tried to be good.\n\nRita Running Rabbit.\nMar. 3rd.\n\nNew Missals.\n\nSister Superior bought some new prayer books for us. They are called \"My Sunday Missal\" by Father Stodman. We each have one and we follow the mass with the priest and answer all together. We use them every time we go to mass, and we like to get up for mass now because we find it so interesting. On Sundays when Father reads the gospel we follow it in our Missal. We like to answer in Latin, and like our books very much. We also use them for the way of the Cross. Father reads the prayers from our Missal then. We understand more about the mass now.\n\nPaul Scalp Lock.\n\nSigns of Spring.\n\nMany of our Canadian Bombers and fighter planes are seen around here every day. Some of them fly very low over the school while others circle around it and then go away. The pilots are training so that they can go and help to win the war.\n\nSpring is near also, for a flock of wild geese were seen returning from the south where they went to spend the winter. At first we thought they were aeroplanes in small groups. The swans, ducks and geese, and other smaller birds are coming to spend the summer with us. I like to watch the flocks of geese go by.\n\nLeo Pretty Young Man.\n\nNew War Songs.\n\nOur teachers have been teaching us some new war songs. Here are some of them:\n\nThere'll always be an England,\nGood Luck to the Boys of the Allies\nA soldier I'm longing to be\nOur own red, white and blue.\nHero comes the thistle,\nBluebells of Scotland,\nGod Bless our Canada.\n\nWe like war songs best of all and find them easy to learn. We are soon going to have a movie show of \"Bombs over Burma\". It makes us feel thankful that we are not some of the bomb victims.\n\nMargaret Cat Face.\n\nThe pupils of the senior class wish to thank their new friends from Woonsocket for the interesting letters they send. We are always so pleased to get them, and we think it is very nice of you to think about us. It is nice to exchange thoughts and prayers too. We know God will bless you for your kindness to others, and for making others happy. Our greetings to all of you in your far-off country. We hope you will like our school paper.\n\n-9-\nAnnouncements.\n\nBaptisms since Jan. 1st, 1941.\n\nJulius, son of Mr. and Mrs. Paulus Good Eagle.\nNorman, son of Mr. and Mrs. Fred Cutter.\nMyrtle, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Francis.\nAngeline Adilo, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Rosario R.

Is it a magic arrow? Did it belong to a spirit?\" The old man smiled at little Red Bird, for the arrow had a story, one which brought back sweet memories to him, memories which gave him courage, memories which stirred up thoughts of pride because he was brave and strong.\n\n\"Come, little Red Bird, sit near me here by the campfire and I will tell you the story of my arrow. You have now seen eight sunrises; you will understand its meaning. Look at your dear Mother standing yonder under the pine trees; she is beautiful, she loves us, she has brought much happiness to our wigwam. It was this arrow found her, that is why I call it 'Sacred Arrow.'\"\n\nOnce when our tribe was on the war-path seeking revenge against an enemy tribe, my father was leaving us to follow them. I was still young but fearless; I longed to follow him, but they scorned my tender age. Still, I would not be left behind. When they were afar off I silently followed them, intending to make known my presence whom we would be too far to return. The tribe was wary to attack had killed many a father many years before; it was the thought of revenge that had spurred me on. I had carefully kept my father's bow and arrows which my mother had given me, and I took them along on my secret journey. On the third day they camped near to the snow; I was sure they would attack the next morning, but when they woke they had gone from my sight. Try as I would, I could not follow them; I soon realized that I was lost. I went on for three days, and now had no more food. The sound of rippling water made me feel a burning thirst; I went towards the sound. I came to a beautiful lake. A flock of geese were coming towards it. I was hungry, here was food. I drew my bow, let fly the arrow, and saw my prey fluttering to the ground. Leaving my horse to munch the green grass, I went to get the bird. But as I approached the edge of the lake I saw at a little distance the slender form of an Indian maid wading through the water towards the wounded bird. Silently I drew back beneath the shelter of the trees and watched her. With eyes turned heavenward I heard her murmur these words, 'Great giver of all good thou art so pity on thy children dying of hunger. Here is food that will make us live.' I wondered at these words and felt pity in my heart for the hungry. She trembled as she drew the arrow from the breast of the bird, did she fear an enemy had shot it? Advanced and as she looked up put up my hand as a sign of peace. Breathlessly she waited. I asked the meaning of her words. This is what she answered. Many weeks before her tribe had been attacked and beaten by an enemy tribe. Her father and brothers had been killed, her mother badly wounded, and she had begged her daughter to take her away from the camp and let her die in peace. After many miles of struggling they had set up their little tepee near the lake and lived on fish. But the mother was slowly...\nfinding away. When she had finished her sad tale I looked into her dark eyes and said, \"I will help you.\" We sat there and prepared the bind for a meal. The broth we gave to the dying mother. Slowly, little by little her strength returned and she was soon strong enough to travel. We left then, not to follow those of my tribe, but turned towards our camping ground. The arrow that had brought me this new-found friend, I kept with me always. That little Indian maid is your mother and always I have thanked the Great Spirit who send her to me. The Grandmother died a few months later, happy to know that her daughter had found a good home.\n\nThe arrow brings to me good fortune wherever I go; it will always be kept as sacred to me. That little Red Bird, is the story of \"The Sacred Arrow.\"\n\n---\n\nThe Religious Corner.\n\nOn awakening in the morning behold the good God extending His hand to you, saying, \"Do you wish that I should care for you today?\" And you, give your hand to this good Father, and say to Him: \"Yes, Lord, be guard me, love me; I will be very, very submissive.\"\n\nAnd if you remain under the guidance and the protection of God, is it possible that you should be sad, or fearful, or unhappy?\n\nNo, God will never permit a suffering which will hurt your spiritual welfare. No, God will never permit a trial which is not for your good.\n\nOh, then, spend your day calmly and tranquilly, more securely than when you were a child and felt your mother near you.\n\nOccupy yourself with but one thing\u2014the fear of displeasing God\u2014and you will see how God will occupy Himself with all that relates to your eternal interests, friendly relations, business affairs. You will be astonished at the sudden lights which will come to you, and the peace which will result from your labor and undertakings.\n\n\"Lord, for to-morrow and its needs,\nI do not pray,\nKeep me, my God, from stain of sin,\nJust for today.\"\n\nAnonymous.\nEaster Message\n\nHe Is Risen\n\nOur Lord Jesus Christ suffered and died for the sins of all mankind. He was crucified on Good Friday. The third day after His death He rose glorious from the grave in spite of the stone and guards, never to die again.\n\nThe pious women first discovered that the grave was empty, and were told by the Angel, \"Christ is risen\". They hurried to tell Peter and the other apostles about Christ's Resurrection.\n\nNow let us join in the festivity of the Church and rise from our sins, for has not the Church made it a commandment for every Catholic able to do so, to confess his sins and receive Holy Communion at least once a year at Easter time?\n\nIf we want to arise glorious and immortal in our bodies for our happiness in Heaven, on the day of the Last Judgment, we must heed the lesson of Jesus, and receive His Body and Blood in Holy Communion. He will increase our faith, help us, guide us to that glorious life with Him for ever in His beautiful Heaven.\n\nOn April 13th Easter Sunday at Crowfoot School, Confessions Will be heard. Come early, Communion given and High Mass sung by the pupils. In the afternoon a Moving Picture of the Persecution of the early Christians under the title of Fabiola will be shown in the school auditorium at 2.30 P.M.\n\nA B C Advice\n\nA-- Aim to do right.\nB-- Be sure 'tis straight.\nC-- Cast from your mind.\nD-- Doubts that always harm.\nE-- Ever look forward.\nF-- Fight your own battles.\nG-- Gather all good thoughts.\nH-- Honor; marks a good man.\nI-- Idleness always shun.\nJ-- Join good companions.\nK-- Kindness or heart seek to obtain.\nL-- Learn and love sweet lessons.\nM-- Meddle not with others' business.\nN-- Never seek out trouble.\nO-- Open your heart to do good.\nP-- Practice much patience.\nQ-- Quickly obey your parent's command.\nR-- Respect old age always.\nS-- Stand by your friends.\nT-- Teach others by good example.\nU-- Use what you earn.\nV-- Venture not dishonest business.\nW-- Work; God will reward you.\nX-- Extend your riches to poverty's home.\nY-- Yearn for eternity's joys.\nZ-- Zeal is the ladder to victory.\nEASTER TIDE.\n\nChrist is risen from the dead,\nALLELUIA, ALLELUIA.\nRisen as He truly said,\nALLELUIA, ALLELUIA.\n\nO praise the Lord with grateful voice,\nBless His name, Rejoice, Rejoice,\nALLELUIA, ALLELUIA?\n\nResurrexit sic et dixit,\nALLELUIA, ALLELUIA.\n\nOur little paper extends\nEASTER GREETINGS\nto all its readers.\n\nNext Issue in June.\nHolidays\n\nHolidays...........a word full of meaning to pupils as well as to grown-ups, a word upon which all must meditate seriously. When we speak of holidays, we instinctively think of \"liberty.\" To some \"liberty\" means no self control, life with principles left at the \"work-shop,\" duty, only when back to \"work.\"\n\nThese ideas about liberty are false and it is wise to remember that holidays are only days of rest for your mind and for your body. Rest does not mean laziness, nor 2 months to kill time and to dream, on the contrary, they are a change in life where we can make others happy & contented.\n\nHaving clean fun, playing from morning till night, roaming in the woods for wild berries, hunting, fishing having a regular after noon nap, destroying crows' nests, playing soft-ball with friendly opponents, that's what we call clean fun.\n\nIt might be remembered also that Mass on Sundays is as important during the holidays as it was in the \"work shop\" months. Not going to mass on Sundays is a mortal sin if there is no special reason for missing it. Since we tried to take the habit of offering our actions to Jesus, why not keep on during the holidays and find out what our \"will power\" is worth............If we continue this daily offering or all our actions, we are sure to see our morning and night prayer.\n\nDon't forget that respect and obedience to your dear parents is a sacred duty and they are expecting this from their children. Re-read this article and surely you'll enjoy the most cheerful holidays you've ever spent.\n\nA Friend\nA Sad Departure\n\nSince our dear \"Thunderer\" we have lost a good friend. Father Chataigner. He felt sorry because he had worked hard for our souls and never spoke to himself in giving us good advice and in teaching. He wrote twice, since he is going to be very lonely out there in Lac la Biche; I hope that some day he will be back in Delmas. I wish to thank him for all he has done to the Delmas Indian children. May God grant him millions of graces and help him in his new missions.\n\nMarguerite Koosoonin.\n\nOur New Father\n\nFather Paradis is the priest who replaced our good Father Chataigner. We were anxious to know him. After passing a few months in Duck Lake, he seemed glad to know other Indians. He is named to learn cree and to go on all our Reserves. It was the lucky first boy to go with him in Poundmaker. I liked him right away and I think that the Indians on the Reserves like him also, because they say nice things about him. The Sport Page will tell you about the many ball games which he organized with Father Paradis. He is a real, good sport and we hope that we will be able to enjoy other hot games after the holidays.\n\nWalter Tootoosis.\n\nNature's Science\n\nThis is a subject we love very much. Nature is a very nice book and we love reading in it. So as soon as it was convenient for us to start our hiking, we didn't miss our chance. We made a lot of work ahead of us because we had to make a collection of harmful and useful insects. Since the beginning of April, our room has been a regular bug house! We found many kinds of insects put the worst was to get their names. It might interest you to know some of them. We labelled bees, cabbage butterflies, lady beetles, ants, and flies in their different stages. We are taking home in the hope of complete study. I suppose we won't know all their names just when we come back in Sept., our teacher will help us out again.\n\nFlorence Kiskotagan.\n\nOur Aquarium\n\nWe have had \"youth luck\" with our aquatic inhabitants. In early Sept., Sister Marie Alberta sent us 2 nice gold fish. We were very proud of them, but temperature came to \"fishy cat\" and one day she scratched both us for \"not being well\". We felt sorry because we noticed that they were leaving the school and caught 2 bull frogs, and two tree frogs. Just now we have many tadpoles in the aquarium. I hope that when we come back after our holidays, we will see their legs and their tails disappearing.\n\nClara Wright.\nVisitors from Alberta\n\nFather Tetreault had a very pleasant surprise one morning. His sister from Alberta came with her family. She has four children; the eldest one is Lillian. We think she is a very nice girl.\n\nIn the afternoon, they took snap-shots of some of the girls. I was one of them. A little later, we went to the ball game and they came along. Unfortunately we lost. The Sport Page will tell you about it.\n\nTheir visit was a short one because they arrived for dinner and left before supper yet their trip was short but sweet! We hope to see them again until then we hope that our Thunder Report will be sent to the family.\n\nSeeding the Garden\n\nAs usual, the senior boys and girls went out seeding the garden. This time we wanted to make a record and we succeeded; all was over in an hour's time. We put in turnips, string beans, corn, radishes, onions, lettuce, garlic, carrots, string beans, tomatoes, peas, cabbages and potatoes. When this job was over, we all went to weed the rest of the garden. It was lot of fun getting through quick grass. Doris Laiberty and Clara Wright, 4 or 5 ft. patient digging finally got a root measuring 4 or 5 ft.\n\nSister was surprised...we had tried many times to get so well that they really looked promising. Since then we have watched the garden grow. The rain has given it a good start, but we could use more rain.\n\nI think that Sister Marie Stanislas can be proud of her nice garden, she is the one who takes care of it.\n\nTrain to Battleford\n\nIf you remember well, after our Local Dramatic Festival, we were invited to the Battleford Achievement Day. We went there April 25th and were invited to repeat our play \"What a Mix-Up\" in the Connaught School in North Battleford. This was an exciting moment. But we managed to pull through quite well. While in North Battleford Hall, we were not the only pupils on the beach. Three other schools came on the stage also. It was very interesting to watch the puppet show. Those boys and girls must be clever to have the dolls dancing without having them all entangled up.\n\nWe came back on time to enjoy a good supper. Joe Marcellar Rodden told us he had had a very peaceful night.\n\nWe all wish to thank our good Father Principal for paying for our trip to the Neighbouring City.\n\nIrene Stapkowsky.\n\nThe Lady Beetle\n\nDo you want to know what a Lady Beetle is? Here is her life. She is very useful as well as pretty. She usually wears a red or yellow dress with black dots for ornament. Although her legs are short, she can run quickly. Then she wants to go a long distance she changes herself into an airplane and flies.\n\nLady Bird spends the winter under the bark of a tree. In spring she comes to the orchard and runs up and down the trees in search of aphids or other naughty insects. She lays her eggs there too. The baby ladybirds who look nothing like their mother, spend their time hunting aphids and other pests.\n\nFrodeline Kiskotagan.\nPhone Calls.\n\nOne Saturday morning, all the girls working in the Fathers' Rectory had a grand time calling their teacher to the phone. It was funny to see them some held the receiver by the wrong end, others spoke in it while others were puzzled and did not know what to say.\n\nOur teacher from the school asked them all kinds of questions and most of them could only say \"yes\" or \"no.\" Luckily, some good souls came to our rescue and the conversation picked up a little. That was a very practical lesson and we wish to thank the Fathers and Sisters.\n\nLucie Chatsis.\n\nNew Organ.\n\nWe had another proof of our good Principal's kind heart. In the beginning of May we said \"Good-bye\" to our old organ, Mr. Peil, from Edmonton. Claire-Lucie is living in Battleford where his sisters, Claire-Lucie and Beate, are teaching. Father Angin arranged things in such a way, that since then we have a brand new organ. Protection is very happy she always has an nice broach still since then.\n\nThanks a lot dear Father Angin. Lillian Albert.\n\nBread Cutter.\n\nPoor Frank Benson who has been slicing the bread for at least two years with an old rig, and the pleasure of using a brand new one which cost $198.00. By the price you can easily imagine that it is one of the latest style. Thanks a lot to our good Fathers again for this good bargain.\n\nFelix Simagnais.\n\nExhibition Work.\n\nOn April 25th a Musical Festival was held in the St. Jean-Baptiste de la Salle School. The time arrangements had been made by Miss Angin and her pupils from the Delmas District were there also took part and were fortunate enough to come first in the 1st Group of Girls under 13. I was the lucky winner in the 2nd Group of Girls 18 over. Florence also came first. As far as the songs for the group of boys, Daniel Lafrance was the best. The results are not yet known since we are in competition with other urban schools. Let's hope the results prove satisfactory.\n\nLillian Albert.\n\nCountry and Western Style. The results are not yet known since we are in competition with other urban schools. Let's hope the results prove satisfactory.\n\nLillian Albert.\nThe Kindergarten\n\nSince Spring the little People in our class have been watching Mother Nature We have seen very nice Things and we drew them in our Nature Science Work Books just come and see Bye.Bye!\n\nEdward Kapiyesiwar Jr I\n\nThe First Visit of Jesus in Communion\n\nHow happy we were on Trinity Sunday to receive Jesus in Holy Communion for the first time.\n\nWe were 23 children in all, 10 boys and 13 girls.\n\nWe prayed for all our relatives and friends. We asked dear Jesus to bless the holidays. Good luck to all!\n\nVictoria Meechan Jr.Gr.I\nMany of us are wondering whether Father Routier will be named \"Provincial\" or not. This year the nomination is delayed on account of the terrible war, but we ardently wish he would be elected for another term. When he visits us he is very kind and we know that he is interested in all the Indians, but especially in the Indian Schools. Let's hope our wishes come true.\n\nMaggie Tootoosis.\n\nAnother Edmonton Visitor\n\nMiss Gerard from Edmonton and a sister to one of White School teacher, Sister St. Gamma was here for a week. I imagine these two sisters had a grand time together, because Miss Gerard seems to be a very jolly girl.\n\nWe were glad to have her come with us to the woods one Saturday morning. Although we bigger boys were not in her group, we saw her learning how to shoot with a sling-shot, then with Father Tetreault's 22. Unfortunately her bullet killed \"spayc\".\n\nThe girls told us about the little dolls which she dresses as \"novices\" of the Sisters of the Assumption. She made about 100 of them, these are for Rev. Mother Marie-Eustelle, who sells these at her annual bazar, the profits of which go to the Sisters of the Assumption in Japan.\n\nFelix Simaganis.\n\nWe have just learned that Sister St. Clothilde and Sister Marie Alberta will be here around the 26 or 27 of this month. We wish to tell them how happy we are to see them again. We also wish them a happy trip to Meadow Lake.\n\nJoseph Martel.\n\nBattle River Picnic\n\nLast Friday, June 20, the Sr. Class had a grand surprise! Our teacher announced that at 10 that morning we were leaving for Battle River in Mr. John's \"Royal Carriage\". Dark menacing clouds made us shiver, but when our \"grub\" was all ready we started off just the same.\n\nYou should have seen the smiling faces, the joyful outbursts of our \"noisy ones\". Arriving there, the boys threw their shoes away and jumped in the water. The girls soon followed until dinner time.\n\nAt 12 we enjoyed the meal and right after, we sailed off in the \"Royal Carriage\" across the river to land in an open space where we enjoyed a good softball game against the boys. Once more we took honours and the poor boys had to cheer for us all.\n\nRaces followed, but this time it was the boys turn to win. Nevertheless we came pretty close beating George.\n\nIf the chilly weather had not accompanied us all the day long we would have enjoyed a good swim; yet we still had lots o' fun and it was not until 7 p.m. that day, that we came back home.\n\nMaggie Tootoosis\n\nPrizes and Promotions\n\nAs usual, Father Angin gives prizes in money at the end of the year. Those who have come first all year in their grade got $5.00. But this year none of us had this big prize. Lucie and Juliette Tootoosis had the most, each received $1.50.\n\nThe exciting moment was not yet over, because our promotions had not been given. Some were rather disappointed when they heard the terrible \"fail\". Out of 110 pupils going to school, only 13 failed. This means that we have been working hard.\n\nWe were told to come back on due time. Now this means to be back in the Thunderchild School on Sept. 1st, so that we be all ready to start another good school term.\n\nDora Laliberty.\nWe have lots of fun watching the boys playing against the girls. We the little ones like to see them play. When I am big I will be a good player; perhaps my sister will be too. We did not play against the boys yet, but Friday or Thursday we will play too.\n\nLet Sunday there was a nice procession. The new priest, Father Dubame carried the blessed Sacrament around the village. We also went. I liked to see the nice altar at the Father's house. I hope Jesus blessed all the people in Delais.\n\nA...What starts with T, ends with T, and is full of T? B...What can kick and yet has no feet to stand on?

Then Mr. Balquet replaced Mr. Richard because Mr. Richard was called in the air force. When we are gone they will continue in the house. There are the class-room and the dormitory to be painted yet. Brith Destrochers.\nAlbert's Misfortune\n\nAlbert Watson, one of our classmates has had a bad accident. He broke his leg while he was playing football. George brought him in his arms. Sister soon said that he had a broken leg. When we came back from church we saw two sisters and Albert going in a car. He went to the Battleford Hospital. He has been there since but last Tuesday his father took him home. I hope he gets better and comes back to School in Sept.\n\nDisappointment\n\nOn June 14 Rev. Father Puthaline from Jack Fish was ordained. Father Tetrau, Father Dobois and Father Paradis went to the ceremony planning to bring back Mr. Protti, the boys' teacher in Hobema. We all wanted to see him and had many questions ready about the Hobema Indians as well as about our good former teachers there who are a year or two. We prepared ourselves cleaned all over and tried to arrange things so that he could enjoy himself as much as possible during his short visit. When the Fathers came back we noticed that they were alone and a few minutes after we were told that he had not come to Battleford. We were all disappointed, but we still hope to see him maybe some time in the fall with his p.t. experts. Congratulations Hobema boys for the great success you have obtained in Calgary and Edmonton. Don't forget you still live in hopes of seeing your performance some day.\n\nHurrah for Thunderchild School!\n\nTo all,\n\nHAPPY HOLIDAYS.\n\nIndian Affairs School Files (RG 10, Volume 6039, File 150-62, part 1)\nLINEUPS\n\nTIGERS (Sr. Boys)\n\nP.- Frank Benson\nC.- George Opwam\n1.- Maurice Sauv\u00e9\n2.- Marcel Martel\n3.- Pete Martel\nSS- Thomas Fasken\nRF- Alex Swiftwolf\nCF- Joe Martel\nLF- Edward Frenchman\n\nCLIPPERS (Jr. Boys)\n\nP.- Alphonse Chickenis\nC.- Wallage Chickenis\n1.- Robert Moosoomin\n2.- A.

Their first appearance met with words of welcome and appreciation from interested readers. Among others we wish to mention in particular our devoted school inspector, Mr. R.V. McCullough, whose complimentary letter will repay the efforts we put forth in this work. To Mr. McCullough and all the other readers who so kindly gave encouragement, we wish to express our deep appreciation and sincere gratitude.\n\nOur second edition appears on the very outset of the summer vacation. No doubt a note of joyous anticipation will be detected throughout these pages; anticipation of the sense of freedom that vacation time offers to both young and old.\n\nFREEDOM\u2014a thing good in itself, if used rightly, but a dangerous thing also, as its very essence breathes alluring temptations. While at school we are under the strain of certain obligations, we have rules to submit to, teachers to obey, lessons to learn. During vacation we break away from these obligations, and rejoice in the thought of being free for two long months.\n\nFREEDOM\u2014yes, there can be freedom from work or studies, but there can be no freedom from duty. Duty towards God by prayer and worship, our parents' duty towards our selves. Vacation time will be filled with occasions of putting this duty into practice. Let us not forget that all the good that vacation time offers us is given by God; therefore, duty of gratitude. Surely, we can acknowledge His gifts of nature with a simple word of thanks.\n\nDuty of kindness and thoughtfulness towards our neighbor; there is always happiness in doing good to others. Duties towards our parents, rendering them the services of love that are denied us during our school-days. Duty towards ourselves; keeping our minds and hearts pure, living clean, honest lives. This is real freedom, found only in the peace of a good conscience.\n\nLet us make of these two months of freedom a milestone on our long voyage to Eternity.

He had three sisters and two brothers. At four years old, Shooting Star with bright eyes, and husky hands was carefully parting the blue-berry bushes where a rabbit-squirrel was awaiting its victim. Shooting Star had no thought of pity for the little creatures; he had been taught not to mind pain. That was his lucky day, for he did catch a rabbit which made his heart beat wild and fast.\n\nHe loved to see the warriors painted and talk of the war path and could hardly wait for the day when he too would wear the feathers and be a hero.\n\nOnce when a great chief made a speech he heard those words which he never forgot: \"Be always brave, be true to your race, and walk always silently and sternly when in pain or distress. Fear not! love the Great Spirit, the giver of life, of meat and fruit, of every blossom and blade of grass.\"\n\nShooting Star soon helped his father make a birch bark canoe, then one night went out with him and killed his first deer. Now he was proud, for he knew that the killing of a deer stood nearest glory on a hunter's name. He quickly learned to read and write pictures and stories.\n\nHis pride knew no bounds when he and his older brother once killed a grizzly bear he having wounded the animal.\n\nShooting Star soon grew to be a fine young man, bravely taking part in all the ceremonies required in the making of a warrior, he was very bold and daring. Sometimes he would creep into the camps and huntin' grounds of neighboring tribes just to see what they were doing.\n\nCrash... Whop... Who is this rushing to battle? Why, it is our Shooting Star now become a great warrior.\n\nHe wears the eagle's feathers upon his head, which shows he has conquered a foe. He wears the bright paint, he wears three scalps at his belt. Fire gleams in his eyes; for he has seen in the last war dance.\n\nShooting Star's tribe is at war with another tribe, and Shooting Star is thinking of Bright Eyes, his own promised bride, who has been stolen by this crafty tribe.\n\nWhere is she? \"Hidden away in some wigwam to slave for some cowardly fox, I must get her back,\" thinks Shooting Star as he dashes out of sight.\n\nBut: This time, with his heart set on one desire \"Bright Eyes\", he fearlessly creeps into the enemy camp and is made a prisoner with several others. The battle was fierce and now what is left of Shooting Star's warriors are hurrying homeward with thoughts of revenge.\n\nWho is this tied with tough thongs to a tree, with fagots heaped around him?\n\nOur Shooting Star. He has seen the other prisoners die, one by one, without a cry. He looks up through the branches to the blue sky and closes his lips tight.\nHe will die like a hero.\n\nHark... there is a rustling in the branches.\n\nAn old man parts the low boughs and stands before his son's tormentors. He is the old chief, Shooting Star's father, who having missed his son on the homeward trail returned for him.\n\n\"Spare my son\" cried the old chief. My hairs are white, my feet are weary. I have hung many a scalp of your tribe above my tepee. My son has not long trod the warpath; he has taken but few scalps. His heart is young; his hopes are high; let him live - let me die,\" begged the old chief.\n\nThe foes are willing to do as he asks.\n\nShooting Star is set free and his father takes his place. As the old chief sees the fire burning around him, he does not flinch. He raises his hand and says \"For my son's sake\" then he thinks that he, too, will soon be free, in the Happy Hunting Ground.\n\nThat night Shooting Star did not leave the enemy camp before he had found and rescued his future bride.\n\nBright Eyes now watches for Shooting Star at the entrance of their lodge which he has made for her, fitted with plenty of warm skins and furs.\n\nThey are happy and love each other.\n\n--- THE END ---\n\nA Puzzle\n\n(Use the letters in the word EXAMINATE to answer these puzzles)\n\n1-- Something to wear on your head.\n2-- A boy's name.\n3-- A girl's name.\n4-- A high jump.\n5-- The name of a large body of salt water.\n6-- Something to drink.\n7-- Where you sit in school.\n8-- A part of your feet.\n9-- A word meaning lock.\n10-- A word meaning tidy.\n11-- Something that the Irish people burn in their fireplaces.\n12-- A little word meaning to allow.\n13-- Something to do at supper.\n14-- The first number having two figures.\n15-- Something to eat.\n16-- A word meaning to take the skin off an orange or an apple.\n17-- A long wriggly creature.\n18-- A word that tells how dogs and cats drink.\n19-- A word meaning to cure.\n20-- The name of something into which mother puts the loaf of bread to bake in the oven.\n21-- What a dog does when he is hot.\n22-- The name of a tiny insect.\n23-- The name of something that flows in a tree.\n24-- A light color.\n25-- A word that tells about not getting to school on time.\n26-- Something to write with.\n27-- Answers on the last page.\n\n---- etc. ----\nSpring\n\nWe are glad spring is here.\n\nWe have flowers in the windows and little ducks too.\n\nWe like to play outside.\n\nHello to Sister Ernest Marie from all the little ones.\n\nHugh Crow Chief\n\nRoss P.F.

It diminishes the attractiveness of evil. Once received it should blossom into a great love of God and a real love of neighbor. It will urge us to love God because He alone is worthy of all love.\n\nUnderstanding\u2014The gift of understanding helps us by shedding a clear searching light on the meaning of revealed truth. By it we are able to attain a closer union with God. This possession of God makes us so happy that we want to share with the world His wonderful secrets. We will always ask God to make us firm in faith and that many may follow its light.\n\nCounsel\u2014The gift of counsel helps us to choose the better of two right things. We are guided by its light to be 100% Catholics. It gives us a promptness of will to carry out our resolutions. Before each action let us turn to the Holy Spirit for guidance. \"Come Holy Ghost and kindle in us the Fire of Thy Divine Love.\"\n\nFortitude\u2014By the gift of fortitude we receive a very special grace. This gift bestows on the soul a permanent power which helps us to overcome difficulties in doing what God wants us to do. We need this grace every minute of the day especially when we are ridiculed for doing the right things. It takes a hero of God to be true to Christ. At such times ask the Holy Ghost to make you suffer the loss of so-called friends rather than to disappoint Christ.\n\nKnowledge\u2014By this gift we are given a supernatural light, which convinces us of the truths taught by the Holy Catholic Church. This light helps us to distinguish false philosophy and the teachings of Christ.\n\nIt points out for us God's will. It does not make any difference how wise or how old we are; we can always learn more about God and His designs for us. Let us read and study only under the guidance of this gift.\n\nPiety\u2014The gift of piety helps us to turn to God with love and confidence as we do to our Father on earth. It makes us ready to give to God the honor that should be His. This gift makes us ready to do immediately the good deeds that come to our minds.\nSometimes the inspiration is to say a prayer; in passing a church Jesus may call us to stop for a few minutes, and again we are urged to refrain from sin. If we love God we will obey these reminders.\n\nFear of the Lord\u2014The gift of the Fear of the Lord helps us in a very special way to be afraid to offend God by sin of any kind. God is our loving Father, He has loved us so much that He has given us the dearest Treasure He had, Jesus Christ the Savior of mankind. He forgives us our sins and He gives us His Holy Grace. Surely we will fear to offend Him.\n\nAct of Faith\n\nArk-o-ekit-morsa Apistotokiw\n\nHeyo, ninna Apistotokiw, nits-i-konmotsai kit-orkano pohorsists; nit-sopokwotakki munat-o-ekit-kipiyew ki nitap-ekoyapokwamixi; nat-orkot-sa-anistsaiwa kitsipohorsin.

Ikkari amistiopi.\n\nOur Motives.\n\nA life without a motive is a useless thing at best,\nThen so many acts want doing which would bring us peace and rest.\nIt brings us pain and worry, it brings us discontent;\nIt makes the world seem empty, and all effort poorly spent.\n\nA life without a motive, like a plant without a flower,\nSurely ends in disappointment at the wasting of its power.\nEach life is sent for something; that something each must find,\nWe know that once we grasp it, we must work among our kind.\nBack from the Hospital.\n\nOn April 5th I came back from the hospital. The girls were glad to see me come back. I had to stay in bed for a few days, then I was allowed to get up in the afternoon. Then one day Sister told me to get up, and she got me ready to go home for a few days. When my sister saw me getting ready she wanted to go home too, so she went to ask Sister Superior if she could go with me. Sister Superior said she could go too, and my father came to get us that afternoon. We were very glad to go home. Then one of my little sisters got the measles and we had to stay home for another week. When we came back I started to go to school again. When I went to the hospital I was very sick, and received the last Sacraments. Now I am all better again.\n\nEvelyn Black.\n\nGarden Work.\n\nOne morning in May Sister Mary named the boys of the Senior Class to work with her in the garden. Some of us had to dig up the earth and make it soft for seeding, others carried new earth in to prepare the beds. Two others had to water the little spruce trees and the flowers that were already planted. For two weeks we worked out in the flower garden all morning, and went to school only in the afternoon. We enjoy outdoor work and are proud to see the garden and lawn look nice.\n\nAlice Red Gun.\n\nAscension Thursday.\n\nOn the Feast of the Ascension we had High Mass at 10 a.m. in our chapel. Many Indians came to Mass, they also had their breakfast here at the school. In the evening we had a moving picture show. The films were very good, and were about animals, and others were comics. We went to bed at ten o'clock that night, and were quite sleepy the next morning.\n\nNorma Carrier.\n\nAn interesting visitor.\n\nOn April the 15th we had the honor of having a very nice visitor in the person of Mr. Alphonse Doucet, a member of the Indian Educational Dept., at Ottawa. He remained here four days, and visited the classrooms and all the buildings.\n\nWhen he came to the Senior Class, he read for him and answered the questions he asked us. He did us do some physical exercises then talked to us the rest of the school period about a new course we are to have next year. He told the boys that we were to have carpenter work. We all liked that and are\nvery anxious for it. We liked Mr. Doucet very much and were sorry to see him leave us. He is doing so much to help us to get a good education and train us in work that will be useful to us when we are out of school. We are going to do our best next year and hope that he will be pleased with our efforts.\n\nMichael Cat Face.\n\nEaster.\n\nWe had a lot of rain the week before Easter and we thought Easter would be a wet one, but the weather turned out real nice. Many people came to Mass on Holy Communion, and most of them did their Easter duties. After they all had breakfast here at the school, we had Mass at 10 and Benediction right after. The sisters served a lunch to all the people, and then we had a movie in the afternoon. It was \"Pabiole\" and was very good. We enjoyed our Easter very much in every way.\n\nJoe Running Rabbit.\n\nDr. Wells payed us his usual annual visit, to examine our eyes. He found them very good and only a few children have to take the Tracoma treatment. We hope he will find us completely cured on his next visit.\n\nRosie Medicine Shield.\n\nMay Devotions.\n\nDuring the month of May we had Benediction and May Devotions every night at the church. Father Guindot said the words and also gave a sermon every other night. We sang a hymn to the Blessed Virgin before the words. Many of the boys and girls got up every morning for Mass, to show their love for Mary. We hope she was pleased with our little sacrifices. We offered them for peace.\n\nBetsy Cutter.\n\nWar Saving Stamps.\n\nWe are trying to do our bit by buying War Saving Stamps. Some of the boys have four already. Sister puts a gold star after our name for each stamp we buy. This way we can help our country to get bombers, ships, ammunition, and all the other things that are needed to win the war. We like to think that the pennies we sacrifice to buy stamps will help our country in some way.\n\nCharlotte.\nOn the Farm in May.\n\nMay the 2nd was a sunny day. The fields were all prepared to receive the little seeds. Already the wheat was in the ground. We wanted to see how the seeding was done, so we all went to the field with our teacher. The farmer was seeding oats on that day. He showed us the drill, the box where they put the seeds in, and the pipes that the seeds go through into the ground. There are chains that drag behind to cover the seeds. It was very dusty in the field. The farmer was driving the tractor, and he gave some of us a ride on the tractor, and some on the seeder.\n\nWhen we got to the end of the field we thanked him and started for home. We went to the grave-yard a while until our teacher caught up to us. It was lots of fun walking home, and we got home just as a big storm was coming. We went to the chapel for Benediction, and our day was over.\n\nVictor Old Woman,\nThomas Red Cat,\nMike Throo Sun,\nBernard Big Snake. Gr.III\n\nFinding Tadpoles.\n\nOne sunny morning we went to the swamp to look for tadpoles. When we got there, there was so much mud we could not get near the swamp. We each had a little can. We went to the ditch and caught many tiny frogs, it was too late for tadpoles. We let them all go again before we got home. We learned about frogs in the class-room. Frogs live on land, they live in water too, they are helpful to us. They eat insects that harm the garden.\n\nPhilip Little Chief\nGrade II\n\nObservation Test.\n\nOne day when we got to the class-room Sister said we would have an observation test. We were going to write the names of all the things we could see. We took our scribblers and our pencils. First we went on the porch and wrote all we could see from there. Then we went to the yard, then there to the pasture. We wrote the names of all the animals there. Then we went to the grave-yard. We saw some skulls and opened some of the boxes with dead bodies in them. When we had finished we went down to the bridge. We found a snake in the water. There were many birds flying around there. Then we saw two more snakes. Thomas frightened the girls with the snake. When we came back to the class-room, Sister told us to count our words. Anne Victoire won the prize, she had ninety-six words. She got a chocolate Wal-Bar. All those who had over thirty words had some candy. Then we played the gramophone as we were too tired to work. Some of the girls played jacks.\n\nEmma Drunkon Chief\nNoella Black Kettle\nLucy Jennie Scalp Lock,\nTheresa Good Eagle.\nMary's Day.\n\nThis year we celebrated Mary's day in a special way. We had Mass at the Church at 8 o'clock with a general communion. All day long we took turns in reciting the beads before the statue of the Blessed Virgin, so that someone was saying them all the time. At 5 p.m., we had an hour of adoration followed by a procession outside. The order of the procession was as follows: First the cross bearer, then acolytes, the boys of the school in navy blue suits and shirts, the white people from the town, the girls all dressed in white, the children of Mary hooded by their banner than Father Guindot carried the statue of the Blessed Mother. On our return Andrea Carl Child carried the statue while the Choir sang, \"O Mary, we crown thee with blossoms to-day\". Then we had Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament with a prayer for peace. It was all very pretty and we hope the Blessed Virgin was pleased with our efforts to make Mary's day a beautiful one. The biggest part was that we had made the sacrifice of not going home that Saturday, and we are sure that pleased our Blessed Mother the most. In the evening we again sang hymns in the chapel after our night prayer.\n\nMary Rose Good Eagle.\n\nA Visitor from Wabasca.\n\nFor Mary's day we had a visitor from Wabasca with us, Sister Doris. She visited the house and came to the girls hall; there she saw some of our fancy work. She said it was well done. Sister Doris is the nurse at the little hospital there in Wabasca. Sister told us we were lucky to have so many nice things, she says the Cree Indians up there have not as much as we have, yet they are very grateful. We enjoyed Sister Doris very much and wished she could have stayed with us.\n\nJane Drunkon Chief.\n\nNature Study.\n\nOne day the Juniors and Grade IV girls went to the pond with our teachers. We found a very large beetle, about three inches long. It has very long claws. We put it in a basin of water with some leaves. We have had it for nearly a month but it is still living. We like to tease it, then he gets very cross.\n\nCharlotte McHugh.\n\nAnts.\n\nSister Margaret, our teacher and two boys went to get some ants for nature study. They were put in glass jar half of sand, so it could be thrown around. We could see the ants making tunnels and moving the eggs around. The next day when we came to school, we couldn't see anything. During the\nnight they had covered all the inside of the jar in this way. One ant would spit on the glass and the next one would lay a grain of sand on the wet spot. The little ants had done this to keep us from watching them. The pieces of dirt were placed so close together that it made a curtain. They work very hard all day and never stop for a minute. Don't you think they are wise little insects? We should be too. We studied all about the little ants and found it very interesting. We like nature study very much. To go on hikes and find out different things about insects and flowers.\n\nCharlotte McHugh.\n\nCaring for Baby Birds.\n\nThis morning our teacher found a bird's nest with five little birds in it. They were very cold, the mother had left them. Perhaps some cruel boy had killed her and left the little baby birds to die. Sister brought them to the kitchen and warmed them up. She filled a bottle with hot straw in it, and put a hot water bottle under the straw. She poured a few drops of wine and water in their mouths and they soon started moving around. She brought them to the class-room and we liked to watch them. Two of them were dead but the other three are very lively. We can hear them chirp during class and their little feathers are growing out now. Sister feeds worms to them and they never seem to have enough. We think that these three will live. I am sure they are lucky that Sister should save their lives.\n\nMary Louise Spring Chief.\n\nBranding.\n\nMany weeks ago we milkers had a great time branding the little calves. The man who works at the stable asked us to help him. We made a fire in the ground with some wood and heated the iron. In it we roped the calves inside and had a hard time holding them. The big calves were strong and it was very hard to throw them. It hurts them when the hot iron is put on them and it is hard to keep them from moving.\n\nPaul Scalp Lock.\n\nOur Picnic.\n\nWhen Sister Superior had to go to the hospital she asked us to pray for her, and told us that she would give us a nice picnic on her return. We prayed so well that she came back much sooner than she expected. We were looking forward to the picnic but it was raining all the time. Tuesday was a nice day so we had it then. We did not go to the river as usual but had it on the school grounds. We had our dinner under the trees, and it was a very good one. Sandwiches, apples, cookies, peanuts, and nice orangeade. After dinner we went to the boys' yard for sports. We had all kinds of races and the winners got money. The big boys\nalso got cigarettes for prizes. Then at 3 p.m. we all came back to the school and had a cone of ice cream. After that we returned to the boy's yard for a ball-games. It was a good one. The big boys played against the big girls and ----the boys won, then the smaller boys played with the smaller girls and the boys won again. We came back and had our supper under the trees to the sound of the gramophone which has been moved out doors. At 7 o'clock we had another cone of ice cream and all went in for a picture show which lasted until 9.00. We all think it is the best picnic we ever had and enjoyed it very much. Here are the winners of the races etc.\n\nRunning Race... Senior boys... Joe Running Rabbit.\n\" \" \" \" \" \" Girls... Margaret Cat Face.\n\" \" \" \" \" \" Junior boys...

We imagine we cannot continue the struggle for our\nwhole lives. But in reality there are no long years to contend\nwith. Life does not come to us all at one time; it comes only a\nday at a time. The following day is never ours until it becomes\nto-day, and we have nothing whatever to do with it but to pass\ndown to it a fair and good inheritance in to-day's work well\ndone, and to-day's life well lived.\n\nIf we could only realize what one day in our life really\nmeans. How we would simplify each hour. How careful we would be\nnot to lose a moment of time. Any one can carry his burden, however\nheavy, till night-fall. Any one can do his work, however hard,\nfor one day. Any one can live smoothly, patiently, lovingly, purely,\nuntil the sun goes down. And this is all life ever means to us,\njust one little day.

Father Larocque said the Mass for the living members on the Club feast; then two days later he said the Mass for the dead members. On that same day, our last year's secretary, Victoria Bellrose, was married here in the church. We were sorry we did not know she was going to be married that day, because we could not sing. But Sister Jean played the organ all during the Mass and I am sure Victorie was glad to hear all her favorite hymns. She is now Mrs. Paul Laboucan, and they are living near Kathleen. A happy married life to them both is the wish of her old schoolmates.\n\nMargaret Auger\u2014Grade VII.\n\nA HOLY HAPPY DAY.\n\nOn April 30th, many of the little boys and girls made their First Holy Communion. Everything seemed beautiful. Bishop Langlois said the Mass and gave the children their first Holy Communion. We hope \"unk\"ing was happy to be received in each little heart. At breakfast, the children ate at a table which was all decorated. In the afternoon, Bishop Langlois confirmed them. We always like to hear them renew their baptismal promises.\n\nFlorence Maskegon\u2014Grade IV.\n\nBINGO! BINGO!\n\nOn the last day of April, we had a Bingo Party in the Domestic Training School. Fr. Forcade, Fr. Mahou and Brother Pequell prepared everything. Fr. Forcade read off the numbers and told us that each one who would Bingo would get fifty peanuts. These peanuts were to represent one dollar for the Auction Sale which we were going to have afterwards. It was very exciting, when someone would Bingo, for we were supposed to keep only half of the peanuts and share the other half with some of our friends.\nAfter we had played quite a while, some had not had\nBingo at all yet, so Fr. Forcade said only those who had\nnot had any luck so far would play this last game, and\nthis time he paid the winner with jelly beans which were\nworth two dollars each. Fr. Maheu got the whole bag, and\nwhen he had treated all his unlucky friends, they were\nricher than most of those who had won two or three times.\n\nThen came the Auction Sale. Brother Piquet was the\nauctioneer. As he held up each parcel, he made some fine\nspeeches. Some people spent all the money they had for some\ngreat big box, and when they opened it, didn't they get a\nsurprise? Brother Arberve spent all his money buying\nback his fur cap which Father had stolen from his room. But\nthe best joke was on Fr. Maheu when his boots came out of\na big parcel. It was a good thing he was rich in jelly beans\nto buy them back.\n\nThere were many lovely presents too. We surely were lucky\nto have such a nice evening. At the end, Fr. Forcade made a\nspeech, and presented Helen Miller with a parting gift for\nshe was soon to fly over the rainbow... going home by plane.\nIt was the last party of the year, and I think we all agreed\nit was the very best one. We wont forget it very soon.\n\nBessie Tastewitch-D., Training School.\n\nA NEW LAUNDRY AND WELL.\n\nFor three years, Sister Superior has been doing the\nwashing in two small machines because the new laundry had\nburnt with the Boys' house. But on May 5th, the new machines\nwere ready to use, and everyone was glad to see how well\nit works. Every Monday there is washing, but now we finish\nmuch sooner than we used to.\n\nWe also have a new well. It is right close to the\nsalt water well behind the boys' house. This well is not\nvery deep. The water is clear and is not salty like the other\nones, but it is very hard. When we wash our hair, it becomes\nvery stiff and hard to comb. So we are making a novena to\nSt. Anthony to give us some soft water. I hope we get it.\n\nLeonard Ward- Philip Fraser -Grade VI.\n\nDEPARTURES AND ARRIVALS.\n\nFather Lajoie went to the East and was gone a long time.\nOn his trip, he went to see Bishop Guy and Harry Thomas.\nI bet Bishop Guy and Harry were glad to see Fr. Lajoie and to hear the Grouard news. We were glad to see Father home again.\n\nFather Grouard had been at Peace River for two months and came home again. We were glad to see him here, but after a few weeks, he told us he was going away for good, because he is the parish priest in Donnelly now. Before leaving, he blessed us. He told us that he would not see us again unless he comes for visits. We were sorry to see him go. He was here five years.\n\nSammy (win-Grade IV) \u2014 George Laboucan-Grade V.\n\nTwo weeks ago, we saw two strange Sisters in the church. We knew one of them: Sr. Denis, because she used to be here before the hospital burned down. Now she is in Jussard. The other sister is Sr. Superior's cousin. Her name is Sr. Luciosa. She has been sick, so she is coming here to rest and get strong again. She looks better already, so we hope she will soon be well, and that she will like Grouard.\n\nMary (makinak-Grade IV).\n\nCONCERT FOR OUR BISHOP.\n\nOn the eve of his feast, we had a concert for our dear Bishop. But before everything was ready, there were many people working busily to make it a success. The teachers and pupils had been practicing for a month. Brother Paquet spent almost two days putting up the stage, fixing colored and foot-lights and seeing that everything was right.\n\nGrouard had never had such beautiful printed programs as we had this year. That is because we had Fr. Forcade who is an expert at printing. He made some beautiful progress with gold lettering. Core Desjardins handed these to the guests as they arrived. A big thank you to Father for having spent so much time and work to help us out.\n\nAnother who deserves a special thank you is Father Mako, who is always on hand to direct his famous Rhythm Band (Rubber Band, they call it to tease us!). This year, Father also directed the singing of \"The Holy City\" which was very beautifully sung by the altar boys in their nice red cassocks and white surplices which Sr. Marcella had just pressed and cleaned for the occasion. We wore our Band\nI bet Bishop Guy and Harry were glad to see Fr. Lajoie and to hear the Grouard news. We were glad to see Father home again.\n\nFather Troux had been at Peace River for two months and came home again. We were glad to see him here, but after a few weeks, he told us he was going away for good, because he is the parish priest in Donnelly now. Before leaving, he blessed us. He told us that he would not see us again unless he comes for visits. We were sorry to see him go. He was here five years.\n\nStanny -win-crede IV...George Laboucan-Grade V.\n\nTwo weeks ago, we saw two strange Sisters in the church. We knew one of them: Sr. Denis, because she used to be here before the hospital burned down. Now she is in Jossard. The other sister is Sr. Superior's cousin. Her name is Sr. Luciousa. She has been sick, so she is coming here to rest and get strong again. She looks better already, so we hope she will soon be well, and that she will like Grouard.\n\nMary -makinak-Grade IV.\n\nCONCERT FOR OUR BISHOP.\n\nOn the eve of his feast, we had a concert for our dear Bishop.

A big thank you to Father for having spent so much time and work to help us out.\n\nAnother who deserves a special thank you is Father Mahe who is always on hand to direct his famous Rhythm Band (Rubber Band, they call it to tease us!). This year, Father also directed the singing of \"The Holy City\" which was very beautifully sung by the altar boys in their nice red cassocks and white surplices which Sr. Marcella had just pressed and cleaned for the occasion. We wore our Band\ncostumes and felt very proud of them. We played two selections: \"The Woodpecker Song\" and \"Dreams of Dixie\". I liked the first song best. Some of the boys had boards and rhythm sticks on which to mock the woodpecker. Everybody liked it. In the first piece, Father just directed but in the second, he played his violin too.\n\nThere were some nice plays by the boys and girls. I enjoyed seeing the girls of the training school in a tableau called \"Vocation\".\n\nAfter the concert was over, I asked Bishop for a holiday. He gladly gave us one, and then he spoke so nicely to us. We could see he was pleased with us; so we were very happy.\n\nThen, to finish it off in the right way, His Excellency gave us each a bag of candy and peanuts which we enjoyed very much.\n\nEllen Prunelle - Grade VIII.\n\nOn Mr. 16th, it was our Bishop's feast. He said Mass at the church; the children sang two new hymns, and the others and brothers sang two too. It was very nice.\n\nFor dinner, the boys went to the park while the girls stayed here. After dinner, all the girls went for a long walk. When we got back, we prepared a lunch and went out to the park in our turn. We had lots of fun, but had to come home early for Benediction.\n\nA few days after his feast, Bishop Langlois went for a business trip to the East. He just got home this morning. We are glad he is home so we can see him before we go for our holidays.\n\nViola Willier - Grade VI.\nEUCHARISTIC CONGRESS\n\nOn Ascension Day, Nora, Helen Miller and I had the privilege of going to Felton with the Fathers, Brothers and Sisters. It is the first time we ever went to a Congress.\n\nWhen we got there, it was just time for the procession. I never saw so many people in a procession. His Excellency, Bishop Langlois, was carrying the Blessed Sacrament, assisted by Fr. Forcade and Fr. Bauscage. At the Church Repository then, there was a sermon, then the blessing of the sick with the \"blessed Sacrament.\"\n\nIt was interesting to see the school children from all the different schools. They all wore caps of different colors. Annie and Nancy Thomas, and Nora Maher were with the Donnelly girls singing. It was beautiful singing.\n\nAfter supper, there was a beautiful French pageant. It was out-of-doors. The children represented France, England and Canada. It was very, very nice. The children spoke very loudly and clearly. Then Bishop Langlois got up and spoke so nicely. He thanked everyone for the beautiful Congress.\n\nIt was quite late when we started for home. We were tired and sleepy the next day in class, but we were very glad we were chosen to go. That's once I was more than glad to understand French!\n\nBulla Cardinal - Grade VIII.\n\nOUR TRIP TO JOUSSARD.\n\nEvery year, the Grouard truck takes the children to Joussard on May 24th. It is a big day, and everyone is always anxious for it. While we were at breakfast that morning, Sister named the lucky ones who were to go. It did not take us long to get ready, make our lunch and hop into the truck.\n\nWhen we got there, everyone ran out\nto meet us. Father Superior asked us if we wanted to play ball right away, so we said no, we wanted to visit around first and make friends.\n\nAfter dinner, the boys played soft ball, and lost by three points. Then the girls played a game. Our girls beat. Then the boys played a game of hard ball. Jussard was way ahead. They have a very good team. After supper, they played again for a little while but there was such a cold wind that we soon came home. We got here at 10:30 and had lunch and went to bed.\n\nLillie \"Grade VI.\"\n\nVISIT OF A SUPERIOR GENERAL.\n\nOn May 30th, the Mother General of the Sisters of the Holy Cross came here with two other Sisters to visit. They were here for dinner, and visited all around. They went to Sister Jean's classroom first. They wanted to hear the pupils sing in Creole, so they sang a hymn. When they came into our class, we said our prayers in French for them. They visited all the school, and then went away.\n\nMary Cardinal - \"Grade IV.\"\n\nMY TRIP....OR MY VACATION.\n\nOne evening, Father Mahieu asked me if I wanted to go for a trip with him. I thought he was just \"kidding\" but anyway, I said \"Yes.\" Next day, it came true. We left about 10:30. We went to Emilie and went around visiting people till Sunday. Father said Mass there. On Monday, we went to East Prairie and were to come back next day, but Father wanted to go hunting so we stayed. The next morning, Father, Ray Moran and I started off on horseback.\n\nOn the way, a branch knocked off my cap. Father's horse got scared and gave a sudden jump, bucking Father right off. When we asked him if he was hurt, he laughed and said, \"No, I'm all right.\" On our way back, we took our own way crossing the river instead of sticking to the path. Father's horse was stuck in some quicksand, so Father got off. Just then the horse got loose and left Father standing in the water! While Ray was watching this, his horse got stuck on the bank. I don't know how they finally got out as I was busy watching my own horse. While climbing off the steep bank, I slid off as I had no saddle, and the horse nearly dumped me in the vines.\nthat night we finally got home again late and we had a lot of fun over it. We didn't get fat eating the same we killed though! The next day we came back to the mission around midnight hour, and wasn't I tired? Sister Jean insists on calling my trip a vacation, because I was gone almost a week instead of just over the week-end. Anyway, I enjoyed it and wouldn't mind going again. Father had his violin and I had the guitar along, so we had plenty of music to keep us happy.\n\nCharlie White - Grade VII\n\nAN OUTING IN THE WOODS.\n\nOn the first of June, the ten biggest boys went out to the woods with Brother Beaulac for a picnic. We fixed our own lunch, and put each our own in a little sack and carried it on our back.\n\nAll the way down, we had lots of fun talking with Brother because he can't talk English, so we had to say all the French words we knew. We saw rabbits and partridges. We were going to swim, but the lake was too full of sticks, so we went hunting rabbits instead.\n\nWe came back and started a fire, where we roasted a rabbit and toasted our bread. Then Brother said it was time for Benediction, so we started back. When we saw we were going to be late, we speeded up. We sure were hot when we got in church, and Sister almost laughed when she saw our dirty, hot faces. She said we looked like tramps.\n\nAlexis Cardinal - H.John Chalifour - Grade VII.\n\nA TRIP TO WHITEFISH LAKE.\n\nOn the last day of May, Father Superior left for Whitefish Lake with Sisters Louis, Omer and Hu. They were there during treaty time, so they saw all of our relatives and friends there. They stayed in Fr. Rou\u00e9's house. Father was gone to Prairie Lake so they did not see him there.\nWhen they came back on Tuesday, we were all anxious to see them. They told us that everyone at home is well. The Sisters said they liked their trip very much. They looked very tired though. The roads were rough and dusty.\n\nMarjorie Wallman - Grade IV.\n\nFIRST PICNIC AT SHAW'S POINT.\n\nWe big girls of the Training School had not yet taken the half-holiday which Mr. and Mrs. L'Heureux had given us on their last visit here, so on June second, after classes, we went to Shaw's Point for a pancake supper.\n\nJust as we reached there, we were welcomed by clouds of fish-flies, so many of them that we could not open our mouths otherwise we would have had our supper on them instead of pancakes. But when we went farther up, they were left.\n\nWhile the Sisters were getting things ready for supper, some went swimming, some went wading, or exploring.\n\nWhen suppertime came, we sat around in a ring and ate the pancakes up almost as fast as they were cooked. Then we saw a boat coming.\n\nFar off in the distance there was a little sull boat which we were wishing we could go for a ride in. We went down to the shore to meet the boat. It was Mr. and Mrs. McDermott. We talked and joked with them a long time and watched them bring the boats in. They said they had to hurry to feed the mink, so we followed them up and went to watch these animals eat their supper. Some of the Sisters had never seen them before. They fed them fish and other things all chopped up. They were very greedy because they were hungry.\n\nWe got home around ten o'clock that night. We sang and laughed all the way. We did not forget to say a big \"Thank You\" to Fr. Forcade who had given us this pleasure, for he was \"Boss\" while Fr. Superior was away. I hope this is just the beginning of the summer's picnics.\n\nMollie Cardinal - Domestic Training School.\nDEPARTURES AND VISITORS.\n\nSummer Vacation is just around the corner, everyone is thinking of going \"HOME\". Some of the girls who have been at the Training School got a head start and are already gone. The first to leave was Delphine Chalifoux. She had finished her two years' training, so she got a job at the hospital in Fort St. John. She was glad to go there.\n\nMadeleine Bigstone had a chance to go back to her home in Wabasca with her father, so she left a few days ago. Helen Miller who had been here at the Mission for thirteen years left for home in Fort Ware last week. She missed her plane in Peace River so had to go to Grande Prairie to get it. We all wish these Club-members success in life, and hope to hear from them soon.\n\nNora Cardinal - Grade VIII.\n\nOn Saturday morning, June 7th, we were surprised to see some soldiers here. They used to be pupils here so they had come for a visit to school. Sister Jean was proud of them because she took their photo. The old pupils who went home on leave were: Edward Macdonald, Alex Fraser, Charles Tomkins, Peter Tomkins, Alfred Macdonald, Malcolm Gardiner, Myles McDermott and Herman Moore. Arthur Maher also came with them. We hope that all these soldiers who are gone to fight for their country will come home safely.\n\nMargaret Fraser - Grade V.\n\nA BIG DAY IN GROUARD.\n\nOn June 9th, the King's Birthday, we were all happy because the Sturgeon Lake and Joussard pupils were coming to spend the day with us. Weren't we glad when we saw the Sturgeon Lake truck coming about half past nine? We all ran out to meet them. We played the gramophone and amused ourselves till the truck came with the Joussard pupils.\n\nAfter dinner, we played around for a while, then we all went to the Boys' Hall. The Sturgeon Lake Band played many pieces for us. They have more instruments than we have. We were very glad to hear their Band. The Joussard pupils sang a cowboy song. Then our Band played two pieces, Frances and Viola sang a lullaby, Ellen Brunelle recited her famous \"Baseball Game\", and then we sang \"There'll Always Be an England\".\nWhen it was time for the base ball game, everyone went out to the field to see the game. The Sturgeon Lake team played a few innings against Joussard, but they had not had enough practice to play against Joussard, so Grouard played Joussard. The Joussard boys won again by many scores. After supper, our team played against the Joussard girls but this time we had lost our three best players, so we were beaten all to pieces. We had only 7 runs while they had 27. But it was fun anyway.\n\nWhen the trucks left, we all cheered. We were glad we were at home so we didn't have to ride a long way before going to bed. The players were supposed to go to Sturgeon this week, but it has been raining almost all week, so I guess that will be just next year now. Too bad!\n\nFaith Gladu\u2014Raymond Burpremont\u2014Grade V.\n\nFEAST OF CORPUS CHRISTI.\n\nFor three days before the great feast of the Blessed Sacrament, we prepared our souls by listening to beautiful sermons on the \"Holy Eucharist.\" Fr. Forcada's sermons were so interesting that for the time he was speaking, we didn't know what tired meant. One night, we sat there for forty minutes, and when he was finished, we thought it was only ten minutes ago that he had started. If we put into practice what Father told us, we shall surely reach heaven some day.\n\nRight after High Mass on the feast of Corpus Christi, we had the procession outside. It was quite a long procession but the weather was so nice that it was not tiresome. That same afternoon, the rain started, and it has been raining for four days. We are glad God gave us nice weather Sunday.\n\nMore Cardinal\u2014Grade VIII.\n\nSAD NEWS FOR SISTER SUPERIOR.\n\nTuesday, Sister Superior received the sad news that her dear mother had died on the feast of Corpus Christi. We were all very sorry to hear this, and we offered prayers for the repose of the soul of Sr. Superior's mother. Next Monday, we will sing a Requiem Mass for the dear departed.\nOLD PUPILS' CORNER.\n\nDear Good Counsellors:\n\n'Tis hard to believe that another school year has rolled by, and that this is the last issue of \"Echoes\". Mingled with the joy that vacation brings is a feeling of sadness. It is always hard to see the older pupils go never to return again, as pupils. Yes, if I could, I would keep you here always, to shield you from life's dangers and sorrows. But as that is humanly impossible, I breathe a prayer that all these dear Good Counsellors who will leave us in a few days, may ever be true to all that we have tried to teach them here\u2014that the principles learned here will guide them safely through whatever may befall them in later life.\n\nHere is part of an interesting letter received from our former Club President, Dolphis Budskin:\n\n\"Yes, dear Sister, I was married to Isabelle John on May 8th. I surely appreciate the good wishes you sent, and hope it will be a lasting happiness for both my wife and I. I am sending you a photo of the two of us which I hope you will keep as a souvenir of one of your old boys....Tell my old schoolmates not to wish they were out of school; it will come soon enough and they will surely regret it then. Thank you, Dolphis\u2014 and Congratulations!\n\nLast week I had a nice surprise in the form of a letter from Mrs. George Fowarue, in England. Our old George is now back in a hospital, and is doing well when he is off duty, working in their garden or driving the car. So he is lucky to have Eileen as a secretary. I was happy to receive a lovely photo of them both...which is now on the piano. Our best wishes to you both\u2014across the sea!\n\nDonat also sent interesting letters and photos of himself and \"Jean\". He is still in Scotland in charge of a wireless station. As soon as things look a little brighter, there will be a Mrs. Don Fowarue! How happy I am that both these dear lads have chosen such good Catholic girls. It pays to be good, doesn't it?\n\nOne day I saw a tall fellow coming up to school with his hat pulled way down over his face. He had\na familiar look. I guessed right away that it was some \"Old Timer\" who wanted to surprise \"our Teacher\".\u2014\u2014and sure enough, it was Victor Bourgeois. He has been here three weeks now, recuperating from a minor operation. A few days later, I had a visit from Johnny Bourgeois. Since then, Johnny has gone to Edmonton to join the army and Victor told me last night that he will do the same thing next week. Good luck to you and all our other soldier-boys. There will soon be quite a regiment of my old pupils. We shall be looking forward to the promised letters from all of you. And when the war is over, don't forget to come back to the old school, and thrill us with your accounts\u2014true or false!!!!!\n\nAnother former Club President who came to pay me a very pleasant visit a few weeks ago was Emmy Morden. She is finishing Grade XII in High Prairie this year. Our old mischief, Ruth, was with her trying her best to be very dignified, but I could still see traces of her mischief. Did you see the announcement of Hazel Gordon's engagement to Dr. Wood? The marriage will take place sometime in the summer. Best wishes, Hazel dear! And I hope we shall have a chance to see the beautiful bride!\n\nLast Sunday, a little lady named Yvonne Cardinal came to greet me, having just returned to Grouard after several months in Fort St. John. She can still smile!\n\nLeo Dufrane left last fall for his job somewhere near Edmonton. I have not heard where he is stationed yet, but no doubt he will write on time to get his copy of the \"Echoes.\" Simmon Dufrane is now working in Dunclay.\n\nI know you will enjoy a few paragraphs of Sam Miller's last letter. Here it is, in his usual breezy style:\n\n\"The fragrance of the green grass and leaves has cast me into the mood of writing. The weather is just grand with an occasional shower to help the grass along......I am enclosing two clippings which might be of interest to the girls of the Domestic School. The poems will no doubt bring their self-esteem as cooks down to reasonable proportions. I hope they will not resent this\u2014it is all in the spirit of fun. Those pancake days must be fun, and I often wish I could attend one. Yes, I would even volunteer to make the slap-jacks. And when the boys and girls finished eating, they would know they had really eaten something, and I am positive they wouldn't...\"\nfeel too comfortable either. By the way, Sister, who is\nthe cartoonist, or should I say the artist, who draws all\nthe illustrations for the Echoes? Curiosity prompted me\nto ask that question, for they always amuse me greatly.\"\n(Ms. Cartoonist is a talented Ft. Vermilion girl-Belle\nCardinal). I glad you appreciate her efforts, Sam.).....\n\"And now, let me thank you for your thoughtfulness, Sister.\nYou can be sure that I try to live up to the ideals you\ntaught us, and I want you to know that your efforts have\nnot been in vain.\"\n\nIf I could feel that all of you echo the sentiments\nexpressed in Sam's last line, I should ask for no greater\nconsolation. I want to be proud of you not only for Time,\nbut for Eternity. Remember that, won't you, so that not one\nClub Member will be missing at the final \"Home-Coming Day.\"\nI wish you all a wonderfully happy vacation, and hope\nI shall have the opportunity of meeting many of you during\nthese weeks of relaxation. Should I not be here to edit\nthe \"Echoes\" next year, I want you to know that I have\nappreciated your kind encouragement, and that from whatever\ncorner of the world I may be, I shall always remember you\nand be happy to hear from you. And in parting from you\nin these pages which have kept us united in spirit through\nthe years, I can think of nothing\ntruer than this bit of verse:\nI want you to know you are never\nforgotten,\nThat the old, glad days hid in memory\nsweet\nAre still a part of my life that I\ncherish,\nWithout them, so much would be\nincomplete.\nAnd you are mixed up with so much I\nremember,\nYour names I so often utter in prayer\nNever forgotten, our tryst is in Hee\nWhere God keeps watch with tenderest care.\n\nSister Jean Alexander\nMR. DOUCET'S VISIT\n\nFrom May 16 to May 24, Mr. Doucet, Director of Education with the Indian Department, was a visitor at this school. As he has already done in other Alberta Indian schools, he has studied local problems and has held conferences with the teachers and staff. The result: next year, a very definite programme of studies will be put into effect. It is to be a practical combination of academical and manual training. The teachers and the staff are anxious to follow this new system, which, there is no doubt, will give our pupils a most practical preparation for their adult lives on the Reserves.\n\nParents, with our cooperation, we would want to be able to join your own. Consider the great efforts being made towards the education of your children. By trying your utmost to set a good example for them at home, by sending your children to school at the proper age, by encouraging your children in whatever progress they may be making at school or after they leave the school, you can contribute very much towards our common ideal: the formation of your children to become honest and useful citizens of Canada.\n\nAt the close of this school year we can rightfully state here that progress has been achieved in nearly every line.\n\nThose among you who have had the opportunity of assisting at the concert given by the pupils last May 20, have certainly become aware of a great change for the best, in the pupils.\nIn the following pages, they will themselves tell you of their great achievements in the field of sports. Some of them have had the grand opportunity of making a name for themselves and for the Indians of Hobbs, by taking part in physical training demonstrations held in Edmonton and in Calgary.\n\nLast February 11th, 101 Indians of the Samson Reserve held a meeting at which it was decided that land would be leased on that Reserve for the erection of a Catholic Church there. More than 95 of those present voted in favour of the building. With the help of the school boys, the old church near the school was torn down. The wood has been transported to the new site and the building is now under construction.\n\nIn charge, many of the Indians are wondering why they are not given a chance to work \"with pay\" on the church. The answer is very simple; not enough money. This is a Mission church where no collections are taken and therefore where the faithful have no share whatsoever in the expenses. That is the reason why only the employed and occasionally the boys of the school are working it now. As the latter started hauling gravel for the foundation from the river, a certain Indian took his team alone, loaded his wagon and hauled his gravel to the site of the new church. (Continued further on.)\nFIRST COMMUNIONS\n\nSome of the children made their first Holy Communion on Ascension Day. Father Callis prepared them for their first Communion. There were nine boys and sixteen girls. They were all glad to make their first Communion to receive Little Jesus in their hearts. After High Mass they had their picture taken by Bro. Guilbert in front of the school. After they had a special dinner.\n\nAmelia goes to Edmonton to see Dolphins\n\nOn Saturday, June 7 I went to Edmonton with Father Rh\u00e9aume to see my brother Dolly who is in the General Hospital. He has T.B. And I also saw Dolly Omosee. She is in the hospital too for T.B. On our way back I got sick. When we got to the school I helped to clean the floor. But I was very happy because I saw dolphins and Dolly.\n\nMR. BLACETTI'S VISIT\u2014Marcello Soosy\n\nLast May 18 Mr. Blacetti came to see us. We were very glad to see him. He said he could not stay very long because he had just been married the day before. But he came back on May 23rd and brought the boys a big box of apples. We ate them at the piano on May 24th.

We walked up to the railway and then we waited for Father Rh\u00e9aume. While we were waiting George Montour's mother came and took some boys there in her wagon. The big boys went in Father Rh\u00e9aume's car.\n\nWhen we got there we started to work. Some of the big boys cut down the branches and the others piled them up and then we burnt them. At dinner time we found a nice place. We ate sandwiches, beans and had soft drinks. Father Rh\u00e9aume brought his gramophone and we played a new record called \"Funiculi Funicula.\"\n\nAfter that we went to work again but it did not take long to finish. So we all went to the river to swim. Father Rh\u00e9aume brought some of the boys and Pat. Yellowbird's father took some or the others. We all had a good time. When we were ready to come back home we all went to the spring to drink some water. On the way we found a well with ice in it. We took some ice out and everybody had some ice to suck. Then one of the boys saw the car coming and we all rushed to meet Mr. Eclerc. He took the small boys first and then he went back to get the other big boys.\n\nONE DAY A CAR STOPPED IN FRONT OF THE SCHOOL!!!!!\n\nOut stepped a \"magnum.\" In no time a crowd of boys gathered near the car. It was to their great relief when they found out it was only Constable Broadway of Camrose who had come to buy a pair of moccasins for his 9 months old baby !!!!!\n\nOUR CONCERT\n\nby M.Ann Godin & C.T.Dion.\n\nWe had a concert on May 21st in honor of Father Rh\u00e9aume, our principal.\n\nWe enjoyed it very much and everyone who saw it said we had done very well indeed.\n\nFirst we had a patriotic sing song by the senior boys and girls. Then a drill of little negro boys and girls; this was called \"Turkies Delight\". It was very funny to see them dance and march.\n\nAfter that was a recitation by a little boy; a song by grade 2 pupils and last of all was a play of boy scouts which made us laugh very much. Everyone did his part very well.\n\nWe did it over again for our parents. We were very glad to be able to show them what we could do on the stage.\n\nOUR PICNIC\n\nby A.Oldpan & R.Croce.\n\nOn May 24th, we had a picnic on the Sumpson Reserve at the place where they have the Stampede. We went as soon as our work was finished after dinner. Many of us had a ride either in a wagon or in Father Moulin's car.\n\nAs soon as we reached the place Chief Sumsan spoke to us in Cree while Dan Johnson repeated what he said in English. Then we sang some patriotic songs and began the races at once. We had all kinds of races for little and big boys and girls. We also saw a horse race. The boys did all kinds of physical training exercises. We liked to watch them. We had lunch and supper there and came back about seven that evening. We stopped at the store on our way back.\n1/That 1 mile is the same as 320 rods, or 1760 yd.\n\n2/That 144 sq.in. = 1 sq.ft.\n304 sq.ft. = 1 sq.yd.\n96 sq.yd. = 1 acre\n640 acres = 1 square mile or 1 section.\n160 acres = 1 quarter section.\n320 acres = 1 half section.\n\n3/That 1 bushel of wheat weighs 60 lbs.\npotatoes 60 lbs.\nclover seed 50 lbs.\nturnips 50 lbs.\ncabbages 50 lbs.\nbeets 50 lbs.\nrye 56 lbs.\nbarley 48 lbs.\nbuckwheat 48 lbs.\ntimothy seed 34 lbs.\noats 34 lbs.\n\n4/That the area of a rectangle (for example: a field that has four sides) is found by multiplying the length times the width.\n\n5/That the area of a triangle (for example: that has three sides) is found by multiplying one-half the base times the height.\n\n6/That the number of board feet in a board is found by multiplying the thickness (in inches) times the width (in feet) times the length (in feet).\n\n7/That Volume equals length times the width times the height.\n\nHAND WOOD FIRER\n\nTo make this firer, take a piece of thin pipe about five feet long. Fill a piece of twisted rag into one end using a bit of tar until the rag is about two inches into the pipe. From the other end fill the pipe with kerosene or distillate and plug with a tight cork. The rag acts as a wick and will blow out until it is put out or the fuel is exhausted.\n\nA wagon seat that is easy to make and easy to ride on can be made from a short length of board and an old tire. Two sections are cut from the tire and nailed to the board. This provides a seat that is comfortable and easy to ride on.\n\nESTABLISHING FIREWOOD STORAGE - To store a large quantity of firewood, cut each section directly opposite to each other. Make a space of about 1 part cement and 2 parts of sand. Fill the space dry. Then wire the stone through the holes to tighten the wires use wedges as shown in diagram.\n1-What is more useful when it is broken?\n2-Does the color of the shell of an egg indicate anything about its quality, taste, or nutritive value?\n3-In baseball, can a batted ball be called fair after hitting home plate?\n4-What is it you keep after you have given it to someone else?\n5-What causes knots in boards?\n6-Is a hare a rabbit?\n7-In which sport does the winning team move backwards?\n8-How would you make a Maltese cross?\n9-If a blue spruce is a kind of evergreen tree, what is a cayuse?\n10-Who were the first people in America to use lipstick, eyebrow pencil and rouge?\n11-One brick above two bricks, one brick between two bricks, one brick beneath two bricks.

It is celebrated on the last Sunday in October. It was started by Pope Pius XI. Feasts are made only for a good reason. The Pope began this beautiful feast to honor Our Lord in a special way and to make people remember that He is our King.\n\nWhen People Forgot\n\nA number of years ago many people seemed to forget that Christ was their King. They forgot His commandment that everyone should love his neighbor. The terrible World War started. Sickness and trouble followed it. Then in some countries leaders arose who tried to do away with all religion. What a sad, bad state of affairs this old world had come to! And it had all come about because people had forgotten that Christ was their King, and had disobeyed His command to love God and their neighbor.\n\nWhy The Feast Began\n\nPope Pius XI saw all this. That is why he began this great new feast. He wished to make people remember that Christ is King of the whole world and that all men should honor and obey Him. Let us honor Christ our King next Sunday in a special way. Let us offer Him our hearts when we receive Him in Holy Communion.\n\nALL SAINTS' DAY\n\nWe usually think of a saint as a person who did wonderful things when he was on earth. There were many saints like this, we know. But there are many others of whom we never hear. They did not work great miracles. They did not die as martyrs. They did not preach great sermons. They did not work miracles because God did not give them that power. They would gladly have given their lives for their faith, but they did not have the chance to do so. They were not\nborn great preachers.\n\nThese people, however, did everything in their power to please God. Today they are in Heaven with God.\n\nMost of the great saints have feast days of their own. On Friday, November 1, however, the Church will honor ALL the saints in Heaven\u2014the great ones and the ones of whom we never hear. It is one of the most important feasts of the year. Because it is a holy day of obligation, we must attend Mass on this feast just the same as on Sundays.\n\nALL SOULS' DAY\n\nNovember 2 is another great day in the Church year. It is called All Souls' Day because it makes us think of all the souls in Purgatory. Some day those holy, suffering souls will be saints in Heaven. But now they need our prayers. Some day we may be in Purgatory ourselves. Then we shall want someone to pray for us. We should always remember the Poor Souls, especially the souls of our own relatives.\n\nMonth of the Holy Souls\n\nNovember is the month of the Holy Souls in Purgatory. They cannot help themselves, so we must do all we can for them. Every day during the month of the Holy Souls let us help them by some special act of devotion. We can hear Mass, receive Holy Communion or say the Rosary or other prayers. Saying the Stations of the Cross is another good way to help them. Our dear Lord said: \"Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy.\" Pray for the Poor Souls and they will pray for you.\n\nR.I.P.\n\nAll hale and hearty are the children of this School. And there's no doubt about it. They are really trying hard to do their share towards an education, which each and every one of them require if they are to become good and useful citizens of Canada.\n\nLet us not forget that it is necessary for the good of the community, that its future citizens be properly equipped for all the duties and responsibilities which they will have to face as men and women.\n\nThe family is supposed to play an important part in training boys and girls to be good and useful citizens. But the parents cannot do it all, and it would often be unwise to let them try.\n\nThis is the reason why the government sees to it that all children are provided with educational opportunities and the government also insists that all children shall take advantage of these.\n\nMany Indians seem to ignore what the government and the schools are trying to do for their children. Here is a summary of the reasons why the government insists upon every boy and girl receiving a good education. 1\u2014Schools do away with ignorance, idleness, and crime, and therefore are necessary to the order, safety, and progress of the community.\n\n2\u2014Schools give every boy and girl in a community a fair chance to start life on an equality with other children and fit them to take their place and do their part in the world.\n\n3\u2014Schools teach the pupils the necessity of obedience and the great value of self-control.\nWe had an arithmetic match against Grade 1. We won the lottery too. The score was 14 to 12.\n\nStanley Buffalo GP-2\n\nEXP THE MISSIONS\n\nFather Rh\u00e9aume came in our classrooms. He held a nice picture in his hands and a little box to put in some money. On his pictures there were children of other countries. He said that they had no missionaries to teach them their religion. To help them we are going to make little sacrifices by giving them a few cents.\n\nRose Littlechild GP-2\n\nSUNDAY\n\nMission Sunday was on the twelfth of October. On that day my father did not come to see me just my grand-father and my grandmother came. But they did not give me any money. Many of the boys and girls put money in the box for the propagation of the Faith. But I and some other did not put money in the box yet. Next time I will try to put money in the box.\n\nRobert Buffalo GP-3\n\nOUR ENTERPRISE...\n\nwe are just starting our enterprise. The name of it is \"work and play the healthy way.\"\n\nRussell Maclean GP-2\n\nTry to make good use of your enterprise.\n\nRussell Ed.\n\nGrade 1\n\nAlex Oldman\n\nWe can find a lot of things.\n\nPercy Minde\n\nbought a car from this store.\nA VISITOR FROM DELMAS\n\nNot long ago, Sister Superior of Delmas came to visit us. She was very kind and brought us some gifts. We were very happy to see her.\n\nThe boys and girls were very excited when they heard about Sister Superior's visit. They asked her many questions and she answered them all patiently.\n\nSister Superior stayed with us for a few days and then left. We missed her very much and we hope to see her again soon.\n\nFrancis Ross Little Child\n\nTHE NEW FARMERS (GREENHURS)\n\nThe new farmers are:\n\nBuffalo James Saddleback, George H. Myers Dion Rattlesnake, Shock Grana Lawrence Johnson, P. A. Rick (Half-Pint), Yellowbird Victor Otter, and Joseph (Grapetton) Sharpe.\n\nCalline Therese Dion\n\nI am very glad to say that we had a picnic, and I am going to tell you something about it.\n\nWe all went in a truck but the boys went first. Then we girls got there. It was near Bear Lake. After we had our dinner in the woods near Bear Lake, we went swimming. The girls run all kinds of races and washed their feet in the lake. Then we had our supper after supper we came back home. The boys came back first. It took the truck a long time to come back. It was dark when the truck came back for us. Three sisters came back with us. On the way the girls were singing and yelling when all of a sudden, when we were passing over a bridge, the truck tipped over and we fell out very quickly and in perfect order!!! I am glad to say that no one was hurt. This is the end of my story.\n\nHalf-Pint, Half-Pint, Yellowbird Victor Otter\n\nLast Saturday we got our new underwear. They were of their too big for us or we were too small for them. Anyway we want to show them to Mr. Morau. He said they were all right. So we went to bed. But just as I was going to bed I thought of something. I got up filled up my underwear with a pillow and some towels and then went again to see Mr. Morau. I was holding onto one arm of the underwear. Yellowbird was holding the other one and Patrick on the door. So I knocked this trick only once. Patrick, Half-Pint, Yellowbird Victor Otter\nOUR TIMES...\n\nOn October the 13th, we went to meet our kind Sister Superior at the station; we were very glad to see her back again for we missed her very much when she was away. She went to Quebec and said she had had a very nice trip both going and coming back. She bought the girls some mirrors, some little crucifixes, perfume and other things too. We thanked her for being so kind to us. I think every one of the girls will return something by praying and by receiving Holy Communion for her. Therese Linde gr. 15\n\nPRESENT ARMS!\n\nLately we have been taking a bit of cadet drill. We have to know how to slope and order arms. We also know how to present arms. This is what we will mean. Sister Superior came back from Quebec. Shortnose gr. 6\n\nPINOCCHIO\n\nWe had the chance of seeing the show of Pinocchio in Winnipeg. We were all happy to go. All the boys went in cars. Those who brought us went in ours. Those who brought us were: Mr. Thorne, Mrs. Courney Jr., Enil, Colonel Teris, Miss Courney Jr., Enil, Miss McLeod, Mrs. Pelendek Jr., Mr. Richardson and Johnny Grier. All the children went and nearly all the Sisters too. It was a very amusing show to see Pinocchio made of wood.\n\nBefore we saw Pinocchio we saw some cowboys playing and singing for some school children. Then we saw the show that we heard so much about. Then the show was over, we went back home thinking of all the nice things we seen... want to thank all those who brought us there and special thanks to Miss Conroy who paid the carpet tax.\n\nPinocchio was a little wooden boy and promised he would become a real boy if he was honest himself and would not always listen to his conscience. Jimmy Cricket and for that nearly be come a joker. But at the end he saved his father and the Fairy told him he had earned him by making him a real boy.

April 1944 Number 2.\n\nOne of the most debated questions of Indian policy today is that which concerns the extent to which Indian customs, traditions, arts and crafts should be revived or encouraged to survive. It would appear that the work of the Indian Affairs Branch to the south of us may be under fire for its position in that matter, regardless of the high opinion they may have won of their work. Even in so insignificant a paper as \"Wampum,\" there have been differences of opinion. It would be well if we could discuss the subject since it is vital to the purpose and program of our work.\n\nIn the Christian Century for March 28, 1944, there is an article by Oswald Grey from Tillard on \"Leadership and the Indian Affairs Bureau,\" or course, to the situation in the United States. Now this article is not, I think, strictly from the sentimental point of view the disappearance of the Indian tribe will be a genuine loss. So far as possible their unique handicrafts and ceremonials should be preserved. But there is no doubt among the fact that there can be only one outcome, and that is the disappearance. The Indians themselves will tire of being considered circus exhibits, museum pieces seeking to keep alive vestiges of a life that was altogether and of a culture that was valuable in some degree, though by now it is always.\n\nPublic interest is growing considerably in the Indian people, but it is largely from the viewpoint of anthropology and ethnology, and is stimulated by the amazing discoveries of ancient Indian civilizations and various historic sites. I welcome this interest, so long as it does not lead to the exploitation of the Indian as a living exhibit, human museum pieces. We need to be clear in our minds as to the purpose behind our revival of Indian arts and customs, so that this renewed interest will serve to promote the best development of our Indian people in the world of today, it must go a means to an end, rather than an end in itself.\n\nSurely it is our hope that the Indian people will be an integral part of the Canadian cycle, bringing to it their own contribution in culture and philosophy, and likewise contributing member of the family, along with the other races and nationalities which will comprise the true Canada of tomorrow. To this end, an education, on the part of both Indians and whites of the history and culture of the Indian people, is highly desirable. It will make us more willing to admit them as brothers and on a basis of mutual respect. Such a change of attitude, on the part of our people, will have to begin in our schools, by means of changes in text books and some appreciation on the part of teachers, whose attitudes will be communicated to their pupils. This would suggest a required reading course for teachers while at normal school, not necessarily very heavy, but such as to give your teacher a sympathetic understanding of the Indian people. This is no doubt imperative also for the other minority groups in Canada, but we are most interested here in its bearing on the Indian people of Canada.\n\nLet us hear from you on this subject.\n\nH.E.J.\nThe Place of Home Missions in a Post-war World\n\nBy G.E.E. Lindquist\n\nAs a basis for my remarks, I quote an old familiar verse, \"Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, the Lord knoweth them that are His. And let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.\" (II Tim.2:19) This bit of Scripture seems to me to give the assurance we need in facing the topic before us: (1) that we have, here and now, a foundation; (2) that it standeth sure, amidst the confusions and turmoils of our time; (3) that we have powerful allies, the Lord, high and lifted up, on the one hand, but nevertheless concerned with our infirmities and shortcomings; also, them that are His, the great cloud of witnesses, the pioneers who have gone before with whom we as Christians may enjoy the communion of saints; (4) that we have a Christian Mission, not limited by any untoward conditions. In this connection I quote the words of another, \"I am a Christian to be a Christian is to be a missionary; as a missionary I cannot be indifferent to the needs of others;\" (5) and with this there is the implication of a social as well as a moral crusade in the words, \"let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.\" May I suggest that this be the key-note verse for our Brome Conference, for it furnishes the foundation, not only for the place of Christian missions in a post-war world, but for Christian missions at all times....\n\nIt is fundamental that the place of home missions in a post-war world will depend on the interpretation of missions in relation to people everywhere. Among the characteristics too often in evidence today toward certain racial groups, more especially the Indian, is that of paternalism. Shall governmental and ecclesiastical wardship over Indians continue in the post-war world? It is significant that although the Indian fights for democracy he is still in large measure denied full participation in what we like to term \"the American way of life.\" Since formal citizenship came to our Indian brethren as a result of their participation in World War I, have we not a right to anticipate that release from federal wardship might be forth coming as a by-product of World War II?\n\nIn any discussion of missions and a post-war world, we need to continually remind ourselves as well as our constituency that there can be no real freedom without the assumption of obligations. I recall in this connection what is inscribed on the statue of General Giles Waldo Shurtleff of Oberlin College, the first Brigadier-General in charge of Negro troops during the civil war, \"Freedom cannot be given, it must be achieved.\" A similar statement was made at the recent Cleveland Conference by Rabbi Silver, who said, \"Freedom without the voluntary assumption of obligations, without sharing burdens and making sacrifices, is no freedom at all, but the sheerest anarchy.\" Should not the voluntary assumption of obligations in the matter of self-support, as well as self-government, increasingly characterize our Indian missions in the post-war world?\n\nFurthermore, the home missionary enterprise must not be content with institutions which seem sufficient within themselves. The Roman Catholic Church in Latin American countries often fostered missions among the Indians which might be called islands of isolation, the idea being that the Indians being gathered within the mission compound might be guarded from outside contacts and thus become self-sufficient. But history records the inevitable breakdown of this sort of isolationism. Even a mission school, essential and highly desirable in its place, may outgrow its usefulness. \"New occasions teach new duties, time makes ancient good uncouth.\"\n\n(continued on next page) Moreover there must...\nMoreover, there must be definite plans to integrate minority groups into community life. The Indian Church may become a real community centre but only as it ministers to all within its sphere of influence regardless of race or color. Is there any cogent reason why an Indian Mission may not become a centre of goodwill to all sorts and conditions of men rather than serve on a level of separation?\n\nCompetition must give way to cooperation, which is just another way of saying that ecclesiastical barriers, so menacing along the old frontiers, must be broken down in the post-war world. For here is that saying true that denominationalism, like patriotism, is not enough. And as far as the Indian is concerned, his designation of denominational nomenclature would seem to indicate that he has but superficially grasped our historical denominational differences. The Archbishop of Canterbury in his first radio address to America reminded us that there is a great public ready to listen to what we say together, who do not pay any attention while we say it in separation. And the late Sir Wilfred Grenfell taught us by precept and example that ecclesiastical barriers can be broken down in the pathways of service. He once told about amputating the infected leg of a Catholic member in Labrador. Later, when he was visiting a Congregational Church in the United States, he asked if anyone there knew of an artificial leg that might be donated, since it was difficult to obtain them in Labrador. Following the service, a Methodist woman offered a leg which her Presbyterian husband had used until his death. Grenfell concluded: \"When I, an Episcopalian, took that Presbyterian leg, given me by a Methodist woman in a Congregational Church, back to Labrador, and fitted it on my Roman Catholic friend, it enabled him to walk perfectly.\"\n\nFinally, the Cross must be our uniting symbol in the post-war world. We must put love in the place of hate, fellowship in the place of isolation, cooperation in the place of competition. Shall we not take our place under the banner of the Cross?\n\n\"Beneath the Cross of Jesus, I fain would take my stand,\nThe shelter of a mighty rock, within a weary land.\nA home within the wilderness, A rest upon the way,\nFrom the burning of the noontide heat, And the burden of the day.\"\n\nThe Cross thus standing at the centre of the Christian's hope must also become the uniting symbol.\n\nAnd as we go forth into our respective fields to face the baffling problems of a post-war world, let us bear in mind the fatherly counsel given by the greatly revered Professor Clarke to his theologians: \"Young men, remember when you get out in your fields that God was there before you.\" Yes, He was there in the pre-war world and He will also be there in the post-war world. God grant that we may be attuned to His leading and avail ourselves of His infinite resources as we face our missionary task.\n\nFrom the News Letter of National Fellowship of Indian Workers, October, 1943. Condensed still more.\n\nThe purpose of the News Letter is expressed as follows:\n\n\"To establish and to foster a unity of spirit and service among Indian missionaries, mission board members, Government employees, and other friends of the Indian, to affirm their group consciousness, to share their experiences, and to establish orderly means to discuss any matters affecting the welfare of Indians and Indian missions.\"\n\nTheir address\u2014Room 69,297 Fourth Avenue, New York, N.Y.\nMy Indian Day Message\n\nBy Big White Owl.\n\nThe first Inter-American Conference on Indian Life to take place in the New World has approved the following recommendation (Final Act, LIX):\n\n\"First, that the governments of the American countries adopt an 'Indian Day,' dedicated to a realistic study of the present-day Indian problems, in all the schools and universities. Second, that the American countries adopt the 19th day of April as American Indian Day, to commemorate that date, on which for the first time the Indian delegates gathered for the first Inter-American Conference on Indian Life at the Hotel Don Vasco de Giroga in Patzcuaro, Michoacan, Mexico (15th April, 1940), and therefore an invitation is extended to the peoples and governments of the Americas to join in this celebration.\"\n\nNow, in concluding this paper, I would especially urge the scholars and Indianists of Canada, and the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa, graciously to dedicate at least a part of their efforts on that day to a broader and saner consideration of Indian programs and Indian problems, and I further suggest to all newspapers and magazines, churches and other institutions throughout the Dominion of Canada that they commemorate this date by including in their publications and lectures, works and talks on Canadian Indian Life.\n\nMy Indian brothers: be not of faint heart\u2014we belong to this continent just as the mountains and hills, the buffalos and beavers, belong here. Our bodies are formed from the dust of our forefathers' bones, and we have not as yet really fulfilled our purpose upon this Earth. We must continue to live, and to try to create a new hope for our people. We must do something to cheer them in their loneliness, and comfort them in their misery... Then some day, out of the gloom and the ashes of the past, shall rise a new people.\n\nI Have Spoken!\n\nSpringtime In Old Ontario\n\nAs I stand here on the banks of the River Humber, looking to the distant hills which are wrapped in a smoky haze, I see solemn White Birches standing here and there. I wonder how such pale, slim and beautiful trees could escape the destructive march of greedy men, money-men who transformed these wilderness mounds with a touch of artificial splendour.\n\nIn the distance I can hear the clamorous Kingfisher calling his mate, and softly the Red-winged Blackbird relates\u2014see a flock of Gulls floating through the warm spring air\u2014how gracefully they skim over the grassy mead. I so often wonder what a white man's dream of heaven can be? Ah, \"Springtime in Old Ontario\" is good enough for me! Suddenly I can feel the presence of another little brother of the wild. One of the little fellows who helped to form the New Earth out of the great waters. He is swimming through the murky and polluted water along the river bank. I watch him as he struggles among twisted willow saplings and floating debris. He too feels and smells my presence and dives down into the murky water just as silently as he came... Now I see a fisherman lifting his net, a thing that bagged and billowed. A monster wall-eyed Pike finds himself entangled in the clinging meshes. In a frenzy of fear he darts about flashing his silvery scales. And with one last quivering thrust of the mighty tail the curtain of muddy water closed this scene\u2014and I was glad.\n\n(continued on next page) Deepening shades...\nSPRINGTIME IN OLD ONTARIO, continued.\n\nDeepening shades now dim the dying day. The fleecy clouds are flying very low. And a lonely owl skimmed over the naked trees. I hear the birds softly fling happy mating calls. I see the dark shadows cast by the friendly trees, and from there a timid hare leaped forth to feed... I came here to commune with the roots and the herbs while all fading landscape sinks into the night. Now I look into the far-flung sky\u2014that great and hushed immensity. I see the pale moon creeping up from behind the birches, the pines and the maples. And I can see a great and queenly city silhouetted against the pale spring moon.\n\nOld memories begin to unfold the sad and tragic tales of yester years. Departed Red Indians rising with the mist from their countless unknown graves. I see their phantom forms come floating through the wet night air. And from somewhere in the realms of space there come the mystic chant of the Turtle clan\u2014my noble forefathers. Then, too, could hear the haunting cry of the Wolf clan, which longs for the cool, still air. Next came the lonesome wail of the Turkey clan to complete the grand review. Far into the night I communed with the council of the dead. And then at last, with weariness and happiness intermingled, I turned to go. A phantom Chief lifts his arm holding forth the sacred Pipe of Peace in a silent signal. Phantom braves taking of their weird masks respond to their leader... I stood alone and mute, in silent salutation, while phantom braves danced by singing out in native ceremonial song. Then came the phantom Chief with slow majestic strides, and speaking with a voice like thunder he lifts his arms. Meekly and humbly I offered my hand and heart to him, who commands:\n\n\"O silent mortal son of mine,\nThou art a reckless Brave,\nForsoke not your noble race\u2014\nTo be a white man's slave!\n\nI place my quivering hand upon my troubled heart as, into that grim hard face I looked. Behold! It was a face radiant with smiles... The Indian Chief now turned to go and vanished with the whispering winds. And all the phantom braves are fading fast away. The ceremonial songs break off in the distant sky to moan at the mellow moon. It was a visitation from spirit-land, where the spirits of many departed Redmen find their happy hunting grounds; where Tecumseh, Pontiac, Sequoia and Brent sit by their little camp-fires and smoke the Pipe of Everlasting Peace. O Brave Warriors, mighty Hunters, and Great Romancers\u2014I salute you!\n\nLo and behold, across the sleepy river, a great city has risen. A city with a million lights and streets a thousand ways. And many men who consider themselves sportsmen often come forth from the midst of this artificial splendor... turning themselves loose to wreck, to plunder and to murder the helpless creatures of nature.\n\nO Thou Great and Good Spirit, open the eyes and melt the frozen hearts of these cruel pel\u00e9-faced men. Help them to understand that to love and to protect the wild creatures of our forests, fields and streams, offers far more real lasting pleasure and delight than does the insane desire of spoiling and destroying our wild life.\n\nThis is the plea of one humble and lowly Red Indian, whose life is a long-continued road of despair, neglect and grief, whose every hope is being blighted by false and disappointing civilized white men.\n\nI Have Spoken!\n\n\"He will not fear the Footsteps of To-morrow who can trace God in the Footprints of Yesterday.\" - Hugh Redwood.\nOronhyatekha\n\nBy Kahbaosa.\n\n\"Leaving Buffalo at 7.55 Wednesday morning the train, bearing the remains for which sorrowing thousands waited, steamed into the Union Station at Toronto, almost on schedule time. Here awaiting it were the daughter and other relatives of the deceased, the members of the Executive Council, representatives of several High Courts, the Mayor and several Aldermen, the police-borough and guard in honour from Temple Encampment of Royal Foresters. As soon as the casket enclosing the remains was removed from the car, it was raised upon the shoulders of eight Royal Foresters and carried from the station premises to the waiting horse. Then came the funeral procession, the like of which Toronto has not often looked upon, to escort the mortal remains of a great man, and an illustrious Forester, to Massey Hall, where it had been arranged he should lie in state, and where memorial services were to be held in the evening. The thousands of citizens of every degree and all ranks who lined the streets, the drawn blinds along the route taken by the procession, the bared heads, the sorrowful faces, formed a tribute of respect such as is paid to but few men either in life or death.\"\n\nWhat great man was this who was so widely mourned and so highly honored? It was Oronhyatekha, a Mohawk Indian.\n\nWhat! A Mohawk Indian whose body lay in state; in whose cort\u00e8ge walked the mayor of the city and dignitaries of church and court!\n\nYes, it was a Mohawk Indian. And, moreover, do you see that splendid building standing on the corner of Bay and Richmond streets, Toronto, that known as the Temple of Industry? It stands there as a result of the zeal and energy of that same Mohawk Indian. When you go into that building again, look to your right as you enter and you will see a fine bronze statue erected by the Independent Order of Foresters as a tribute to the memory of Oronhyatekha who is so highly esteemed by the Order as to be almost their patron saint.\n\nBut how came he to be accounted worthy of such honour?\n\nTo answer that question it will be necessary to tell you this story.\n\nOn the tenth of August 1841, a baby boy was born in a home on the Indian Reservation near Brantford. His parents named him Oronhyatekha, which means \"Burning Cloud\". We do not know much about the early life of the boy except that he had a craving for knowledge, and possessed a mind that readily absorbed all that was offered him. First he attended the Industrial School on the Reserve, when he had mastered all that was taught there he went to the Wesleyan Academy at Allentown, Mass. After that he taught school for a time, then pursued his studies at Kenyon College, Ohio. There he proved himself an able scholar by taking the first two years' work in one year.\n\nKenyon he came to the University of Toronto.\n\nIn 1860 Edward Prince of Wales came to Canada. Little did Oronhyatekha think, when the proposed visit was first announced, what a significance it would have for him. It led to his going to Oxford, that historic seat of learning, the attendance at which is itself a distinction. It came about thus:\n\nWhile the Prince was in Canada, the Chiefs of the Six Nations Indians prepared an address to the son of their \"Great Mother\" across the \"Big Waters\". They chose Oronhyatekha to read the address. The Prince and his party were very much impressed by the fine appearance of the young Indian; and by the literary attainments and ability of the man. He was invited to continue his studies at Oxford. There under Dr. A. Kland, afterwards Sir Henry Acland, he studied medicine and in course of time returned to his native land a full-fledged physician.\n\n(continued on next page)\nHe practised first in Frankford. From thence he went to Stratford, and in 1873 moved to London. After that, only five years of his life were devoted to the practice of medicine, yet at the end of that time he had gained a reputation for skill and was highly esteemed by the members of his profession. In 1878 he became a member of the Independent Order of Foresters. Henceforth it is as a Forester that we know him, for the rest of his life he was devoted to that organization. As one remarked some years later, \"Beyond all question and evil he lived, planned and acted for that great Order.\" We feel that it would be nearer the truth to say, he devoted his life to the interests of his fellowmen as he could serve them through that Order.\n\nIn September of the year that he joined the Order, Oronhyatekha was elected Right Worthy High Chief Ranger of the High Court of Ontario. Soon after he was chosen as the head of the Order in Ontario which office he filled for two years.\n\nOn the thirtieth of June 1881 there was a great gathering of the Foresters at Ottawa when the different branches in Canada and the United States were united and the Order was reorganized.\n\nThere arose the question of leadership. Where was to be found a man with the necessary qualifications to make the reunited Order a success? The choice fell upon Oronhyatekha but he would not accept the position, and when the gathering adjourned for lunch that day nothing had been accomplished as far as securing a leader was concerned.\n\nOronhyatekha took lunch at the home of his friend Edward Botterell. On the way to the house and while they ate, they discussed the question of leadership. By and by, when they were near the end of the meal, Oronhyatekha turned to his friend and said, \"Well, if you will stand by me, I will accept.\" Of course Botterell promised he would and thus the question of the leadership was settled. In a short time Oronhyatekha was elevated to the position of Supreme Chief Ranger.\n\nWhen we consider that there are always in the world some narrow-minded people who regard the white race as God's chosen favourites and all others as inferior beings, we are not surprised to find that some sought to discredit the Order of Foresters because it had an Indian as its chief Officer. But that the Order did not make a mistake in their choice is proved by the fact that Oronhyatekha remained in that position for twenty-six years\u2014until his death; also by the fact that the Order, which numbered only 369 members when he became its head, at the time of his death had \"grown to a mighty host of over 248,000.\" And again by the financial strength of the Order which, at the time when he ceased from his labours, had an accumulated Fund of $10,390,115.61. The wisdom of the choice is further proved by a consideration of other important accomplishments of this remarkable man.\n\nAs a result of the policy of the Supreme Chief Ranger, and under his guidance, the Order instituted some very beneficial forms of insurance. In 1898 he secured the site at the corner of Bay and Richmond Streets, Toronto, where on the twelfth of May of the same year, was laid the corner-stone of the \"Castle\" which in 1907 was described as \"the finest office building in Canada.\" Thus Oronhyatekha's dream of erecting a suitable habitation for the Order was realized.\n\nThe next dream born in his fruitful mind was that of founding a home for the orphans of departed Foresters. This was realized when the Home was dedicated at Island Park on the twenty-seventh of August, 1904.\n\nThe story of this remarkable Indian will be concluded in the July issue of WAMPUM.\nDuck Chief's Medals\n\nBy Mildred Valley Thornton.\n\nThe peak of the year for Alberta Indians is seen in the Calgary Stampede. They prepare for it for months in advance and live it over in memory long after it has passed.\n\nKnowing that I should find excellent material for my brush, I was glad when at length I was able to attend this famous exhibition. To me the Stampede meant Indians above everything else, and my most ardent dreams did not exceed in colour and romantic appeal the scenes which awaited me there. Naturally I made straight for the Indian encampment as the sole purpose of my visit was to paint as many Indians as possible in the time at my disposal.\n\nThe headquarters of the R.C.M.P. was located protectingly in front of the wide circle of tepees, and I knew from long experience that no one could be of so much assistance to me as the scarlet-coated keepers of the law. Corporal Cameron of Crossfield and a young rosy-faced constable from Gleichen were in charge, and immediately became interested in my work. The building they used had been the original Mounted Police Headquarters in Calgary, so had much historic interest.\n\nIn front of it stood an enormous, beautifully mounted specimen of a buffalo, which the corporal told me aroused the curiosity of many of the visitors, especially Americans. Some of them thought it was alive and wouldn't have been at all surprised to see it charge suddenly into the crowds. Inside the building were many fine robes whose soft brown hides had once protected the bodies of its brothers.\n\nPeople came to the Mounted Police for everything but the moon. Women came looking for their lost children, others to ask where the fancy-work was, and still others wanted advice about what to do for a headache, or the best place to eat. The 'Mounties' treated them all with equal good humour. During the week they sold several splendid buffalo robes and other lovely furs. They seemed to enjoy their duties, though some phases of it were not so pleasant....\n\nIn a corner of the building was a cell which could tell many stories of the past. Seldom in use now, it contained saddles, suitcases, boxes and other paraphernalia to which I was permitted to add my various pieces and equipment, that I might go in and out at will for my supplies.\n\nOn inquiring about the best subject in the camp from my artist's point of view, the first man mentioned was Duck Chief, head of all the Blackfoot tribes in Alberta, so I sallied forth with the constable in search of him. Duck Chief readily when he heard of my request and disappeared into his tepee to get prepared. Soon he came out again however, and quietly announced he would not pose. Extremely disappointed, I turned away, knowing the utter futility of argument. It wasn't long before I was busily engaged painting someone else. The next few days were full of the most intensive work, for there was plenty of excellent material at hand.\n\nThat same morning quite unexpectedly, Duck Chief signified his willingness to be painted. Joyfully I grabbed my kit and hustled off to his tepee. I was curious and wondered what had made him change his mind. So was the Mountie, who started making inquiries. It seems that the venerable Chief had wanted me to do it all the time, but his wife wouldn't let him.\n\nAlas, \"how the mighty have fallen\". Here was the proud leader of a brave and warlike race, strong and fearless in his six feet two of bone and muscle, yet meekly yielding to the will of the fat, black-braided little woman who swept his hearth and embroidered his moccasins. So it appears that the hand that rocks the cradle is also the hand that rules the brave.\n\n(continued on next page) I think of all....\nI think of all the Indians I have ever known, Duck Chief was one of the most obliging and lovable. He preferred being painted in his tepee, for which I was thankful, as it shielded me from the curious gaze of dozens of passersby who delighted to watch the process. I liked the Chief just as he was, in his ordinary clothes, and wanted to paint him that way. But he had ideas too. He sat on the ground rumbling with two enormous medals suspended on sleek thin ribbons. Very carefully and deliberately he adjusted them around his neck, turning the medals this way and that, fastening and unfastening several large safety pins with which he made them secure.\n\nQuietly, and in patience, I sat waiting until the solemn ceremony was over. Finally everything was arranged to his satisfaction. Then he suddenly looked up and smiled like a pleased child, which was my signal to begin.\n\nI saw so much beneath that tawny skin. The features were open and generous, and slightly Mongolian, which is unusual in the Blackfoot. One does not paint portraits year in and year out without learning something about human nature, if one is even faintly observant. In the face of Duck Chief I read good humor, patience, tolerance, wisdom and the unmistakable marks of natural gentleness. Added to these desirable qualities was a simple childlike directness of manner coupled with immense dignity which was most appealing.\n\nI was so pleased about doing this portrait that I went off to other work and did not miss my sweater till I was in my room that evening. I had not the faintest idea where I had left it as I had been all over the encampment. Next morning I asked the Mounties to be on the lookout for it but could tell that they weren't very hopeful of ever seeing it again.\n\nThen I went to Duck Chief's tepee to ask if he had seen it. His face was absolutely impassive as he countered my inquiry with a question of his own.\n\n\"Was it blue?\"\n\n\"No,\" I replied, \"it was tan.\"\n\nWhereupon he turned on his heel, went into his tepee and came out immediately, not only with the missing sweater, but also with a brush which I had overlooked, and smiling broadly, he handed them to me.\n\nI was very curious to know more about his medals. He had many others besides the two large ones he wore when I painted him. The Mountie procured an interpreter for me when I had difficulty understanding him, but he was not able to elicit much information, so my curiosity remained unappeased.\n\nWhen I returned home, however, I looked up literature on the Royal visit and found much that I wanted to know.\n\nIn The Vancouver Sun, May 29, 1939, was the following: \"During the five-minute stop in front of the thirty tepees, His Majesty greeted Duck Chief, 75-year-old head of the encampment, and a direct link with the final peace treaty that made all Canadian Indians wards of Queen Victoria.\n\n\"Duck Chief wore the medal given him shortly after the signing of Treaty No. 7, the Blackfoot Treaty, and another to celebrate the visit in 1901 of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York, later King George V and Queen Mary, the parents of the present King.\n\n\"Duck Chief gave His Majesty a message that he had always wanted to meet the Great White Father, particularly after he had heard that the King was coming across the water to see his Canadian children.\"\n\nFrom The Vancouver Sun,\nSaturday, February 21, 1942.\nBy permission of the Author.\nThe Pilgrims And The Indians\n\nAccording to our school histories, the Plymouth Colony, established in 1620, was able to survive and later to prosper largely because of help received from friendly Indians. Foremost among these was Samoset, a Wampanoag, whose hail, \"Welcome, Englishmen,\" so startled the Puritans in the early spring of 1621. Samoset expanded his limited vocabulary through contact with fishermen along the Kennebec. In his broken English he was able to tell the Pilgrims that they were free to occupy the land, as the Indians to whom it belonged had been swept away by a pestilence the previous year.\n\nOn Samoset's second visit he brought with him Squanto, who had a better command of the English language and who subsequently acted as interpreter in most transactions with the Indians. Squanto had travelled widely for one of his race and had had a very colourful career. In 1614 he had been kidnapped and sold into slavery in Spain. Later he had been freed; he made his way to England and finally returned in some manner to his home in America. Samoset and Squanto announced that Massasoit, the great sachem of the Wampanoags was planning to visit the settlement. The Chief appeared with a retinue of warriors, he was received with ceremony; Miles Standish ordered out the army, (even including Standish). With Squanto acting as interpreter on the first treaty with the Indians of New England was made.\n\nThe terms were few and simple; there was to be peace between the settlers and the red men. No injury was to be done by either party to the other. All offenders were to be given up to be punished. If the English engaged in war the Wampanoags were to have them. If the Indians were attacked unjustly the English were to come to their aid. This treaty, simple as it was, was not violated for fifty years. Following the precedent set by Massasoit, nine tribes in all acknowledged the British King.\n\nLet us not overlook the good deeds of Squanto. The Pilgrims looked upon him as a special instrument sent of God for their good beyond their expectation. He taught them how to plant corn; to put a dead fish in each hill by way of fertilizer. (An Indian teaching white men the secrets of agriculture!) He became their interpreter and their pilot. From him they learned where to find fish and how to take them. They were soon raising such an abundance of corn that they had surplus to exchange with the Indians for furs. These furs, sent to England, were the source of revenue which enabled the settlers to purchase the merchandise they required. Squanto remained the friend of the settlers until his death and when dying, asked the governor to pray that he might go to the \"Englishmen's God in Heaven.\"\n\nActually Massasoit desired the alliance of the Pilgrims as protection against the Narragansets whose powerful chief, Canonicus, challenged the settlers by sending the governor a bundle of arrows wrapped in a rattlesnake skin. Governor Bradford replied by returning the snake skin filled with powder and shot. Had Canonicus seen fit to accept this challenge, it is a matter of speculation as to just how much protection Squanto's army of six with its bell-mouthed blunderbusses could have afforded the colony. Happily, however, hostilities were averted.\n\nFrom \"THE TOTAL POINT,\" Editor, R. Newell B. Collins, Box 224, Algoma, Michigan.\nNotes From Island Lake.\n\nBy Rev. J.A. McKim, formerly of Island Lake.\n\nIt had been a midnight call and when we arrived home early in the morning we were sure that the baby would live as we left him resting comfortably. He was a fine big fellow whom I had named Donald Sidney. He was Elizabeth's first child, and as it is usual for the first child of Indian women to die, we felt that we had accomplished something.\n\nIt turned out that the cause of the sickness had been one of food, for the grandmama had told us that she had given him some evaporated milk undiluted, while she was waiting for the mother to nurse him. That is definitely not the food for a day-old baby.\n\nAfter that we watched Donald grow strong and healthy till he reached his fifth month, then one evening the father came to the mission and told us that the baby would not eat and did not sleep well. When I visited him the next morning he seemed listless, but cried occasionally and showed signs of the same colic that he had shortly after his birth. I left some baking soda and a hot water bottle and left directions about his food. It looked as if he would soon be well, but that night he was worse, for he started to choke and had a high temperature and was perspiring profusely.\n\nWhen I arrived at the home all the Indians of the community had arrived before me and were sitting around on the floor as is their custom when anyone is ill. The alarm of the curiosity had taken over the child from the mother, and they had him lying on some quilts on the floor near an open window, and as he was perspiring they had taken off his clothes to keep him cool, and a chilly breeze came in the open window.\n\nBy this time the boy was breathing very heavily, even gasping at times. It was quite evident that he had a congestion of the lungs. I had the woman make a warm bed in the corner and cover the child up, and I mixed up a mustard plaster for his chest and told them to keep him covered and use mustard every four hours. When I returned in two hours, the baby was back on the floor naked before an open window.\n\nWe had the funeral the next afternoon. Scenes such as this are a common occurrence at Island Lake. The two factors that contributed to that child's death are, Indian habits in regard to sickness, and lack of proper medical care.\n\n---\n\nWAKM is indebted to Mrs. Jennie Dunham, West Paris, Maine, for quite a number of clippings and articles of interest from our neighbours across the line. We should like to include them in our pages, but find it impossible. There are several excellent publications in U.S.A., telling of their Indian people, not so many here in Canada, and we feel it necessary to give the picture of the Indians of Canada, so far as we can in our limited space. Mrs. Dunham has been a life-long friend of the Indians, has written plays and comedies, copies of which we have received. Also, she has provided us with a newspaper article on the great Indians of U.S.A., which is really impressive, and worth including once more; copy of \"Indian Truth,\" by the Indian Rights Association, 501 S. 17th Street, Philadelphia 3, Pa., at $.2 per year; pamphlet, \"The Two Nations,\" by Miss Isabel F. Knight; notice of the award of the Congressional Medal of Honor to Seed It, Ernest Childers, an American Indian, of Volcan, Okla.; picture of Nehma-Nosa, Ojibway Chief at Lake Iron, Chief Jim Crow of Norton Station, an Indian Reservation, for whom a new house was built by popular subscription, who was burned out, and of a statue in front of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, which represents an Indian, astride his horse, and entitled, \"Pray to the Great Spirit.\" We suggest that interested readers make Mrs. Dunham one of their letter-friends, her materials seem inexhaustible.\nFrom The Editors Mail-Box\n\nThe Community Drama Bulletin, Victoria, B.C.\n\nThis splendid report of activities on the West Coast has been featuring a series of articles by prominent Indians of various tribes, which have been most interesting, and should be included in WAMPUM if space permitted. The January, 1944 number tells of the Haidas of the Queen Charlotte Islands; there is also a report of a Missionary Exhibition in connection with Victoria's Centenary Celebration in December last.\n\nFrom the same number we quote,\n\n\"Princess Ninaki: Miss Nora Gladstone who is a nurse at the Jubilee Hospital, Victoria, has just had an article published entitled, 'We Follow The Trail.'\"\n\n\"This young lady is one of those destined in the future to help us white Canadians to realize our duty towards our fellow Canadians, the Indians.\" Miss Gladstone is a reader of WAMPUM, perhaps we can hope for a message from her for our readers.\n\nIn the number for February and March, there is given the list of officers of\n\n\"League of Nations of North American Indians: This organization is developing splendid plans for a very large meeting at Chicken Itza, Mexico. There are various councils composed of very representative people. The officers of the National Organization Council are,\n\nChairman: Lawrence Two Axe (Iroquois-Mohawk), Oakland Cal.\nSecretary: Albert Thompson (Salteaux) Manitoba.\nAsst. Sec.: Malcolm Norris (Cree) Edmonton.\n\nSome of the officers of the Social Service Council are,\nChairman: Chief Swimming Eel, Connecticut.\nSecretary for Canada: John Laurie, Calgary.\nSecretary for Yucatan: Don Carlos Marrufo, Mexico\nSecretary for U.S.A.: Princess Sun Flower (Sioux) California.\"\n\nWe recommend the Community Drama Bulletin to you.\n\nThe Fairfield Trust.\n\nA strong committee under the above name, has been working with zeal and no small success to restore the ancient Moravian Mission Buildings at Moraviantown, or New Fairfield. We have received a well-prepared sketch of their activities, together with their financial report. They have raised already the sum of $2502.08 and are pleased to receive donations for the project, which includes the transformation of the site of old Fairfield into a public park and memorial, as well as the repair of the buildings. The Treasurer of the Fund is,\n\nRev. Charles Malcolm, M.A., B.D., 141 Grand Ave., East, Chatham, Ont.\n\nFrom the circular we quote in part,\u2014\n\n\"On the retirement of the Moravian Church from Canada in 1903, they gave their ancient buildings and lands at New Fairfield to the Methodist Church. Thus ended the period when these now belong to the United Church of Canada. During their stay in Canada the Moravians had built two churches on their lands in Western Ontario.\n\n\"Their first church was erected in 1792 on their Fairfield site on the north side of the Thames. Their first church and all the buildings of Fairfield were destroyed by fire, set by the U.S. soldiers of General Harrison on October 6th, 1813, following General Harrison's victory in Battle of the Thames on October 5th, 1813.\n\n\"After the close of the war 1812-14 the Moravians returned to the site of Fairfield but promptly decided to build their new village on the south side of the Thames. They named this new village New Fairfield.\n\n\"It was about 1818 they built the historic old edifice (illustrated in the folder).\"\nA GLOBE'S STONE OF CANADIAN CULTURE,\n\nAn Outline of the Arts and Crafts of the Indian Tribes of B.C., by Alice Ravenhill, March 1944. Occasional Papers of the British Columbia Provincial Museum, price 50\u00a2. The latest work on the subject, well illustrated and with the various designs explained and described. It contains also a valuable bibliography of available material on the Indians of British Columbia. The Editor is grateful for this gift, and regrets that he can do no more than make its existence known to our readers at this time. It is not possible for WAPUM to give you these things in detail, but we hope that it is helpful to let you know what they can be secured. WAPUM may be excused for a sense of pride that Miss Ravenhill, one of our most faithful supporters, should still be able to make such a worthwhile contribution to our common cause.\n\nThe Society for the Furtherance of B.C. Indian Arts and Crafts,\n\nThe Annual Report of the President (extracts):\n\nThere is a growing feeling throughout the Dominion that we white Canadians must recognize our responsibility for the welfare of Canadian Indians. This growing sense of responsibility has tended to broaden the purpose and widen the activities of our Society. All the original aims of the Society are being conscientiously adhered to, but in addition, an effort has been made to be of immediate and personal service in individual cases which have been brought to our notice. The long view of practical help in bettering conditions for Indians has been well-expressed in a Brief sent to us by Mr. John Laurie (White Cloud), of Calgary. This statement of present conditions and future needs was carefully considered both by the Society as a whole, and by a sub-committee composed of Mr. Pickford and Mr. Carl, as objects to give the matter special consideration. The Brief has attracted the sympathetic support of the Oliver Society, of which Mr. Albert Allan is the President.\n\nThe Report of the Okanagan Society makes reference to the above Brief also, and states that they have a similar report on the rehabilitation of the Indian people in process of compilation. The Society has had to curtail some of its activities due to the war, and the absence of Mr. Anthony Walsh whose work in the Unakonop School had been one of their most successful projects.\n\nIndian Council Fire, Chicago, Illinois:\n\nThree books by Marion E. Gridley, who has devoted her life to the study of Indian lore and traditions, are obtainable from 'Indian Council Fire', at $1.25 each. They are,\n\n\"Indians of Today\"\n\n\"Indians of Yesterday\"\n\n\"Indian Legends of American Scenes\"\n\nThe latter contains three legends of Canada and a brief description of Canadian Indians.\n\nWile Hills, Saskatchewan:\n\nMiss Ila Brown, U.S. missionary to the Indians, recently sent in her renewal to WAPUM for two years, and with a money order for $8 subscriptions for her Indian people. This addition to the list of Indians' friends changes the balance, and means that there ought to be more material for and by the Indians themselves. The Editor welcomes this emphasis, at the same time appreciating deeply the interest and unfailing cooperation of our sympathetic white folk. Subscriptions are fairly well divided between the two now. Just imagine what it could do for WAPUM and its cause if more workers followed the example of Miss Brown. Congratulations, Wile Hills, now can you send us your news?\nGreetings\n\nOnce more as Christmas draws near we wish all our readers and friends a Merry and Blessed Christmas. May the Infant Jesus bless you and all those dear to you.\n\nIn your efforts to make others happy by presents, do not forget your own soul. The greatest gift you can give your soul is the grace of God which you must either obtain anew or have increased through the worthy receiving of the Sacraments of Penance and of Holy Eucharist at Christmas.\n\nWe must not forget that after all Christmas is the celebration of Christ's birth on earth. So, certainly the best thing we can do for the Infant Jesus' birthday is to offer our hearts as another manner on Christmas morn. Then for good measure, let's drop in on Christmas day and visit the Crib! What do you say?\n\nAnd for the New Year, may we wish you all health, happiness and success in all you do!\nThe drawings on the cover and on the back of this issue have been borrowed from the December 1941 publication of the Canadian Red Cross Junior. They are two of eight printed as \"Christmas in pictures\". They were drawn by the Juniors of the Inkameep Indian Day School, Oliver, British Columbia. A splendid idea of Indian art! \"Legends in Pictures\" for our Cree Indians should be an enterprise worth while undertaking.\n\nThe 1940-41 school term is now well underway, despite a late opening of classes this year, due to the spread of poliomyelitis in Alberta.\n\nThe newest and most important innovation in our programme of studies this year has been the adoption of a definite course for woodwork. We must admit though that woodwork here has not yet been fully organized as planned, due to numerous improvements about the school and farm buildings, at which our boys have been constantly occupied to date. Unfortunately most of the work done could not be classified amongst the operations and projects of a first year course. However the entire schedule for this year, we hope, will be covered in due time.\n\nOriginal descriptions of the most recent improvements will be given by the pupils themselves in the \"School Section\" of this magazine.\n\nThis new system has long been waited for and has now been appreciatively received at this School. The entire staff is ready to do their utmost to obtain the results that necessarily should follow. Thus, with the academic, religious and physical training our children are receiving, manual training should help enormously towards the better preparation of our pupils for their adult lives.\n\nThe new church on the Sampson Reserve will be ready for the celebration of Midnight Mass on Christmas. Bro. Kacl and Mr. Ovilin Fortier, woodwork instructor, are actually finishing the interior. It is expected that Mass will be celebrated at the new church twice a month. It is also expected that the Indians will respond to all that is being done for their spiritual welfare, by assisting regularly at all Church services.\n\nLOCAL STATISTICS - Since July 1941, 29 births, 20 deaths and 4 marriages have been registered in the Mission's Records... Of the above-mentioned weddings, we would like to mention that of Mary Jean Potts who became the bride of Harry Lightning Bull on November the 4th, and that of Peggy Picche who became the bride of Narcisse McKeanaw on December the 16th.\n\nThe best of wishes to you all!\n\nUnfortunately we are unable as yet to give the names of the dozen or more Indians of Hobbema who have recently offered their services to their country. The next issue will have them. Congrats!\nThis organisation has been formed for the benefit of the Indians of the Hobbema Reserves. Its aim or objective is improvement and progress in every line. It is a study Club as well as a 'benefit' club, which has so far sponsored 3 movies to date and which will later sponsor picnics, sports events and perhaps sports clubs.\n\nAs it is required of members of any other Club certain obligations are required of the members of this Club. The two first and most important are:\n\n1. Assistance at Mass every Sunday.\n2. Receiving of Holy Communion once a month.\n\nOther obligations and rules are to be formulated by the members themselves. The Club will also devote some of its meetings to study and discussion. For this reason some of the leading men in our locality and from other places, if necessary, will be asked to lecture on problems of everyday importance in the sphere of the home, of the farm, or in the field of health both corporal and spiritual.\n\nThe Club has been very fortunate in obtaining Rev. Father Yott, O.M.I., as its Chaplain and Director. He is actually a professor of St. John's Juniorate in Edmonton and until last summer he was stationed in Eastern Canada, where he has had several years of experience with different young people's organizations. His direction and advice has been none other than very stimulating but encouraging. Favored with his leadership, the Club will surely work energetically towards their objective, which is no easy task, when one considers all.\n\nMr. Fortier who is going to be in charge of us soon is helping Brother Karl during the week on the new church. They are trying to finish before the great feast of Christmas. Midnight Mass on the Samson Reserve is going to be said by reverend Father Mouline. I hope the Indians of the Reserve will hear Mass there and receive Holy Communion for God will bless them and help them in every way.\n\nRobert Rabbit.\n\nNEW ROOTCELLAR by J.J.A. Shortneck\n\nDuring the holidays three men from the reserve came to help Mr. Rioux and Mr. Leclerc to build the root cellar. They were Joe Doschamps, Baptiste Ermineskin, and Leo Coytoo. We have a better root cellar than the one we had last year. It is entirely made of cement. There are ten bins on one side and twelve on the other.\n\nNearly all the bins are full of vegetables of different kinds. I hope we will have enough vegetables to last through the winter season.\n\nON THE WREATH FOR VICTORY - One night J. Shortneck was fooling around with Mike Mock. So they got their faces colored. You should have seen Joe's face. It had black 7s painted all over. He looked like a brave warrior on the warpath.\n\nEnoch Crane\nMOTHER GENERAL'S VISIT\n\nLast month on Nov. 6 Mother General was coming to see us and stay with us for I week. We were very anxious to see her. We were glad she came, but she came late. We did not because she came due to the church. In the morning they went to see the church on the Samson Reserve. Father took her and Mother Assistant in his car while going down which made her stumble and she fractured an ankle. The next day she was taken to the hospital in Edmonton. We felt very sorry for her. We wished her speedy recovery and prayed for her.\n\nCOME FOR A REST\n\nOne of our sisters, Sister St. John d'Avril, has been very ill. She used to play the piano for us and make us sing. We hope she will have a good rest. We are praying for her to get well soon.\n\nDolly Tomorrow.\n\nPHYSICAL TRAINING FOR THE GIRLS\n\nWe were very happy to have a Sister from Edmonton come here for a few days to give us lessons in P.T. We were very anxious to see her. She took us by groups; the little girls and the big girls. We began with easy exercises and then played a few records for them. She also played the gramophone and for the big girls she played those exercises very fast. We were ever so anxious to have her bring us some more records to learn other steps and especially the polka. We thank Sister for her kindness in coming to give us these classes.\n\nGOD'S SYMBOLS by Mary Child, Medaille No. Buffalo.\n\nSister showed us the Great symbols first they were hard to see but now they are about 56 cm. We now know how to make substances with them. We were glad to learn them because it is our own language.\n\nP.b. \u2206 b.c. \u2206 v \u2206 p.p.r.p.r.p.\nSports\n\nThere isn't very much to report on Sports in this issue. However, like you have probably read in the preceding pages, there's something new to speak about. So........\n\nOUR NEW RINK AND CANADA'S WAR EFFORT\n\nWe now have a new rink, a new shack and twenty 100 Watt lights on our rink. We know it has cost quite a lot. So we want to help the school help Canada's war effort by buying things of our own, such as skates, tape and hockey sticks. About 20 boys have their own skates. We also pay 5 cents to get our skates sharpened. Every night we have league games. Each player has to pay 2 cents a game. The money we give goes to pay for the lights. And here is something else we boys have offered our principal: not to have any toys for Christmas, because our new rink is the best present we can get. We thank Father Rh\u00e9aume and all those who worked hard for us.\n\nNorman Yellowbird.\n\nTwenty 100 Watt lights.\n\nLast year our rink was near the school. This year it is in the field across the road from the school. There are 20, 100 watt lights on the rink. We play hockey after supper now and the people of Hobbs come to skate here now.\n\nAlexis Twins.\n\nOUR GOALKEEPER'S NEW OUTFIT\n\nV. Rattlesnake, Ermins's goalkeeper has a new outfit. Mr. Protti, our coach ordered it from Ashdown's in Edmonton. Victor has a new body protector, goalie gloves, a helmet and new shoulder pads. We are sure anxious to get our regular workouts and then we'll be ready to meet any team.\n\nFrancis R. Littlechild.\n\nLeague Games\n\nWe have organized two hockey leagues for the school. We had the elections on December 10th. The Senior captains are: E. Crane, E. Baptiste, L. Johnson and myself. Here are the names of our teams (respectively) E.A.C., Maple Leafs, Canadians, and the Colonels.\n\nThe league opener saw the Colonels against the Maple Leafs. After the first period the Colonels were leading 3-2. The second period ended with 2-1 for the same, but the Maple Leafs finished the game by banging in 3 goals in the third period. They won 4-2. It's too bad we lost that game. Here are the 'League Standings' & 'Top Scorers':\n\n| Team       | P | W | L | T | PTS | Top Scorers |\n|------------|---|---|---|---|-----|-------------|\n| Maple Leafs| 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 4   | F.

He lies awake, worrying about how Santa Claus can get from the apartment house chimney to Bobby's room. Bobby has drawn the plan of the steam-pipe system as far as he can determine. Just how the rotund figure of Santa Claus is going to squeeze through the vapor ducts does not bother Bobby. What he wants to know is, if it is possible for Santa to go from the chimney opening in the upper left-hand corner to the radiator beside Bobby. Can you draw a continuous line between these two points?\nGROUARD ECHOES\n\n\"CLIMB THOUGH THE ROCKS BE RUGGED\"\nTHE C.Y.O.\n\n\"TIME MARCHES ON...\"\n\nLong, long ago...at the Grouard Indian School, a Club was organized...\n\nITS NAME: \"Club of the Good Counsel.\"\n\nITS PURPOSE: \"Education.\"\n\nITS MOTTO: \"Climb though the Rocks be Rugged.\"\n\nITS VOICE: \"The Grouard Echoes.\"\n\nITS MEMBERS: \"The Pupils...past and present.\"\n\nITS FOUNDRESS: \"Sister Jean Placidus, Principal of the School.\"\n\nThis Club has been ever since, wonderfully active. \"The Grouard Echoes\" have ever since been published.\n\nTo render its educational programme more effective, the Club entered this year into new activities:\n\n- Youth Training\n- and the C.Y.O.\n\nThese activities have made it possible to give an education whereby the child becomes,\n\n- more personal,\n- more wilful,\n- more responsible.\n\n'Tis the secret of Education, albeit a task. \"Climb though the Rocks be Rugged\". Education is never too expensive if we really believe it is desirable to make our boys and girls good Christians and good Citizens.\n\nIn this \"climb\", the Club gave us the good counsel. Youth Training: the impetus; the C.Y.O.: wings. \"Health of the body for health of the mind\", says Mr. J.H. Ross. That's what Youth Training has given Grouard's Youth. From this stepping stone, our boys and girls have automatically walked into the C.Y.O. for a higher training...a training of the mind and will at the service of God and Country.\n\nIn other words, every member of the C.Y.O. is taught and given a chance to be his best self.\n\nLeader.\nOLD PUPILS' PARTY.\n\nThis is the first year I have the good luck to attend an Old Pupils' party, and I surely did enjoy it too. The old pupils began to arrive about four o'clock, and what chatting and teasing there was until it was time to set the tables. When all was ready, the boys drew a girl's name from a box, and then took this girl to supper. This was most exciting, and there were many shouts of laughter at some partners.\n\nSupper was served in fancy baskets to about fifty or sixty guests, not counting the six babies of some of our Old Timers who brought the family along. Sister Jean gave us a little talk, in which she urged us to be true to our ideals. She recalled the memory of the many old pupils who are fighting our fight across the sea.\n\nMike McDermott and Veronica Gamler gave us some good music, and with all the games, music and fun, the evening passed all too soon, and before we knew it, we were home again, anxious for the next Old Pupils' reunion.\n\nElsie PHILLIPS.\n\nHOLIDAY MEMORIES.\n\nChristmas was a very nice feast as usual. The Midnight Mass brought such a crowd to church that many had to stand at the back. Before Mass, Private John Bourgeois home on leave, sang the solo he used to sing here every Christmas when he was a pupil here. It was sad, and brought back many memories. Johnny said he was wondering where he would spend next Christmas. We were wondering about that too.....\n\nEdith GLADU\n\nOn Christmas afternoon, we received our gifts which are sent to us each year by the High School girls at Yakima, Wash. They were nice gifts, and so nicely wrapped. We wrote and thanked them all for their great kindness to us.\n\nAline MASKINACK\n\nA Tale of a Hare\n\nBefore Christmas, Sister often sent us out to the woods to get trees. There were so many rabbits around that we would come home with as many rabbits as trees.\n\nOne day, Father Forcade turned a live rabbit loose in the school basement. Our old black cat sniffed and sniffed, and arched her back each time the rabbit moved. It was very funny to watch them. Finally, we sold the rabbit to Father Marcot for twenty cents.\n\nLance Corporal Sam TWIN.\n\nA NEW PRESIDENT.\n\nOn the feast of St. John Bosco we had an election to replace Pete Gladu who is no longer in school. We think we made a very wise choice, and we are proud of our new president: William John Chalifoux.\nSchool Activities\n\nSCHOOL OF THE CIVIL SERVICE.\n\nOur Inspector's Visit.\n\nJust a few weeks before Christmas, Mr. Stehelin came to inspect our school. When he walked into our room, we were all so busy wrapping up the last issue of \"Echoes\" for that afternoon's mail, that we did not see him till he got right in the room. He must have thought we were having a pleasant time of our Enterprise, for one of our old pupils, Private Victor Bourgeois, home on leave, was playing the piano for us while we worked. Mr. Stehelin seemed to think it was nice that a soldier on leave was interested enough in his old school to come and spend an afternoon to entertain his old teacher and schoolmates. Mr. Stehelin showed his satisfaction when he promised he would come back the following week for our Display.\n\nSergeant Alfred THIBAULT.\n\nSCHOOL OF ADVANCED TRAINING.\n\nCatechism.\n\nOur catechism classes this year are so interesting that we have had to bring in a lot of extra seats for all those who wish to attend. Besides all our pupils and the Training School girls, we have Major V. Paquet, Captain Nancy Thomas, Pauline Twin, Corporal Nora Cardinal, and even the Bishop's Secretary, Miss B. Lemieux. We often have arguments outside of school to try to find answers to the problems Father Forcade asks us to think over.\n\nSergeant Viola WILLIER.\n\nSCHOOL OF SOCIAL REFORM.\n\nGift Exchange.\n\nOur Christmas gift exchange this year was more exciting than ever because all the catechism class put their names in for the exchange. On the last day before the holidays, we all brought our parcels and put them under the tree. Father and Brother Paquet had such a big box to carry, that they had to bring Father Maheu along to help them drag it to school on the sleigh. I won't let any secrets out, but you can just guess that there were plenty of tricks played and that everyone got his money's worth of fun.\n\nSergeant Viola WILLIER.\n\nSCHOOL OF TRADE AND COMMERCE.\n\nHandicrafts.\n\nAre you interested in learning a trade? Join this school and you will be taught: Printing, Basketry, Weaving, Dyeing, etc., etc.\nACTIVITIES\n\nReligious Ceremony\n\nTHE FEAST OF THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION this year was a special C.Y.O. day. It started off with a beautiful Mass at which Brothers Fortier and Tremblay renewed their vows. At High Mass, we marched to church in squads in full uniform. The Schola sang the Proper of the Mass from downstairs, and at the afternoon Benediction, we all sang the Magnificat in four voices.\n\nDistinctions\n\nBefore the Officers' dinner, a court of Honor was held in the boys' hall. The officers stood at attention while our Leader explained the nice ceremony at which Major Brother Paquet received the Distinction of St. Michael while Captain Nancy Thomas and Sgt. Joe Providence were awarded the St. Bernard Distinction. Everyone felt very happy over these well-earned awards, and sang very gayly a song which had been arranged for this big event. We cheered these popular officers, and gave them a hearty hand shake in congratulation for the honor that had come to them.\n\nLieutenant Charlie WHITE.\n\nOfficers' Mess\n\nOur first OFFICERS' DINNER had been so much like a beautiful dream that we were glad to have another \"banquet\" to prove such things really do happen! Busy hands had decorated our classroom with Our Lady's colors and had turned it into a nice banquet hall. What with a courteous gentleman as my dinner escort, dainty waitress at my beck and call, music, and \"food for the gods\" such as Sister Mary Adelia knows so well how to prepare, I almost fooled myself into thinking that I was \"Queen Ann\".\n\nWhen Fr. Forcade, our Toastmaster stood up, we all began to wonder... Sure enough, the \"hunch\" I had came true, and the first thing I knew, I was trying to make a speech. Just my luck! I had the misfortune of thanking different ones, especially the cooks, and as soon as I had sat down, the Toastmaster rubbed it in about thanking myself... because I had helped cook that week.\n\nSeveral others gave toasts too. We are growing braver about this too as Father \"spots\" us in this, just as he does in Gym and we know he won't ever let us down.\n\nAll this, with a few songs, one especially in honor of the guests who came to hear the Toasts, and a box of chocolates given for the supper by Miss Lemieux, made the party end very sweetly.\n\nCorporal Annie THOMAS\nDomestic School.\n\nOur Retreat\n\nA few weeks ago, we had a chance to set our spiritual affairs in order in a three day Retreat, preached to us by Rev. Father Nadeau, O.M.I. We all enjoyed it very much and hope we will be better children for it.\n\nRoland GABOURY.\nTRAINING SCHOOL\n\nOne day early in December, we were very sorry to hear that our teacher, Sister Margaret Mary, was leaving us for the hospital in Edmonton, where she had to undergo a serious operation. We surely worried about her, but frequent letters brought us hope for her recovery. To our great joy, it did come, slow but sure, and we are glad to say she is back home again, with all kinds of new and interesting ideas for us.\n\nKIND HELPERS\n\nDuring Sr. Margaret Mary's absence, Sr. Norbert helped Sr. Eustache to keep things going at the Training School. She is our tailor, and she shows us how to cut patterns. We appreciate all the help she gave Sr. Eustache during the weeks Sister Margaret was away, and we thank them both for their kindness to us.\n\nA GRAND SURPRISE\n\nDuring the Christmas holidays, we were occupying the skating rink every minute of our free time. Skating is surely a pleasant amusement in this part of the country. By the way, we wish to thank Rev. Father Habay for being so kind as to buy us skates. When we first got them, we did not know who had sent them to us, but after a thousand and one questions, \"a little bird\" (with a beard!!) told us. A big, big Thank You, dear Father. Now we don't have to borrow the boys' skates any more, but can just whizz past them! Brother Nichol put a light over the rink the other day; it makes it much pleasanter at night.\n\nBRAVO, MARGARET!\n\nYesterday, when we came to practice for Singing, we were treated to a grand sight: Margaret Fraser, learning to skate! We were doubled up from laughing; she was doubled up\u2014but for other reasons. She had a strong supporter on either side, but even they were not enough to keep her upright. We all said, \"Mr. Winkle has come to Grouard!\"\n\nWEAVING\n\nWe have some new looms, and you should see all the lovely things we are making. I am happy to think I will learn so many new things this year. Three cheers for our dear old Domestic Training School!!\n\nCorporal Eella CARDINAL.\nYOUTH TRAINING\n\nDRAMATICS\nXmas Concert.\n\nPerhaps the most enjoyable concert we ever had was this year's Xmas program. If we took just two weeks to prepare most of it, it was because we had been so well drilled in our weekly Dramatics classes. We are getting over our shyness by volunteering to sing or dramatize something new for the class. We are getting lots of fun out of it, and some are learning that they could be pretty good at acting.\n\nSTARS\nOne who took an important part in a play and surprised everyone, and especially herself by her fine acting, was Cora Desjarlais. Annie Thomas as Mrs. Ruggles will not soon be forgotten. She made us laugh so hard, it hurt.\n\nCHINS UP, BOYS\nIn memory of our many pupils who have joined the Armed Forces, the boys had the tableau, \"Just before the battle, Mother!\" From behind the scenes, as the words of the song died away, we heard the bugle call, followed by the roll of drums. Many liked this number best of all.\n\nMarjorie TALLMAN.\n\nSorry Folks\nWe were asked to repeat this concert, as many people wanted to come from neighboring towns, and others wanted to see it again, but we were unable to do so. Sorry. The next performance is on March 18th.\n\nTHERE'S MUSIC IN THE AIR\nRythm Band\n\nMy! My! were we ever proud of ourselves when we came out to play our Band selections at the concert! The applause and the cheers that greeted us were deafening. Of course we knew we looked pretty nice in our Band costumes, so we didn't mind waiting till they ceased clapping.\n\nWe had a new cymbal and two nice new drums, which Major Paquet and Sergeant Thibault surely know how to play! Our Band Director, Fr. Maheu, had arranged a medley of Xmas airs and to show you how he makes use of everything, let me tell you what he took to imitate church chimes. It was a big circular saw set up on a stand. It was hidden behind the piano, and when the \"sexton\" would strike it, one could imagine it was real chimes. A solo played ON SMALL BOTTLES strung up on a stand, brought a great deal of applause. We played as a last number, Fred Scott's favourite song, \"Ridin' Down the Trail\"...and we had to come back and play it all over again because they liked it so much.\n\nEllen Brunelle. (VII)\n\nCOMMUNITY SINGING\nWe do a great deal of Community Singing at Displays and Movies on Sunday nights. Fr. Forcade gets on his bench and directs, he teases them and soon he has them all going strong. At the Display, we could hear our BISHOP'S beautiful voice as he joined in the crowd for singing. Even our school INSPECTOR got going with us.\n\nLt. Cora DESJARLAIS.\nWho says Grouard is just a \"mud hole\"? Well, I don't, and you wouldn't either if you belonged to our Youth Training centre...where we have lots of good, healthy fun, and keep so gay we don't see the mud...if ever there was any!\n\nYou should see all the new things we have for our exercises too: a piano for the Girl's Hall, a springboard, benches, new mats, a big box horse and a canvas blanket to make our landing softer when we spring from the board. I fear the blanket won't last very long with our Major landing his 190 lbs. on it so often. Each time he jumps in it, you can hear the poor thing groan!\n\nSergeant Alfred THIBAULT.\n\nV.T. CONVENTION\n\nDuring the Xmas. Holidays, Father Forcade, our Y.T. Leader, attended a Leader's Convention in Edmonton. He was gone a week and came back quite satisfied. He told us that the Y.T. Officials had encouraged him and that we might have the pleasure of Mr. Ross' and Mr. McNally's visit in spring. With our new Equipment and our \"peppy\" Leader we feel we are tops and we are always glad to show others how we feel about it.\n\nLieutenant Charlie WHITE.\n\nNew Year Ride\n\nOn New Year's, four teams of horses sleigh-rided us around the country, though it was pretty cold. Swell fun!\n\nMary Edith GLADU.\n\nBingo & Display\n\nOn New Year's night we had a Bingo Party in which we had lots to eat, lots of prizes to win and lots of fun. A few days after, we had an Amateur Display in which we played informal games. By the time we got through, there were so many peanut shells on the floor that we did not need to use the mats to make rolls and headstands.\n\nLilly WARD.\n\nThe BIG DISPLAY\n\nOur last Big Display was a real hit...at least we were told so. Mr. Stehelin, our Inspector, came all the way from McLennan to attend. He had invited Sr. Superior and the teachers from Guy school to come with him. They all took part in Community singing and seemed to have enjoyed our stunts, our Rythm Band and our dress parade.\n\nIn his speech, afterwards, Mr. Stehelin said that we were very lucky boys and girls, \"This school, said he, is the finest of my Inspectorate.\" We gave a big cheer when he gave us a holiday.\n\nCorporal Nora CARDINAL.\n\nIMPOSSIBLE\n\nMAJOR: The pass-word for the week is \"dressing!\"\n\nGUARD: When will we get a chance to undress? You're always around!\nC.Y.O.\n\nBROADCASTING STATION\n\nOur \"SUNA,\" (Finnish Steam Baths), one for the boys and one for the girls, is more popular than any summer resort. What wondrous \"steam pudding\" we make after Gym classes and on Saturdays.\n\nOfficers here don't promote just on their good looks. To become a Major, Capt. Nancy must know how to give First Aid to little Licut. Jeannette if she breaks her collar bone over the Box-horse. To become a Colonel, Major Paquet must know all about Kinseology. He's wishing for the time being that people didn't have quite so many muscles...\n\nNight-watchman Turetto, former P.T. Instructor in the army, has started to ride our Box-horse. Every time he rides it something grunts. QUESTION: is it the horse or the rider or...both?\n\nEveryone thought Fr. Maheu's idea about the circular saw (for chimes) was wonderful except the Manager of the Sawmill. Just what he thought is not known...\n\nSpeaking of the Rhythm Band...Fr. Maheu had a Trombone solo at our last concert. The Trombone was made up of a Player blowing a Kazoo in a Gramophone Horn. We still have the Player and the Kazoo but what happened to the Horn...? The finder will get a reward...\n\nWhat's become of two famous parkas\u2014 one white and one black\u2014that were such familiar sights just before Christmas? Did they really journey back to Eskimo-land?\n\nElvis's got that Bridge stunt done pat. A cheap and elegant bridge at that. Did you see her in the picture?\n\n3d\nOld Pupils' Corner\n\nDear Old Timers:\n\nAt the old pupils' party, where so many of us gathered for the sake of \"Auld Lang Syne\", those of you who were unable to attend were surely not forgotten. We spoke of you and the gay times we have had together in this classroom, where we wished you could all have been to enjoy the fun. It would have done your heart good to hear the gay voices...in particular, Michael McDermott's ringing laugh which cost him a forfeit. Leo Dufresne did his share as usual by being the clown, so that there was never a dull moment.\n\nMay I offer my tardy thanks to the many who sent Xmas greetings in the form of letters, cards or sweets? I deeply appreciated your thoughtfulness...and hope to keep sweet throughout the year, in consequence!\n\nDid you hear the wedding bells that rang out a few weeks ago for someone you and I thought enough of some years ago to elect as our first Club President. Yes, our dear Louise Laird is now Mrs. John Calahaisson. I was happy to offer best wishes in your name as well as mine.\n\nMary Louise Sawan McDermott is the proud mother of a baby daughter born a few weeks ago. This will be good company for Sonny (Richard) who is quite a handsome big chap now.\n\nAt the General Hospital in Edmonton, Lena Gladu is still fighting for health, and seems to be winning the battle too, according to a cheery message received at Christmas time.\n\nWe have another soldier's picture on our piano...no other than our dear Roy Smith's, this time. Roy was home on leave at Christmas, but we did not have the pleasure of seeing him as he was in the hospital most of the time. Better luck next time, Roy!\n\nPaul Hurtubise is now overseas with the R.C.A.F. Good luck to you, Paul, and may your \"shots\" be as accurate as they were when you \"fired\" things at your schoolmates here!\n\nDoes it bring back pleasant memories to see your Club motto on the cover of our \"ECHOES\"? I trust it may remind you to keep your face uplifted towards the beautiful, the worth-while things of life. Cling to your youthful ideals, strive to make them come true in your life, so that those who come in contact with you may be happier and better for it. That is not asking too much of a \"Good Counsellor\", is it?\n\nOn the following page, you will find parts of some of the very interesting letters I have recently received from some of our old crowd. Knowing the great affection you have always had for your old classmates, I can think of nothing that would give you greater pleasure than to share these messages with you. May this strengthen the bonds of friendship that bind us all together.\n\nSister Jean Placide\nDear Teacher and pupils:\n\nThanks a million for the last Echoes, which were even more interesting than the previous ones received. Such lovely snaps which indeed puts the finishing touches to the Journal. By the way, Sister, when am I going to get a snap of YOU? If I don't get one soon, I.......\n\nI am pleased the C.Y.O. IS such a success and that everyone is interested and finds enjoyment, besides helping to build body and soul..........................\n\nLucky Don, that's me! Yes, I was lucky to spend such a lovely Christmas with my wife and family in England. We went to Midnight Mass, and then we made a flying visit to Newcastle to see Baby Fovargue, Eileen and George. I am pleased to tell you that they are all fine, and that we all hoped the Grouard folks had as good a break as George and I.\n\nPleased you received the wedding cake, and by now I hope you have received the photographs.\n\nSo a good many more Old Timers have JOINED THE COLOURS. Good Show! How I should like to run across them. Still may happen, seeing they are gradually coming over............\n\nWell, Teacher, I wish you all the happiness and success possible for 1942, and may we soon have those tough Huns under our heels! Cheerio and keep smiling!\n\nLove and best wishes.....\n\nDon. (Fovargue)\n\nFrom her\n\nPUPILS\n\nDear Don;\n\nYou deserve all the good things that have come your way, and I trust they may continue...for Time and for Eternity.\n\nWas thrilled to hear that you are now \"Uncle Don\". Be sure to live up to the dignity of your title! I can well imagine all the tall stories Baby Pauline will soon be listening to from Daddy and Uncle...about the days they spent in Grouard School, when they were Sister Joan's \"Angels\". Please congratulate George and Eileen on the bonny, wee lassie, and offer best wishes from us all to this second-generation Club Member.\n\nWrite again, Old Faithful!\n\nS.J.P.\n\nCanadian Army Overseas.\nJanuary 3, 1942.\n\nDear Sister Jean:\n\nHello, Sister! Had a swell trip across, and I'm safe and sound, thanks to the good Lord. Maybe it's the\nprayers of you and your pupils that helped along. I regret that I did not see you just before I left, to go to Dundurn. I sure had a swell time in Grouard, for I knew it would be my last out there. But I pray I may return someday to the old home.\n\nI will be going on my landing leave next week, for five days. I'll be going to GLASGOW with Antoine Cardinal to see the sights.\n\nThe climate is sure great and I like it fine, never saw a bit of snow since I left Canada. Say Hello to all the pupils for me, and tell them to drop me a line. I wish them the best of luck.\n\nGuess I'll sign off by sending best regards to your pupils, and last but not least,, to you, dear teacher, best regards and love.\n\nYour old pupil,\nVictor Bourgeois.\n\nDear Victor;\n\nSooms impossible to think of you in England...you wore horo such a short time ago. But you know that we're all proud of you, Laddie, and that our prayers will faithfully second daily for the brave soldier boy whose pictured gaco smiles so cheerfully at us all day long.\n\nHope you haven't lost the heads I gave you, and that you will be the same good old \"Vic\" in the army that you wore horo. Y... for VICTORY and VICTOR TOO!\n\nS.J.P.\n\nLebret, Saskatchewan.\nJanuary 4, 1942.\n\nDear Sister Jean,\n\nThank you, Sister. I received your parcel and letter and enjoyed all..........................\n\nHere Christmas was quiet with that quietness which best stresses the peace and joy of the season. We had just buried one of our young priests who had been ordained last June, and naturally that had some effect in saddening our Community. However, Christmas never loses its meaning...Listen to me chatter away, and are we ever rhapsodical?\n\nHow did you like Churchill's address to the Senate and Congress? He simply AROUSES me! I often told you, when I was young, that he was my MAN, and that liking for him has not decreased!! \"What a chicken\" and other of his \"Churchillian\" expressions usually strike home...\n\nDon't you think I've been long enough? Goodbye, Sister, and pray for me, don't forget. I'm trying to make sure you hear my \"Thank You\" for your kindness.\n\nYours very sincerely,\nHarry Thomas, O.M.I.\n\nDear Harry,\n\nNow, don't be so indignant over my printing part of your letter...In spite of your modesty which we admire, remember, you are still OUR Harry, our first Vico-President in whom we are very much interested. You are also the first and only Good Counsellor so far, who has donned the robe of a Missionary. Need I tell you that this commands all our respect and affection?\n\nEveryone horo sends you greetings; it is always a family feast when a letter from you arrives, so come AGAIN!\n\nS.J.P.\n\nFort Ware, B.C.\nJan. 2, 1942.\n\nDear Sister Jean,\n\n\"Greetings\", Sister, from an old pupil! When I received your letter, I was in the bush, with a survey party, 150 miles North of here, and I had absolutely no chance of thanking you till now..............................\n\nAs I sat by the radio and listened to the lovely strains of \"Silent Night\" on Xmas eve, my mind raced back to the days when I was an altar boy and assisting at Midnight Mass. Yes, as I sat there, my voice unconsciously lifted as it did in days gone by, and not till it had ended, did I realize\nCorrespondence -- (Concluded)\n\nthat I was sitting alone.\n\n\"There was a feeling in my breast,\nA feeling I could not suppress,\nWhat it was\u2014 I leave to you to\nguess\"........\n\nSister, I hope this finds you in\nthe best of health and spirits, and\nplease forgive me for not writing..\nAs ever, your old pupil,\nSamuel Miller.\n\nDear old Sambo,\n\nThough the years have made a big man\nout of my little boy, I see you are still\na poet\u2014a dreamer of dreams!

R. E. WODERHOUSE\n\nDOMINION PRESIDENT, WOMEN'S AUXILIARY\n\nI am so glad to have this opportunity of at least saying thank you to all my many friends in the Yukon. It was very gratifying to note the well-kept appearance of the little churches in the Yukon, in many cases of log construction, but inside, so beautifully appointed, and so splendidly clean.\n\nThe highlights of my term of office as Dominion President of the Women's Auxiliary, will be one of the most thrilling experiences to remember\u2014the most wonderful scenery surely in the world\u2014and yet, it is not of that I go to evidence of the same thought and devotion to your Church, your community, always among the best things worth while. I think life in the North soon strips one of artificiality and it is this that impressed me most\u2014that in your part of the world only real things matter. It was also most revealing to travel so far from the centre of Canada and find people so well informed on the questions of the day. What a thrill it gave me in Whitehorse, for instance, to be able to listen to the \"B.C. News\" direct from London\"\u2014to meet people following so closely events happening in other parts of the world.\n\nAs I think of all I saw and heard while in the Yukon, my mind impresses and blesses.\n\nHIGH GRADE FOXES AND MINK Livestock and Pelts\n\nWATSON'S FUR FARM\n\nGARDNER, YUKON, CANADA\nNORTHERN LIGHTS\n\nPublished in the interests of the Diocese of Yukon, Canada.\n\nVOLUME XXXI\nWHITEHORSE, YUKON, NOVEMBER 1941. No. 4\n\nFrom MRS. R. E. WOODHOUSE\n\nDominion Women's Auxiliary\n\nI am so glad to have this opportunity at last saying thank you to so many friends in the Yukon area of the little churches in the Yukon, in many cases of big congregation to me during my visit. My trip to that place this summer will be one of the highlights of my term of office and ever will be one of the most beautiful experiences to remember\u2014the most wonderful scenery sure to be in the dian women. The records too bore wonderful\u2014and yet, it is not of that sort evidence of the same thought and often think, but of you, people in care and, though not be any means those far distant parts, of your zeal and the most pretentious house in the community, always among the best and devotion to your Church, your enthusiasm endeavor to help those people. One was so proud of the things worth while. I think life in Church of England in the Yukon the North soon strips one of attitude and one realizes what the Auxiliary means to our women living in me most\u2014that in your part of the isolated churches.\n\nHIGH GRADE\n\nFOXES AND MINK\n\nLivestock and Pelts\n\nWATSON'S FUR FARM\n\nGARRETT, YUKON, CANADA\nST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL\n\nDawson\n\nThe Annual Harvest Festival was held on August 26th in St. Paul's Pro-Cathedral, when the services were celebrated by the Rector, the Rev. Wm. Valentine.\n\nThe Church was very tastefully decorated with the usual Harvest offerings of flowers, fruit and vegetables, together with the beautiful varied autumn leaves so wonderful in the Yukon. There were good congregations at all services.\n\nAt a business meeting of St. Paul's W.A. held at the Rectory on September 2nd, it was announced that the sum of $70 had been realized from the sale of refreshments on Discovery Day, August 18th. As it had been formerly decided that this money should be spent on materials for making garments for refugees, approximately $50.00 was spent on flannelette for pyjamas, etc. This means a very busy season for all members of the W.A.\n\nDeath has been busy once more among the ranks of our Church members. Mr. Frederick Hickling, a pioneer of Dawson and a valued Church member ever since he came here in the early days, passed away suddenly on September 11th.\n\nThe funeral was held on September 28th under the auspices of the Masons, the Oddfellows and the Pioneers, and was largely attended by all classes. He leaves a widow and two sons, one of whom, William, flew all the way from New York to pay his last respects to his Father. Mrs. Hickling has now left to make her future home in New York, and to her we extend our sincerest sympathy, together with our best wishes for comfort in her new life.\n\nThe next to be called away was Mrs. Delia Firth, another pioneer and much loved member of our congregation. She was on a visit to Vancouver, intending to spend the winter there, recuperating after the death of her husband only a month or two previously. She was taken ill very suddenly and an emergency operation was performed, but she failed to recover from it, and died in Vancouver General Hospital on October 5th.\n\nHer only son, Howard, attended the last sad rites in Vancouver and a number of wreaths were sent from Dawson. A Memorial Service was held in St. Paul's on October 19th, when the officiating clergyman was the Rev. Wm. Valentine. Mrs. Firth will be greatly missed by her numerous friends in the Yukon.\n\nA very pretty wedding took place in St. Paul's on the evening of September 12th, the principals being Miss Elinor Mary Hough, only daughter of Mrs. E. M. Coukley of St. Paul's Hostel, and Mr. John Francis Donald of the N.C.C. A reception followed the ceremony held at the Rectory by the kind invitation of Mr. and Mrs. Valentine, when a crowd of friends offered their congratulations and good wishes to the radiant couple.\n\nThe Little Helpers held their Annual Service in St. Paul's on September 23rd, when nearly 30 Little Helpers, their mothers and friends, attended. The service was taken by the Rev. Wm. Valentine and afterwards refreshments were served in the Rectory.\n\n---\n\nST. SAVIOUR'S\n\nCarcross\n\nOur Harvest Service was bright and helpful and the church was tastefully decorated by the Girl's Auxiliary. The address on that occasion was given by Mr. Stanley Webber. The special day of intercession, set apart by the King on August 21st, was observed, special prayers and hymns were used and the Lord Bishop of the Diocese was the preacher, taking for his text \"Who is on the Lord's side\". Sunday school re-opened after the summer holidays with a good enrolment. We miss Gertrude Rose who for many years was a faithful attendant. She has left for Vancouver to continue her studies and our best wishes go with her. Mr. Dalton, a student from the Anglican Theological College at Vancouver, was with us during the summer months helping with the services.\n\n---\n\nDIocese OF YUKON\n\nMissionaries and Workers\n\nRt.

The Yukon is carrying ice-floes but it is still open water. For one week we had good grayling fishing through the ice but then the present mild spell came and the ice left. The main herds of caribou are still playing around the International boundary so meat is scarce. Preparations are being made for winter trapping.\n\nMany of our menfolk work on an equal footing with whites during the summer and they are beginning to realise that if they are to receive respect and equality from fellow citizens they have to put their own house in order. A new spirit of cooperation is abroad and we are trying to live without relief, that most shattering kindness ever devised by white man for a native. As Moosehide natives have been allowed relief since gold rush days it is going to be some time before it becomes a custom of the past. Prayers supported by hard work are bound to bring success.\n\nHIGH GRADE\n\nFOXES AND MINK\nLivestock and Pelts\n\nWATSON'S FUR FARM\n\nCARCROSS, YUKON, CANADA\nGROUARD ECHOES\n\n\"CLIMB THROUGH THE ROCKS BE RUGGED\"\nTo you, dear Father Forcade,\nwhose generosity, kindness and zeal has\ninspired and led us throughout the happiest and\nmost fruitful year of our school career, we\ngratefully dedicate this issue of \"CHOUARD SCHOOL.\"\nGROUARD ECHOES\n\nPUBLISHED EVERY OTHER MONTH BY\nTHE GOOD COUNSEL CLUB\nST.

These were the ex-pupils who had returned for the first \"Home-Coming Day\". Those are the names of each (left to right):\n   Mrs. John Norris, Mrs. John Giroux, Hazel Morden (now the wife of Dr. Wood), Louise Laird (granddaughter of the Honorable David Laird who was once Lieut.-Gov. of Canada), Victor Bourgeois (Overseas), Delphis Budskin, Milton Poveshuckle (Overseas), Don Fovargue (Scotland), Harry Thomas (Scholasticate), George Fovargue (Overseas), Paul Hurtubise (Overseas), John Califer and Leo Dufresne (Army).\nEDUCATION OF THE MIND\n\nPersonality is developed by personal activities: activities of the mind and activities of the will.\n\n\"The mind does not unfold spontaneously.\" It must be EDUCATED.\n\nIn our civilization, we have schools\u2014many of them; attendance is compulsory; curriculums are standardized and laden\u2014We would like to think they might do the job...!!\n\nIs this not wishful thinking? Formal teaching imparts knowledge\u2014it instructs the mind but does not educate it. A learned burglar is always a liability to his country. Until the mind has been educated to BELIEVE in truth, it is still in the dark.\n\nYet \"no one can learn to distinguish right from wrong, and beauty from vulgarity by taking a course of lectures. It can only be taught by making it present in a child's surroundings and part of his daily life. Growth of intelligence is obtained by training and exercise, whereas the other activities of consciousness demand a group with whose existence they are identified.\"\n\n* * *\n\nAt the Grouard School, this education is attempted in the Good Counsel Club and in the C. Y. O.\n\nBy various ways and means, these organizations promote Faith in Truth. Everything, in the social life of the members, from their responsibilities and weekly passwords down to their beautiful uniforms is meant to make them feel that truth is equivalent to good, justice, charity, and beauty; that in it is to be found happiness, honor and victory; that it is really worth to live and die for; that it is the ROYAL in us which has CLAIMS on us all.\n\nA staunch Faith in Truth makes better Christains, better Lovers and better Countrymen!!!\n\nIf you would live for SONG\u2014WAR\u2014LOVE\u2014\n\nThen Faith must be your guide,\nThe Justice of your cause,\nShould make you brave in strife\u2014\nFor that which you hold true,\nYou must lay down your life,\nAnd your honour maintain\nE'en though victory be denied\u2014\n\nIf you would live\u2014Then Faith must be your guide!\n\nLeader.\n\"Climb though the rocks be rugged\"\n\n- Club Stems -\n\nAn OLD TIMER Speaks\n\nIt turned out to be one of those beautiful days... though the week-end hadn't forecasted as much. But when dawned April 26th, Feast of Our Lady of Good Counsel, the beautiful weather helped us to rejoice.\n\nCLUB MASS.\n\nEvery year, all Club members give a small offering so that we may have two Masses said, one for our living and one for our departed members. You see, OLD TIMERS, what a thoughtful teacher you all had, as yearly to participate in the prayers of a second generation of Club members. That's how we started the day, by assisting at the Club Mass.\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\nAs we sang our beautiful Club hymn, all the old familiar faces came to my mind... came to join their dear voices to ours as in days long since gone. My prayers included the dear departed schoolmates who no longer respond to the summons of the Club hall. How vividly the faces of our boys in uniform came. I whispered a prayer that Our Lady would shield you all! And my own dear little brother, who has donned a higher uniform, dedicating his life's work and services to the SUPREME KING. Yes, said I, year by year the Club members chant the Requiem of the departed, sing joyous hymns at some happy classmates' wedding, or listen with joy to the bells pealing out the tidings of baptisms of another generation of Good Counsellors. And through all this, the Club bonds endure though miles and miles separate us from many of our old and beloved companions of bygone, happier days!\n\nCLUB REUNION.\n\nAfter the evening Benediction, we gathered 'round OUR TEACHER, and visited our departed members' graves. Back in the dear old classroom we listened to the short but effective motherly advice given us by Sister Joan, after which Father Forcade entertained us by lecturing the key Community singing, and showing us beautiful pictures on a Projector. Some photos full of faces of the OLD TIMERS are flashed on the screen, to our great enjoyment. Again, our dear teacher's kindness was shown by the delightful lunch which was served before the festivities ended.\n\nLong live our Club, our Teacher, and all our members!!!\n\nMrs. JOHN GIROUX (Marguerite Thomas)\nSchool Activities\n\nPRINTING THE \"ECHOES\".\n\nHave you ever wondered how we go about printing our \"ECHOES\"? If you were to step in our classroom a few days before we \"go to press\", you would see a very busy workshop. When the pupils have handed in their articles, Sister Jean types them on to the stencils. I hope I'll soon be smart enough to help her at this job! When Sr. Benigna or Belle Cardinal have put in the designs, Fr. Forcade helps the boys print the stencils. Next comes the sorting and assembling of sheets. A group puts in the photos, while others do the stuffing, or prepare the paper and envelopes for the mail. When the 210 copies are finished, each one gives a big sigh of satisfaction and relief.\n\nEllen Brunelle\u2014Grade VIII.\n\nPRACTICAL TRAINING.\n\nIt is a good thing we have some movable desks in our room, as our class is used for so many useful activities. We girls should surely know how to set an attractive table and to put up decorations after all the practice we've had this year for Officers' Dinners, Old Pupils' Reunions etc.\n\nA Big Secret.\n\nEvery evening, of late, our classroom becomes a second \"HOLLYWOOD\" where great stars take their training in Dramatics. We are working hard in preparation for our concert to be given May 15th, in honor of our Bishop's feast. (Shh! It's a big secret\u2014don't tell him...but be sure YOU keep the date in mind.)\n\nWe Learn by Doing.\n\nWhile the boys have been busy making potato-picking boxes, we girls embroidered a new set of monograms for our uniforms. It took a long time to make the first, but after that it was easy.\n\nRoland Gaboury is proud to see that the nice flower basket he just finished is being used for our May altar.\n\nIn the Junior rooms, we see everything from paper houses to live caterpillars.\n\nElsie Phillips.\nHALL NEWS\n\nDid you notice:\n\nThe girls' new MERRY-GO-ROUND? It's wartime, and carpenters are few and far between, so we made the new TOY out of an old totter-totter. It's quite the thrill!\n\nThat Father Superior took ONLY Girls to cut and sow potatoes? That is SOME FEATHER in our hats!!\n\nThat Buster is almost one of ourselves now that his dear master, Father Marcotte, is gone? He knows a good place, so he has adopted the Girls' yard... even though Sister M. Ambrose isn't so fond of this extra \"boarder.\"\n\nAline Maskinak, since we saw the picture-show, \"Ride 'EM Cowgirl.\" She sure has made up her mind that she can do just as well, if not better! The rest of us aren't quite so sure about that, though.\n\nHow SWEET the girls can be when they want to coax Sr. Clare Eva to take them to play ball out of their own yard???\n\nHow quiet it was when Marjorie Tallman went to High Prairie for a few days? Marjorie sees ghosts at nights, and does she scream? In the daytime, she makes up for it by being a good JOKER, so we are very glad she is back again.\n\nAll the fun we had roasting our potatoes in Sr. M. Ambrose's big BONFIRE last Saturday. Yum! Yum! Did it taste like home? We hope Sister will have more rubbish to burn each Saturday!\n\nLieutenant Nora Cardina l.\n\nDid you notice:\n\nWhat a wonderful improvement there is in the Schola? That's because our Director added eight fresh LITTLE BOYS' voices. Everyone is raving about the way they sing the Proper of the Mass in four parts.\n\nHow clearly the BASS rings out when the Schola harmonizes? I learned the trick when Brother Paquet and William John deserted me one Sunday and I was left alone for the Bass. But if you want to learn how-you'll have to join the Schola!\n\nHow quickly the chocolates and oranges near our plates disappeared on Easter morning? GONE, but NOT FORGOTTEN........\n\nThe nice hand-painted neckties the boys are wearing with their second-class Uniforms? Sr. Therese Bernadette painted the C.Y.O. design on them without Sr. Denise Lucille noticing it - and was there joy and surprise all around?????\n\nHow much BEBE Noir's chest sticks out since he comes to the Dramatics classes? We rather think he and \"Margot\" will quite steal the show...as Pickininnies.\n\nThe nice rose bushes Sister Denise is carefully and tenderly working over each sunny day? It seems that they are a very rare kind...one that even lambs may eat with relish and feel no bad effects from.............??????\n\nCaptain Charlie White.\nACTIVITIES\n\nReligious Events\n\nEaster Sunday's beautiful Pontifical High Mass came as the crowning part of a most impressive Holy Week at which His Excellency, Bishop Langlois, had officiated. We had the pleasure of hearing His Excellency preach in French and in English at the C.Y.O. Mass. Father Superior was well enough to speak to the people in Cree.\n\nIn the afternoon, we assisted in full dress uniform, again, at the singing of the Complines, followed by Benediction given by our Bishop. These beautiful ceremonies were attended by most of the surrounding population, as it is their chosen day for their Easter duties.\n\nColonel V. Paquet, O.M.I.\n\nCourt of Honor\n\nAt the Court of Honor held on the last C.Y.O. day, we had the great honor of having Bishop Langlois present. Many of our officers and Guards were decorated. After he had sung the Leader's Prayer, Fr. Forcade explained that these awards were given for good deeds. Sister Superior pinned on the St. Michael and Father Superior, the St. Bernard Distinctions. Then His Excellency pinned the St. Ubald's Award on Capt. Janet Clark... and did we envy her? She is the only one so far to have had the Bishop in person present on her. Captain Charlie White wasn't here to receive his St. Ubald's Award, as he had gone to the Hospital for a few days. Bishop then told us how happy he was to know that so many had deserved to be decorated. He reminded us that the C.Y.O. is not selfish; that it trains us to serve a CAUSE: the love of God and of our neighbour. He finished by telling us this reward should urge us on to work hard for the reward that GOD will give us.\n\nSergeant Bella Cardinal.\n\nEaster Dinner\n\nOur \"Banquet Hall\" for the dinner was all decorated in Easter colors. Chocolate eggs, bunnies and chicks gazed at us from each place. Sr. Mary A delta must have done a good deal of hard work to give us such a nice supper. I was happy to have the pleasure of eating with the Major Officers for the first time.\n\nIn his after-dinner speech, Father announced the opening of a School for Officers. He then called upon Sister Superior, who had come in to hear the toast, to speak next. We congratulated all Sr. Superior said to us, but it made us sad to think that she would not be here for many more C.Y.O. days.\n\nSeveral Officers gave clever talks. Of course they knew beforehand that they would be asked to speak, so they had prepared for it. After some gay songs, we went to prepare for the big Display. Just one more Officers' Dinner! Too, too bad!\n\nLieutenant Viola Willier.\n\nHard Time Party\n\nOn the Thursday after Easter, the Officers gave a Hard time Party in honor of those who had won Awards at the Court of Honor. The Sisters chose the funniest costume, as we marched around the classroom. It was a real circus to see us all.\n\nAfter a Bing party, a treat of popcorn and Punch, we went home with a prize that was a SURPRISE!\n\nLance Corporal H. Sinclair.\nYOUTH TRAINING\n\nC.Y.O. Day.\n\nEaster Sunday dawned bright and clear. It seemed as if it had to be that way, being Our Lord's day of Resurrection...and then too, it was our C.Y.O. Day. After all the other wonderful events of the day were over, it was time for our big Display.\n\nA big crowd attended, and it was considered the most interesting of all our Displays. It started at eight o'clock with Community Singing. Our Leader repeated \"Leader's Prayer\" by request, and then after we had showed that we had \"brought our voice along\", Father made us \"fall in\" for the Dress parade.\n\nThen came the change into Gym suits, followed by a parade which included skipping, dancing, and fancy steps. This was followed by Colonel Dr. Faquet's command of a formation which included V's for Victory, and other pretty figures.\n\nThe smaller boys were found very daring when it came to Forward Rolls and head-springs off the box-horse.\n\nWhat the crowd enjoyed the most was the games. When it came to the race where the two teams had to dress each other up in old straw hats, boots and all, we were just sick from laughing.\n\nA group of girls acted out a car. Some were the wheels, others were the steering wheel, the motor and even the pump to fix flats with! There was a seat for the couple who owned the car, and when the car would go, the old man would hang on to his wife for dear life!\n\nFather said the side who won the first three games would have the next Gym class, and the side that won the next three would get an extra Steam Bath. The boys got the extra Gym class, but we got the other reward.\n\nGoodbye - Displays!\n\nIt seemed as if the Display came to a sudden jerk and then stopped...everyone was wishing it would last much longer. There were some people who had seen a Display for the first time, and they were just astonished over it. I suppose it was because there was so much quick action, with not a minute lost. We are terribly sorry that that is the last Display for this year. Father said there would be a Field Day though, and that should be even better fun.\n\nMajor C. Desjarlais.\n\nBatter Up!\n\nAlong with Spring Fever comes a more pleasant one: Baseball Fever! We have some pretty good teams this year...and it is fun to pit our strength against each other. Because there are many big girls, and very few big boys, we girls have a pretty good chance to beat the boys this year. We have not succeeded yet, but we feel it in our bones that we will...very SOON! Watch for that bit of news in the next issue of \"Echoes\"....\nAnother Display has come and gone but our Gym Classes, thanks to Youth Training, \"go on forever.\"\n\nInformal Games\n\nAt our last Display, we played a few games, and seeing that it created so much interest and enthusiasm, our Leader decided we should have some more during our Gym classes. First, we divide in teams so we can have the excitement of playing for championship. We have all kinds of games but one which really makes us work is Human Croquet.\n\nHuman Croquet\n\nThere are ten girls who stand astride to represent the wires, then the players from each side crawl through these \"wires.\" The captains rush and coach and puff in a brave attempt to get their sides through and back first. What excitement! It's a wonder the roof doesn't come off! It's real FUN...if you want to try it you're welcome!\n\nSteam and Showers\n\nWhen the class is over, we are hot and more or less played out. How heavenly it is to be refreshed by a wonderful cold shower following a Steam Bath. We often wonder what we ever did in the days we had no steam baths...how we would hate to go without them now! The more we get, the more we want, it seems.\n\nOpen Air Classes\n\nFather Forcade has told us that as soon as ever it gets warm enough, we are going to have our Gym classes outside. Won't that be just glorious? Just now, we are using all our evenings for Dramatics, but soon we shall be able to have our regular exercises again. We are all anxious for that time.\n\nOfficer Trainers\n\nIn order that many may be trained for leadership, Father Forcade has organized a school for Officers. Class for Guards desiring to pass tests as Officers is held once a week. When they are ready to try their tests, they notify the Major Officers who observe them drill their Squads in certain specified Gym exercises. The Major Officers then turn in the grading they have given the aspirant Officer, and if they have a satisfactory rating in school and in the Hall, they are entitled to a gold cord to be worn on their uniform. When there is a vacancy in the Staff of Officers, they will then be ready to take up the work of an Officer.\n\nMinstrel\n\nOur DRAMATICS CLASSES are so popular that everyone wants to be in them. Our big enterprise now is a Negro Minstrel...Oh, is it fun? If you notice us slurring our R's, you'll know that it's because we are trying to get that pronunciation.\n\nSee the World!\n\nOur Leader is getting a nice Projector for use in the school. It will be a real treasure, as we can then see all the slides and postcards available. Aren't we lucky \"chilluns\"?\n\nColonel Nancy Thomas.\nAre you interested in NICE STATION-ERY? If so, you should see the C.Y.O. letterheads and envelopes we are using now. And the best part of it is that it was made right here in Crouard. Aren't we lucky to have a professional printer in our midst?\n\n***\n\nWe were forcibly reminded of Death during Holy Week. The remains of Rev. Father DREAU who died at the Hospital at High Prairie were brought here and buried on Good Friday. The funeral Mass was chanted only after Easter. R.I.P.\n\n***\n\nA telegram informed FATHER MAHEU of the sudden death of his MOTHER on March 31st. Father immediately boarded a plane and flew home to sing the Requiem for his beloved mother. Our deepest sympathy with our prayers, Father!\n\n***\n\nDid your jaws ache last week? Ours did. They always do when FATHER KINDER-VATER pays a visit to our classroom. When he had exhausted his supply of news and jokes, he climaxed the session by singing for us. Sister says perhaps some had an \"ear-ache\" too...after that!\n\n***\n\nSanta Claus himself wouldn't have received a warmer welcome than did FATHER MARCOTTE when he paid us a flying visit last Monday. We didn't get to see half enough of him\u2014but we are fully convinced that Father was glad to see us again and that he still knows how to tease. Even the horses and \"Buster\" knew him and bade him \"Welcome\" in their own way!\n\n***\n\nWhy is it we don't carry a kodak around all the time? Had we done so, we'd have been able to get a prize-winning snap a few days ago\u2014of the Bishop's Secretary! It would have done your heart good to have seen demure MISS LEMIEUX perched beside our mail-carrier in the \"one-hoss shay.\" Judging from the convulsive grasp on the seat handle, I would venture to say it was Miss Lemieux's first buggy ride in years.....\n\n***\n\n\"The early bird catches the worm.\" We had to get up mighty early to catch our Leader on his patronal feast\u2014but in spite of all resistance and trickery\u2014we managed to offer him our best wishes on the eve of his feast, and then to sing his six o'clock Mass the next morning. Sister had asked for about a dozen singers only\u2014but you should have seen the crowd that insisted on coming to join their prayers and voices to Father Forcade's. We feel quite sure Heaven was kept busy receiving and answering petitions that day.\n\n***\n\nCertain C.Y.O. GUARDS are proudly wearing new red and blue cords on their uniforms. This proves they have passed certain tests and have had good reports in school and hall.\n\n***\n\nWe are to learn a new song entitled, \"Jerry Had a Little Lamb.\" For further information write Father Forcade.\nOld Pupils' Corner\n\nMy dear old pupils:\n\nYou will be glad, I know, that I asked Marguerite to write the Club page for this issue....it was indeed a happy inspiration. Marguerite is always my old \"Stand-by\"; I can't imagine what I would do without her enthusiasm and whole-hearted support. And I may say right here, that she is not the only one whose thoughts strayed back over the years, on Club Day! How fervently I asked God to bless each and everyone of you, so that your lives may be clean, worthy and beautiful.\n\nOne day\u2014just before our Club Feast\u2014I had a wonderful surprise. Just imagine receiving fresh flowers. \"Hey up here!\" I could hardly believe it, but yes, there they were: twelve beautiful carnations, from our Old Timer, Mrs. McLaughlin, of Vancouver, B.C. How dear it was of you to remember, Ethel!\n\nAnd just as agreeable \"Says it With Flowers\", our dear Ruth Morden says it with SWEETS....When pupils are so thoughtful, how can one help loving them, and hoping that the best in life will come to them? Be assured of my deep appreciation for what you all try in so many ways to make me feel: your gratitude towards a teacher who, like so many others, only did her duty. But when one loves one's duty, ah! what happiness! It has always been my good fortune to have such dear, good boys and girls to teach\u2014you, even YOU, my OLD TIMERS....in spite of all your mischief!\n\nA few days ago, I chatted with Mabel Gledu, now Mrs. Paul Noskeyi. If you know them both so well, I am sure you will rejoice to hear that Paul is still a wonderful hunter and trapper. Mabel said Paul had killed 63 rats in two weeks, and then she proudly added, \"And I got 12 myself, so in all, we got 7500.\" Paul is out hunting again, but will be home on time for the wedding. Just guess which of our OLD TIMERS is getting married now? None other than our old \"JIG-BOO MAN\"....Jerome Cardinal! His coming marriage to Mabel Hemolin was announced in church this morning.\n\nSpeaking of the Noskeyi family: I have always forgotten to tell you of the tragedy that befell them last fall. Norman was drowned at Prairie Lakes, and a few weeks after, his little brother Maxwell broke through the ice, contracted a bad case of Pneumonia, and died a few days afterwards. God grant them eternal rest!\n\nAlvin Selkirk's baby has her heart's desire: a son! Her two little daughters are quite thrilled over the advent of a baby brother. So, help me bid a warm welcome to this new Club Member with an OLD TIMERS name: ADMN !!!!!!\n\nTwo weeks ago, a very erect, nice-looking soldier boy paid me a visit: Leo Dufresne. He has joined the Royal 22nd Regiment, so expected to be transferred to the East very soon. He thinks Army life is quite all right, and left with the hope of meeting some of our dozen and a half Club Members who are in uniform in Canada and Overseas.\n\nA letter from Louis Mathieu last week assures me that he took my remark re his \"wicked-looking\" little moustache all in good fun, and that some day, he may have enough courage to send me his photo for the \"CHOES\". Bravo, Louis!\n\nWhat would we do without our Michael McDermott? He was right here with his good-looking little truck and his guitar to help out for our last Club reunion. If you like hearing about all your former pals, why don't you ALL write and share these pages? I'd like nothing better! In the meantime, GOD BLESS YOU my dears!\n\nYour devoted OLD TEACHER,\n\nSister Jean Placideau\nJ.C.S.\nDear Teacher and Pupils;\n\nHere I am back at work after a glorious seven days' leave with my little wifey. The wife and I managed to get leave the same time, so you can well guess we made the best of our short break.\n\nWhilst we were on leave we received your Newsy Journal, which we both thoroughly enjoyed. We both find this New Journal has improved in many ways, but where we got a big surprise was when we saw our wedding photograph in the Journal. It tickled the wife when she found the curtains were the proper colour.\n\nI was just thinking you must have quite a good collection of snaps around you of all the old timers and their children. It makes one think how the time passes by; Look at me now a happy married man and I must confess there's nothing like it for total happiness.\n\nI visited several Churches including our Cathedral in Middlesbrough, so I had three wishes for visiting. Don't worry, I didn't forget you all in one of my wishes, so I hope they are fulfilled.\n\nWell Sister I must close and write to George who as you know has been posted overseas. As yet no word from him, so I can't say much except his posting came as a shock to all of us.\n\nWe visited his little daughter, Pauline, and I am pleased that she and her mother are A.l.at Newcastle although you will realize how they miss your Old Timer, George.\n\nSo with love and regards from Joan and myself, Good Luck and Keep Smiling.\n\nYour Old Timer, Don\n\nDear Donny-Boy;\n\nIt would have been a disappointment had not your genial letter arrived on time for this issue of \"Echoes.\" Everything in your letter makes me glad: your happiness, your holiday, your appreciative remembrance. Tell Joan I'll be looking forward to receiving her promised letter.\n\nWe shall go out to fix your dear brother's and mother's graves in a few days. We are happy to perform this labor of love for you.\n\nRemember me to George and Eileen when you write them. We keep you in our hearts and in our prayers.\n\nS. J.P.\n\nSacred Heart Scholasticate,\nLebret, Sask.\n\nDear Sister Jean Placidus;\n\nYou have every reason to be well pleased with the 1941-42 School year and to feel it is a success as well as a pleasure. I only wish that your ultimate aim be realized and that the boys and girls live up to the ideals you have striven to give them and this particularly when they step forth to do battle face to face with life.\u2014Father Forcade does seem to be a splendid educator.\n\nAnd poor old George\u2014 it really is too bad he's transferred probably to a more active front\u2014Libya or to the Far East. War\nrespects no one, no family. Our old world is packed full of that nauseating stuff that is unleashed even upon the best and noblest boys. May God bless and protect him and his little family and make them strong in their duty and in their sacrifice.\n\nTrusting that you have more success and consolation during this last stretch of the school term. Good-day Sister; please have a wee remembrance in your prayers for,\n\nYours truly,\nBrother H. Thomas\n\nMy dear Harry;\nWe missed you at the Club Reunion. It would have been pleasant to have you around to hang up our decorations\u2014 as it was, we had to use a step-ladder!!\nIt would have done your heart good to see that brother-in-law of yours singing the Club Song. He did more dramatizing than singing\u2014and that helped the rest of the crowd to sing with gusto!\nGlad you liked the fudge\u2014how much will you give me for answering your question as to whether or not I made it? You know, curiosity is not supposed to be a MASCULINE fault!! Anyway\u2014I enjoyed your letter. Come again!\n\nS.J.P.\n\nGeneral Hospital,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nMy dear Sister Jean;\nThanks a million Sister, for the \"Grouard Echoes\" which I surely enjoyed. I always like to read the \"Old Pupils Corner.\" I admire the ones who have gone far ahead especially my old classmates.\n\nI am feeling swell, but I'm to be transferred to the Calgary Sanatorium for a further treatment. I'm to under-go an operation up there. So Sister please tell your pupils to pray hard for me. As yet I don't know when I'll be going as Doctor didn't tell me. I don't mind very much though, but I know I'll be kind of lonesome for the friends I have here.\n\nA lady came around here and asked us what we wanted to do, so I told her I want to finish school if I can make it, so they will be around to teach us. Is till remember my Arithmetic!\n\nThe rocks are steep and rough but I'll climb up a winner if it be God's Holy Will. With God's choicest blessings on you, dear Teacher.\n\nYour loving pupil,\nLena Gladue\n\nDear Lena;\nWe all hope the inevitable operation is over with now and that you are on the royal road to recovery. We remembered you in our classroom prayers.\n\nSo you still remember your Arithmetic? I don't doubt it\u2014you were quite a \"Shark\" at figures!\n\nWrite and tell us how you are. Very best wishes.\n\nS.J.P.\n\nDear Teacher;\nWell good-bye, dear loving Teacher. I'm on my way to a land of action and that's Overseas.\n\nGnr. R.A. Smith\n\nDear ROY;\nWe are anxious to hear from you and to know where you are. In the meantime\u2014God keep you safe and strong.\n\nS.J.P.\n\nCanyon Creek, Alberta.\n\nDear Sister Jean;\nThanks Sister, for the \"Echoes\" which I got last mail. I must admit that I enjoyed every paragraph even the last of the old Pupils' Corner.\n\nI came back here to work and I had the misfortune of cutting my right foot. This sure spoiled my trip to Slave Lake for Holy Week. Now I have a pair of crutches to hop around on. In another week or so I will be struggling along on two feet again, I hope.\n\nHow is Margaret? Is she still in jail? (In quarantine.) What a disgrace! I hope she is free.\n\nBest wishes to you and your\nPupils. Good Luck.\n\nA YOUNG pupil,\nErnest.Giroux\n\nMy dear Ernest;\nYou'd better hurry and get into your uniform, or you'll get killed without even going to do battle for your country! Better luck in the future, dear Mr. Former President. Write again.\n\nS.J.P.\n\nCurrie Barracks,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nDearest Sister Jean;\n\nIt's hard to explain my gratitude and appreciation towards you and the pupils of our dear old home, Grouard Mission. \"Grouard Echoes\" Oh, what a surprise it was to me. Sister, you just can't imagine how delighted I was. Millions of thanks to you and your pupils. Well Sister, I am still in the hospital...\n\nI may be weak in the body, but, Sister I am positively sure I am strong at heart and soul. From now on I am following your motto, \"Climb though the rocks be rugged.\" Sounds encouraging.\n\nSay Hello to your pupils and a big hand shake to you dear Sister Jean.\n\nFrom an old pupil,\nJohnny Bourgeois\n\nDear Johnny;\nSorry you're improving so slowly, but I trust all will yet be well. Patience is a great virtue!\n\nAs to the big secret you told me, yes, I approve whole-heartedly and think you would be very wise in your choice. Let me hear more about it.\n\nS.J.P.\n\nCanadian Army Overseas.\n\nDear Sister Jean and Pupils;\nHello, Sister Jean, just thought of putting \"pupils\" above, knowing you would read it to them.\n\nThere is really not much happening around here, but I may say a few things that will interest you. Charles Tomkins, Louis Auger, and Leonard Anderson are out here. I saw John Smith in London awhile back and last Sunday I saw Gerard Brulotte, an old school friend of mine in my young days. And another couple of friends of mine, Mike and Edward Belcourt. Tony Cardinal is here with me; we have quite a time together.\n\nYou may tell the pupils that it is a beautiful country out here, but not so good as Canada.\n\nWe may never see Canadian soil again but we're ready to take it, with heads up and a smile. Closing with best regards to all.\n\nFrom an old pupil,\nVictor Bourgeois\n\nMy dear old Vic;\nThe ball-season is open-and aren't the boys wishing you were here again to play on their team? Hardly seems a year ago that you were doing your share of playing and teasing on our diamond. And now you are fighting for a Great Cause! Let the thought that it is for God and Country spur you on and help you to keep your chin up. Be sure of our faithful prayers. May God protect and bless you.\n\nS.J.P.\nReverend Father Desnoyers, who is the Assistant-General of the Oblate Fathers, arrived in Grouard for his official visit in this Vicariate. We have not yet seen him, as he only arrived a few hours ago, but from his remarks to our Bishop, we know that he highly approves of the C.Y.O. in Grouard. Father Desnoyers represents the Superior-General who is in Occupied France.\n\n\"No one is a prophet in his home town\" is very often a true saying. It so often happens that we get more appreciation from those who are far away than from those with whom we rub elbows. But to prove that that is not always the case, we publish a letter received Saturday from our Postmistress:\n\nReverend Dear Sister Placidus:\n\nPlease accept the enclosed offering to add to your financial part. I am sure proud and anxious to read the GROUARD ECHOES. I think the boys and girls are wonderful. I, as an outsider, see a big change in the pupils; they carry themselves beautifully and are bright and happy. All credit is coming to their leaders, and in particular Rev. P. Forcade who has done wonderful work. I am also glad to note that some of the old pupils remember the kindness that was shown them at the school.\n\nECHOES, please accept my appreciation for your kindness in remembering me.\n\nMrs. V. MAURICE.\n\nSince the construction of the new Bishop's Residence in McLennan has started, many of our Brothers are busy doing their bit. They are working under the direction of Bro. Desrochers, O.M.I., an architect who came from the East especially for this construction. We wish them good luck\u2014but how we hate to see that house going up, as it means we shall eventually lose OUR Bishop.\n\nReverend Brother Fortier has returned to the East.\n\nThere seems to be a bit of competition between our two Superiors as to which one will work the hardest! Father Superior, although he is supposed to be convalescing, can be seen at any hour of the day in his garden or potato patch. And in between her washings, soap-making and sewing her Superior is putting in her big garden.\n\nSister Marcella has undertaker to beautify our cemetery. Any one who wishes a job may apply to her, and be sure of being accepted.\n\nSr. Louis Omer has a new hobby: going about looking for caterpillar eggs that infest our trees. When she has found a particularly lively crowd of baby caterpillars, she sends them to us with a magnifying glass. Ooooh! Do they squirm??\n\nLAST MINUTE FLASH.\n\nThe mail this morning brought in our new Projector, and some cards and slides. We are so happy that the first Slides in colors which we will see this afternoon is \"BEN HUR\" which our teacher just finished reading to us. HURRAH!\nLOCAL STATISTICS\n\nAs the 1941-1942 school term draws to a close, we can rightfully state once more that progress has been achieved. The following figures show that there has been improvement as far as the age of admittance of our first grade pupils and the grade attainment of our last year students is concerned.\n\n1940-1941 school term...........37 pupils were admitted. 19 were discharged.\n\nWhen admitted:\n2 were 7 years old\n7 were 8 years old\n9 were 9 years old\n2 were 11 years old\n3 were 12 years old\n1 was 13 years old\n1 was 15 years old\n\nWhen discharged:\n4 were in grade 6\n5 were in grade 5\n3 were in grade 4\n6 were in grade 3\n1 was in grade 2\n\n1941-1942 school term...........27 new pupils were admitted. 15 will be discharged.\n\nWhen admitted:\n16 were 7 years old\n4 were 8 years old\n6 were 9 years old\n3 were 10 years old\n2 were 11 years old\n1 was 12 years old\n1 was 16 years old\n\nWhen discharged:\n8 are in grade 6\n6 are in grade 5\n1 is in grade 1\n\nNote: Children are usually discharged at 16.\n\nThese figures show that there has been some improvement. We sincerely hope that the parents will continue cooperating with the school authorities for the good of their children. Next year's records should show further progress. How about it!\nAs we glance over the work done at the school this year, we cannot but notice this year's outstanding innovation, namely, the new manual training programme. It is most certainly a great help in the training of our boys as a practical preparation for their adult lives.\n\nThis year the boys have especially learned the fundamentals of hand woodwork. They have completed some wonderful projects including chairs, tables, stools and medicine chests. Three years in such a course will do much more than just prepare them for an ordinary life on the Reserves.\n\nA systematic chart prepared by Mr. P. Boyko, farmer, has given the pupils the splendid chance of evolving through the different phases of farm training.\n\nA regular physical training programme has helped to keep the boys fit and in good health. Winter has seen the boys achieve new laurels in the field of sports.\n\nThe girls too have been very busy. They have received important training in the different branches of home economics. Very recently they have taken part in a competition arranged by The Canadian Handicrafts Guild of Edmonton. Our girls emerged victorious with the first prize. Congratulations!\n\nKnights of Columbus\n\nIf anybody should notice a scarcity or rather the absence of certain members of the main staff next Sunday, May 24th, let it be known that the main reason is that Mr. R. H\u00e9roux and Mr. D. Fortier of this school will be undergoing an initiation in Edmonton. Rev. Father Rheuma and Mr. L. Protti are actual members of the K. of C. They'll be there. To the new members: Congrats!\n\nBlessing of New Church and Confirmation\n\nSamson Reserve\n\nMay the 17th will long be remembered by the Indians of Hobema. This day marked the Blessing of a new church dedicated to Our Lady of Lourdes on the Samson Reserve, and the Confirmation of a large class of 107 by His Grace Most Reverend J.H. MacDonald, Archbishop of Edmonton.\n\nIt is estimated about 1000 were present for the occasion. The procession which accompanied the Archbishop to the church was led by two members of the R.C.M.F. of Edmonton. It also included boy scouts from the Indian School and a cavalcade of Indian horsemen some of whom were clad in native costumes.\n\nAs only a small portion of the crowd could find a place in the church, the ceremonies which started at 3:30 p.m. were broadcast to the hundreds gathered outside of the church.\n\nArchbishop MacDonald was assisted by Rev. Father J. Holland of St. Joseph's Seminary, Rev. Father L. Couture of St. John's Juniorate and by Rev. Father F. Moulin, who has spent nearly forty years as a missionary on the Hobema Indian Reserves. It was indeed a great consolation for him to witness the Blessing of this new church on one of the Reserves as well as the Confirmation of so many of his spiritual children.\n\nThe choir of St. John's Juniorate under the direction of Rev. Father L. Pepin O.M. was in charge of the singing.\n\nIn his sermon, His Grace thanked all who had contributed in the work of building the new church, which upon completion would be the pride of the Indians of the Samson Reserve. He exhorted the Indians and especially those who were confirmed on this day, to make good use of all the means (continued next page)\nVacation time will soon be here. Vacation means a time of rest. But it does not mean a time for idleness. If you really want to enjoy your holidays you must do your duty in all things. Thus you will only feel happy for doing right but you will also make all those around you feel happy and glad to have you with them.\n\nTo conclude this you should start right now planning what you will do to keep busy during your holidays. Make use of the time that you have free at school. Girls you can make yourselves useful around the farm. We wish you this and we wish you plenty of fun, good health and God's Blessings on all you do.\n\nEd. Rh\u00e9aume O.M.I., Principal.\n\nRight boys and seven girls will be leaving the school this term. They are V. Battlesnake, J. Shortneck, E. Crane, J. Ball, L. Johnson, M. J. H. G. Twins, H. Dixon, C. Lightfoot, M. Buffalo, J. Headman, M. T. Child, L. Guitrufie and M. Simon.

We are knitting socks, sweaters and scarves for the soldiers and we enjoy it very much. We are glad to do it for them who are fighting for us and for our country. We are not wasting anything in our sewing rooms. We save even the tiniest pieces of cloth and that is also to help win the war.\n\nMadolene Buffalo.\n\nA PICNIC\n\nOn Easter Monday, we went for a ride to the new church on the Sampson Reserve. There were three teams, two belonging to the school and one which Mr. Joe Minde had let us have. We were about 45 in all. Mrs. Minde came with us too. We started in the morning, had dinner in the basement of the church and came back about three o'clock in the afternoon. We enjoyed our ride very much and hope it won't be the last.\n\nIsabelle Headman.\n\nTALKIES\n\nWe have had talkies very often this year. We like them very much especially when they are about cowboys. One of the last ones we saw was about the war. It was entitled \"Canada Carries On\". We saw many things we had never seen before, cannons, machine guns, ships and bombers. We saw them all in action. We are going to see another show about the war on May 26th. C. Lightning.\n\nTONSILECTOMY\n\nTwenty three girls and twenty seven boys have had their tonsils taken out. It took two weeks. Every morning 5 or 6 would go to the hospital in Wetaskiwin and then the next morning another group would take their place. Many of the boys kept asking each other who was going to be next. They were afraid every time they saw Miss Conroy's car coming towards the school. I was kind of afraid too. I thought I was going too, but I didn't go.\n\nLast Saturday morning three boys stayed in bed. After we finished our breakfast they got up, dressed up and away they went. They came back the next morning, Sunday morning, but they didn't want to stay in bed because there was a big celebration at the new church on the Sampson Reserve.\n\nErnest Baptiste.\n\nWITH MUD IN HER EYE!!!\n\nAbout 3 weeks ago I was on the swing and 3 other girls were playing near it. There was a big puddle of water underneath me and I was just wondering what would happen if I fell off the swing.\n\nThen Sister rang the bell for us to go in and just as I was getting off, I don't know what happened, I fell right into the mudhole. I was afraid to tell Sister but I did and she sent me upstairs to change my clothes. I made marks all the way on the floor, because when I took off my rubber shoes one of them was full of mud. I washed my clothes and when all was finished I went to my classroom. I was all right.\n\nAmalie Chibley.\nDISTURBED VISITORS\n\nLast Tuesday we had some very disturbing visitors. They were Multnomahs and their Sisters Sarah and Leonard. They came to thank us again for showing us their pictures in the color show.\n\nOn Friday, April 18th, we had a quiz program in our classroom. Father Rh\u00e9ume and Brother Kael came in to listen.\n\nOn Thursday we had each sent in 10 questions on anything we had learned in the classroom. There were 300 questions in all. Each pupil had a number written on his number was called he had to choose a question from an envelope. If he answered rightly he got some candy. Whoever someone missed the question from the question got the candy. It was lots of fun and we hope we will have another soon.\n\nHoward & Stanley Buffalo and Joe Lightning.\n\nQUIZ PROGRAM\n\nOn Friday, April 18th, we had a quiz program in our classroom.

They are all Leghorns. There are about 250 of them. About 10% of them died. Sister Superior is taking good care of them in a brand new chicken coop that Brother Kael built this spring. We like to go and watch them when they are eating. Hope that when we come back next September they will be big enough to lay eggs for us.\n\nRobert Rabbit.\n\nA LITTLE ACCIDENT...OR ASSIST MY NUDNESS\n\nNEW BABY CHICKS\n\nOn May 7th Father Rh\u00e9ume went to the station and brought back a half dozen big boxes filled with small baby chicks.

Ayvastin.\nTHE PRINCIPAL'S FEAST\n\nYesterday May 21st, is our principal's feast day. Yesterday evening we had a little gathering to wish him a happy birthday. We sang a few songs. Then Father Therese Dion read the address and offered a spiritual bouquet to Father RM. In the name of the whole school after the children asked Father to grant us a holiday. He succeeded. Today we had a holiday. We want to thank our kind principal for all he has been doing for us.\n\nHUNTING EGGS\n\nThis afternoon May 21st, as it was a holyday in honour of our principal, the girls went out on a picnic and the boys went out to the bush to look for eggs. Mr. Fortier promised a nickel to the one who would bring back the most eggs. The boys brought back 22 cents, 5 nickels, and 12 hawks. So in all there were 39 eggs. I got the nickel with 9 cents.\n\nRAIN WAVE\n\nTeacher: Give me around which means all the words in the following group:\n\nking, queen, emperor, czar\n\nFrank (brightly) Big shot!\n\nWOODWORK\n\nWe have learned a lot of things in woodwork. We have learned how to use carpenter's tools and how to make all kinds of joints such as the mortise and tenon, dado, tongue and groove, and so on. We have made projects to make. Most of us have made tables chairs and medicine chests. We have also learned how to use various tools, especially the chisel because it is a tool we worry often.\n\nVictor Battlewake.\n\nVI. GARDENS\n\nSome time ago Mr. Protti read a letter to us which Father Rh\u00e9aume had received from the government at Ottawa. It said that to help wo Indians should plant gardens which will not only help us but help Canada as well because there is going to be a shortage of the things which are given in the rations to the Indians. By growing vegetable gardens we can get the food and the vegetables we need to be healthy. So let's get down to work on our gardens for victory. Let's get down to work on our gardens for victory. All the school boys are willing to have their own gardens at home.\n\nWe want to help not only our parents but also Canada in its battle for victory. So let's all do our part in winning the war by growing these victory gardens because nearly all the food that our old people get in their rations is going to be cut down for the fighting men. So let's store away some food for the winter. Norman Yellowbird.\nSCRAP\n\nWe are doing our part to help Canada's war effort by collecting scrap. We are grateful to all the people of Hobbs who have helped us in our work. We want to thank Mr. Bilt who took over 5 tons of scrap in his truck from Hobbs to the Wetaskiwin Salvage Depot.\n\nJoseph Shortneck.\n\nWASTE METAL\n\nThe duty of my committee was to salvage bones. We picked the smallest and the biggest ones we could find. We have already picked up more than 1,200 lbs. - Emock Crane.\n\nSCRAP METAL\n\nOur committee collected metal of all kinds. Our loads were so heavy we had to take the horses to haul them. After we had all our scrap ready Mr. Bilt came with his truck and brought it all to the Salvage Bin in Wetaskiwin. I. Johnson.\n\nRUBBER\n\nHelp Canada by saving scrap rubber. That's what our committee did. We collected old boots, tires, tubes and everything we could get that was made of rubber. We got quite a lot of it and had lots of fun going out around Hobbs looking for it. Percy White.\n\nPAPER, GLASS & RAGS\n\nF.R. Child's group had to pick up paper. They got piles and piles of magazines and journals. I was in J. Bull's committee. We had to collect bottles and rags. We got plenty of rags from the girls sewing rooms and we got more than 20 dozen beer bottles. Alexia Tins.\n\nBE PREPARED\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, April 19th, the Boy Scouts were blessed by Reverend Father Rh\u00e9aume, our principal. After that we made our three promises. The first to obey all scout laws, the second to obey God's laws, and the third to do good to others at all times.\n\nM.D. Buffalo.\n\nCELEBRATION\n\nWe celebrated that same day. After supper the 32 boy scouts went to the bush. There we had a real good time. We put up the flags and built a big fire. After that we played some games and then we had our sing-song. Then we showed Mr. Fortier an Indian dance and then all danced around the fire. We stayed there until 10 o'clock and then came back. We went to bed feeling very tired. The next morning I was so sleepy I could hardly open my eyes. Gabriel Johnson.\n\nKNOTS\n\nMost of us are still in the tenderfoot class. Mr. Fortier, our scoutmaster is showing us how to make all kinds of knots. We are learning how to tie such knots as the weaver, the sailor, the Boland, the cloven hitch and the granite knot.\n\nThe Sisters and the girls made our neckerchiefs, pants, socks and kit bags. We want to thank them for all they have done for us.\n\nThe boy scouts took part in the celebration last Sunday. Some served in church, some were in the parade and the others helped in the booths and on the grounds. We also helped the members of the band to Club to prepare everything for the celebration on the Samson Reserve. Ernest Baptiste.\nThe score of that final game was 6-3. Here are the final league standings and the leading scorers:\n\n| Team          | Score |\n|---------------|-------|\n| Colonels      | 15-7  |\n| Maple Leafs   | 12-8  |\n| E.A.C.        | 12-8  |\n| Canadians     | 12-8  |\n| G.Kontour     | 12-8  |\n| F.R.Child     | 12-8  |\n\nLeading scorers:\n- P.W.

Child was the outstanding goalie with 3 shutouts and only letting 16 goals past him throughout the season.\n\nP.Ross Child of the Colonels was the league's bad man with 16 minutes in the cooler.\n\nBASEBALL\n\nWell another season of hockey has gone by. The kids surely felt sorry that they could not play their work-outs at night or on our new rink. The rink has 20 100-watt lights, each player had to pay two cents for every game they played at night. Everybody was glad to pay for all the fun they had.\n\nOur school team only played five outside games. Out of these five we lost one to St. John's College by a score of 6-1. Let's hope we'll do better next time. Here are the scores of the other games played:\n\n| Opponent       | Score |\n|----------------|-------|\n| Weyakwa        | 8-2   |\n| Matno          | 14-0  |\n| Wepaskwinn     | 7-4   |\n| St. Albert     | 125-0 |\n\nHOCKEY\n\nF.R.

The mother cat had 3 kittens in 1937; the cat and her 3 kittens had 3 kittens in 1938. If, in 1939 the cat and her 3 kittens and each of their 3 kittens should each have 3 kittens, how many cats and kittens would there then be altogether?\n\n2. Ned bought 3 marbles from Ted and sold 3 each to Jed and Fred. Ted bought 6 from Fred and 9 from Jed and sold 6 to Ned. Fred sold 3 to Ned. How many marbles then had each boy, if all started with six apiece?\n\n3. Joe phone Jane to meet him at the \"Lower Deck\" for lunch at 12:30. Jane thinks he said 12:00. Joe's watch is eight minutes fast though he thinks it is seven minutes slow. Jane's watch is ten minutes slow though she thinks it is five minutes fast. At what time will each arrive at the \"Lower Deck\"?\n\n4. Each time the pump handle is pushed down a quart and a pint of water flows from the spout. How many strokes will be necessary to fill a 4 and 1/2 gallon tub, if every fifth stroke fails to produce any water?\n\nANSWERS: No fun unless you do the figuring.\n\n1- 64. 2- Ned & Ted each had 12, the others none\n\n3- At the same time: 12:15. 4- 14 strokes.\nGROUARD ECHOES\n\n\"CLIMB, THOUGH THE ROCKS BE RUGGED\"\nOur first number of the Grouard Echoes for the New Year 1944, carries with it sincere and loving wishes for the health, happiness and success of all our readers, in their various fields of labor.\n\nThe Old Pupils were especially in mind on Dec. 27th when Holy Mass was offered for their welfare at Sister Superior's request.\n\nOnce again our worthy and venerated Bishop, Mgr. Landis, has been forced to leave the Vicariate owing to the precarious condition of his health. We trust that it may not be too long before he returns to us again with renewed strength and vigor to resume the work so dear to his heart.\n\nTo St. Joseph, our certain hope below, Glory of earth and heaven, Thou pillar of the world, to thee, Be praise immortal given.\n\nTo him, we attribute the generous donations received from:\n- Vancouver B.C.\n- New Westminster, B.C.\n- Fort St. John, B.C.\n- Iona, California\n- Spokane, Alta.\n- Vancouver, Wash.\n- Baldwinville, N.Y.\n\nRest assured dear friends your kindness is not forgotten. Every Wednesday, \"To Joseph\" is sung at Benediction for all the benefactors of the Mission, past and present.\n\n\"It is at Joseph\"\n\nHe never fails those who trust in him.\n\nOn Jan 21st, we had the happy privilege of welcoming our beloved and esteemed Directress of Studies, Sister Ebert. She visited the classes on the 24th and 25th.\n\nThe pleasure was mutual when she greeted a large number of her former pupils who had come to the Co-Operative Bingo party on Jan. 23rd. No one who has ever met Sr. Ebert has ever forgotten her; it seems that way.\n\nAll too soon we had to say good-bye to her and wish her \"Bon Voyage\" on her way to Joassart.\n\nAnother \"Old Timer\" who visited here in December was Rev. Fr. Floch who is always interested in Grouard.\n\nSister Joseph O'Gorman, from Lacombe Home visited here in December also.\n\nThe remainder of the School Year will be devoted to the development of an enterprise entitled:\n\"Pioneers of Grouard during the past Fifty Years\".\nThe culmination will be a booklet made up of the pupils' compositions on the subject.\n\nMay your Lenten Season be holy and fruitful in prayer, penance and good works, that your Easter may be happy and joyous.\nSchool Activities\n\nOUR RETREAT\nOur news items were already given in, so we couldn't mention this important news in our last Echoes. Like the Fathers and Sisters, we too make a retreat every year. Who was our preacher? No other but Rev. Fr. Joseph McGregor, the parish priest of Edmonton (a name we often hear, since our new teacher thinks there is no place like that one). Father gave us three sermons a day and knew how to hold our attention and interest by making his preaching story-like, always bringing home some beautiful lessons. We thank you, dear Father for your kindness and interest. Your words have helped us a great deal and will remain with us a long time.\n\nMandy Willcox - Gr. V., Albert Ward - VI.\n\nMr. H. Laird's Death\nMr. H. Laird died Dec. 3rd at High Prairie Hospital. The Indians of Northern Alberta have lost in him a devoted friend for he had been Indian Agent for over twenty years. His time was spent in advising and helping our parents in their difficulties. He was also a devoted friend to our dear Missionaries in their hard work. He was laid to rest in High Prairie cemetery.\n\nWe extend our deep sympathy to his daughter, Louise, an OLD TIMER here in Grouard and to his son Gordon, a member of our Canadian Army.\n\nLucy Smith - Gr. VI.\n\nOUR CHRISTMAS TREE IN THE CLASSROOM\nThe week before Christmas all the class rooms were decorated and cribs and Xmas trees put up. To us was given the joy of running to the bush for a Christmas tree. It was a nice one too. In its time I had it ready, standing in the corner of our class room. I wanted the honor of decorating it - but the girls said - boys were not good for that dainty work - so they took it in hand and quickly did \"fairy work\" with it.\n\nJoseph Ward - Gr. V.\n\nGift Exchange\nOn Dec. 22nd, the members of the Good Counsel Club had their gift exchange like in the years gone by. What fun! What surprise! But also - what anxiety for fear someone would play a dreadful trick \"all wrapped up in tissue paper and tied up with ribbon\". Our class president, Tommy Pon, dressed as Santa and gave out the presents, which we had to open before the class. We were all pleased over our gifts.\n\nFrances Willcox - Gr. VI.\n\nMINI-MISS\nAfter attending Midnight Mass in Edmonton several times, it makes a great difference to be in Grouard for that beautiful forest. Dec. 24th at 11:15 P.M. we were welcomed by singing and music. I was told that the Sisters of the Mission were playing \"angels\" that night and singing \"Glory to God\".\n\nLike the shepherds of old, we went out in the darkness and cold to go to church, but there it was bright and warm and crowded. People, mostly Indians for and near, came to enjoy the beautiful ceremonies. We had solemn High Mass by three priests. After a light lunch we went back to bed until late in the morning.\n\nHelen Berard - Gr. V.\n\nTHE CONCERT\nWe had our Christmas concert Dec. 28th. It was a very nice one too. We had one song play \"Christ Cradle\", where a poor little boy was seeking for a home. He found one with a poor but charitable family. All enjoyed the pantomime of \"Sleep, Holy Babe\", in which the Blessed Mother rocked the baby Jesus to sleep.\n\nJenny Legrand - Gr. VI.\n\nA WONDERFUL TREE\nA Christmas tree loaded with gifts during these hard times? Who gave the one hundred twenty parcels? It was the kind girls of Yakima who have been sending boxes every year to Sister Jean Placidus. This year, Sister was so kind to let us have them as usual though she has another \"flock\" to look after now. Thank you, dear Sister Jane, for your special thanks to the girls for your generosity.\n\nA special word of thanks to Mr. Hill from his proteges, for he too helped to lend the Christmas Tree, and spread happiness around.\n\nDoris Chalifoux - Gr. VI.\nIn a letter from Sr. Philothoe, Principal of St. Joseph's, Yakima, Wash., the message following, speaks volumes,\n\n\"You are most welcome for all. It has been a labor of real love for the girls and the Sisters, and we are only too happy to be able to do some little tangible act for our beloved Missionary Sisters of the North. The children really love to do it and they believe would be very much upset if they were not allowed this privilege.\"\n\nCould the dear Sisters and pupils of St. Joseph's see the happy faces of their little Northers when they receive their gifts, they would surely feel a thrill of great joy, for these poor children certainly appreciate the favor of being \"Yakima Specials.\"\n\nCHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS\n\nWe had them from Dec. 23rd till Jan. 3rd, and quite a number of us spent this jolly time in bed with the \"flu.\" So, no general outing like usual, no sleigh ride, no \"old pupils' reunion,\" but you were not forgotten! \"Old Times\" for a Mass was said for your intentions, asking God to bless every day of 1944 for you all.\n\nMerry Christmas - Gr. V.\n\nA WELCOME VISITOR\n\nMr. Demers, has replaced Mr. L'Houmoir, as Indian Agent for the Northers part of Alberta. He took up his new duties in October 1943. Mr. Demers must have been very busy with his new work, for his first visit to our Mission was only on Jan. 12th. We were glad to make his acquaintance. He visited every department of the school but stayed a little longer in the class rooms. Our agent was interested in our \"bonding work,\" which was going on that afternoon and we were proud to show him our bright colored work.\n\nHis first gift to us was a holiday for the sorrow. To our thanks, we added three cheers. We'll be looking forward to your next visit, Mr. Demers.\n\nRosie Shott - Gr. VI.\n\nCOMING AND GOING\n\nSome new pupils came to Ground, Helen Borden from Edmonton, who brought her little sister Gertrude and her baby brother Tommy with her. Billy and Michael Hyres came from Eureka River, and two little people came back who were here last year: Kind and Elmer S. man. Of course, Joe was very glad when he saw them again. Agnes and Eliza Crofton came from afar to join our ranks. To all those who wish us well and are glad to have them with us, but we were sorry to lose the Cunningham girls who went back to Rust after the holidays. We would be glad to have you back again.\n\nLouise Fraser - Gr. V.\n\nWE PLAY BINGO\n\nThe pupils of Class III gave a Bingo Party to raise money for their Holy Childhood Fees. Thanks to the generous cooperation of all, they made enough to pay their fees and those of Class IV, and of all the baby boys and girls who do not attend school. Classes I and II paid their own fees and we have a membership of 130. Thirty-eight pagan babies have been ransomed since the association was begun in 1941.\n\nDOWN OUR NAY\n\nScid the music to the rock,\n\"Aren't they ever coming back?\"\nSaid the ceiling to the floor,\n\"Guess we'll have to wait some more\",\nSaid the blotter to the ink,\n\"Toll me now, what do you think?\"\nSaid the ink unto the blotter,\n\"Each day grows a little hotter,\"\nSaid the window to the bill,\n\"Well, I think I've heard my fill!\"\nSaid the dollar to the bill,\n\"What a long and rugged hill!\"\nSaid the mountain to the ridge,\n\"Funny how another bridge.\"\nFrom its height you cast a glance,\nAt the stream called \"Circumstance\".\n\"Obstacle Bridge\" 'tis called you know -\n\"We build and cross as ON WE GO.\"\n**THE BOYS' HALL**\n\nFifty-five big and small boys give the salute as they come before you. We are all happy and healthy except our dear Jimmy Collins who has been at the High Prairie Hospital since October. Michael Willier, from Briftpile, is a deaf and dumb boy but, you can't get anything on him, for he seems to get everything. Six little boys are too young to go to school so they \"split\" the day between eating, sleeping, and playing.\n\nTommy Pon Ying - Gr. VII\n\nTalk about Winter fun!\n\nSkating on our nice rink every chance we get is fun! We had a grand hockey game last Sunday. Coasting down the hill is great too. Some of the Brothers have enjoyed this sport with us more than once.\n\nWe had one real good sleigh ride this winter. You should have seen two bob-sleighs full of happy boys supervised by our hall keeper; Sister Denise Lucille.\n\nJoe Sawan - Gr. VI.\n\n**TURKEY DINNERS**\n\nYes, two real big turkeys came from Edmonton to Tommy Pon from his grandfather. He was so glad to invite some Fathers, Brothers, and big boys for two big dinners in the boys' hall. Thank you Tommy, it was very kind of you, also of your grandfather to send you such a nice Christmas gift.\n\nTommy Laboucane - Gr. VI.\n\nThe latest news about Jimmy Collins is that, slowly and peacefully this brave lad is nearing the top of the hill - where he will meet His Lord Face to Face.\n\nManly, gentle and quiet, best describes Jimmy - he has always been most grateful for the care bestowed on him, and the letters and visits he received were greatly appreciated.\n\n**THE GIRLS' HALL**\n\nThis year we have sixty-five girls in our hall. Five little ones do not go to school. Elsie Andrews is 15 years old but found class work too difficult so she helps in the hall with the sewing machine work. Emma Miller is our deaf and dumb girl who also helps us let around the house. She is able to do nearly everything we do except school work. Less fortunate is Sere Desjardins for she is blind, though not deaf or dumb. Sister duguy, a foundress of this school and who came fifty years ago is trying to teach Sere how to knit stockings and braid carpets. Our youngest little girl, not yet three years old, came from Ft. Nelson with her two sisters after Christmas.\n\n**WHAT A SLEIGH RIDE!**\n\nOn Jan.13, making good use of our Indian Agent's, Mr. Demers, Holiday, we had a wonderful sleigh ride. The boys used the teams first and then it was our turn. Sr. Clare Eve went with some while Sr. Jean Leon had most of the little ones with her. It was a good thing, for the sleigh wouldn't stand a heavy load for after a quarter mile the wheels came apart leaving us all out on the snow. No one was hurt. Our teammates went home for another sleigh but our ride ended in a hay field, with lots of fun, a little cold, and no harm to anyone.\n\n**BINGO! BINGO!**\n\nDuring the holidays we had two bingo parties, one boys and girls together, the other boys alone. The Fathers and Sisters came to see us play and some even joined the game. This fun had been organized by Rev. Frs. Lachance and Potvin and Brothers Paquet and Tremblay.\n\nNice prizes were given and plenty of pleasure and fun besides.\n\nNellie LePretre - Gr.VII.\nO, Grouard was built for glory,\nGrouard was built for fame,\nAnd the master hand that built it,\nShall himself its worth proclaim.\n\nLong he toiled here before us,\nBorn with patience, trial and pain.\nIn labor, prayer and exhortation,\nSpent himself for others' gain.\n\nAs the future rose before him,\nHe beheld with vision bright,\nGreater days and greater conflicts,\nFilled with shadow, woe, and fright\u2014\n\nDid his brave heart quail before it,\nDid his spirit sink and die,\nDid he say\u2014\"I cannot do it;\nOf what use is it to try?\"\n\nHis was courage of the valiant,\nHis a spirit of heavenly fire\u2014\nAnd he bravely struggled onward\nTo the heights of his desire.\n\nHis great soul passed on to glory,\nBut his spirit grand and true,\nRemains to cheer and guide us,\n'Tis his work we have to do.\n\nYears have come and gone since Grouard\nFirst was built upon a hill,\nBut the man of mighty purpose\nLeads us on and always will.\n\nMany noble souls have answered\nTo his call and spent their best,\nIn labor, prayer and suffering\nKnowing God will do the rest.\n\nAs the legion grows in number\nAnd other tasks appear,\nValiant hearts take up the challenge\nCarry on through doubt and fear.\n\nThough the task at times seems hopeless,\nAnd dark shadows veil the sun,\n'Tis God's work lies here before us,\nSHALL WE PALTER 'ERE IT'S DONE?\n\nOnward, upward! On to glory,\nTo eternal heights we climb,\nGod, Himself, will crown our efforts,\nFor the glory of His Name!\nTRAINING SCHOOL\n\nWEAVING\n\nOur weaving studio is becoming quite an attraction. When the Reverend Fathers of the surrounding missions and other visitors come to Grouard, they are interested to see our large loom in operation. When Rev. Fr. Hugonnet came, he could not resist the temptation of trying a few throws of the shuttle and was so surprised to see two noodles instead of one go down together under the width of his shoes! No wonder why Almo Maskinok and Amio Collin have not had their pictures taken yet, with the patterns they have for themselves.\n\n#########\n\nThe Hospital at High Prairie must be very attractive. Thoreso MacDonald and Paulino Tain went there before Christmas. Thoreso had to return again in January. Our dear Sr. Bustacho of Rome spent several weeks there in January. She is at home now convalescing. We surely met her cheerful smile at the Home Centre.\n\nOUR CHRISTMAS\n\nMolbo Cordinal who had been working for Mr. and Mrs. Stoholin since last June, helped to make our festivities very joyful by coming to spend the holidays with us. It must have been sad to part with them as she says they treated her as one of the family.\n\nMid-Night Mass.\n\nWhile some were attending the old, yet always new ceremony of Midnight Mass at Grouard, Almo Maskinok, Thoreso Nolan, Rose Ann Klymowosow and Thoreso Jacob accompanied by our teacher, Sister Margaret Mary went to sing at the three Masses said in the church at Enilda. We considered it a great privilege to have been chosen as little Apostles to celebrate the Birthday of the Christ-Child. Rev. Fr. Potvin who officiated there, had a delicious hot lunch served to us at the Hotel after the three Masses. We arrived home at 4:30 A.M. and we did not have to be lulled to sleep after the long ride in the open air. Believe me! we did not get up at 6 o'clock either!\n\nGIFT EXCHANGE\n\nDid you hear our shouts of joy when we walked into our parlor and discovered the beautifully decorated tree loaded with useful gifts? There were even surprises for Molbo Cordinal, Janet Clarko, Annie Thomas, Flore Andrew and Mary Edith Gladus. Molbo and Molbo always want to sleep in now because they got nice milk nightshirts. Margaret Cordinal keeps our clocks regulated since she has a wrist watch, and does she like it? We're watching a nice day to take Pauline's picture with her lovely work basket, but we must not touch it. Yvonne is always wanting to go skating to show us her red ski socks.\n\nAnd\n\nThen\n\nComes\n\nOur\n\nNew\n\nYour's\n\nDinner!\n\nIt was a great honor for us on New Year's day to have kind Fr. Superior Molbo, Annie Thomas and Janet take dinner with us in our home centre. We were anxiously looking forward to hearing our dear Bishop come also, but his ill health deprived us of that happiness. We hope it will not be too long before it will be given us the pleasure of serving him his favorite dish of pancakes. Sister Superior spent the rest of the evening with us while we played games and music and had a very pleasant time.\n\n#########\n\n\"Beautiful hands do this that do y'work; that is a must, brave an' true, meant by moment the long day through.\"\nMy dear Old Pupils:\n\nI had been waiting anxiously for this opportunity of greeting you all\u2014and now that I've been reminded that it is time\u2014I have a sort of helpless feeling which comes from wanting to say so much, and being able to express so little of the sentiments that well up in my heart as I think of you. Could I only make you feel a small part of the joy your many letters, gifts and other remembrances have given me! THANK YOU seems such a weak commonplace word to say for all your loving thoughts of me.\n\nFirst in my \"Litany\" of thanks was that wonderful week-end visit, shortly before Christmas, of my two OLD FAITHFULS, Annie Thomas and Janet Clarke. I love you to imagine how dear to my heart such a visit was... That they should off Ground to good advantage will please, but not surprise you! Then came Christmas, bringing a real overflow of the most beautiful proofs of your affection and appreciation from far and near; from England, Italy, Sicily, India, and from every part of Canada. Remember Pollyanna and her \"Glad Guru\"? I feel as she did, when she was ill, and from every one she had ever known, it seemed, came letters to help her play her own \"Glad Game\". Old friends from whom I hadn't heard for \"many moons\" suddenly came to life on hearing of my transfer, and keep telling me things that go straight to the heart. And so I thank you, each and every one, and ask God to bless you for it all.\n\nI trust you will not be too disappointed over finding no letters from the Old Pupils, following this page, as in the past. Will you understand, if I say that there are some things that are too precious to be shared with the public? Maybe I am happy to read because I know the loyalty with which they are written, might not be so well understood were I to allow them to be printed. So? Do not grieve, however, OUR TEACHER will surely find some way of sharing with you the news who receives from your old school pals.\n\nSplendid long letters from our boys Overseas assure me that all is still well with them, and that they are hopeful that Peace will soon descend upon our war-torn world, permitting them to return to their dear ones. Each one assures me that it's not a mere 150 miles that will prevent them from coming to Fairview... and each one asks to be remembered to the OLD TIMERS!\n\nJimmy Thomas, still flat on his back in the Shuswapsoy Military Hospital in Vancouver B.C., would appreciate hearing from old pals, I think. He is better, but it may be a long time before he is able to walk again. Another who would be cheered by a letter from old school friends, is Mary Jane Smithson, now Mrs. John Boring, at St. Joseph's Hospital, Dawson Creek, B.C., where she has been, unable to talk, for 4 months... I hope to tell you more about your other old friends soon. Until then, keep on climbing, though the rocks be rugged, and when you turn, be sure you always turn to the RIGHT! Then, my dears, you'll be sure to find you way HOME where I hope one day to call the Roll and to find that all have been faithful, and so may enjoy that eternal \"Old Pupils' Reunion\". Keep your eyes on that goal\u2014and the climb will seem less hard!\n\nMay God bless this New Year and grant it may bring us all closer to Him\u2014and to one another! And now I say.....

I'm lucky to have such a chance to have a chat with you; even if it is on paper.\n\nAmong them all, we're sadly missing out boys in khaki who are now mostly all overseas, and even some in actual combat. For these brave lads, and all old-timers I'm sure God receives your fervent and motherly prayers. So we all know we are never forgotten by you and, neither you, by us all. Jim Andrew is another who has received his call to the army and will, no doubt, be donning a uniform.\n\nSome who aren't so remote were here during the holiday season. Delphine Chalifoux and Louise St. Arnaud returned to Edmonton to their jobs; Nellie Cardinal (Ghostkeeper) and Louis Cardinal, her husband with their two little boys were also visitors. Mary Cardinal returned with them to work in a cafe in Ft. St. John. Alvina stopped in for a short chat and gave me the news that John Califer is a proud daddy of a baby girl. We are sorry to their news Florence MacKay is seriously ill in Ft. St. John Hospital where she had been working for quite a while. Claire Gladu (Louboucan) is now Mrs. Narcisse Legrand and still lives in the old place. Yvonne Cardinal had been very ill but is now well and enjoying health once again. Despite her illness, she hasn't lost her shy smile ?? Our dear, old Louise Laird (Calison) is bravely carrying on like a good soldier after the death of her dad. Johnny Norris is home once again, and Ironto still facing life, laughing. You should see young baby Bolanger, she's really cute, and Anne and Simone have reason to be proud of their baby daughter. Sure resembles her Uncle Leo and no foolin' \u2014 Wonder of the cuteness is for that reason??!!\n\nThe boys I saw were Michael McDonnell, Charles McLeod, William Brunello, Alexie and Jennie Cardinal; the latter returned to Ft. St. John.\n\nI've recently heard from big brother Harry who is well and studying quite hard. Nancy still likes her training very much and sounds real professional. I'm glad to let you in on the glad news that Jim is now doing nicely and expects to be back on his feet before long. Oh! I mustn't forget to tell you - sister and discarded her brides for a new hair doll ?? She really looks grown up now; wait till you see for yourself. Janet, Viole, and Melba are now her companions as they too work for Fr. Forendo.\n\nNow at the closing, I wish to say that from them all, I heard the most familiar and sad words, \"Wish Sister Joan were here.\" So in their names, and all other old-timers far and wide, we lovingly say au revoir and God bless you.\n\nSincerely,\nMarguerite.\n\nThank you, Marguerite for your kind response to my appeal for an \"Old Timer's New Page\".

I am certain it will be of interest to Sr. Joan and the absent Club Members now so widely scattered through the world.\n\nThe \"Ground Echoes\" has ever been the trusty messenger between the Good Counsel Club Members of the Present and those of the Past thru the medium of \"Our Teacher\" \u2014 as another \"Co-operative venture\" we have carried the work through this year.\n\n\"So where ever you may be, at Home or at Sea,\nDown on the earth or up in the air,\nGood Counsel Club Members everywhere,\nKeep Onward and Upward, 'til we all meet Up There.\"\n\nThe Editor\nLIFE'S CANVAS\n\nSunshine and shadow and laughter and tears,\nThese are forever the points of the years,\nSplashed on the canvas of life day by day.\nSo are the painters, the colors are they.\nSo are the painters, the pigments we use.\nNow, we're wholly permitted to choose.\nGrief with its gray tint and joy with its red,\nCome from Life's tubes to be blended and spread.\n\nHere at the easel, the brushes at hand,\nEach for a time is permitted to stand,\nWhite was the canvas when first we began,\nReady to picture the lifetime of man.\nNow we are splashing the colors about,\nKnowing the rods and the gold must give out.\nSoon we must turn to the dull hues and gray\nPainting the sorrows that darken the way.\n\nNow with the sunshine, and now with the shade,\nSlowly but surely the picture is made.\nEven the gray tints with beauty may glow,\nReckoning the joys of the lost long ago!\nLet me not doubt it with doubt and despair,\nDoors that are heavy, unkind and unfair,\nBut when the last bit of pigment is dried,\nLet me look back at my canvas with pride.\n\nLet me, when trouble is mine to portray\nDip, with good courage, my brush in the gray,\nAfter the tears and the grief let there be,\nSomething of beauty for others to see.\nLord, let no pain not in anger or hate,\nGrant me the patience to work and to wait,\nMake me an artist, though humble my style,\nAnd let my Life's canvas show something worth while!\n\nMy Literature students will likely recognize this. Don't you think it would be well to study and meditate on it also? There is so much truth in it for all of us! Come, let us make our life's picture beautiful in the sight of God and men!\n\nSister John Placidus.\nGROUARD ECHOES\n\n\"Climb, though the rocks be rugged\"\nAs we come to the end of another year of vigorous endeavour, our hearts are filled with happy gratitude as we read over the list of names which we have on our pages of benefactors. To all those who have helped in any way to make the GROUARD ECHOES what it now is, we wish to say a very heartfelt and sincere THANK YOU. Without your words of encouragement, and without your financial assistance, we could not have carried on as we have done. It has been a joy to know that our pages were eagerly awaited and read by so many... and we hope to start off from where we left off, next September.\n\nA very special word of gratitude is due to the following friends for some substantial donations since the last issue:\n\nDoctor and Mrs. T. Wood .. High Prairie.\nMrs. Harry Tremblay .. Edmonton, Alta.\nMr. and Mrs. J. English .. Faust, Alberta.\nRev. Father Boucage .. McLennan, Alta.\nMr. Paul Fovargue .. Culp, Alberta.\nMr. Fred Doll .. Froideventch.\"\n\nLast June, we were bidding farewell to our much-loved Superior, Sister Michael Archangel, and bidding welcome to Sister Gonzales who was to replace her. The same emotions must be gone through again this June, as our dear Sister Gonzales has given her resignation owing to her continued ill-health.\n\nThough we are very sad at the thought of losing her after such a short while with us, we are happy that her state of health is improving, though it does not permit her to be an active duty for at least another year. We wish to assure our former Superior, Sister Gonzales, that though we had the privilege of being under her wise guidance only a few months, that we shall not soon forget her. Her memory will long be cherished by all who had the privilege of being her \"children\".... big and small.\n\n\"THE KING IS DEAD ... LONG LIVE THE KING!\" This is what we are reminded of, because, on the heels of the news that our Superior had resigned her office, came the news that we have a new Superior in the person of SISTER MARY LAURE!\n\nIt is not hard to find words of sincere welcome for Sister Mary Laure, as she spent many years here as Mistress of the Girls' Hall. All her old girls will be happy indeed to know that they are to greet their old friend again, as the Superior.\n\nSo, to our new Superior: Welcome to Grouard, and best wishes for your happiness in your new work.\n\nAt any hour, at any moment now, we are awaiting the sound of the church bells, pealing out the glad tidings of the arrival of our beloved Bishop, Monseigneur LANGELOIS, who has returned to the North. We are so happy to know our Bishop is really cured, and that after a rest period, he will again resume full charge of his affairs.\n\nFor this great happiness, we exclaim over and over, \"Praise the Lord! Thanks be to Thee, dear GOD!\"\nHere's Fr. Beaucage!\n\nOne evening, as we were coming from Dramatics, we looked out, and then do you think we saw? Well, it was our old friend and teacher, Father Beaucage. My, it was nice to see him, even if we didn't get to talk to him then. The next morning, he visited the classroom, and as our store is in the school basement, he couldn't leave without at least paying us a little visit. He looked at the moosehide work, and he even tried on a beaded coat which seemed to have been made especially for him.\n\nMy Companion\n\nAs Fr. Forand was printing the Groo Hymn Book, he needed someone to help him at that job. So Nora Cardinal was the one chosen for the task. She is a very good helper, and does she ever keep me company? Now, I'm happy because I've got someone to \"chow the rag\" with!\n\nHi Virginia!\n\nAnother \"old timer\" suddenly showed up one morning. She came all the way from Ft. St. John, with Sr. Marguerite of Charity and Mrs. McFarlane. This is our old friend, Virginia Calliou. Virginia is almost completely deaf now, but she reads lips so well, that we can make her understand everything we say. She was so very glad to see all her old friends again. She was glad to bring back Florence Noskowi to work at the hospital with her.\n\nAn Angelic Member!\n\nI had a big thrill the other day when I held a tiny new Club Member while the waters of Baptism were poured on his head. This was the wee little son of Mary Louise and Myles McDermott. My god-child's name is Myles Arthur Raymond. I'm sure he'll be a WONDER CHILD!!\n\nBright Lights\n\nWhen Father Forand went to the city to get the little truck he had bought, he decided to bring me along. Oh, oh! Was I ever excited? Luckily generous Father Beauchamp was around and he accepted to replace me as clerk in the store.\n\nMrs. Tremblay was returning to Edmonton after her visit in Grouard, so we made the trip together. And I stayed with her and Madam Morrier in their apartments. They treated me like a queen. I surely appreciated all the kindness received.\n\nMy, I felt lost when we arrived in town! (This was my first visit to a big city.) If it hadn't been for Father and Mrs. Tremblay, I don't know what I'd have done! Did I ever open my eyes wide...and they stayed open all the time I was there, for at every place we went, there was something new to look at.\n\nI did a great deal of buying for the Co-operative. That was a good experience for me. I met many wonderful people, saw Jeannette McDonald and Nelson Eddy in two pictures....and had so many thrills.\n\nBut when the car was ready, and we started for home, how happy I was! The city is grand....but I don't like its noise and rush. Grouard is the place for me, for as everyone says, \"Home sweet Home is BEST!\"\n\nOld-Timer ANNIE THOMAS.\nVictory Garden\n\nWe have some flower beds near the school where we usually grow only flowers. But this year, we are doing our bit for our country, so we have put in a VICTORY GARDEN. It isn't very big, but it will have radishes, onions and tomatoes. There will also be a border of Sweet-Peas and Astors near the well. I seeded the Astors so I am anxious to see them come up. Sr. Denise Lucille put in the sweet-peas for us while Sr. Jenn was sick at the hospital. We hope to get a bite of the vegetables before we go home for holidays.\n\nJoo Sawn...Gr. V.\n\nOh, Honey!\n\nBUZZ! BUZZ! Hear the bees? They got here last Monday. They looked like hunks of raisins stuck together. There are eight hives of them: 2 for Fr. Superior, 1 for Mr. Lafrenze, 3 for the Co-Operative, and two for us which Fr. Forcade bought, so we could study them and sell our own. They are in the Fathers' garden as there are lots of flowers there. We don't go too close for fear of getting stung on the nose\u2014then we'd go cross-eyed looking at it! Hope the honey will make some of the girls sweet.... 'cause they're pretty sour.\n\nPhilip Fraser\u2014Leonard Ward.\n\nScrub Day\n\nOne rainy day, we did our classroom Spring cleaning. First we scrubbed out our desks, washing away each little ink spot, and then came the GREAT job of washing our ceiling and walls. BOY! Did that change the room! It looks like a new ceiling and wall now. I wish my little face could be washed like that. Maybe it would take even the frockles off! I think we feel better now that the cleaning is off our minds.\n\nThere is only the floor that needs oiling now, then the room will be spic and span for the holidays.\n\nLoo Hogue\u2014Grade V.\n\nSchool Activities\n\nMeet Baby Fox!\n\nWhile we were doing our cleaning, Sister Joan said that if we were real smart, she would take us to see the baby fox that Sr. Margaret has at the Homo Centre. Didn't we hurry?\n\nNellie and Alino brought the little fox outside so we could all pet him. Is he ever cute? He is about three months old, but is still quite small. His big bushy tail is about a foot long. He seemed afraid of us and would have run away if he could have. He is such a cute pet. Everyone will be sorry when he goes back to his real master.\n\nAlbert Ward\u2014Gr. V.\n\nBusy Days\n\nSister Edward taught Marjorie Tellmon how to make paper flowers; so now, while the other girls sew, Marjorie makes flowers. They go well with the baskets the boys are always making.\n\nAnd in between all these interesting things we do, and the pleasant outings, there's plenty of hard studying to do, for don't forget... FINAL EXAMS come very soon. Brrrr! I go to sleep and dream I didn't pass.... I'm mighty glad when the morning bell rings and proves it was all\u2014just a dream!\n\nLucy Amato\u2014Grade V.\nYOUTH TRAINING\n\nA HAPPY \"BAND\"\n\nOne night, all the Band members were invited to a party in the Bingo Hall. And since it was a Band party, we brought our instruments along and played several selections. The famous piano accordion was there, of course, and Father Mahou very generously pumped away at it. We wanted to hear TEDDY BEARS PICNIC, but Father didn't know it, so he pumped the bollocks and Sr. Joan played the melody. It was the first Accordion \"DUET\" we had ever heard, and everyone had a good laugh over it.\n\nBingo!\n\nWe then had a very interesting BINGO game. Father Potvin had arranged many prizes, and when we'd win a game, we could have a choice of prizes. There were sacks of taffy that were most popular, so that each one could really be sweet. Lunch came along then, and before we were ready for such a grand meal, we were told it was time for all good children to be in bed. So we went, but not before thanking Fr. Mahou and Fr. Potvin for a very pleasant evening.\n\nSCHOLA PARTY\n\nWhenever there is some extra singing to do, it is always the SCHOLA who gets the job, so we were not a bit surprised when we were called one night to practice for the next morning. It was to be the anniversary of the Episcopal Consecration of His Excellency, Bishop Guy who was still here. So we practiced the hymns for the Mass we were to sing the next day.\n\nFun\u2014\n\nThen, we were given slips of paper to play games. It was funny to hear how things turned out. The best part was when we were all invited downstairs with our cups. Some made coffee, others toasted bread, and others buttered the toast. Finally, the whole HAPPY GANG sat down to a fine lunch.\n\nA little bird told us the SCHOLA will soon have another treat...but it is to be a surprise, so we don't know what it will be. So...we're waiting! Lucy A.\n\nSpring\n\nSince June is here, we are not doing our regular work in Gymnastics any more, but we are preparing for a Festival. In between times, you are always sure to see somebody playing Baseball. Long walks and outings are in style too. Tom Pan\n\nLAST OF THE MOHICANS\n\nWe have studied in detail of all that concerns Indian Life this year. To finish off our study, came the picture show, \"LAST OF THE MOHICANS.\" This gave us a good idea of what Indian warfare was like in the early days. We are all glad we didn't live in those bloody days.\n\nJimmie C.\n\nFESTIVAL (Continued)\n\nD.- Comedy Playlets.\n\nThe Pic\nSr. Bonigna\nSr. Claire Eva\nPoor Joe\nFr.

Limon.\nC.Y.O.\n\nOur Queen\n\nOn the last Sunday in May, there was a very nice crowning of the true May Queen, our own dear Mother Mary! Those who had made their First Holy Communion at Easter had the privilege of crowning the Blessed Mother. Nellie Leproto read the Act of Consecration. Corporal Jennie Legrand.\n\nCourt of Honor Party\n\nEach time the Officers spoke of the party to be held in honor of those who had been decorated at the last Court of Honor, everyone said, \"Let's have a HARD TIME PARTY!\" And so we did!\n\nWhen the Fathers and Sisters came to see the Dress Parade, all the children followed Sister Denise and Sr. Mambrose so that the house was just full. How funny it was to see all the silly outfits! Tommy Pon Ying got first prize. He must have been tired when he got his things off. He and Janet had to do the French Minuet together after. They were a queer looking couple of Commanding Officers!\n\nThe funniest game played was \"THE CHAIR OF HUMILITY.\" We laughed so much over this game and the forfeits that followed! Fr. Forcade gave the penalty.\n\n(continued at top of next column)\n\nToot! Toot!\n\nWhen Father Forcade brought the new C.Y.O. truck home, there was lots of excitement. It is made like an ambulance, is painted black, and on each side, it is printed in silver, \"C.Y.O., Grouard, Alberta.\"\n\nMore power to you, little truck!\n\nParty (cont.)\n\nDoris had to go and beg five cents from Fr. Mahou. Was her face red!\n\nThen, instead of a regular lunch, the HOBOS had to go and ask Sister Jean for a hand-out. We got some surprises too!\n\nWe decided we could stand a party like that about twice a week!\n\nJimmy Colin - Roland Gaboury.\n\nBeans! Beans!\n\n\"PICNIC TIME FOR TEDDY-BEAR!\"\n\nOnly the Teddy-Bears last week were the C.Y.O. Officers. It was a big surprise...the first thing we knew, instead of going to dinner with the others, there we were riding away in Fr. Forcade's new C.Y.O. car...\n\nWhen we got to the nicest spot near the lake, we had the best Pork and Beans dinner you'd ever want to taste...thanks to Sister Proxode. Cake and oranges finished up the meal.\n\nAfter a good walk around, Father gave us chocolate bars and gum.\n\nTo avoid making a second trip, the boys agreed to walk home. They wanted to race, so Sr. Jean said she'd give them some gum if they got home before we did. They took a short cut and when we drove up to the school, there were the boys, panting on the steps! Sister said they surely deserved their gum....\n\nI think we enjoyed this OFFICERS' Dinner best of all. The Officers thank Fr. Forcade and Sister Jean for it.\n\nDoris Chulifoux, Corporal.\nHERE AND THERE\n\nFOLLOW THE LEADER!\n\nFollow the Leader, with perfect trust,\nFollow the Leader, that we must,\nIf we would scale the mountain high,\nWe must follow the Leader, you and I.\n\nOUR BISHOPS.\nOur saintly Bishops number five,\nTwo of them are still alive\u2014\nTo these men of high renown\nWe owe the fame of Ground town.\nThey blazed the trail with zealous hand,\nAnd brought salvation to this land.\nThey urge us ONWARD in the right,\nThey urge us UPWARD to the light.\nThey bid us climb with courage till\nWe reach the summit of Life's hill.\n\nOUR PRIESTS.\nBefore God's altar, every day,\nFor us they kneel, to bleed and pray,\nThat God may keep us in the right,\nAnd make us victors in the fight.\nThat we may conquer vice and sin,\nAnd every foe that lurks within.\nThey lead us ONWARD as they climb\nAnd UPWARD to new heights sublime.\n\nOUR BROTHERS.\nIn toil that praise will never pay,\nThey pass their lives from day to day,\nLending us a helping hand\nWhile teaching us to understand\nThat every duty that's well done\nIs just another victory won.\nONWARD, UPWARD, do they go,\nTheir lives a light, the way to show.\n\nOUR SISTERS.\nFor us they labour in class and hall,\nWithout them we could not do at all.\nThey cook and they sew, they wash and they mend,\nThe Sisters' work seems never to end.\nFrom early morn to set of the sun,\nOne task is finished, another begun.\nMother and sister and teacher in one,\nBlessings will follow the work they have done.\n\nSo, follow the Leader, with perfect trust,\nFollow the Leader, that we must!\nFor Christ is our Leader, Christ our King,\nTo Him our love and service we bring.\n\n(Sister Mary Stella, F.C.S.P.)\nHear Ye! Hear Ye!\n\nLast year at this time, we were all thinking of and preparing for our big FIELD D.Y CELEBRATION. This year, all you hear about is the FESTIVAL! This big event will take place on June 15th and 16th. Don't miss it!\n\nOriginality\n\nOur Grouard Festival will be different from other Festivals. Usually, many schools or classes take part and compete for the awards. This festival of ours is JUST ours... but there will be different groups with different teachers. Almost half of the Mission Staff is teaching and coaching different items. It is a lot of fun to have all those different teachers.\n\nAdjudicator\n\nThe different groups will perform and then their performance will be judged immediately. I think there will be about three ADJUDICATORS (judges). If His Excellency, Bishop Langelois is here then, he will be asked to be Adjudicator for the Music; Father Forcado will judge the Dramatics, and Sister Joan, the Folk Dancing.\n\nThis is the PROGRAMME:\n\n1. MUSIC\n   A - Solos\n   1. They Pick on ME (Song)\n      Sr. Eustache - Coach\n      Sr. M. Ambroso \"\n      Fr. Mohou \"\n   2. Pickin' Inny BoBo\n      Fr. Mohou Coach\n      Sr. M.

It seems they know just when to pop in too. They surely take us by surprise sometimes...keeps us on our toes!\n\nMeet our friend!\n\nGuess who came from Edmonton with Fr. Forcado? Mrs. Trombley, the wife of our L.A. Representative! And isn't she the grand person! She made herself right at home with us, sleeping in our infirmary and making life quite gay for all. We will always keep a fond remembrance of her.\n\nBefore Mrs. Trombley left, she bought each of us a souvenir to remember her by. And that's not all. When she arrived in Edmonton she sent Sr. Margaret Mary a nice lace tablecloth for the parlor, and some doilies.\n\nHonoring our Guest\n\nOne night while Mrs. Trombley was here, we spent a grand musical evening together. Some of the Fathers sang, and Fr. Mahou kept things lively with his accordion and his funny songs. Everyone enjoyed hearing his favorite, \"Clementine.\" Mrs. Trombley surely laughed!\n\nA Stitch in Time.....\n\nMr. Stohlin, our School Inspector, honored our HOME CENTRE with a short visit. On his way, he ripped his coat sleeve, and I was the one who had the privilege of sewing it for him. Besides the honor, I got a generous tip for my sewing!\n\nMcLennan Visitors\n\nReverend Fathers Boulet and Beausoleil from McLennan have also come to visit our famous new Home Centre. They seemed very well pleased with our work and encouraged us to keep on. Now, we are looking to the great day that will bring our dear Bishop Langlois here to see what has become of their former refectory, now all transformed into our new Home.\n\nFrom the North...\n\nOther visitors here were Sr. Margaret of Charity of Ft. St. John, and her sister, Mrs. Douglas McFarlane, R.M. of Beaver Lodge. They sprung a big surprise on their cousin, Sr. Margaret Mary. Both are splendid musicians, so that meant good music for us. They were both so nice to us, we all wanted to go back with them to Ft. St. John. The lucky one to go was Florence Muskeyi.\n\nA \"Jacket\" Party\n\nSr. Denise Lucille's sister, Sr. Louis, who left Joussard for Peace River where she is now the Superior, came for a visit. She came to our house to see the 86 jackets we made for the Joussard boys.\n\nSr. Margaret gave a party of rejoicing the night those jackets were finished. There was joy......for more reasons than one!\n\nA Fox in a Box!!\n\nWho wants to see a real live baby fox? Everyone is welcome\u2014or WAS, rather! We had all sorts of visitors in to see the cute fox we had here a few days. But we had something else up our sleeve too: Before the visitors would go, we'd make them give us a tip for our baby box! We're reasoning pagan babies, and our ransom elevator is right behind the door, so could catch many. Fr. Giroux gave us a dollar, but he shook his fist at us before he went out. We knew him, though, so we knew it was all in fun! He wouldn't box our ears!\n\nNORA CARDINAL\nNEWS BITS\n\nYou just ought to have seen our Father Superior and Father Potvin go after that refectory roof. First, they shingled it, then they painted it. It is a nice deep green now and looks quite fancy and fresh.\n\nAt last, the long-desired fence has come into being, and now Sister Denise Lucille will no longer have to worry about stray dogs, horses and cows who were always too interested in her flower bed. Special credit goes to Roland Goboury and Philip Fraser for making it.\n\nExtending its policy of \"A GOOD TURN\" to the neighbor, the C.Y.O. has now a truck-car that serves as an ambulance.... a much needed improvement in this remote district.\n\nLike the C.Y.O. itself, we believe that the car will bring happiness in the lives of many, for besides its services for the sick, the C.Y.O. car goes on many joyous errands too.\n\nHave you ever wondered who those two Nuns are who work early and late, in the Sisters' Garden? It's Sister Mirocilla and Sister Duguy.... and from the looks of things, there will be wonderful things in that patch.\n\nRecent visitors to Edmonton were SISTER LAURIAN and SISTER MARY ADELINE. They enjoyed city life for several days but they say, like good country mice, they were glad to get back here.\n\nIt's Examination Time! That's the season when teachers find out all sorts of surprising things.... such as:\n- A blizzard is found inside a chicken!\n- The vowels are something inside a man's stomach!\n- A dimple is a bump inside out!\n- Storm is water gone crazy with the heat....\n\nA snooze is when a tickle explodes! And perhaps the most sincere definition of all is this one: ETC. That's a sign used to make the teacher believe you know more than you do !!!!!\n\nIs Sister Jean going to Seattle? That is the question we have been asking for several weeks. If the Passport arrives today or tomorrow, Sister will go. Anyway, you will know by the writing on your Echoes address. If you do not recognize her writing, you may write to her at PROVIDENCE HOSPITAL, SEATTLE, WASHINGTON during the summer. She will attend Seattle College there.\n\nOne of the pleasures we are looking forward to is a visit from MOTHER PROVINCIAL and her Secretary. They are at Jeussard now, so we hope to see them very soon. We liked Mother and Sister Achille very much last year.\n\nSister EGEBERT, our Directoress of Studies, is to come here soon too to visit the class. We are anxious to see you, Sister Egbert; you are an old and dear friend of our parents who remember you as the best teacher they ever had.\n\nJimmy Thomas passed through on his way to Edmonton last night. We hope to see Jimmy here in Grouard soon.\nOld Pupils' Corner\n\nMy dear OLD TIMERS;\n\n'Tis the merry month of June, and hearts are all astir (that rhymes, doesn't it?) to the glad song of Vacation! Yes, in just a little while, all my Birdies will fly away to greener pastures. I suppose I should be very happy too\u2014but somehow, there is always a sort of sadness connected with the end of the school year.... or at least, I have always felt that way. I should not mind so much were I only parting with my pupils for the two months of the holidays, but with my Senior pupils, there is always the pain of parting for good with some who do not return. And just as I loved you, my old pupils, and would fain have kept you under my wing for many years more, so I say Goodbye to those who are to return no more with a catch in my voice and an ache in my heart....... May Our Lady of Good Counsel watch over them all, and help them to live up to their ideals, being indeed their Counsellor, sincere and true.\n\nAnd now for a few news flashes of our old pupils.\n\nNancy Thomas is doing wonderfully well in her Nurse's career, according to word received from Bishop Guy who saw Nancy on his recent stop in Cranbrook. He said those in charge consider her a born nurse, and say that she is very well liked by the staff and patients. Bravo, Nan! Your letters sound very professional, and we are glad you are making such a success of everything.\n\nYou should see Hazel and Doctor Wood's little son, Arthur! He has the most marvellous smile, and is so very friendly.... I enjoyed a very pleasant visit at their home a few weeks ago. Hazel told me Jennie is studying to be a Technician at the General Hospital in Edmonton, and Ruth, having finished her Business course is at home for a while. She will soon be working in the Office at High Prairie.....\n\nCharlie White surprised me with a letter recently. He had just come home from \"Up North.\" I quote his promise: \"I may be leaving soon again, but I'll try and go 'DOWN YONDER' and see YOUSE.\"!!!!!\n\nAgathe Cardinal McLoughlin writes that her little son Gilo, now almost nine months old, is wonderfully well and happy. She promises a photo of him soon.\n\nThe Grouard men are gradually coming home from the Yukon. Johnny Norris is determined to stay up there for some time yet, and get a good stake. So is Willie Hemlin. Thoro cheers, brave men! Others have gone to Fort St. John to earn big money working for the Yankees up there. John Giroux just returned from there a few days ago, as full of tricks as ever. You might be interested in knowing that John and Brother Cunningham are salesman for a special brand of ORANGES. You might be interested, for they even do SPECIAL DELIVERY on their wares! Ask them for details.....\n\nAnd now, my dears, Au Revoir! I trust that after the holidays, we shall meet again through these pages, which will be better and better as time goes on. In the meantime, be good, be loyal, and don't forget to pray for us.\n\nYour loving \"old\" Teacher,\n\nSister Jean Plaisance\nDear Sister Jean:\n\nI was most pleased to receive your very interesting letter and the ECHOES. Believe me, Sister, I read each bit contentedly. In fact I read it backwards! Ah, that sounds exaggerated, does it not? I'll leave it up to you to guess why I start at the back.....\n\nI'm in fine health now this find you and your pupils the same. Like it exceptionally well over here. In a few days time, I'll be spending my third leave. I have had the pleasure of seeing Scotland and Wales, so I suppose I must be prepared for a long speech when I go back to visit your classroom. But how my voice quivers when I face an audience!\n\nIt's nice to hear so many of the ex-pupils are writing to you faithfully. Once again, thanking you for the Echoes. May God bless you, dear Sister.\n\nFrom your ex-pupil,\nEdward McLeod.\n\nMy dear Edward;\n\nYour Airgraph reassured me as to your well-being. When I haven't had news from my boys Overseas for some time, I begin wondering what has happened. So, thank you for writing.\n\nYour dear old Grandmother comes here every week to do her shopping. When we meet, we smile our sweetest, and she laughs outright at my Groo! That's one of the things I'm going to enjoy in Heaven; when I can sit down and have a real talk with all these dear old ladies.\n\nI love so much, but cannot talk with because of language handicap. Anyway, in the meantime, Granny and I both send you our love and wishes.\n\nS.J.P.\n\nDear Sister Jean and pupils;\n\nI have just received your son mail dated 27-12-43. Thanks ever so much, also for the beautiful picture; I think it is lovely. I trust you have received my Xmas card by this time.\n\nThere is one friend you will always have, Sister, I shall never forget you as long as I am on this earth, for all you have done for us while we were at the Mission. Those were the days!\n\nA bit of advice to you, pupils! You are in the best part of your lives at the Mission. I remember when I used to say I wish I was finished school, but I did not realize then what it was doing to me. You realize that only when you go out into the world and see for yourself. So while you are there, make the best of everything. Anyway, I am very proud to be a pupil of St. Bernard's, and I shall not let the Mission down.\n\nChoirio, and God bless and protect you all. Au Revoir!\n\nOne who never forgets,\nGeorge Fovargue.\n\nDear Laddie,\n\nIf all my pupils were other George Fovargues, I should never grow old nor weary!!\n\nYour beautiful sentiments\nin the foregoing Airgraph show that you have not changed at all. God bless your grateful heart, dear Georgia, and make it happy in the thought that wherever you go, loving hearts follow you with prayers for your safety and happiness.\n\nI heard from Don not long ago and he was rejoicing in having heard from you. Your kind Dad writes me occasionally to share some of the letters from the dear \"lads\".... We are all looking forward to the day when you will bring Eileen and Baby Pauline home! Until then, keep up your courage and your splendid spirit, and rely on our prayers...\n\nS.J.P.\n\nAtikomog, Alberta.\nMay 15, 1943.\n\nDear Teacher:\n\nAt last, news from your old TOPSY! I guess you thought I was dead, oh? I'm not! I often think of you and wish I was back in your classroom doing Arithmetic... My babies are fine and fat. I often wish I had a baby girl. If I ever have one, I will name her after you.\n\nWe might go over to Grouard sometime this summer. My husband would like to work at the Mission. Dear Sister, please send me news of Grouard. I'm dying to hear about you and all the old pupils. Don't forget your old Topsy, and thank the Sisters a thousand times for all the trouble they took to bring me up. God bless you and your pupils.\n\nYour former pupil,\nMabel Noskoyi Yollowknoc.\n\nDear Mabel,\n\nI knew all the old timers would smile happily at news from you, so I hope you will not mind seeing your letter in print. It will remind everyone of all the mischief you used to get into... and who doesn't feel better after a good laugh?\n\nYou have received my letter by this time, I'm sure, so you know that you are never forgotten by your old teacher.\n\nS.J.P.\n\n---\n\nColgury, Alberta.\nMay 7, 1943.\n\nDearest Sister Jean,\n\nI got home safely, but not too glad to be here, for you know the old saying, \"NO PLACE LIKE HOME.\"\n\nNow, Mother, let us as well confess, now that I am far away, that I am married. Please forgive me; I know I should have told you before.\n\nYes at last, Sister Jean, I have found my mate. She is just my type, and I love her just like I love our old Mission. Won't it be grand some day when I come to see you and say, \"Meet my wife.\"\n\nI am sending you a picture of myself and wife.....\n\nBest regards and wishes to all at the Mission and a big Hello to Fr. Forcado for the wife and I. Hoping to hear from you very soon.\n\nMuch love to you from\nJohnny and Jean Bourgeois.\n\n---\n\nDear Johnny,\n\nTo say your letter was a surprise, is stating it mildly! I remember your telling me, the day we were walking out to the cemetery on Club Day, that you had a great deal to tell me about that topic, but we were not able to continue our conversation, so you had to write me the glad news.\n\nOf course, I am glad you are married, Johnny, and I offer you my sincerest congratulations. Please tell Jean I wish her all the happiness in the world. Thank you for the pictures... now, send me some large ones so I may put them up with all the other OLD-TIMERS. I will write you and Jean soon... in the meantime, best wishes!\n\nS.J.P.\n\n---\n\nIt may seem strange to our readers, that most of these letters are from the old boys. May I explain that the girls write just as faithfully, but their letters are usually too personal to be reproduced for the public.\n\nS.J.P.\nTHE PUPILS OF\nST.

MODESTE DEMERS,\nFIRST BISHOP OF VANCOUVER ISLAND\n\nSt. Catherine's School was blessed by His Excellency, the Most Rev. John C. Cody, Bishop of Victoria, on April 15, 1940. He was assisted by the Rev. M. Lemmens, S.M.I., and other members of the clergy.\n\nThe event linked past with present, for, on the same day, Jubilee celebrations were being held at St. Ann's School for Boys commemorating the seventy-fifth anniversary of the opening there of the first school for natives on Vancouver Island.\n\nIn keeping with the double nature of the happy occasion, the children of St. Catherine's attended the Mass of Thanksgiving at St. Ann's and, in the afternoon, with many of their parents, were proud and happy to welcome their beloved Bishop on his first visit to their new school.\n\nCANADA FOREVER\n\nGod bless our mighty forest land\nOf mountain lake and river:\nThy loyal sons from strand to strand\nSing \"Canada for ever.\"\nST. CATHERINE'S REVIEW\n\nFEBRUARY - MARCH\n1945\n\nEDITOR - Ramona Underwood\nASSISTANT-EDITOR - Doug Williams\nARTISTS - Norman Lee\nDoug Williams\nJanie Underwood\nViolet James Louise Underwood\nFrancis George Evelyn Wilson\n\nNEWS-REPORTERS - All of us\n\nOUR SCHOOL\n\nST. CATHERINE'S CONSOLIDATED INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\nDUNCAN, B.C.\n\nOpened January 8, 1940\n\nSCHOOL COLORS: BLUE AND WHITE\nSCHOOL PATRONESSSES:\nKATERI TEK-NITHA &\nSAINT CATHERINE OF SIENNA\nKATERI TEKAKWITHA\n\nOnce there was a little Indian girl whose name was Tekakwitha. When she was a baby, she lived with her father and mother in a village far away in grand and beautiful woods beside a pretty river. Her mother wrapped her in a pretty blanket so that one could see only her sweet brown face and her two black eyes, like beads. She had two red feathers sewed to the top of her warm blanket for a cap. Tied to a cradle-board she had her afternoon nap swinging from a tree while her mother worked near.\n\nThere was no church in the village where Tekakwitha was born. No Mass, no Tabernacles, no Stations, and these Indians knew nothing about the good God. Yes, there was one that knew, and that was Tekakwitha's mother. When she was a little girl at Three Rivers some holy priests told her about God and taught her to pray. She wanted Tekakwitha to be baptized, but before she could manage it all the family fell sick and both her mother and father died.\n\nTekakwitha grew to be a big girl. She wore her hair in two long black braids and she had a band of wampum round her forehead. One day Blackrobe came to the village. \"We are priests called Jesuits,\" they said, and we have come to tell you about God, and about His Son Jesus, and about Heaven.\" Tekakwitha was very happy and wanted to give her heart to God, but her uncle was angry and did not want her to learn to pray.\n\nTEKAKWITHA'S CROSS. Tekakwitha went into the forest by the river. The sky was blue through the trees and she could hear the water laughing over the rapids. All else was quite still. Indians are always silent in the forest, - they listen... listen... She was still too, she was praying about Our Lord on the Cross, and thinking over the things the Blackrobe had said about Him.\n\nShe saw a beautiful birch-tree growing close to the water. Its bark was pure white. She went up to it and spoke to it.\n\n\"Little birch-tree, little birch-tree,\" she said, \"will you give yourself to be a pure white cross for Jesus?\"\n\nThe little birch-tree rustled its leaves gently in the sunshine to mean,\n\n\"Yes I will give myself to be a pure white cross for Jesus.\"\n\nShe cut down the little tree and made two sticks. These she tied together with the band of wampum from her forehead to make a cross. She dug a hole in the ground and planted it upright. It was a lovely white cross.\n\nThen she looked in the deep, soft moss under the hemlock trees and found red bunch-berries smiling up to her from their green leaf collars. They looked like red blood.\n\n\"Little berries, little red berries,\" she said, \"will you give your red blood to love Jesus.\"\n\nShe gathered a beautiful red garland of them and placed them at the feet of the white cross.\n\nThen she spoke to herself and said, \"Tekakwitha, the white birch tree gave itself to be a pure white cross for Jesus, the bunch-berries gave their red blood to love Jesus. Will Tekakwitha give herself to be a pure white cross for Jesus? Will she give herself to be a garland of love for Jesus?\"\n\nAnd so Kateri Tekakwitha lived a holy Christian life and soon we shall call her SAINT KATERI, the patroness of our school.\nSEPTEMBER 6 School opened today and we have no water. The pump is broken again. Very few pupils are back from the hop-fields. Mrs. Vallee Thornton visited St. Catherine's to take notes on the work of the Indian children.\n\nSEPTEMBER 12 Miss Edwards and her mother from Seattle visited the school. They were very interested in everything.\n\nSEPTEMBER 15 Reverend Mother Mary Mildred, from Victoria, called at the school for a few minutes.\n\nSEPTEMBER 21 Our visitors today were Mr. and Mrs. Nesbitt from Oliver, B.C. Some Sisters from Victoria were with them.\n\nOCTOBER 11 The school nurse came here and put the T.B. pads on our backs. Boy, it got itchy on the place where the pad was placed.\n\nOCTOBER 13 We boys of St. Catherine's played softball against St. Ann's boys. WE WON. Sister Superior of St. Ann's School gave us all a treat of doughnuts. WASN'T THAT GOOD!\n\nOCTOBER 16 Dr. and Mrs. Barclay, from the Indian T.B. Hospital at Sardis, came and gave us a picture show on tuberculosis germs and the treatment for a person to get rid of the disease.\n\nOCTOBER 17 A boy named Bernard Joe broke his wrist while playing at recess.\n\nOCTOBER 24 Miss Jones, the travelling clinic nurse, took X-Ray pictures of the children of St. Catherine's and the Koksilah School.\n\nOCTOBER 30 The manual training room got a Stanley rabbit-plane and were we glad. We are doing some classy work with it.\n\nNOVEMBER 2 The whole school attended Mass to pray for the souls in purgatory, particularly for the Indian people.\n\nWe are writing letters to our Principal, Sister Mary Sheila, who has been replaced for a few months by Sister Mary Bernice. We want to show her how well we can write letters and to tell her that we are learning every day.\n\nNOVEMBER 20 The bus time changed for the winter months. School will open at nine-thirty.\nNOVEMBER 21 Father Lemmons replaced Father Seguin to teach our catechism on Tuesday and Thursday mornings, because Father Seguin went for a holiday trip to the East.\n\nNOVEMBER 24 The feast day of our school is November 25th, Saint Catherine of Sienna's day, but this year it came on Saturday so we had our ice cream party on Friday instead. St. Catherine of Sienna is our patron saint only until St. Kateri Tekakwitha is canonized.\n\nNOVEMBER 27 Julia Joe, one of the first pupils of St. Catherine's became the bride of Dominic Thomas and came to visit us after the wedding.\n\nNOVEMBER 28 The bridge at Clemclemuts had to be repaired so the school bus had to go the other way by Duncan.\n\nDECEMBER 13 The Sisters and the boys of St Ann's School came to the dress rehearsal of our concert.\n\nDECEMBER 19 Our concert went off very nicely. The children all did their best. Everybody said they liked it. We had some special guests from Kuper Island Indian School.\n\nDECEMBER 21 The Christmas holidays begin today. Each child received a bag of candy and popcorn, an orange and an apple on the Christmas tree.\n\nJANUARY 3 School again. The holidays are all over. We are glad to welcome our principal, Sister Mary Sheila.\n\nJANUARY 23 The school bus can go back on the other road now. The bridge has been fixed.\n\nFEBRUARY 7 It rained so hard, and the river got so high that the bus came at 2:00 o'clock to take us home.\n\nFEBRUARY 8 Sister Mary Dorothea visited our school today. She visits all the schools taught by the Sisters of St. Ann. She was very interested in our school paper. She said we were learning to read and spell and do arithmetic very well.\n\nFEBRUARY 12 Dr. Wm. Pfenderleith, our school inspector, inspected our school today.\n\nFEBRUARY 14 This is Ash Wednesday. All the pupils went to Mass and received the blessed ashes so that we might begin Lent in the right way.\n\nFEBRUARY 16 We gave in all our notes and our drawings for St. Catherine's Review today. Now we are waiting to see our paper finished. We hope you will like it.\n\nWe thank Reverend Mother Mildred, Provincial Superior of the Sisters of St. Ann, for helping us to get out this paper by supplying stencils, ink and mimeograph paper.\n\nWe are going to send copies of our paper to His Excellency, Most Reverend John C. Cody, our bishop who lives in Victoria, to Reverend Father Bradley, Supervisor of the Indian Missions, and to all those who are interested in our school.\nEVEN THE PRIMARY CLASS\n\nEven the beginners in the primary class, some of whom spoke Indian only in September, want to have their names in the school paper. These are their little sentences:\n\nA YELLOW BUS takes us to school and takes us home. - Bernard Joe -\n\nWE START SCHOOL at 9:30 in the morning. - Bernard George -\n\nI LIKE SCHOOL. - Johnny Underwood -\n\nI CAN READ MY BOOK. - Beatrice Johnny -\n\nI HAVE A NUMBER BOOK TO SHOW MAMA. - Jean Jack -\n\nWE HAVE LUNCH AT NOONTIME. - Modeste Henry -\n\nWe listen to the Singing Lady. - Sam Henry -\n\nI WORK HARD AT SCHOOL. - Gus Joe -\n\nI CAN ADD AND TAKE AWAY. - Elmer James -\n\nI can write well. - Ida James -\n\nI am in Grade I. - Marie Alphonse -\n\nI CAN READ. - Jerry Jack -\n\nOur teacher's name is Sister M. Walter.\n\nKateri Tekakwitha\n\nO Mohawk maiden, your proud race\nHas won a storied fame,\nBut brightest on its pictured page\nIs the glory of your name.\n\nIn forest aisles, by snowy shrines\nYour memory lives and glows\nWith lily radiance, whose light\nOutshines the ruddy rose.\n\nDear dark-eyed daughter of the land,\nIn heaven let your voice\nPlead for the journeying souls\nWho know\nYour virtues and rejoice.\n\n- Sister Maura -\n\nLittle Kateri plants a white birch cross and offers her garland of blood-red bunchberries in token of her love for Jesus.\n\n- Grade VII Reader -\nNOTES FROM THE JUNIOR CLASS ROOM\n\nGRADES II AND III\n\nOur school is called St. Catherine's School. We pray to St. Catherine every day to help us to be good and to learn. There are four classrooms in our school. Grade I has a classroom. They have forty-six little desks. There are five windows in the room and six big lights. The primary room faces the front of the school. The children learn to read, write, spell, do number work and say their prayers. They sing too. We sit just across the hall from them and we hear them. Many of them could not speak English when they started to school in September.\n\nWe are called the Junior Class - Grades II and III. I like our room best. We learn to do many things.\n\n- Lorraine Charlie -\n\nDid you ever visit our school? It is very nice to see. You come along the road on the Cowichan Reserve, look at the white house. That is our Indian School. There is a Thunderbird above the door. It was made and painted by one of the boys. We have a shop in our school. That is where the boys learn to make things out of wood. They are pretty smart too.\n\nThe girls have a room called the sewing room. They learn how to make dresses. They make sweaters too. When I go into the Senior Class I will make a dress for myself.\n\n- Allee Modest -\n\nWe have a school for ourselves. There are three Sisters teaching in our school. Our teacher teaches Grades II and III. She goes also to teach the Senior Class how to make dresses and cook. There are five grades in the Senior room. While they are learning to sew or to cook, their Sister comes to teach us.\n\nI like to come to school. I never missed one day yet since September. I hope I won't get sick. Sister gave us some games to play with when it is raining.\n\nThere is a very nice kitchen in our school. There are four nice tables for the big girls to learn cooking. The stove is cream and black. Mr. Morrison is putting up some nice cupboards along the wall.\n\n- Cecilia Charlie -\n\nWhen we have a concert we open the folding doors between our room and the sewing room. Our parents and friends sit in our classroom. We use the sewing room for the stage. The boys have made screens to use on the stage.\n\nThe lunch-room is next to the kitchen. We have cocoa or soup every day. Sometimes the big girls make pancakes or bread pudding and apple pudding. We all have some. We sit on benches. We have drop-tables around the wall of the lunchroom.\n\nAcross from the lunch-room is the boys' playroom; next to it is the boys' workshop.\n\nI think our school is nice, don't you? I hope we always have this school. I love my school. I love my teachers. They teach us lots of things.\n\n- Virginia Pierre -\n\nI come from Khenipson Reserve. I have to walk a long way to get to the bus to come to school. Sometimes the dykes are flooded and we cannot go to school. Then we are sad. The dykes did not flood yet. I hope they don't.\n\nKhenipson is a small reserve. That is why we have no chief.\n\n- Edith Page -\nOUR DRESS PARADE\n\nSt. Catherine's School is lucky to own three Singer sewing machines which are very seldom idle when we girls get going on our dresses.\n\nWe like to look nice, so we are learning how. The cheapest way, we are taught, and the best, is to buy material and make your own things.\n\nOur teacher gets different kinds of dress materials and patterns for us. We are allowed to choose what we want, and with a little help, we do pretty well. The dress parade begins when the choice is made and the pattern is in our hands.\n\nThe cloth is spread out straight on the table. The pattern is laid and then pinned in place and we are ready for the big step - the cutting. We really get frightened when we first put the big shears to the material.\n\nWe do not find it hard to put our dresses together for we are taught to follow our lay-out. Finally when we get everything together then the machines begin. We like to watch one another's dresses growing from day to day.\n\nWe are fitted up with an electric iron. The ironing board was set up by the senior boys. They also made our cutting tables and our benches.\n\nSome of the girls are able to finish two dresses besides having a little time for knitting and fancy-work.\n\nWe do not take our dresses with us when school closes in June. We work during the summer months at berry-picking and hop-picking. When we return in the Fall we are pretty rich. We then buy the dress that we made, and from that money Sister buys more material to keep our DRESS PARADE going.\n\n- Janie Underwood -\n\nWE ENTERTAIN OURSELVES As Hallows'een was on Saturday we had our party and games on Friday afternoon. We had all kinds of games. Some of us played Donkey, Feeding them blindfolded, and ducking for apples. Believe it or not, there were pennies and nickels in the apples.\n\nAfter the games, the girls of the cooking class served pancakes. - Virginia James -\nWOOL-WORK AT ST CATHERINE'S SCHOOL\n\nHave you ever washed wool? Come to our school and we'll show you how.\n\nFirst: buy the fleece from St. Ann's Farm. They have very good wool there. Second: take the fleece outside and get a couple of boys with good muscles to shake and shake it until all the loose dirt, sticks and burrs are removed. Third: get a large tub of cold water and plunge the fleece in it. This water will have to be changed many times as it will look like mud at first. Fourth: get another tub and fill it with soft warm soapy water - Oxydol is the thing - and put the fleece into it. The wool is now ready to be washed by hand.\n\nEach girl gets a basin, goes to the tub, gets a little wool and some water, finds a comfortable place, and tries to get her amount of wool the whitest. The girls have great fun racing. The wool is then rinsed well in warm water. When it is all washed, we each take our basin of snow - because we, the pupils of St. Catherine's wash wool until it looks like snow - and spread it out on the grass, and ask the sun to make it whiter - if it can. Sometimes the rain helps too.\n\nWhen the wool is dry it is taken to our sewing room where big, little and small boys and girls, spend many happy moments teasing - not one another - but teasing and carding our well-washed wool to the tune of some well-known song. The next step is the spinning, and the long rolls of snow-white fleece are changed into yarn.\n\nThe wool is then taken off the spool and put into skeins for another washing to loosen the spinning. When this is dry the wool is wound into balls and is ready for knitting the Indian sweaters which is the trade on the Cowichan reserve. We have knitted some beautiful sweaters and socks and have won prizes.\n\nWe are now trying our hand at finer spinning and will use two strand yarn to make knitted articles of all kinds. In this way the wool industry is growing in St. Catherine's.\n\n- Helen Canute -\n\nACHIEVEMENTS AND PRIZES\n\nWe are glad to say that we sent some of the boys' wood work and the girls' sewing and knitting to the Montreal Exhibition last year. The boys won a cash of $5.00 and Madeline Charlie won a personal prize of $2.00 for an Indian sweater. For three years we have sent samples of our work to the Victoria Indian Exhibition and the people seemed to like it.\n\nAlfrida Thorne, Ramona Underwood, Douglas Williams and Leonard Peters won the Gold Seal Certificate of Merit for the promotion of Humane Education, for their poster on the prevention of cruelty to animals. Ramona Underwood also received honours for her booklet that was sent to the T.B. Contest at Sardis.\n\nDo you not think we have been doing good work?\n\n- Louise Underwood -\nAPPLE PIE IN THE COOKING CLASS\n\nWe have tried our hand at many things\u2014cookies, cakes, buns, puddings, and pancakes a few times, and we did enjoy them. But APPLE PIE did you say? Yes, we made that too, but what happened?\n\n\"Girls, if you would like to make apple pie bring some apples tomorrow, about six each will do.\"\n\n\"Yes, Sister.\"\n\n- Next day -\n\"We shall go to the kitchen after recess to make apple pie. Bring your apples down. Work two together.\"\n\nSister goes down after recess.\n\nVirginia, the thoughtful little pie-maker brought apples but we had forgotten ours! OH! OH! We could not even go down to the kitchen. Sister helps Virginia and what a grand apple pie comes out of the oven just as we girls are going down to serve the lunch. Are we ashamed and sorry? Are we going to miss making apple pie and the chance of letting our parents see what fine cooks we are going to be? Not us.\n\n-A remark loud enough for our teacher to hear -\n\nRita: Are you going to bring apples tomorrow, Ramona?\nRamona: I guess so.\nGirls: We all are. We are not going to be cheated out of apple pie.\nRita: What will Sister say?\nJanie: Don't worry. She'll give in and help us. Won't you Sister?\n\nThe next day every girl brings a dozen apples. We do not need a second invitation to go to the kitchen, and soon apple pie making is in full swing. Virginia is Sister's assistant. To be sure each girl gets her own pie our teacher suggests that we put our initials on our pie.\n\nAt three o'clock there is a scramble for the first-bus girls to claim their pies, and every girl of the senior class goes home with the fruit of her labour, the proud possessor of an APPLE PIE. Every one was at school next day. The apple pie was not half bad.\n\n-Louise Underwood-\n\nWHICH WILL YOU HAVE?\n\nA NOTE OF THANKS\n\nOur thanks go to Miss Edwards, a September visitor from Seattle, for her interest in our school\u2014candy, goodies, popping corn for our Christmas parcels, carving tools and magazines for the boys' department, needlecraft books and all kinds of sewing helps for the sewing room, all have come from her kindness and generosity.\n\nMr. A. Moran also helped fill our parcel with the candy he so kindly donated\u2014not do we forget Mr. Morrison's apples for the same occasion.\n\nMrs. Kyle of Duncan comes in for a goodly share of our thanks for letting us use his bus when we went to see \"Going My Way.\" The children enjoyed this very much.\n\n-Ramona Underwood-\nOUR PROGRAMME IN THE HOME\n\nECONOMICS DEPARTMENT\n\nWe have a programme put out by the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa. It covers a three-year course in knitting, sewing, housekeeping and cooking. When we have completed one year in any subject our teacher sends our names to the Department and we receive a badge. We are very happy to receive these badges because they tell us that we are learning. Many of the girls have received their badges already.\n\nFIRST YEAR: Marjorie Modest, Alfreda Thoms, Josephine Canuto, Ramona Underwood, Evelyn Tommy. They have badges for sewing, cooking, knitting and housekeeping.\n\nSECOND YEAR: Alfreda Thoms, Ramona Underwood and Evelyn Tommy for knitting and sewing. Many other names have been sent in but we have not received the badges yet. One thing that holds so many back is that the girls must be twelve years old before they can apply for a badge.\n\nI hope by the time we finish school we shall have received all our badges. The one pictured is for knitting. Each badge has a picture on it to show what it is given for.\n\nI think they are pretty, don't you?\n\n- Evelyn Wilson -\n\nWe are working hard again this year at our T.B. booklet. We hope to win a prize. If we have time we are going to do some more animal posters. We are working too for the Exhibition at St. Ann's in Victoria.\n\n- Rita Page -\n\nOUR CHRISTMAS CONCERT\n\nWe would like to tell you about our Christmas concert because everybody liked it. It was on December 19th that we had our concert. Some parents and relatives of the children, and the Sisters and Fathers from Kuper Island, and other guests came. They all liked our school concert. We are glad that we did well.\n\nOur program opened with O CANADA and a song of welcome. We had drills and dances and two little playlets. We then sang Christmas carols.\n\nThe children sang the carols so well that at the closing Father Lammons asked if we could sing for him at Mass on Christmas morning. We were there to sing at Mass and he was glad to have us sing for the Baby Jesus, and we did well.\n\nWe closed school on December 21st and we enjoyed our holidays very much.\n\n- Violet James -\n\nFIRST HOLY COMMUNION\n\nSome of the boys and girls are to receive their First Holy Communion in our church at Duncan during the month of May. We do not know yet who they will be. May Our Lady always look after those who prepare well for her Son.\n\nI come from Somenos. I have three sisters in school. My brother is only four years old. They call me\n\nAudrey Underwood.\nOUR WOODWORK SHOP\n\nWHEN THE SCHOOL FIRST OPENED\n\nWe had only some old benches and a few tools which we used in the big play room at manual training period. We were not able to do very much. Then we divided the play room to make a real workshop. The Department gave us more tools each year and all the boys helped fix the workshop. Now we are very proud of it, and are learning to use all the fine tools that have been got for us.\n\n-Norman Joe-\n\nTHE MANUAL TRAINING ROOM IS A BUSY PLACE\n\nWhen we all got to work, each boy is doing something he wants to do and now that we can handle all our tools pretty well we are surprised at the things we can make. Our teacher makes us want to do our best so that we are ashamed of poor work. Everything that has been finished is here for you to see. When I leave school there will be the big painted thunderbird still hanging on the sewing room wall to remind other boys that I spent many hours making it. It takes time and patience to do good work.\n\n-Alloc James-\n\nTHE BOYS IN THE MANUAL TRAINING ROOM HAVE LEARNED\n\nto paint designs on the things they make. It takes a steady hand to make fine lines. We sure know that. We use our own Indian designs and choose our colours. We made a large trellis painted with birds and fish. This trellis is on the outside of the school for a rose bush.\n\nWe painted the game boards. Francis George made wall-racks to hold them. I made two carved picture frames for Sister Mary Eugenia, the last one framed needlepoint which the girls had done. Dennis is making and painting a wood-packer door-knocker to hang on the senior classroom door. You just pull a chain and the bird pecks at the door. I am going to make one for the Junior Classroom as soon as I finish the bench I am doing now.\n\n-Roy George-\n\nWHEN WE FIRST STARTED WOODWORK\n\nWe thought that all we had to do was hack things out and nail them up, but we have learned to plan and make a drawing for each thing we are to make. Visitors are surprised at the way we have fixed up the workshop and we hardly believe we have made all the things that we have. We won a $5.00 cash prize at the Montreal Exhibition and the boys voted this money to be used to help pay for the Stanley No. 55 plane for which we have long been waiting. It will be a gift for the school and those who come after us.\n\n-Douglas Williams-\n\nI WAS A JUNIOR LAST YEAR\n\nand learned how to use many of the tools. We learned how to make paper knives and book stands and paint them with Indian designs.\n\nThe seniors spent most of their time building racks for the new tools which the Department sent us. Everything is in its place. Leonard Peter framed the blackboards and made shelves for our lunch boxes. Douglas Williams and Eugene Thorne made racks to hold the saws, chisels, etc. Norman Joe put up a display board and shelf between the windows then he painted the big thunderbird to hang over it.\n\n-Dennis Alphonso-\nWE HELPED MR. MORRISON, our teacher, to build a workshop using half of our big playroom. We put down a wooden floor over the old concrete and built a wall. When this was done we made over the old rickety benches putting in new vises, then we planed the tops clean and gave them two coats of stain and varnish. We did not know much about it all at first, but learned how to use the tools and get things done.\n\n- Ernest Alphonse -\n\nTHE DEPARTMENT GIVES US A LIST OF THINGS WE MUST DO\n\nto do each year in the workshop. When we have done the work for each year we get a badge from Ottawa. Douglas, Francis, Eugene and I got the first year badge and our names have gone in for the second year badge now.\n\nThe senior boys made tables for the classrooms. One of the first things I made was a long bench for the sewing room. Eugene and Douglas made wonderful polished tables for the classrooms. Eugene Thorne painted a big Thunderbird design over the outside of the front door. It looks great from the road and is seen by everybody.\n\n-Kenneth Williams -\n\nTHE GROUNDS WERE COVERED WITH TREE STUMPS when the school was first opened. The Department had these pulled out and the ground was ploughed. The senior boys with Mr. Corcoran, put up the swings and seesaws and laid plank walks to keep us from sinking to our ankles in the mud.\n\nIn the spring we made a garden. When we came back in the Fall we had potatoes, carrots and other vegetables to eat. We like to eat raw carrots and the girls made stew for us some times using the potatoes and vegetables.\n\n-Francis George -\n\nMORE NOTES FROM GRADES II AND III\n\nSt. Catharine's is a nice school. Indian boys and girls go to it. A big green and orange bus brings us to school. The bus leaves Somosos at 8 o'clock (in summer time) and picks up the children along the road. We get to school at 8:15. Sister is waiting for us. We go to study our lessons until the second bus comes. The bus goes to Koksilah with the teacher and the Indian children that go to that school. The bus picks up more children for St. Catherine's on the way back and arrives with the second load at 8:45. Then we take our ranks and march upstairs. We sing a song and then go to our rooms. I like our school.\n\n-Ruby Alphonse -\n\nI like our school too, but sometimes I lose my coat and miss the bus. I have to walk home then.\n\n-Theresa Alphonse -\n\nI live at Clamclamutz. I ride in the bus to school. Sometimes the river is a flood and I cannot get out of my house. The school is nice and warm when we go in. Come and see our school.\n\n-Amelia Tommy -\n\nI come from Khenipsen. I do not like to miss the bus. I do not like a long walk when it is wet and cold. I do not miss school only when I am sick. I have two brothers and three sisters. We go to St. Catharine's School. My big brother is too old to go. My baby brother is too little yet.\n\n-Sarah Page -\nSTARS FOR THE WISE\n\nThe children who are wise enough to come to school every day and learn, get stars. This is how it works. If we do good work we get a red star. If the work is not so good, we get a green star. If it is bad, we get no star. When we have five green stars on the classroom chart we can have a red star posted on the bulletin in the corridor, and when we win five red stars we can get a gold star. You should see the number of gold stars on our bulletin! Spelling, Arithmetic, Reading, Language, oral and written, Geography, History, Health, drawing and singing, all count.\n\nWe even get stars for ranks. For five stars for good ranks we may win a silver star. Just watch us march up and down our stairs.\n\n-Roy George-\n\nJOY AND SADNESS\n\nFor some time our teachers have been telling us about Reverend Mother General, the head of the Sisters of St. Ann. Reverend Mother has planned to visit all the schools here in the west. She has never seen ours. We have been looking forward to seeing this good Mother who gave us teachers when our school was opened in 1940, hoping that she would come while we were in school.\n\nNow our teachers ask us to say a very special prayer for dear Reverend Mother for she is ill. We promise our prayers and we know our dear Lord, His Mother and Good St. Ann are going to see to it that our prayers are answered and we shall see Reverend Mother this year.\n\n-Margaret Rose Charlie-\n\nWe pray for our deceased school-mates\n\nAlverne James Norma George\nRaymond George Elsie Jim\nViolet George Fred George\nHerman Joe\nAudrey Tommy Francois Wilson\n\n-By Helen Canute-\n\nREVEREND FATHER BRADLEY, Supervisor of Indian Missions on Vancouver Island has visited St. Catherine's School once. He is coming to see us soon again.\nTHE CORPUS CHRISTI PROCESSION\n\nEvery year we have the Corpus Christi Procession, the second Sunday in May, which is a big day for the Indians. Many people from all over Vancouver Island come to the Tzouhalem Indian Church for the High Mass. The Indians sing in the choir. After the Mass Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament is carried in procession to St. Ann's School where Benediction is given, and then back to the church, with singing and hymns all the way. Spring flowers and blossoms look their prettiest; daffodils and tulips are in their best to do honour to their Creator.\n\nThe Sisters have an altar on their front porch. The Bishop gives Benediction. The high mountains and the tall green trees seem to listen and bow down in adoration. Then we all walk back to the church.\n\nFor many years boat races at Cowichan Bay followed the ceremony at Tzouhalem, but lately everybody goes to Duncan to watch the sports. Last year it rained in the afternoon so we had our sports on the 24th of May.\n\nWe are anxious for the procession to come this year. - Alec James -\n\nFIELD DAY\n\nMike Underwood, Chuck Thorne with some other Indians arrange games for us on Field Day. They are lots of fun. The winners get money for prizes. Last year after the races, Duncan and Saanich played a game of softball. Duncan won. - Alec James -\n\nTHE BOYS' PLAY PERIOD AT SCHOOL\n\nOn rainy days at school we cannot go outside to play games so we try RING TOSS, CARDS or CHINESE CHECKERS. The boys like ring toss best. In the summer we like baseball. During the winter, when the pond beside the school is frozen, we like to play ice hockey. This winter we were able to play for about two weeks.\n\nWe are now waiting for spring. The senior boys will then start to practice up again on baseball. The juniors will be at their marbles. - Douglas Williams -\nA MARCH TO MUSIC - AND SALUTE THE FLAG\n\nEvery morning to the music of the gramophone, the children march upstairs to the landing by the classrooms. We sing the hymn salute the Flag which hangs over the entry, and then we sing, \"God Save the King!\"\n\nWe then march to music to our classrooms and start the day's work feeling very good. We march to music as we go up and downstairs, six times each day. We are getting to be like real soldiers. Do you want to come and see us do it? We'll be well trained when we join the army.\n\n--Evelyn Tommy--\n\nOUR LUNCH ROOM AT NOON-TIME\n\nLunch time is a busy time. We girls serve the hot cocoa prepared in the Domestic Science room every day. Would you like to know the names of the girls who do this work? Well here they are:\n\nMonday: Ramona and Janie Underwood\nTuesday: Josephine and Helen Canute\nWednesday: Rena Williams and Evelyn Wilson\nThursday: Evelyn Tom and Rita Page\nFriday: Rita George and Nora Henry.\n\nThese girls prepare and serve the cocoa and also wash the dishes.\n\nMonday: Sarah Ryan and Lillian Ryan\nTuesday: Edith and Sarah Page\nWednesday: Virginia Pierre and Madeline Tommy\nThursday: Alice Nodest and Cecilia Henry\nFriday: Bernice Johnnie and Maria Wilson\n\nThese girls wash the tables and keep the lunchroom tidy and clean.\n\nWe have some spare tires too. They are Louise Underwood and Amelia Tommy, Theresa, Ruby, Catherine, Audrey, Philomena, Agnes Charlie. Whenever any of the girls are absent these floaters take their places.\n\nBefore the rationing, the girls of the cooking class used to serve a full hot meal about twice a week, but now things are too hard to get so we shall have to wait until after the war.\n\n- Rena Williams -\n\nOUR NURSE\n\nMiss Hayward is our nurse. She used to visit the school twice a week and often visited our homes too, especially when anyone was sick. She is very kind and good. But, since Christmas she has been sick and we miss her very much. Hurry up, Miss Hayward, and come back. St. Catherine's School will be very glad to welcome you.\nTHE ROLL CALL\n\nof all the pupils registered at Saint Catherine's Indian Day School since the date of the opening of the school, January 8, 1940.\n\nSOMERIO'S RESERVE :: CHIEF - FRED THORNE :: :: :: :: ::\n\nSarah Thorne\nViolet Thorne\nAbner Thorne\nEugene Thorne\nRamona Underwood\nLouise Underwood\nJanis Underwood\nAudrey Underwood\nMary Joannie\nRose Joannie\nFrancis Joannie\nJulia Joe\nMary Joe\nJacob Joe\nNorma Joe\nNorman Joe\nVincent Joe\nGilbert Joe\nWalter Joe\nMartha Joe\nRuth Joe\nSadie Jack\n\nMargaret Jack\nLillian Jack\nRoy Charlie\nAgnes Charlie\nLeonard Peters\nRaymond James\nAlvis Joe\nGarfield Joe\nEngelina Thorne\nAlfreda Thorne\nCordon Thorne\nCharlotte Thorne\nGertrude Thorne\nFlorence Felbe\nGabriel Felbe\nFloyd Felbe\nNorma Felbe\nWillie George\nRaymond George\nFrancis George\nEarl Williams\n\nJanet Williams\nKenneth Williams\nDouglas Williams\nRena Williams\nLeonard Antoine\nPaul Antoine\nWallace Antoine\nDavid Pierre\nRaymond Pierre\nViolet James\nAlex James\nJohn James\nCatherine Jimmie\nJack Jimmie\nJerry Jimmie\nHoward Seymour\nVelma Seymour\nBeatrice Joannie\nLillian Harry\nJean Jack\nJerry Jack\nVincent Harry\n\nKOKSILOH (QUAMICHLAN) RESERVE :: CHIEF - TOMMY MODEST :: :: ::\n\nMarjorie Modest\nAlice Modest\nIrene Georges\nVirginia James\nSarah Ryan\nLillian Ryan\nNellie Bartleman\nLillie Mae Bartleman\nEvelyn Rage\nHardy Rage\nEleanor Rage\nPhyllis George\nViolet George\nTom George\nPhilip George\n\nBernice Joannie\nSadie Joannie\nMathilda Tom\nMargaret Rose Charlie\nMarie Charlie\nFrancis Thomas\nBethany Willie\nMarina Billie\nEdith Daniels\nBarbara Dick\nAbram Joe\nSusan Joe\nClara Joe\nArnold Joe\nCustave Joe\n\nEvelyn Wilson\nMaria Wilson\nGustave Wilson\nTillie Daniels\nEffie Daniels\nClarence Daniels\nChristine Daniels\nGeorge Daniels\nDaniel August\nArnold Sylvester\nClifford Sylvester\nPatricia Sylvester\nBarbara Sylvester\nIda Paul\nJunior Tom\nFrancis Joe\n\nQUAMICHLAN RESERVE :: CHIEF - TOMMY MODEST :: :: :: :: ::\n\nMadeline Charlie\nGaelia Charlie\nTommy Charlie\nBennie Charlie\n\nTillie Charlie\nLorraine Charlie\nMargaret Charlie\nEvelyn James\nEdna James\nElmo James\nIda James\nMarjorie James\nCecilia Billie\nMary Johnnie\n\nCOMIKAEN RESERVE\n\nDick Joe\nThelma Joe\nJoseph Joe\nBernard Joe\nJean Joseph\nEliza Joseph\n\nKENNIFSEN RESERVE\n\nLila Henry\nNora Henry\nCecilia Henry\nModest Henry\n\nCLEM CLEMELUTZ RESERVE\n\nRita George\nRy George\nNorma George\nLila Dianna George\nFrederick George\nRodrick George\nDorothy George\nBenedict George\nBernard George\n\nVictoria Wilson\nHerman Jim\nFlora Jim\nElsie Jim\nCatherine Jim\nAgnes Jim\nErnest Alphonse\nRuby Alphonse\nTheresa Alphonse\n\nPEARL JOSEPH\n\nPearl Joseph\nMartin Bell\nVirginia Pierre\nJosephine Canute\nHelen Canute\nMadeline Canute\n\nSAMMY HENNY\n\nSammy Henry\nRaphael Johnnie\nLima Johnnie\nFrank Page\nRita Page\n\nFRANCIS WILSON\n\nFrancis Wilson\nRene Wilson\nEliza Wilson\nPhilomena Wilson\nMary Underwood\nJohnnie Underwood\nRichard Daniels\nGilbert Jimmie\n\nTOTAL - 200\n\nMany people from the reserves have been working in the shipyards and canneries during the past winter.

It's spring!\"\nI laughed and I told him,\n\"I know, I know.\"\nThe frog in the round pond told me so.\"\n\nAnd do you remember the lambs at play?\nOne little black one ran away\nAnd lost his mother, and stood and cried,\nUntil she came hurrying to her side.\nAnd I thought, \"That's the way the Lord takes care\nOf His little children everywhere.\"\n\nAnd now, dear God, I must say, \"Good-night,\"\nPlease watch the world through the long dark night.\nBless mother and daddy, and make them good,\nAnd help all the people to do as they should.\nFrom\nThe Sechelt Residential\nSechelt B.C. School,\n\nTo:\nPhilip Phelan\nChief Education Division\nDepartment of Mines Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ontario\nThe Indian Village of Bella Bella was the scene of a unique celebration this Easter season. Instead of rivalry or the attempt to stage an old-fashioned \"potlatch\" the Bella Bella Indians invited the neighboring villages of Bella Coola and Klemtu to be their guests. The main purpose was to have a formal dedication and opening of their new board walk which forms the main street of the village. Owing to the rugged character of the soil, ordinary roads are not practical and this board walk, 10 feet wide and nearly 3/4 of a mile in length, serves as road and side walk. This is the second time it has been rebuilt. Counting their time, it is estimated that it cost nearly $20,000.00. The Indians did the work, getting the logs, towing them in and sawing them into planks in their own sawmill. Except for approximately $100 which the Government contributed, the village bore the entire cost.\n\nAbout seventy-five people came from each of the two villages. The first evening, Tuesday, was taken up by basketball games between Bella Coola and Bella Bella. The men's team from Bella Bella won both games while the Bella Coola team was victor in the women's game.\n\nOn Good Friday, services were held morning and evening. An Indian, Mr. Norman Harris, conducted the morning service and Dr. D. L. Lamb, Medical Missionary took the evening one. Special music at both services was provided by the Alerto choir under the leadership of Mr. William Robinson with Mr. Louis Hall organist.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, the visitors, headed by the Bella Coola concert band, lined up for the opening ceremony. Red, white and blue ribbons were stretched across the street. After speeches of welcome by Chief Charlie Moody, Chief Samuel King of Bella Coola and Chief Philip Brown of Klemtu spoke and the dedication prayer was given by Dr. E. Herby. Chief Brown then unveiled the street sign \"Churchill Road\" and Chief King cut the ribbons. Everyone then paraded the length of the Village to the musical music of the Bella Coola Band. This ceremony was followed by a banquet in the Community Hall and a dance that evening.\n\nOn Easter Sunday, appropriate services were held. A native, Mr. David Campbell, conducted the morning service while Dr. D. L. Lamb was in charge of the evening service. The Klemtu Choir also provided the music, singing such anthems as Haydn's \"The Heavens Are Telling\" and the \"Hallelujah Chorus\" from the Messiah very creditably. Although the Bella Bella United Church seats over 250, it was necessary to hold the services in the Community Hall to enable everyone to attend.\n\nOwing to rain, the sports program for Monday had to be cancelled. However, a very enjoyable farewell banquet was served by the Ladies Aid of Bella Bella and in the evening...\nthe festivities were brought to a close by a concert provided by the members of the Bella Bella choir and Concert Band.\n\nThe Committee in charge of arrangements, under the leadership of Mr. Caleb Williams, deserves much credit for the successful way in which the celebration was conducted. Entirely Indian in its conception and management, it was a credit to the Natives, and few White communities of the same size attempt anything like it.\n\n******************************\n\nWEDDING\n\nBella Bella United Church was the setting for the wedding on April 23rd when Miss Mabel Hall, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Abel Hall was united in marriage to Mr. Daniel Humchitt, son of Chief Albert and Mrs. Humchitt, all of Bella Bella Indian Village. Rev. George E. Darby, M.D., performed the ceremony.\n\nThe bride, given in marriage by her father, wore a floor length gown of white satin with white net overskirt. Her floor length veil of white net was caught to her head by a cap of tiny white feathers and she carried a spray of pink tulips. She was attended by Miss Catherine Martin as maid of honor, while bridesmaids were Miss Alice Humchitt, Miss Marguerite Hall, Miss Lorettta Sandy and Miss Phyllis Hopkins. Their floor length dresses were in pastel shades. Mina Hall, sister of the bride and Betty Brown were junior attendants, while Mr. Carmen Humchitt supported the groom. Wedding music was played by Miss Betty Wilson.\n\nFollowing the ceremony a banquet was held in the Community Hall. In the evening a reception was held to which the whole village as well as visitors from Bella Coola and Klietu were invited. Mr. and Mrs. Humchitt will reside in Bella Bella.\nThis month our Indian design was drawn and colored by\n\nJacob Duncan of Kitamaat, B.C.\n\nJacob has been in hospital for almost 3 years and expects to be discharged within a few months. He has proven that it pays to take the cure, and he finds many interesting things to do even while in hospital.\nNOTES ON TUBERCULOSIS\n\nIt is not generally known, but there is an Advisory Committee for the Control and Prevention of Tuberculosis among the Indians. This Committee meets in Ottawa and consists of twelve members, ten appointed by the Canadian Tuberculosis Association, one by the Department of National Health and Welfare and the Senior Medical Officer of the Indian Department. These experts are studying the problem of T.B. amongst Indians and advise the Government regarding better ways of preventing and curing this disease. Here are a few of the things they have found out and announced.\n\nThe death rate from Tuberculosis amongst Indians in 1943 was fifteen times that of the White population. While the death rate from T.B. in Whites has declined 35% in the past fifteen years, there has been very little change in the Indian rate of death. In 1937 not more than 100 Indians were having hospital treatment for T.B. At present there are 905 in departmental and provincial sanatoria.\n\nIn British Columbia, Coqualeetza Hospital has approximately 175 beds for Indians only and is in charge of Dr. W.S. Barclay, a prominent T.B. specialist. The R.C.A.F. Hospital at Millar Bay near Prince Rupert has been taken over by the Department for use as a T.B. hospital for Indians and will have 150 beds. It will be opening shortly and will be in charge of Dr. J.D. Galbraith. Local people will remember him as he was on the \"Thomas Crosby\" for a short time and at Bella Coola for several years before specializing in T.B. work.\n\nThe Government spent over $1,000,000 in 1944 on control measures. Now that the Government is actually doing its part, to a large extent at least, it is up to the Indians to take advantage of the facilities offered and try to help themselves.\n\n**********************************\n\nHAVE YOUR POCKETBOOKS READY & TWO GOOD CAUSES NEED YOUR HELP!\n\n1. Cancer. This terrible disease is second in the list of \"killers\". The cause is unknown and unless it is taken very early, when it can be removed surgically or killed by radium or X-ray, it is fatal in a few years at most. A continent wide campaign is on to raise money for research into the cause and cure, education of the public so that people will be suspicious of unusual growths, and the treatment of cases. While it not very common amongst Indians, it does occur and we should help in the fight against it. In the meantime, consult your doctor for lumps that appear in places where they shouldn't; for moles that start to enlarge, change color or lose their skin; for any ulcer (raw place) that does not heal readily; any irregular bleeding.\n\n2. Pension Fund. In order to make the pension fund of the United Church safe, the laymen have started a campaign to raise at least 3 1/2 million dollars. The ministers undertake to devote their lives to their charges for a very small salary. They are not allowed to earn more than this and so cannot save enough to provide for their old age or illness. The Church provides a pension for this reason but unless something is done, this fund is liable to go \"broke\". Hence, this drive. Help this good cause along, Bella Bella.\n\nG.E. Darby, M.B.\nRAISED DOUGHNUTS\n\nDissolve 1 tbsp. sugar\nand 1 Fleishman's Yeast Cake\nin 1/2 cups warm milk.\nAdd 1/2 cups sifted flour. Beat well and let rise 1 hour.\nCream 3 tbsp. butter\nand 1/2 cup sugar\nadd 1 egg well beaten\nand 1 tsp. nutmeg.\n\nAdd this to yeast mixture and add 1/4 tsp. salt and rest of\nflour (3 cups) to yeast mixture to make a soft dough. Let\nrise 1/2 hours. Cut into circles about half an inch thick and\nlet rise about 1 hour. Fry in deep fat.\n\nWISHBONES\n\nA backbone, not a wishbone is the thing that you require\nIf you wish to make your mark, and gain your heart's desire.\nIdle wishes get you nowhere; any fool can dream,\nBut if you want the sweets of life, the sugar and the cream\nYou can't expect it placed before you on a silver dish\nYou've got to do much more than sit at home and merely wish.\n\nWishes, wishes, do not sit and wish your life away\nLook around and see what can be got from life today.\nIf you want the moon - then hitch your wagon to a star.\nIf you don't, then learn to be content with what you are.\nBetter not to wish at all, -contented with your lot\nThan spend your life in wishing for the things you haven't got.\nTHE GIRLS' CLUB\n\nThe Girls' Club has had a busy and profitable winter. Besides publishing the \"Dootseelth\", spasmodically, we admit, but non-the-less enthusiastically, they have undertaken a number of other projects.\n\nTwo very successful \"Fish-Ponds\" have been conducted by Club members - the first at the December Ladies Aid Sale of Work, and the second at the Valentine Party in Gibson Hall.\n\nThe Valentine Party was organized and managed by the girls, and the program of games was enjoyed by the young people, as well as by some of the not-so-young people of the village. A profitable side line (in addition to the Fish-Pond) was the sale of Hot-dogs and coffee.\n\nIn addition to the donations of Babies Ward furniture, which we mentioned in an earlier issue, the Girls' Club recently donated an electric washing machine to the hospital. The machine, operated by a member of the Club, takes care of the daily \"Baby Wash\", and fills a long felt need. Whenever a satisfactory quality of linoleum is again available, the girls hope to purchase floor covering for the hospital wards.\n\nIllness of club members and club leader during the spring weeks interfered with club meetings, but the girls plan to conclude the season's activities on May 24th with a \"Hot Dog Stand\".\n\nClub meetings have been held in the Nurses' Home, and when the members were not occupied with publishing a \"Dootseelth\", or preparing a \"Fish-Pond\", the work periods were spent in making surgical supplies for the hospital.\n\nWhile all of the girls have been faithful and loyal, and have worked hard for the club, we would like to pay special tribute to the unsurpassed faithfulness and industry of two of the members, namely Alice Mason and Dorothy Windsor.\n\n*************************************\n\nTHE LADIES' AID\n\nWhile The Ladies Aid has not held regular meetings during the winter, the ladies are planning their regular Spring Sale of Work. Also, they were responsible for the serving of a very fine banquet in the Community Hall during the Easter celebration.\nMISSION BAND NOTES\n\nIn spite of prevalent colds, the Mission Band held their regular meetings this Spring.\n\nAt the Easter Thank-Offering Meeting in the Church, a choir composed of twenty-two girls sang two songs.\n\nThe members began working early for their Easter Sale and realized $8.00 mainly from the sale of eggs which the girls enjoyed coloring.\n\nAt the close of this term, they will have completed their booklets, \"Friends in Africa,\" and will take these home as a memento of a year's study of the work of the United Church in Africa.\n\n******************************\n\nCANADIAN GIRLS IN TRAINING.\n\nWith few exceptions, the girls have met faithfully each week in the Prayer Meeting room at the Church. Since Christmas six meetings have been spent on the study book \"Spotlight on Africa.\" The girls took as their project, the making of a model African village and while it was not as complete as it might have been, still it gave a very good idea of how African homes are built. On completion of the study book, the girls met with the Evening Auxiliary at their April meeting and became affiliated with the W.M.S., in this way. This is one of the necessary credits in order to become a \"Recognized Group.\" In this connection it is interesting to note that the first report on the year's work, submitted in January, received very favorable comment from Miss Gertrude Patmore, Girls' Work Secretary for B.C. The girls hope that when the second report goes in at the close of the winter's activities, that they will win \"recognition\" and thus become one of the \"Chevron\" groups in B.C. This will entitle them to wear a stripe on their middies.\n\nThe group is a small one and while their influence has not been greatly felt in the village, still the girls have worked hard at many small things and have benefited in various ways from their meetings. We shall look forward to being together again as a group after the summer holidays.\nTHE EVENING AUXILIARY\n\nThe Evening Auxiliary has met regularly in the Nurses' Home the first Monday of each month during the winter. The Study Book has dealt with the work of the United Church in Africa, and while the leader for the evening presented a chapter from the Study Book, the other members were busy doing hospital mending and making surgical supplies. This donation of services has been doubly acceptable this past season due to the unfortunate shortage of hospital staff.\n\nThe group is growing in membership; the 1945 paid-up membership was 28, as compared with 14 in 1944, and the 1946 paid-up membership has already reached 24.\n\nFinancially also, progress is being made. In 1944, $35.00 was raised, while in 1945 the total receipts amounted to some $75.00.\n\nBesides its regular meetings, the group joins in the World Day of Prayer, and the Autumn and Easter Thankoffering services.\n\n*************************************\n\nTHE SUNDAY SCHOOL\n\nDue to numerous cases of measles in the village, Sunday School was not held in January, February, and March. However, April found the Sunday School operating in full force, teachers and pupils having lost none of their enthusiasm for their Sunday morning sessions during the winter months.\n\n*************************************\n\nPROCRASTINATION\n\nIf you have a job to do\u2014then do it right away! \u2014\nTomorrow is a long way off\u2014we only have Today.\nThe present time is ours to use, and spend as best we can,\nAnd every hour is precious in this little human span.\nWe put things off, and then we find we've left it just too late;\nAnd when it's more than likely that we put the blame on Fate,\nwe never can recapture that odd moment that we lose;\nThere's no time like the present, as we find out\u2014to our cost.\n\"I'll leave it till tomorrow\"\u2014that's a fatal thing to say!\nDon't give the clock the laugh on you\u2014just do that job today.\n\n*************************************\n\nCongratulations on the birth of a Baby:\n\nTo Mr. & Mrs. Basil Carpenter Jan. 7 Fredrick\nTo Mr. & Mrs. John Thompson Jan. 23 Elizabeth Agnes\nTo Mr. & Mrs. Lawrence Reid Jan. 31 George Johnny\nTo Mr. & Mrs. Ed Moody Apr. 2 Barbara Joan\nTo Mr. & Mrs. Ben Brown Apr. 4 Leona Sheila\nTo Mr. & Mrs. Moses Simchitt Apr. 10 George Eric\nTo Mr. & Mrs. Frank Alison May 2 Baby Girl\u2014Reggy Fey\nTo Mr. & Mrs. Willie Hall May 10 Baby Boy\nTo Mr. & Mrs. Gordon Reid Jr. May 11 Daniel Gordon\nTo Mr. & Mrs. Stanley George May 12 Baby Girl\nClam digging this year has been very good. Although people came back with backaches and colds, they were still happy over their loot from every corner of the coast. Clams, like any other fish, have to be searched for, but are found on beaches instead of in the water. And instead of using nets, you use forks to move them from their watery beds. And once caught, they must be removed from their shells before they can be eaten.\n\nSpring found the people of Bella Bella very busy this year. All were busy clearing their yards and gardens, painting their homes, and repairing the walks. New homes are being built, and old ones repaired. Altogether the village looks greatly improved.\n\nApril 6th the Choir members gave a concert in the Community Hall which was much enjoyed by all. Solos, duets and quartets were rendered, as well as several numbers by the entire choir. Choir leader was Mr. Gordon Reid, and Mrs. Agnes Hudson was pianist.\n\nSunday, April 14th a memorial service was held in the church, honoring the memory of the late Chief Edward Gamble of Kitkatla. The Choir and the Bella Bella Concert Band assisted with the service. We extend our deepest sympathy to Mrs. Gamble, and her son Russell.\n\nThe Herring Spawning came early this year, and fortunately the weather was favorable; many people went \"fish-egging\", and returned with large amounts of Herring eggs, which have been cured and stored for next winter's use.\n\nThe Carpenter brothers are hard at work building a 34 foot mill-netter for Basil Carpenter.\n\nOn April 25th Vancouver, Bella Bella, and a few other important places went on Daylight Saving Time.\n\nBrenda Campbell, Caleb Williams, and George Wilson attended the Native Brotherhood Convention at Fort Simpson in March.\n\nThe people of Bella Bella were sorry to learn that Mr. S.F. Anfield has been transferred to the Prince Rupert Agency. At present Mr. Anfield is managing both agencies.\n\nNews items contributed by Alice Mason.\nHis Excellency Bishop Ladouceur encourages us!\n\nIn his kindness he writes the following lines to our Editor:\n\n\"It is a splendid idea to have a small newspaper of your own. Our little publication will supply an excellent way of communication between the children of the school their parents and the community. I am sure you will find it a valuable aid in keeping them informed of what is going on at the school.\n\nI am confident that the success of this paper will be assured. It will be a good task to give the children something to read; something to think about; something to write about; something to discuss; something to argue about; something to make articles which will prove both interesting and instructive to the readers and profitable for their authors.\n\nTherefore, let us all lend our support to this enterprise.\"\n\n\"Sturgeon Landing Resto.\"\n\nVic. A. Ross, Editor\n\nHere is a question the Bishop asked us at the concert; carrying your gun on your shoulder you are going hunting along the shore; suddenly you see ten blackbirds on a branch; you shoot five fall down; kill! kill! how many are left on the branch? Five; we answered... His Excellency and the missionaries laughed at us much; why? why? we were wrong; the right answer is zero for the other blackbirds fly away.\n\nPhilippe Castel\n\nIt is always a great pleasure for us to read Island Breezes from \u00cele-a-la-Crosse.

We hope to hear from them again through our newspaper we send you our best wishes and we pray that you will have lovely days and good success.\n\nEditor Castel\nCHRISTMAS. ALL THE CHILDREN were happy to receive Jesus during the Masses in the parlor, what we saw, we wished our Guider down in the refectory for playroom; on great surprise: a Christmas tree! It was all of beautiful color and golden stars; one of us received gifts. We thank the Fathers for working all that. Once Christmas Tree.\n\nwent to Midnight Mass and in the Holy Communion; we After Masses, we went in brown owl sitting on it looks like a real one, Merry Christmas. Then lunch and next to our surprise: a Christmas tree! ful lights of every color, it was nice!

The Missionaries the Bishop to see us very glad to receive are making retreat for began on February 28 finish on March 7. All are 20 Fathers and Brothers are always praying in and when they go outside by 2. The Bishop also is there, he prays with the mornings he offered own intentions: we our sacrifices with He gives us candles missionary also us some and we have a great pleasure with them. They finish their retreat on Thursday and will go away on Friday; we should like to keep them with us always.\n\nLeo Sauteux Gr.5\n\nA GREAT DAY. This morning His Excellency, the Rev. Fathers and Brothers end their retreat. They sang nice hymns at Mass. It was much nicer than the children; it was grand to see the Fathers wearing a surplice, kneeling before the Blessed Sacrament and before His Excellency to renew their promises. After Benediction they went out singing the Magnificat: it was lovely. After supper we had a nice concert; His Excellency assisted with the Missionaries and the Brothers. The children did their pieces very well, everybody enjoyed them. At last, His Excellency and the Fathers sang; one Father played piano: they sang so well that we did not want to go to bed.\n\nFlora Jane Merasty Gr.6\n\nGeorgina: Sister, there is lots of birds; some are black and some are white.\n\nThe Nurse: Which kind do you like the best?\n\nGeorgina: The white. Look, they are always in the water but the black are flying. My! the white are funny, they have no bed. Fathers, Sisters, girls and boys have beds but them, nothing.\n\nThe Nurse: Sure, they have beds, the water is their bed.\n\nGeorgina: Why, they are just funny!\n\nDear little Georgina, she is not 4 yet!\n\nEsther Merasty Gr.3\n\nOn Christmas evening we gave a concert and the Indians from around the school were invited to assist. There was a Christmas tree played by 8 boys, and Santa Claus gave them presents. The big girls played a nice drill; having bells in our hands to be more joyful, we sang a Christmas song. I tell you, it was a nice concert for our beloved Indians who came and no doubt they enjoyed their evening.\n\nAnna Bightey Gr.6\n\nSince January SISTER T. EUSEBE is with us; she helps the Nurse to take care of the children and also she is devoting herself to the Guides and Brownies. She is very kind to us. She will go in missions next June.\n\nTherese Colomb Gr.3\nST. JOHN AMBULANCE. Since many weeks we were being taught by our Nurse the Junior First Aid, and when Dr. Vule came from The Pas, we had the examination. Our Scouts took part in all exercises attended, during nearly one hour he asked us questions about bandages, fractures, artificial breathing, etc., and we knew almost everything and we were proud to give the right answers; we knew also that very well. At the end, the Doctor told us his satisfaction and surprise about our knowledge, he encouraged us for our hard work and said that we will be useful some day in missions to help injured people. We are grateful to Dr. Vule and to our honored Nurse.\n\nA GREAT SURPRISE. We were going on the lake last winter and suddenly we saw an airplane. I was scared because it was coming near us. A man opened the door and I saw my dear Daddy and my uncle. Quickly we came home and I stayed with them one hour. I was very glad; he brought me all kind of things.\n\nSuzette Highway Gr. 4\n\nOn January two boys arrived in school; so now we are 65 boys. They came from Pelican Narrows to fill-up some by their absence. Pr. Principal was expecting them. Then they took the train down to Athabasca with the tractor driven by brother George to the school of Surgeon. We are glad to have them with us.\n\nRodrigue Thomas Gr. 4\n\nST. GEORGE'S DAY. On April 23, we celebrated the Feast of St. George, Scouting's Patron Saint. For Mass and Benediction we wore our suits and ties. We sang the Mass was said by our Scoutmaster. At 9 o'clock the Scouts who have no class in the morning went into the bath with the Scoutmaster to practice some tests. We just came back for dinner. In the afternoon some other Scouts went too but the bad weather obliged them to come back soon. At 4 o'clock the seven Scouts who passed before junior first aid of St. John Ambulance Association before Dr. Vule had a meeting presided by Pr. Principal. They were given their certificates from the St. John Ambulance he congratulated them and said he was pleased at us and hoping some other boys will have the same favor. In the evening we played a Whist card game, we played long's turn was very exciting. Some other Boys, Guides and Brownies had a meeting everybody had a piece of cake made a Girl Guide. We thank the Fathers and Sisters for this nice Feast.\n\nPierre Caribou, Sr.\nSICKNESS. Since the Visitors had went away there was a sickness among the children and not only a few but nearly all the boys and girls were sick; some stayed in bed for 2 weeks but although we could not go in our playroom we were not lonely. Because our kind Fathers and devoted Sisters did their best to please us, they brought the machine up just think a picture show in our bed! We were overjoyed. Our little tired Nurse brought the Victrola and we played the songs we like best. The Sisters made mint toffee and we coughed very much so have a lot... Besides that we had many story books and different games to play with and every night before going to bed Sister tells us nice stories. After all I think that we are not poor but very grateful to those who are so good for us.\n\nEveline Michel\n\nThree other girls were received Guides on St. George's Day and four others became Brownies.\nDawn came as a welcome relief to Christine. The prospects of her daughter facing the coroner jury the following morning was not conducive to sound sleeping and her dreams were filled with weird fantasies. She was wide awake with the first shaft of light that touched the reserve. For some time she lay in bed dwelling on the possible outcome of the trial. Lyddia was innocent, she knew, yet doubt and fear kept gnawing at her peace of mind. Justice had miscarried before now. For Lyddia to spend even one night in jail would be a disgrace she could not bear to face.\n\nSo, the morning hours went slowly on. At seven she arose and called Lyddia. Together they attended Mass and received Holy Communion. Christine prayed as she had never prayed before. She prayed with all the fervor of St. Monica praying for her wayward son, Augustine.\n\nAt breakfast she finally summoned up enough courage to tell about the coroner investigation. Lyddia, dear, she began, Father told me last night that the coroner is having a meeting this morning. Lyddia started in her chair, sat up straight, her face becoming strangely pale. \"This morning, Mother?\" \"Yes, dear, at 10 o'clock.\" \"Oh, Mother, I am scared,\u2014what will they do to me?\"\u2014\"I know how you feel, child; I am afraid, too, but, we must have courage.\"\u2014\"What do they do at the Coroners meeting\u2014will they ask me a lot of questions?\" \"Oh Mother I will be too frightened to speak.\"\u2014\"They will be nice to you, Lyddia. Mr. Weston came over to see me when you were away. He told me that the Coroner's jury was only to decide the cause of the death.\"\u2014\"But, I did k\u2014\" Lyddia shuddered even to say the word\u2014\"I think it would be better for us not to talk about it, Lyddia. We must trust in God. If they ask you any question you will just have to answer as truthfully and as well as you can.\"\n\nAbout nine o'clock a rap came on the front door. Both Lyddia and Christine were in the kitchen. Christine's heart was quaking as she wiped her hands on her apron saying to Lyddia, \"I will see who it is.\"\n\nIt was Father Kelly. \"Good morning, Christine,\" he began, \"I hurried over to tell you that Mr. Stuart just sent word that the meeting will be postponed until six o'clock this evening. There has been some delay in picking a jury.\n\n\"Oh, Father, I wish they would get it over with. This waiting is killing both of us.\"\n\n\"Well, look, Christine, the women are going to scrub the Church today from top to bottom. Why not bring Lyddia over, it will help you to keep your mind off it.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I will,\" she answered energetically.\n\nLyddia came into the living room thinking, of course, that it was an order to attend the Coroner's Meeting. Seeing Father Kelly she said quietly and with some relief, \"Good morning, Father\", Is it time to go.\"\n\n\"No, Lyddia, it is put off until tonight. I have just been asking your Mother to come over and help with the cleaning of the Church.\"\n\n\"Sure, I'll go.\" Lyddia answered.\n\nFather hurried back to the Church to tell the other women and young girls that Christine and Lyddia were coming and that no mention was to be made about the pending investigation.\n\nThe day passed more quickly than Christine had anticipated as she plied her scrubbing brush with great vigor and prayed with great fervor. Shortly before six o'clock, the Coroner very kindly and thoughtfully sent word asking Father Kelly if he would accompany Christine and her daughter to the Magistrate's house.\nIt would be, perhaps, offensive to them if I were to send the Constable,\" the message read. \"Most thoughtful indeed,\" Father murmured to himself as he folded the note up and placed it in his pocket.\n\nFather Kelly, old Uncle John, Christine and Lyddie walked together to the School-house where Court was being held. They arrived a minute or two before six. On the way over Father Kelly gave Lyddie a general notion of the proceedings to take place and of what would be expected of her. Everyone, including Father Kelly was obviously nervous.\n\nOn arriving at the School-house they were immediately ushered into the large class-room. The room was fairly spacious, but not sufficiently spacious to hold the number of men mustered for the occasion.\n\nThe Jury, which was comprised of the better known citizens of the district were grouped along one side of the room. On the other side sat the Chief, Jimmy Henry and Sam Denny; Mr. Winston and the rest of the men who had searched and found the body of Struthers. They obviously were to furnish the necessary evidence. At the end of the room at the teacher's desk sat the Coroner, the district Constable and the Magistrate. A chair was reserve for Lyddie near by.\n\nThe Coroner's Investigation was declared open immediately and the wheels of the law began their tedious and tiring grinding and sifting of evidence. The witnesses were called one by one, their evidence written for time immemorial by the Magistrate. Questions were asked, statements were made by those who had viewed the body. His exact position was duly noted. Their sworn testimony, taken at the time of the discovery identifying the body of Struthers, was produced and read to the Jury. During the examination of Mr. Winston's evidence he insisted on more than once correction and without being asked that the wound caused by the stone, on the side of Struther's face could not have caused his death. Finally, the Coroner somewhat curtly, \"Mr. Weston,\" we are not asking for your opinion, we seek only facts, please confine your replies to the questions asked.\" Upon this mild rebuke, Mr. Winston took out his handkerchief and blew his nose with resounding vigor in obvious protest. Lyddie, of course, was called upon to give her story and did so in a low and nervous voice. The Coroner interrupted her narrative with numerous questions. Dr. O'Brien who was actually the Coroner of the district, although he was not handling the investigation was longest on the stand. After the usual routine, questions as to name and occupation he was asked to describe the wounds which he did in detail noting their exact position, and their seriousness.\n\n\"Do you think, Doctor,\" the Coroner went on, \"that the wound already described as inflicted on the side of the deceased's head might have cause his death?\"\n\n\"No, your Honor, it is my opinion that it did not. It was merely a flesh wound.\n\n\"The wound described on the back of the head which the unanimous testimony of the witnesses has shown to have been caused when the deceased, falling, struck his head on a sharp protruding stone. Could this have been the immediate cause of his death?\"\n\n\"During the autopsy I examined the base of his skull most carefully. There was no fracture of the skull and probably only a slight concussion. I do not think it was sufficient to affect his death.\"\n\n\"What then, Doctor, in your opinion was the cause of the death of the man in question?\"\n\n\"Heart failure, Your Honor\". There was a sudden new interest throughout the room and a shifting about in seats.\n\n\"Would the Doctor, please, explain to the court his reasons for this assumption,\" the Coroner asked.\n\n\"Yes, your Honor, about six months ago, the deceased came to my Office. He complained of suffering from pains in his chest. Upon examination I discovered positive signs of angina pectoris. I suggested the approved treatment for it and in addition warned him to avoid entirely all alcoholic beverages and sudden over exertion. His case was not too far advanced at that time.\"\n\n\"Are you of the opinion, Doctor, that he followed your advice?\"\n\n\"Regarding drinking, at least, he did not. I discovered him drunk on more than one occasion, and one of these occasions, I repeated my warning to him.\n\"I am praying for something else, too.\"\n\"What is it?\"\n\"That we will be able to get married before Christmas.\"\nLydia was so surprised by this sudden announcement she said,\n\"Oh\"\u2014very weakly.\nJohnny was quick to sense what he thought was a vague refusal.\n\"But, would you like to, Lydia?\u2014Have you changed your mind about me?\"\n\"Yes, I say I had?\" Lydia answered somewhat pertly.\n\"No,\u2014but, you seem disappointed.\"\n\"I didn't say anything. I just said 'Oh!'.\n\"Well, will you, Lydia. We would get along swell together.\nWill you?\"\n\"I'll\u2014Lydia began, and then stopped and smiled.\nJohn was quick to notice this change. He felt he was losing ground.\n\"What are you smiling at, Lydia?\"\n\"I was just thinking of something funny.\"\n\"Heck, do you think it is funny because I asked you to marry me?\"\nJohnny answered, somewhat irritated.\n\"Now, I didn't mean it that way, but, I was thinking of a story of David Copperfield that Sister Theresa used to read us in class period.\n\"Do you remember the note Barkis sent to Peggotty when he asked her to marry him?\"\n\"No, I don't\" Johnny answered.\n\"He said, 'Barkis is willing' \".\n\"Does that mean that you will?\" Johnny asked with sudden emotion.\n\"If Mother will let us.\"\n\"Oh, I am sure she will. Why should she want us to wait any longer.\"\nThey sat for a moment in silence and then, the bell, high up in the belfry of the Church began booming out its call to Benediction.\n\"I guess we had better go, Johnny,\" Lydia said.\n\"Yes, I guess so. We will ask your Mother after Benediction.\"\n\"I think you had better pray that she will say 'Yes!' \"\n\"You bet I will. And what will you do, Lydia?\"\n\"You know I will be praying with all my heart, Johnny.\"\nAnd together they passed up the steps of the Church and through the vestibule and into the presence of their Eucharistic God.\n\nThe end.\n\nNOTE: This the end of the story. I hope you have enjoyed following the adventures of this young Indian girl. I do not know if I shall be able to find time to continue the story of Lydia's life next year. It takes a good deal of time to type and then stencil 3000 words each month.\n\nSo far the present at least we will say GOODBYE to Lydia.\n\nRespectfully yours\n\nFather Dunlop.\n\"Would you say, then, that these wounds already described did in no way affect his death?\"\n\n\"It is possible, Your Honor, that they contributed in a measure to hasten his death. But, I am of the opinion that his untimely death was brought about rather by his excessive drinking and by the prolonged overexertion from running which caused his heart to fail.\"\n\n\"That will be all, Doctor,\" and the Doctor quietly stepped down from the stand and took his seat with the other witnesses. The Coroner then summed up the evidence as received for the Jury. The Jury then retired to the adjoining Class room for deliberations. They were not out long but, it seemed like hours to Lydia and Christine. As they took their places once more in the crowded Class room the Coroner addressed the Foreman saying, \"Have you reached a decision?\"\n\n\"We have, Your Honor,\" the Jury man replied.\n\n\"Would you inform the Court of your decision,\" the Coroner asked.\n\n\"Accidental death, Your Honor.\"\n\nSomeone started clapping, someone cheered, then the whole class room became an uproar. The Coroner pounded loudly on his desk for order, but, order was not restored for some time. When finally the sudden wave of enthusiasm had died down the Coroner spoke, \"Miss Lydia, the Coroner's Jury has found you entirely innocent of the death of Sydney Struthers. Let no stigma be attached to your good name for you have done no wrong in the eyes of the State and I feel certain that you have done none in the eyes of God. I congratulate you on your courageous defence of your virtue!\" and then he added curtly, \"Court dismissed.\"\n\nMany gathered around Lydia and Christine to congratulate them on the happy ending of this sad event. Christine's only remark was, \"God be praised.\"\n\nTogether the Mother and daughter and Uncle John who was beside himself with delight set off for the reserve. As they neared the reserve they saw a young man hurrying towards them. Christine was just about to say, \"Who is that coming in such a hurry?\" when she caught a glimpse of Lydia's face. There was no need to ask who it was. It was Johnny.\n\nThere was no doubt about that.\n\nJohnny was out of breath when he got up to them. He was yet a dozen paces away when he blurted out, \"What happened---how did it turn out?\"\n\n\"It was Christine who answered. It is all over, Johnny, and the Jury said it was accidental death.\"\n\n\"Thank God,\" Johnny answered, and then stood with his head down obviously embarrassed, his hands in his pockets, and shifting from one foot to another. It was Christine who broke the silence for Lydia had suddenly become tongue tied with the appearance of Johnny. \"When did you get in?\" she asked.\n\n\"Just now. I only heard about the trouble two days ago, and I came right down. Our gas boat broke down near Sloan's Cove. I thought we would never get here.\"\n\n\"It was nice of you to come. Well, I guess we had better go home. It must be nearly time for Church. Old John and Christine walked on ahead. Johnny and Lydia came behind. They seemed to have found their tongues for they talked continuously as they walked along. They did not turn in at the house, but, walked on down to the wharf. Johnny told Lydia all about the boat he was going to buy explaining in detail its lines, its horse-power, the make of the engine, all of which was Greek to Lydia. Yet, she found it all so interesting because Johnny insisted on calling it \"Our boat.\"\n\nSitting together on a rail that ran down to the dock Johnny assured Lydia how worried he had been when he first heard the news.\n\n\"I heard so many different stories before I finally got here, Lydia, I did not know what to believe.\"\n\n\"It was awful, Johnny, but, since you came tonight, it all seems to have happened so long ago. Isn't that funny because it is only a few days.\"\n\n\"I'll bet you could have cheered when the Jury said you did not kill him.\"\n\n\"Yes, you bet I did. But, you know Mother prayed so hard and Sister Mary and the Priest and Uncle John. I guess it just had to be a sure thing.\"\n\n\"And I prayed, too, Lydia.\"\n\n\"Did you Johnny?--That was nice of you.\"\nOttawa, July 9, 1946.\n\nDear Reverend Father:\n\nWe have received a copy of your splendid school magazine.\n\nWe would like to offer our congratulations to yourself, the members of your staff and the pupils who helped in publishing this magazine.

Verreault\n\nWe wish to acknowledge the helpful assistance of Rev. F. G. Laviolette, O.M.I., editor of the Indian Missionary Record, who has graciously offered us the photographs which appear in this book; of the Staff of the Lebret Seminary, and particularly of Bro. J.B. Landry, O.M.I., and Bro. J.P. Boucher, O.M.I., to whose most generous collaboration we shall be in a large measure indebted for the successful completion of the task which this Editorial Staff has undertaken.\nAFFECTIONATELY\n\nDEDICATED\n\nTO OUR BELOVED\n\nPARENTS AND FRIENDS\nA Word From The Principal\n\nTo the Editorial Staff:\n\nI wish to compliment the members of the Editorial Staff for the interesting \"Year Book\" they are presenting us. They have drawn a pleasant picture of the pupils' life at school and of their progressive steps in the field of academical work, Technical Training Art and Science.\n\nThe Parents and the ex-pupils, I am sure, will take a particular interest in its reading. In recalling to their mind memories of their school days, we hope that it will bring them closer to their Alma Mater.\n\nTo the School Staff and Parents:\n\nIt is my duty to extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to the School Staff and to the Parents. The progress achieved by the children is chiefly due to their devotedness and to their spirit of sacrifice and cooperation.\n\nFor a better understanding and a closer contact between the Parents and the School Staff, we are planning for next year, the organization of the \"Parents' Day\". All the parents of our pupils would be invited, by groups belonging to the same reserve, to visit the school. They would be shown the class-work of their children and their activities in Technical Training. Full opportunity would be given them to discuss with the Principal and the Staff any matter related to their children's welfare.\n\nThis year, we have made a new experiment. We have granted the pupils a holiday for home gardening. We think it to be an encouragement for the parents and a reward for the children. If it proves successful, it will become an annual affair to which parents and children can look forward.\n\nTo the Graduates:\n\nDear Graduates, the school life with all its pleasant and unpleasant moments is over for you. You are leaving us. We witness your departure with deep regret, not only because we have enjoyed your company but mainly because your training has yet to be completed. You understand that it is not at 16 years of age that you can have acquired a complete education and a full knowledge of a trade. Moreover, the parents of many among you are not in the economic position to give you the necessary help to continue your training and to fit you to undertake the\nthe task of earning your own living. Your situation has been the object of much thinking. We have come to the conclusion that the best amendment to the present system of Indian Education would be to build up a plan that would help you to specialize in the technical trade or profession of your choice and ability and at the same time, would permit you to earn enough to start on your own.\n\nWith the encouragement and help of the Department we hope to be able to create next year, out of the revenue of a rented farm, a fund for the Graduates. Our intention would be to pay a suitable salary money for their establishment.\n\nDear Graduates, in extending you a hearty welcome back, I wish you full success in all your undertakings.\n\nTo all the pupils:\n\nSincere congratulations to all the pupils who can go back home for their holidays with the conviction that they have done their duty, have increased their knowledge and improved their character.\n\nTo the others who are conscious that they could have done better, I say: \"Try it next year.\"\n\nDear Pupils, be good during your holidays, pray well, work well, play well.\n\nMay God bless you.\n\nHappy vacation.\n\nPAUL PICHE, O.M.I.\n\nFather Piche and two converts:\nMrs. Sugar and Mrs. Mulligan,\nof Piapot Reserve.\nREMINISCENCES\n\nTHIS INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL you see on the top cover, the finest of its type in the province, accommodates today, two hundred and eighty children, from the tiny tots of the primary grades to the husky young youths and maidens of grade seven and eight.\n\nBut, Lobrot too, had its beginning. Many old timers would recall the yearly visits of the first school, from 1894 to 1904. Happy souvenirs are often related of the merited and zealous founder of the school, Reverend Fr. Hugonard. His missionary career in the Qu'Appelle Valley lasted altogether forty-three years, thirty at the Indian School, Bessides being a great benefactor to the Indians he was an ardent lover of his adopted country. One incident very remarkable of this great soul was when the first school, which he had built with unnumberable fatigue and hardship, was completely destroyed by fire in 1904. He was absent. On his return, when seeing the building in ashes instead of complaining, took the staff and pupils to the church nearby and sang the \"Te Deum.\"\n\nThe younger generation would recall the second fire which again wiped away a wonderful architectural work of many years of labor. The fire started in early morning and at night 30, 1936, this school was officially opened. His Eminence Cardinal R. Villeneuve on the occasion of his visit to the west, joined with Inspector W. Morrison of the department of Indian Affairs in the official opening.\n\nThe school affords religious and social education to children from eleven different reservations. Reverend Brother Pich\u00e9, Principal, is missionary of the Piapot, Moosepotung and Pasqua Reservations. Rev. Fr. Guy de Brotergno has charge of the File Hills Colony and Agency, while the Assiniboino, Sioux, Wood Mountain, Moose Mountain, Oak River and Oak Lake Reservations are under the care of Rev. Fr. Laviollette.\n\nFr. Hugonard, O.M.I.\n\nPage 7\nThe Old Mission Church.\n\nFather Lignonard, Grey Nuns and pupils, with old school in background.\n\nThe Grey Nuns have been active in the school since 1864.\n\nPage 8\nAGNES McNABB - Well mannered, well groomed, and love of her work will get this girl places if she only perseveres. Agnes finds greater interest in drawing and painting than in philosophy and when she departs from the school we feel that an artist, and a good one at that, will be lost to us. We wish her success in the future and hope to see her continue her wonderful work in art.\n\nCATHERINE GOODFEATHER - \"Katy\" for short, is from Standing Buffalo Reservation. Leger, energetic, sportive, Katy took place in the ranks of baseball players. A diligent and ready worker, Catherine is able to extend the \"helping hand\" in any kind of manual work, cooking, baking, etc. In the coming future we wish her luck and happiness.\n\nELIZABETH THORNE - From Pasqua Reservation came to Lebret Indian School. Is a very quiet nature. Diligent at work and particularly talented for sewing and kitchenny. Elizabeth delights in playing baseball and swimming.\n\nJANE CHALICAN - Jane is a girl who likes \"easy going life\". Is especially fond of listening to the radio and singing cowboy songs. Her preferred spot is \"home\", which is on the Pispot Reservation. She excells in sewing, crocheting, and embroidery work.\n\nANTHONY PEIGAN of Pasqua Reserve. Tony was outstanding in a number of fields. Though not particularly brilliant in the classroom, his work was neatly and cheerfully done, and he has now completed his Grade VIII. He was a member of the school band, in which he played the bass, for many years. He excelled in sports, being a regular part of the school hockey and baseball teams. This year, he has been the lieutenant of the Cadet corps, and has also completed many years of service at the altar.\nVINCENT RYDER, of Assiniboine. Vincent has also completed his Grade VIII this year. Though rather quiet in his ways, Vincent is well known to all for his good work in every field. In the classroom, in the shop, or on the farm, his work is done well. He has always liked sports, and has been on school teams this year. Whatever his occupation later on, we feel sure he will be as orderly as he has been in school.\n\nHERBERT WALKER, of Assiniboine. He has completed Grade VII with a good record in the classroom. Herbie's work in school has been excellent. He has been for a number of years a member of the school band, where his departure will be felt somewhat. He has also been much interested in farm work and manual training.\n\nLOUIS DESHOMIE, of File Hills. Though not greatly interested in study, Louis is a good worker. He is very fond of horses, likes to work on the farm, and has had training in tractor operation. He has completed his Grade VII.\n\nWILLIAM ROPE, of Assiniboine. Wally, as he is commonly known, has always done excellent work in the classroom. He is rather quiet, and takes his time. He is good in carpentry and other branches of manual training. Also in the band.\n\nFRANK DESHOMIE, of File Hills. Frank is particularly fond of outside work, where he does very well. He is part of our hockey and baseball teams. He has also distinguished himself in service at the altar. If cowboys still existed, we would have no doubts about his future occupation.\n\nVICTOR DESHOMIE, of File Hills. Victor is also more interested in outdoor work than in study. His one great love is horses. He is a veteran member of the school band, and also plays the organ. He is of a pleasant and easy disposition, and has completed his sixth grade.\n\nHAROLD LASUSSE, of Sioux Reserve. Harold is known for his cheerfulness and his liking for every kind of fun. He likes outdoor work, is an outstanding hockey and baseball player, and also a member of the band. He has served at the altar for many years, and has now completed his sixth grade.\nFarewell!\n\nIt is for me a great pleasure to express, on behalf of all the graduates, a few words of gratitude to all the members of the Staff of the Lebret Indian School.\n\nNow that the time has come for us to leave the school in which we have lived for many years, we must look back upon what has been done for us, by the Fathers, the Sisters, by our teachers and supervisors, and by other members of the Staff. They have done everything in their power to give us a good education and to make us upright and good, and in this way enable us to take our place in life.\n\nFew schools, I am sure, could have offered us as many opportunities, and at the same time as much enjoyment. Through the kindness of all those who have been in charge of us, we have had many good times and our school days have been both useful and pleasant.\n\nBefore leaving, I am sure that all the graduates will join me, in promising to all those who have worked in our interest, that we will try ever to remain faithful to that which they have taught us, and that we will not forget them.\n\nOn behalf of all the graduates, then, I say farewell to the school, to the Staff and to the pupils who will follow us later; and I thank the Fathers, the Sisters and all the others who have worked for us, for everything that they have done.\n\nAnthony Peigan\n\nPage 11\nOUR classroom had quite a number of prizes at the exhibition this year. One girl alone (Agnes McNabb) took away eleven first prizes and one second prize; in fact, our School took first prize at Prince Albert and second at Regina.\n\nOCTOBER 5th - We had a short visit from our new Indian Commissioner and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Ostrander. They visited the different rooms and admired the work done by the children, after which tea was served.\n\nOCTOBER 6th - We had the visit of His Excellency Bishop Jordan from B.C. A banquet was served in his honor. Dorothy Dumont, Antoinette Dosomie, Rose Mary Tuukanow, Grocio Tusicapi and Mary Docta acted as waitresses.\n\nThe Missionary Fathers are kept quite busy lately with their bazaars, basket socials, etc. They seem very pleased with the cooperation of their flocks.\n\nOCTOBER 14th - Sunday. Several boys and girls went to Filo Hills' Colony for the unveiling of the War Memorial. His Excellency, Bishop Trocillier was presiding. Present also were Father Superior from the (Scholasticato) Seminary, Father Tourigny, Father Blanchetto, RR. FF., Principal, Laviolette and Dion. The school band was in attendance.\n\nNOVEMBER 1st - Opening of Annual Retreat preached by Reverend Father Duplain, C.M.I.\n\nNOVEMBER 3rd - Grand surprise! His Excellency Bishop Coudeur from Yellowknife is here with us. An impromptu musical program was given in his honor.\n\nNOVEMBER 21st - Being a special feast of the Grey Nuns, Sister Superior granted a holiday. The latter part of the afternoon was spent at the town hall taking in a show \"Billy The Kid\" which we all enjoyed.\n\nDECEMBER 3rd - Stella Crowe, Agnes McNabb and Helen Therese Bollogardo were quite excited for they were going to Regina. Quite an event as this occurs very rarely. The first went to see about her throat and the other two to have their eyes examined.\n\nDECEMBER 8th - IMMACULATE CONCEPTION. This afternoon, the teacher from Fort Qu'Appelle, Fort San, Lebret Village and our school assemble to discuss teachers' problems. There is also an exposition of the work done in creative art by the different pupils of the local schools.\n\nDECEMBER 23rd and 25th - Our Annual Christmas Concert took place. Attendance was good.\n\nDECEMBER 27th - It seems to be a tradition to spend a day over at the Seminary. Boys and girls had a very enjoyable time. Tobogganing, skiing, sleighing, snowball fighting, singing, etc., soon brought a perfect day to a close. Many thanks to our dear friends, the Fathers and Brothers of the Seminary. A special word of thanks to Brother Montgrand, (one of our own blood) for his tender devotedness.\n\nPage 12\nDECEMBER 28. - A Bingo Party in favor of the Junior Red Cross took place. A cheque of $50.00 was sent to the Red Cross Headquarters, Regina.\n\nJANUARY 13. - Today we had the privilege of assisting (here in our chapel) at a Solemn High Mass. The well-trained voices of the Brothers sang the Mass, \"Stella Matutina\" in four parts. The sermon was given by Reverend Father Superior of the Seminary.\n\nFEBRUARY 4. - Two of our boys, Patrick Goodpipo, and Billy Yuzicapi left for Saskatoon University to take an Agricultural course.\n\nFEBRUARY 10. - All the Missionary Fathers had gone on mission and Father Dion said 6:30 mass. Through some misunderstanding no one was sent for 9:30 Mass. After having been in the chapel for about twenty minutes what did we hear? No Mass! Some of the children were asked to go to the parish church but it was filled (basement) so we had to wait for Fr. Gorleu who was saying Mass there. We finally assisted at a low mass around eleven o'clock.\n\nFEBRUARY 11. - Helen Theresa Bellegarde played organ in the chapel for the first time. Glad to say that her playing was almost equal to that of Franz Schubert.\n\nFEBRUARY 14. - Here, everybody made the most of St. Valentine's Day. Cards were sent to each other and to top it off we had a card party in the evening. Our guests were Rev. Father Principal, RR. FF., Guy and Laviolot, also Mr. and Mrs. Bodard. Prizes were awarded to the lucky ones. A few of the girls had their fortunes told by Mrs. Bodard.\n\nFEBRUARY 18. - It being the feast of the Oblate Fathers we tried to sing our best. A holiday awaited us.\n\nAPRIL 26. - There was a musical amateur hour held in the Libret town hall. Father Laviolot acted as adjudicator. The senior and junior girls took part, also the band boys. Gracie Lavallee sang a solo.\n\nMAY 3. - The Indian Chiefs and Councillors from here, there and everywhere came to the school to discuss problems concerning the Indian welfare. A banquet was served on Sunday night followed by a musical entertainment. Everybody seemed to have enjoyed themselves during their short stay at the school, so we concluded by the speeches given by some of the chiefs. The hat was also passed around amongst themselves, the profit of which was to be given to the school children.\n\nMAY 4. - Mr. Doucet visited the classrooms, recreation halls, sewing rooms, etc., Tots and grown ups were glad to welcome him. His captivating stories won all hearts.\n\nMAY 19. - The Children from the nearby Reservations went home for the week end. It was a grand favor our Principal granted us. The remaining few went to places such as the Seminary and Fort Qu'Appelle where they took in a show entitled \"The Balls of Rosarita\". Sunday evening everyone was back in the best of spirits.\n\nMAY 24. - Sports' Day at Fort Qu'Appelle. The Cadets and band boys are the privileged ones and they go. The girls have to take the down hearted part and stay at school.\n\nJUNE 5. - Field Day at Fort Qu'Appelle.\n\nJUNE 5. - Children and singers go to Piapot for Flower Day.\n\nCAROLINE PEIGAN and MARY DOUGLIS.\nMUSIC AND DRAMA\n\nMUSICAL FESTIVAL\n\nThe second musical festival was held in the Lebret Town Hall on May 15. It proved to be a real success. Our adjudicator, Mr. Ian Barrie, was very pleased with the progress made since the last festival. Our school had a large number of competitors. Helen Thorsen Bollegarde and Gracie Lavall\u00e9e sang solos. Helen Thorsen came in first with 87% singing, \"Be the Best of Whatever You Are\", and was awarded a silver medal. Gracie sang \"Little Lamb\" and came in second with a mark of 86%. George Lavall\u00e9e played a \"Clarinet Polka\" and got very good marks, 93%. He was awarded a medal for best instrumental solo. Our band boys certainly played well. The band master, Rev. Father Lavolette has every reason to be proud of them. \"This band should be travelling and make itself known, as there are few (so you say), in the Province,\" remarked Mr. Barrie. The school choruses all had good marks, 82% and over. Although our school didn't take the trophy for the best chorus, glad to say that the Junior Girls, (Gr. V - VI) chorus under the direction of Sister E. Herauf took first place in their choruses with an average of 86-1/2%. Though the entries this year were double that of last year, we hope to have still more next year, because every one seems so encouraged with the results.\n\nANTOINETTE DESNOMIE, Grade VII.\n\nCHRISTMAS CONCERT\n\nOn December 25, we had the annual Christmas Concert for our parents. The play \"Enchanted Grotto\" under the direction of Sister Sue Christina was presented by the girls; the boys' band played several numbers among which the Overture \"Western Wonderland\"; the senior girls chorus under the direction of Sister J. Cosselin was praised by every one for its artistic performance of two choice Christmas Carols. A Spiritual Bouquet and gift were presented to Father Principal. An address was read by Charles Bollegarde for which Father Principal said a few words. He thanked all the actors and actresses for their good work and he particularly thanked the girls and Sister Directress for their wonderful singing.\n\nDOROTHY DUMONT, Grade VII.\n\nORGANISTS:\nMary Docta, Clara Minnie, Helen Th. Bollegarde, Dorothy Dumont, Rosalene Taylor, Anthony Paigan, Alfred Lavall\u00e9e, Victor Desnomie.\n\nBEGINNERS: Norma Capo, Alvina Capo.\n\nA special word of thanks to Mary Docta for the many services she has rendered in playing organ. Her readiness to help out the beginners was also very much appreciated.\n\nPage 14\nClassroom News\n\nJanuary 1963\n\nSince we have a new big classroom, we are very happy to be able to sit in the most beautiful room of our big school. We are also enjoying seeing new things on the first floor right next to the other classrooms. We really enjoy ourselves looking out the windows at the beauty of nature that we see on the south and east side of the lake, the flowers, the hills, the school building, and all the surrounding trees. But what makes us more happy is to hear the birds sing all through the day.\n\nShirley Bellwood\n\nFebruary 1963\n\nSome of us are happy to make their first collection during the year. We were unable to go to the sick by way of visiting for that part of the year. We are pleased to see our friends of yesterday, who are now in the following schools: Mrs. Herbert, Herbert Dyer, Ivan Gray, John B. Craigie, Bill Smith, and Charles Macdonald. Ronald Gray, Paul Johnston, William W. Taylor, Robert Macdonald, Gordon Taylor, William W. Taylor, Albert Smith, Anthony Bell, Killiard Armstrong, Harold Cox, Albert Armstrong, Marvin Adams, Alvin Armstrong, Lee Armstrong, Earl Cappo, Cecelia Armstrong, Alice Brown, Anna Lamont, Pat Ann Orr, Louise Johnson, Patricia Armstrong, Anita Armstrong, Jerry Poppo, Ivan Gray, Kenneth Armstrong, Yvonne Poppo, Lila Poppo.\n\nP.S. Remember \"Sunday\"\nThe sickness - We were very sorry when we heard that some of our companions were sick with scarlet fever... Just think!... Six weeks in bed for little boys and girls who don't like to keep quiet... Happily after three long months they were all back in class... But too bad some had forgotten many little things under their pillows... What do you think?... Should they be sick again to pick up what they have lost?\n\nMother Majhanta\n\nThe Red Cross - Until now the little ones of Grade I felt rather left out in the help our school was glad to give to the J.R.C. So we were all enrolled in December. The name of our branch really means something: \"rainbow\". Guess why?... Because at the beginning of the school year we often see tears in our class... but they never last long. With the daily sunshine it makes a rainbow. Soon we are all happy and smiling.\n\nShirley Cappo\n\nGRADE III CLASS\n\nWith the help of our teacher we Grade III pupils put up two post-office stations in our classroom. We named one, St. John Bosco P.O., and the other, St. Theresa P.O. Each contains 24 boxes. This gives to each one of the forty-three pupils one mail-box number. The five extra ones are for the Reverend Fathers and the Sisters. Twenty-four pupils belong to St. John Bosco P.O. and nineteen to St. Theresa P.O.\n\nEach pupil receive a letter once in a while, from their teacher or from their schoolmates. Here is one of the smart answers received:\n\nSt. Theresa P.O., Lebret, May 1946\n\nDear Sister:\n\nI was so pleased to get another letter from my devoted teacher. Many thanks for the nice letter.\n\nI belong to Muscowpeting Reserve. I expect to spend my Summer Vacations at home with my parents. Very likely I will be looking after my little sister, and I will help mother, too. Richard and Clarence will help my father with his work.\n\nBy the way I was so delighted to find that sweet little picture and prayers which you had the kindness to send me. I will say again, I thank you so much for your kind letter and kind pictures of the little Jesus. May God bless our teacher.\n\nFrom your grateful pupil,\n\nBonnie Poitras\n\nPage 16\nOUR MID-YEAR EXAM AND GOLD MEDAL AWARDS - In our mid-year exam those excelling in Arithmetic are: Irene Jusiciapi with 95%, Violet Blocksiaux 90%, Gerald Anaquod 87%, Thelma Desnomie 87%, Donna Poitras 87%, Florence Jack 87%, Marine Desnomie 86%, and David Obey 86%.\n\nIn spelling, Gerald Anaquod topped them all by 100%, while Walter Lavallee had 97%, Wilfrid Dubois 97%, Lucy Desnomie 96%, and Margaret Happa 94%.\n\nThe Gold Medal Awards went to the following: The gold medal for first prize in studies to Gerald Anaquod with 96%; the gold medal for enthusiasm to Irene Jusiciapi who drew the highest letter; the gold medal for good conduct to Irene John, and the gold medal for general application to Marine Desnomie.\n\nGRADE THREE HAS FABULOUS ARTISTS AND AUTHORS - Our best artists in pencil or crayon are: Walter Lavallee, Lucy Desnomie, Irene John, Gerald Anaquod, Willie Dumont, Daniel Nokusis, and Patrick Yuhaka. We also have a promising author by the name of Archie Goodwill. We were asked lately to give a composition on the Prophets of the Old Testament. Within half an hour, the best one came forth on \"Daniel in the Lion's Den\", by Archie.\n\nNURSERY WORK - Under the direction of our dear Sister Michaud, in charge of the general sewing-room department, Gladys Essie, Florence Obey, Margaret Happa, Donna Poitras, Irene Jusiciapi, Florence Jack, Thelma Desnomie, Stella Dubois and Therese Sayer, excelled in knitting, plain-sewing, cross-stitch, embroidery, buttonholing, etc.\n\nFollowing are some of the articles accomplished under the patient and kind supervision of Sister Michaud: Dolls' dresses, scarfs, muffs, caps, underwear, buffet set, aprons, cross-stitch for wall decoration, etc.\n\nOUR PLAYING MATCHES - Last week Lucy Desnomie and Walter Lavallee were chosen as captains of the match; it went pretty hot for some time, but the result was that Walter's army won six against two along with the captain for a final defeat. The winners were Walter Lavallee, Gerald Anaquod, Johnny Bellegerde, Margaret Happa, Norma Lavallee and Wilfrid Dubois.\n\nTHE ANNUAL FESTIVAL - Some of our best singers took part in the Second Musical Festival at Lebre. They sang \"The Cuckoo\" and \"Rain upon the roof\", with a result of 82 and 84 marks. We were beaten by one mark by the fort qu'Appelle Chorus.\nINTERMEDIATE GIRLS' CLASS -\n\nA new manufacture of \"papier mach\u00e9\" has developed during the year. Many a broken dish has been put into decorative flower pots, rough pieces of wood into nice silvered frames.\n\nThe tissue paper wrappers of fruit have been mixed into flower paste, stuck on milk bottles, to form attractive flower vases, particularly when broken pieces of small mirrors have been placed on. Ash trays from covers, old pyrex coffee pots into fish, toy animals, fruit dish filled with different fruit the top of jam cans into frames.\n\nThe finishing touch of oil painting, the gold bronze and silver aluminum, all has been worked by the girls of Grade 4 and 5. None of the girls knew the difference between oil paint and water colour. It took quite a long time to convince them that oil paint on fingers or on clothes doesn't go off as easily as water colour.\n\nThe effect and nature of turpentine had been explained and in spite of it all one day a girl forgot with a good intention most probably. She put her two hands down in the oil can to take the hard crust formed on the top. Lifting it up to show her companions how smart she was, When Sister Marcoux happened to come in she immediately asked her to go and wash her hands, saying that she wanted to start right away. Sister took the occasion to teach her in the most effective way this time that oil paint cannot be washed away by water. Many a time she had heard it before, but never was the lesson so well understood and remembered.\n\nThe other girls understood it was a trick on Pauline and waited anxiously ten minutes for her reappearance. At last she comes. She acknowledged that when alone in the \"cubby room\", she recalled that water cannot take away oil paint.\nThe badge system has stimulated many a girl to graduate in the three year course of the Indian Affairs branch. A very great improvement has been made to facilitate this course. It is the combination of the two sewing rooms. We have a peel manufacturing department now with its different sections. In fact, every girl passes from one place to another quite automatically, from sewing, mending, ironing, pressing, buttonholing, dyeing, carding, spinning, knitting, weaving, beadwork and embroidery.\n\nTo mention only a few names, Bernice Jasnomie excelled in sewing. She sewed 35 coats in a month. Father Principal took the occasion to prove to us girls how he appreciates the work we do by giving her a sum of money. Mary Docta is preparing herself to be an excellent seamstress. She has tested her work is well finished, and she seems to have a little speeding motor in her hands. Beatrice Bear is still quite small, but she feels big when Sister chooses her to repair a tear on a very fine garment. The art of mending has penetrated through her fingers quite young. Dorothy Lamont seems to have a strong taste for embroidery, cut-work, and tries to beat everybody in sewing. Irene Nokwisi and Caroline Peigan decided not to be surpassed. Buttonholing has been in style this year on account of the hundreds of snow-suits, coat-suits, and pants that have been re-modelled from Army and Air Force clothing. Sixty snow-suits for the medium-sized girls have been made by the big girls, thirty-five for the small girls, and forty-five pants for the boys. How many buttonholes did we make? I don't know. It's too much to count them. One sure thing about it we made some. You can ask almost any girl to make a buttonhole now.\nThe knitting machine has been oiled many a time this year. If we recall well, 91 pairs of stockings for boys were made, 36 pairs for the small girls, 60 pairs for the medium-sized girls; Gracie Lavallee, Florence Rockthunder, Ruby Desjarlais and Gladys Habbitskin to mention the best, have shown great skill on the machine. Another improvement worthy of being mentioned is the new electric mending machine which Father Dion bought at the beginning of the year to spare the girls in mending. What a wonderful invention! Rose-Mary Tuckanow is not afraid of \"electricity\" nor of big holes in garments. She can master both in the wink of an eye. Many other girls passed through this section with success. To mention a few: Ruby Desjarlais, Florence Rockthunder and Gracie Lavallee.\n\nWeaving has also attracted the girls with great enthusiasm. Mary Doota can teach to younger ones, she can give demonstrations to the public, entertain visitors, and so forth. Young girls of Grade 4 had a start in weaving this year with a little loom they had in the classroom; Pearl Deegan is promising for the future.\n\nCOOKING -- Since cooking is of outstanding importance to maintain a happy tune, Sister Neumier took as her motto to teach the girls everything that she knows. Every girl from the age of twelve makes two or three stages in the kitchen during the year. \"There is no place like the kitchen for me\" is the big girls' motto.\n\nIt will be with a feeling of pride that we will cook to help our mother during the summer vacation. We learnt how to make appetizing dishes from what is left over from one meal, for instance, apple and orange peelings can make good marmalade, hard crust can make good bread soup, etc.\n\nOld cow meat will always be tough meat, won't it? We happened to know that by Gracie Yusicapi's experience. One day when coming from the kitchen after having cooked steak a long time, she met a sister who told her how hard she had found the steak. She asked Gracie who had cooked the meat. Gracie humbly answered \"the stove\", but it might have been an old cow, Sister, and old cow is always tough meat.\n\nIn spite of all the dishes we broke, and the food we burnt, nevertheless we learnt something. No doubt about that since several girls obtained their badges in cooking year. Many thanks to our kind Sister Neumier.\n\nPage 20\nDAIRYING - Mr. Joseph Muloin, the school herdsman, was again in charge of the cattle this year. Under his direction the boys began milking in November, and they have milked between seventeen and twenty-five cows till the middle of May. They were in this way a great help to Mr. Muloin. The boys also brush their cows twice a day, and once in a while they feed the cows and clean the barn. Since May the cows are milked with the machine, which a few of the boys are learning to operate.\n\nPOULTRYING - The chicken coop is also in the hands of Mr. Muloin, although it is expected that Patrick Fourhorns, one of the boys, will replace him soon. There are about three hundred laying hens in the chicken coop, besides two hundred pullets. Throughout the year two boys went twice a day to feed the chickens, clean the coop, and gather the eggs. Many boys thus won a badge in poultrying.\nGARDENING - This year the garden has been greatly reduced in size. The part behind the barn has now become part of the large potato field. The Senior Boys with their teacher have taken charge of the garden. The baseball team has taken over the care of the lawns and trees of the school grounds.\n\nCARPENTRY - Mr. Joe Desjarlais is our instructor in carpentry. This work is done in the school shop, one day a week, in groups of eight or ten. In the past much time was given to the building of small wooden articles, such as stools, cupboards, toolboxes, and so on. This year most of the work is done with the school carpenter. There are always rooms or buildings to remodel, repairs to be done, furniture to build. In this way the work done by the boys is valuable both to them and to the school. Among the outstanding pieces built this year are three beautiful oak altars, built by George Lavallee. They will soon replace the altars now in use in the chapel.\n\nFARMING - The school farm is under the management of Mr. William Lecree. The boys work on the farm at the different jobs that each season offers, such as sowing, haying, harvesting. The boys of Grades VII and VIII are also learning tractor operation.\n\nIn February and March, Billy Fusicapi of File Hills and Patrick Goodpipe of Sioux Reserve went to Saskatoon to take a six-week course in Agriculture at the University of Saskatchewan.\n\nClarence Poitras.\nACTIVITIES\n\nSTUDENT COUNCIL: THE SENIOR BOYS STUDENT COUNCIL has been organized in February to unite together the different activities of the boys outside of the classroom. It is composed of a number of committees, each under the direction of an officer, and each in charge of some activity of the Senior Boys. We will deal more fully with the work performed in the Athletic Committee, in charge of sports, and in the Altar Boys Committee, in charge of service at the altar. Two activities, the Cadet Corps and the Military Band, are not part of the Council.\n\nIn April, the Council organized and presented a programme of songs, music and games in the Senior Boys' playroom, with Clarence Rogers, president of the Council, as master of ceremonies. The programme consisted of band instrumental music, tricks, jokos and band selections. Father Principal and Father Guy afterwards spoke to the audience.\n\nALTAR BOYS: THE EXCELLENT WORK previously carried on by Mr. P. Aronsult, former Senior Boys' Supervisor, in this field, was forcibly more or less discontinued after his departure in January. We sincerely hope that the altar Boys may secure, in the future, a director who will give them an instruction as valuable as that which they have received in the past.\n\nMasters of Ceremonies and Communion-bearers this year were: Anthony Piegan, William Bollogordo, Richard Poitras, Gordon John, Arthur Obay, John James Tawiyaka and Charles Bollogordo.\n\nAcolytes and Torchmasters were: Georges Kniyesawatun, Gilbert Bollogordo, Frank Dumont, Percy Mandy, Roderick Amoskun, Master Techan, Kenneth Corrigan & Michael Piegan.

Major Vint, of the Regina Headquarters, visited the corps in October, December, February and March, and was also present at the Annual Inspection in May. During his visits, he helps the corps with its work and sees what progress is being made.\n\nSgt. Major Austin, in December, gave a 3-day course in Signalling.\n\nThe Annual Inspection of the Corps took place on May 30th, in the Junior Boys' playground. The Inspecting Officer was Major Jardine, District Cadet Officer, accompanied by two members of his staff, Captain Pearson, and Sgt. Major Vint.\n\nOur Corps had first place in its group at the 1946 Inspection.\n\nPublic Appearances:\n\nIn November, the corps was in attendance at the Inauguration of the Memorial Hall, Labrador, where a banquet was served in honor of the returned servicemen of the town.\n\nOn May 24th, the Cadets took part in a parade at Fort Qu'Appelle, on the occasion of the Sports' Day. The parade was followed by a Field and Truck Meet, in which our corps was awarded $15.50 in prizes. These prizes went to Arthur Oden, Patrick Poirier, Richard Poitras, Victor Tachon, Vincent Ryder, and to the baseball team.\n\nAnnual Camp:\n\nLast year three cadets of our corps, Georges Levallois, William Yuzicopi and Clarence Poitras, attended the cadet camp held at Prince Albert in July. Many others have volunteered to do so again this year. The camp will be at Dunham, from June 29th to July 9th inclusively.\n**BASEBALL**\n\nMr. Edward Doll is the coach of the school's baseball team. A league has been formed in the district, with Lebret, Fort Qu'Appelle, Balcarres and the Indian School competing. Father Piche has donated a cup for the league championship.

Sometimes we put the 15 biggest boys on one side and the rest on the other. It's quite a tough game, and the big boys usually win. In rugby we usually pick up teams, and it is played rather rough, but we have a lot of fun chasing each other for the ball.\n\n*Swimming.* - We had our first swim on May 28th. The water was quite cold, but we wanted to swim badly. We enjoyed ourselves for about 15 minutes, and made sure that everyone had had a dip. We go swimming almost every day now.\n\n*Boxing.* - We started boxing this winter, and we already have seen some great matches. The ones we prefer in the ring are Wilfrid Payant and Clarence Anckun. We have now six pairs of gloves, and we have great fun watching the small boys' bouts.\n\n*Hunting.* - In the fall and in early spring rabbit hunting is our favorite pastime. We go out with our supervisor or teachers. In one afternoon with the Brothers of the Scholasticato we killed 14 rabbits. The Brothers had rifles and were giving us a chance to shoot. We had a lot of fun chasing the rabbits from bush to bush.\n\n*Fishing.* - In early spring as soon as the ice is gone the fishing season begins. Perch are more common, and once in a while a boy happens to catch a jackfish. The boys are always losing hooks and have to buy new ones. We now fish every day since the perch have started to bite.\n\n*Clubhouse.* - On winter evenings and wet days the bigger boys go to the clubhouse to play pool. We have two tables in excellent condition. Sexton and Nigger are our favorite games.\n\n*Field Days.* - A field day was held at Fort Qu'Appelle on June 3rd, in which all the schools of the district competed. The Indian School won two silver cups: The Intermediate Cup, which we owe to the efforts of Arthur Oboy, Herbie Strongeagle, John Bellegarde, Walter Lavallee and Victor Tachan; and the Grand Aggregate Cup, which was awarded to the Indian school for having the highest total in all events.\n\nRibbons were won by Arthur Oboy, Herbie Strongeagle, John Bellegarde, Walter Lavallee, Victor Tachan, Patrick Fourhorns, Vincent Ryder, John James Tewiyaka and Billy Bellegarde.\n\nMedals were also awarded to Arthur Oboy and Herbie Strongeagle for having obtained the highest total in their age group.\n\nBILLY BELLEGARDE, Gr.

We hope that the lateness will not lessen our best Easter Wishes for one and all. May the Risen Christ fill your hearts with His peace and love.\n\nIn our first issue we aimed at giving a description of our school and outlining the work carried on by the children in the different departments.\n\nIn this issue we have just gathered up the threads, as it were, and continued on with our everyday accomplishments.\n\nMany letters of appreciation came in after people had read our first paper. These letters made us want to prepare another paper. We hope that as much pleasure is gleaned from these pages. We would like, too, to hear from our former classmates. THE EDITOR.\n\nSCHOOL COLORS: BLUE AND WHITE\n\nSCHOOL PATRONESSES: KATERI TEKAKWITHA and SAINT CATHERINE OF SIENNA.\nIn this year of the Diocesan Centenary\n\nThe pupils of\n\nSt. Catherine's Indian Day School, Duncan, B.C.\n\ndedicate St. Catherine's Review\n\nTo our beloved Bishop\n\nThe Most Reverend John C. Cody, D.D.\n\nBishop of British Columbia\n\nThe \"Great Priest\" visits the Cowichans\n\nThe year was 1855. Bishop Demers had been three years in his Victoria Diocese and he was eager to pay a visit to his dear friends, the Indians of the East Coast of Vancouver Island. In 1842 when he had visited the Salish tribes along the Lower Fraser River he had met some of the Cowichans from the Island. Those had brought the message of the Black Church to their people. In 1843 some of them had been at Fort Victoria when Father Bolduc offered Holy Mass for the first time at that point. In 1850 Father Lemfrit had come among them and baptized many and taught them to pray to God. In 1852 another priest was assigned to them and now, in 1855, the \"Great Priest\" as they called their bishop came to visit them.\n\nThe best hut in the village was prepared for their guest. Crushed oyster and clam shells were scattered around. A huge pile of blankets was prepared as a seat of honor. The Indians brought the Bishop and two priests from Victoria by canoe. As they rounded the headland and entered Cowichan Bay they fired a musket to tell the waiting tribesmen of their approach. When the canoe was at last swung with a flourish in to the beach, a long line of Indians, men, women and children stretched from the village to the water's edge to give welcome to the Bishop and to shake his hand.\n\nAt length, seated on his throne with his Indian children about him, Bishop Demers answered many questions: Where had he been in the years since they had seen him at Langley? How many people had he visited? The Bishop answered their question; he told them of his visit to Rome where he had seen the Great White Father. He told them that he had spoken to the Great Chief about his Christians of Vancouver Island and that he had brought to them his blessing. At these words the crowd of Indians knelt and with foreheads on the ground, received the blessing sent them from on High.\nMARCH 5 We have a new District Nurse, Miss M. Leighton, taking the place of Miss Hayward, who retired because of sickness.\n\nMARCH 14 Ramona Underwood wins second prize for her T. B. Booklet and $3.00 with a badge. One of the pupils of Koksi-lan School wins first prize.\n\nAPRIL 7 We boys of St. Catherine's play softball against the boys of St. Louis. Score 41-21. We won!\n\nAPRIL 27 Mr. Morrison completes the kitchen press.\n\nMAY 20 Twenty-eight children make their first Holy Communion. After Mass we go to school and have our breakfast.\n\nMAY 27 PROCESSION DAY. Many Indians from different reserves were present, and also many white people. His Excellency, Bishop Cody, comes and carries the Blessed Sacrament.\n\nJUNE 21 The team of St. Catherine's play softball against the girls of Kuper. St. Catherine's won. Score 41-40.\n\nJUNE 20 Reverend Father Lemmens is leaving the Cowichans. Raymond James reads the offices and Andrew Underwood presents a gift. The present is a box of cigars. We all know Father Lemmens likes to smoke. The students had a hard time to get the cigars because it is during war time.\n\nOCTOBER 5 Miss Edwards visits the school and is very interested in Roy George's little bench with Indian designs on each side of it. Roy made the bench and painted the design himself.\n\nOCTOBER 30 Reverend Mother General and Reverend Mother Lillian arrive in Duncan and come to visit us for a while.\n\nNOVEMBER 31 We have a visitor. It is Major Mackay, our Indian Commissioner.\n\nNOVEMBER 9 We have our X-rays for T. B.\n\nDECEMBER 2 Our visitors are Dr. Plenderleith and Mr. Peake.\n\nDECEMBER 11 We are vaccinated against smallpox. The Doctor and nurse vaccinated us in the kitchen of the school.\n\nFEBRUARY 1 Our furnace is burnt out.\nFEBRUARY 4-20 Grades 6-8 had to carry on classes at St. Ann's.\n\nFEBRUARY 22 Our new furnace is fixed but there are few in attendance. I guess they didn't know the school was open.\n\nAPRIL 5 Most of the pupils of the Junior and Senior Classes attend the funeral Mass of Brother Giles at St. Edward's Church.\n\nAPRIL 8 Reverend Father Bradley, Superintendent of Indian Missions, comes to our school.\n\nAPRIL 9 Father LeClair is always happy to bring people to see our school, and today he brings two distinguished visitors, Reverend Father J. Scannell, Provincial of the Oblate Fathers, and Reverend F. O'Grady, Principal of Kamloops Indian School. We are glad to see them, and they tell us we have a very nice school.\n\nNorman Joe ---- Raymond James.\n\nST. CATHERINE'S ALTAR BOYS\n\nAre we proud of our altar boy!! I'll say we are. They certainly carried off the ceremonies of Holy Week in grand style and turned out 100% for each service. It took lots of practice and playtime, but it was worth it. Keep up the grand work boys!!\n\nSunday or Monday he's up with the lark,\nBe it raining or fine, daylight or dark;\nNo matter how early you're at the church door,\nYou'll find this young altar boy there long before.\n\nHis manner is charming, he's merry and bright,\nAnd keeps to the letter the rules of the Knight;\nThey say that at school he's the best in his class\nAnd none can excel him to serve Holy Mass.\n\nHis surplice is spotless, his soutane is neat;\nHe's polished and groomed from the head to the feet;\nHe does nothing with the greatest of care,\nRemembering the church is the real house of prayer.\n\nWe missed him one morning, and to our surprise\nThe reason we learned from other small boys.\nThey said it was true, or they heard so at least,\nThat he'd gone into college to become a priest.\n\nThen ten golden years seemed winged to pass,\nA young priest is robed on the altar for Mass,\nHis features are beaming with heavenly joy,\nAnd there once again is our once altar boy!\n\nD.L.\nDEAR READERS:\n\nHow about coming to see our sewing room? You'll be very surprised to see what the girls have been doing.\n\nDo come and see our dresses, skirts, blouses, pyjamas, jackets and jumpers. We sew them on the machine. There are three machines in the sewing room.\n\nWe have some other things to do too. Sometimes we work in wool, and we knit stockings and sweaters. We have two carding machines, two small spinning machines and one large one. We have two big tables and three big benches in the sewing room, all made by the boys in their shop.\n\nWe go to the sewing room at 10:30 in the morning and stay till noon.\n\nWe can get a lot in that time if we want to. Sometimes we listen to the radio when we are working in the sewing class. There is a statue of St. Rita standing right on top of the piano. It is very pretty.\n\nThere is an amount of different material in the press. There is also thread to match.\n\nAn ironing board stand is close to the door. We are proud to have two electric irons, and also two little stands where many books and little boxes may be put. There is a big press where we keep our dresses. The boys make the presses and the ironing boards too. There are two blackboards on each side of the room, and a thunder bird, made by Alec James, is on top of the blackboards.\n\nWe are hoping that pretty soon the boys will make cupboards for the girls to keep the articles that they are working in, as our boxes are a little too small and our work gets crushed. What do you say, boys?\n\nWe are very proud of St. Catherine's School, so how about coming to see our sewing room? We'll be glad to show you around any time you care to stroll along.\n\nMary Underwood.\n\nWe go to the sewing room at 10:30 a.m., while the Junior and Primary classes go out for recess for fifteen minutes.\n\nIn the sewing room I am making a blue pullover sweater and I'm still hoping to finish it soon. After I finish the sweater I will try to make a skirt to match the sweater and a blouse to go with the skirt. When I get\nthem all finished I will buy them for myself and wear them for school. Maybe it will be too small for me. Then it will fit my sister. Maybe when my sister starts sewing, she will make something for herself.\n\nMany of the girls have made lots of things and bought them for themselves, and some of them are wearing the things that they have made since they started school. Other girls make small clothes for their sisters or brothers, and the parents buy them, as they are finished.\n\nSarah Ryan.\n\nEvery day -- Monday to Friday -- we go to the sewing room to learn how to knit. After we know how to knit, we practice using the sewing machines. Then we start making dresses. We make dresses for ourselves, sometimes for our little sisters. We choose the kind of material we want, and when we get stuck we have to call on our teacher and ask her what to do next. I have made three dresses for myself and a blouse and a skirt for my little sister. Now I am making a pair of pyjamas. They are just about finished.\n\nI am going to make a dress next. In the summer I go to the States and pick strawberries and hops and when I come home I have lots of money. Then I'll buy the dresses that I have made in school, and then I'll wear them. Our parents can hardly believe that we made the dresses ourselves, and we did. WE ARE PROUD OF OURSELVES!\n\nEvelyn Wilson.\n\nDear Parents of the children,\n\nSay! how about coming to see our sewing room to see what we have done during our sewing period. Any time you have a chance to come, we will be very glad to see you here.\n\nI think St. Catherine's School is the luckiest school to have such a lovely sewing room.\n\nOur teacher helps us in making dresses, skirts, blouses and pyjamas. We have three new sewing machines and many different kinds of materials and patterns.\n\nSometimes we work on raw wool. There are two carding machines and three small spinning machines and a big one. When it is all done, then we make sweaters, socks, caps and mitts.\n\nWe have two lovely cutting tables and three benches, six chairs and two presses made by the senior boys. We put our dresses in the presses when we have finished them.\nWe have two electric irons. The ironing board was installed by the boys.\n\nOur sewing room and our sewing is very much up to date. Do come and see it.\n\nEvelyn Tommy\n\nOne of our bright boys brings in this cartoon for our sewing room. Is this a hint, boys, for us to start speeding up on a set of sweaters for the football team?!?\n\nWORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT\nAFTER OUR LAST PAPER\n\nFrom Mother Mary Mildred, Provincial Superior of the Sisters of St. Ann\n\n\"Dear Editor,\n\nMy sincere congratulations on your first issue of St. Catherine's Review! I have read with pleasure every line, from the first to the last. We are already looking forward to the next number.\n\nYour desire to give pleasure to all your former pupils will, I hope, meet realization in the promotion of a united school spirit which will endure.\n\nMay God bless your endeavors.\"\n\nSt. Ann's Academy, Victoria, Yours very sincerely,\nApril 12, 1945\nMother Provincial\nFrom Doctor William Plenderleith, Inspector of Schools:\n\n\"Dear Miss Underwood:\nI wish to thank you for your copy of the \"St. Catherine's Review\" which I received by mail today.\nThis publication is a credit to your editorial staff and to the teachers of St. Catherine's School.\nThe artists and reporters, as well as all the other contributors, deserve special commendation for their excellent work.\nTrusting that you and the other students will take the fullest advantage of the excellent educational opportunities and guidance offered to you at the St. Catherine's School.\"\n\nTHE NEW FURNACE\n\nHolidays generally make us happy but not this time. When we received the news that our old furnace had broken down and that school would be closed for about three weeks we all felt sorry because we are trying hard to get to High School, and three weeks is a long time to stay out of school. Sister told us to pray that something would happen so we could carry on our classes. Sister Superior of St. Ann's was kind enough to let us use one of the rooms downstairs so grade six, seven and eight went to school at St. Ann's.\n\nOnce we got settled, we started working hard. We did our science experiments on air, and as the boys of St. Ann's had not done these experiments yet, Sister took both schools together. We found these experiments very interesting.\n\nReverend Father LeClair goes to St. Ann's twice a week to teach Catechism, so we attended these classes and liked it.\n\nOne thing we missed from our school was the six big blackboards, because we had only one little board, which was painted black, 4' x 4'.\n\nAt our school we have no reference books, so Sister took the opportunity to teach us research work while we were at St. Ann's. We borrowed the World Book and the books of Knowledge, and each looked up the work of a different scientist and also work on one industry. At first we did not like it, but when we learned how to look up things, we began to be interested in research work.\n\nLouise Underwood.\n\nNEW NURSE\n\nOur New Nurse is Miss Leighton. She replaces Miss G. Hayward. Miss Hayward was sick. Miss Leighton is a good nurse. She goes around with a car loaded with medicine. She comes to our school to ask if there are any of our family sick. If there is someone sick, she'll go to our home and give some medicine to the ones looking...\"\nWe have a piano in our school. So every Friday afternoon we go into the sewing room because that is where the piano is kept. We learn to sing many nice hymns and songs.\n\nMany of the senior boys and girls helped to sing the Midnight Mass. We think we can sing pretty well. The primary class has a nice time Tuesday afternoon listening to their program over the radio. We hear them very often from the Junior room and we enjoy it too.\n\nDavid Bartleman.\n\nOUR SCHOOL\n\nOur school is a very fine one. Inside we have four large rooms, three classrooms and one sewing room, where the senior girls learn how to sew, knit and make dresses.\n\nI am in the Junior room. There are 43 boys and girls in our room. Our boards have pretty pictures all around. There are six big lights which we use so it is dark during the winter. There are five big windows in our room too, and blackboards in the back and front and along one side of the wall.\n\nDownstairs where we eat our lunch and play when it is too wet outside, we have many games. I like to play Jacks best. We also have a big play yard with ten swings. The senior and junior classes play baseball most of the time. Father often comes and plays football with the boys. They are lucky!\n\nAudrey Underwood.\n\nVISITORS\n\nWe had just changed classes for sewing one morning when we heard someone talking in the hall. Some of us knew the voice. It was Doctor Plenderleith, the Inspector of the Public Schools, who has been our inspector for two years. We thought he came to the school to inspect, but Doctor Plenderleith did not come to inspect. He brought us another visitor, Mr. Peake, Principal of the Duncan Grammar School, who wanted to see our school and our work.\n\nThey visited each classroom. They went into the sewing room to see the girls at sewing. They saw the dresses that the girls made. They said everything was very nice. They went down to the Manual Training to see the boys at woodwork, and were very interested in their work.\n\nMiss Edwards came to visit our school on October 13th. She brought with her a big parcel. We were all wondering what it was. Miss Edwards gave it to Sister. All the girls asked what it was. Sister did not tell us, but told us to unwrap the parcel and find out. We unwrapped it and found a nice big statue of St. Rita. It is now on the piano in our sewing room. We thank Miss Edwards for her kindness to us.\n\nSarah Ryan.\nOUR MINIMS\n\nWe have a picture of a farm in our room. There is a farm house and a barn in the picture. There is a blue lake behind the barn. The horses and dogs drink in the lake. The geese and ducks like to swim in the lake. Beside the lake we have thirteen trees. The green field is beside the lake too.\n\n- Johnny Underwood.\n\nThe farm house is green and red. The farmer and his wife and his children live in the house. The barn is red and brown. The horses and cows are in the barn. Sometimes the sheep go into the barn. The ducks do not go into the barn.\n\n- Ida James.\n\nOn the farm there are horses and cows. On the farm there are goats, sheep, dogs and many other animals. I like the jersey cow best because it gives me good clean milk.\n\n- Sadie Johnny.\n\nA MINIM'S DAY\n\nI wake up early and I jump out of bed. I wash my face and my hands. I eat breakfast. Then I am ready for school.\n\n- Pearl Thomas.\n\nI go to school on the bus.\n\n- Sam Henry.\n\nI like to read and count and play ball at school.\n\n- Annie Page.\n\nI like to read about Betty and Fred. Do you?\n\n- Jean Jack.\n\nI like to read and work at school. I have read two books. I like Peek too. I like school. I take Helen to school.\n\n- Junior Tom.\n\nThe bus gets here. We get on the bus. When I get home I help my mother.\n\n- Marion Ryan.\n\nAfter school I help my mother. When I am finished helping my Mother I go to play ball. Then I have my supper. Then I say my prayers and I go to bed.\n\n- Marie Alphonse.\nOUR GARDEN\n\nBags of potatoes, carrots and peas,\nFor dinners and recess to eat at our ease,\nAll that is needed for you and me,\nAnd plenty for others across the sea.\n\nSpring is the time for outdoor sports and for outdoor work too.\nWe have quite a large garden beside our school. In it are planted\npotatoes, carrots, onions, beets, turnips and parsnips. We use these\nproducts for our cooking classes. These vegetables help to keep us\nhealthy.\n\nWhen school opens in September all the vegetables are ready to\nbe taken from the ground. From this time until they are all gone,\nyou will see the children nibbling on raw carrots at recess, noon hour,\nand even after school.\n\nIf there are any vegetables left over at the end of the year,\nSister tells the children to bring bags and get what they want out of\nthe bins to take home, so that they will not go to waste.\n\nJosephine Bartleman\n\nEXHIBITIONS.\n\nOn Pentecost Sunday, May 20, 1945, we had an exhibition of our\nyear's work in the classrooms of St. Catherine's School.\n\nAfter Mass the school was open for the friends and parents of the\npupils. In the afternoon it was open to the public. There were about\na hundred white people who came, interested in seeing the work of the\nIndian children.\n\nAll the classrooms were very attractive. Half way down the black-\nboards were samples of the pupils' work of the year - Spelling, Arith-\nmetic, Grammar, Language, Social Studies, Letters, etc. These were\nmade into booklets, which were strung across the blackboards on a string.\nThere were also booklets on Transportation, Geography and History and\nour Mass and Sacrament books in Catechism. Under the blackboards we\nhad Agriculture, Physical, Product and Manufacturing maps of Canada.\nOther projects that helped to decorate the room were \"Protect our\nForests\" and \"Our Health Project\".\n\nAll the sewing, knitting and embroidery was displayed in the sew-\ning room. In the manual training room all the boys' woodwork was dis-\nplayed.\n\nWe are having a busy time this year getting ready for the big Can-\nadian Exhibition at Victoria. We are also preparing work for the\nIndian Art Exhibit at the Provincial Museum at Victoria. So you see\nwe are very busy and important people.\n\nRona Williams.\nOUR KITCHEN\n\nOur kitchen surely had been topsy-turvy for three years because Mr. Morrison, the woodwork teacher, could only work in his spare time, making our cupboards. He completed them on May 31st, 1945. That day was a happy one for the Sisters and the girls. Would you like to see it? Well here is a drawing.\n\nThe cupboard extends from one end of the kitchen to the other. It is 19\u00bd feet in length, and is built right up to the ceiling. It is a deep cream in color and decorated with black. The knobs and butterfly hinges are black and make a very pretty decoration. The press is divided into three sections as you can see from our sketch. In the first section is kept all the dishes for the children\u2014cups, bowls, plates, etc. Spoons, knives, and forks are kept in the drawers. In the lower part of the first section are the cocoa pots, pans, and other heavy utensils. In the second section there is nothing as yet. In the third part is kept all the cooking utensils. It is always tidy. In the lower section are large tins pasted cream to match our cupboards. Printed in black letters are the contents of each tin\u2014sugar, cocoa, flour, etc.\n\nOur kitchen can accommodate sixteen pupils. We now have four cooking tables and sixteen stools. This year we received only part of the cooking equipment, but are hoping that next year we will get the remainder, and then the cooking class will be in full swing.\n\nThe girls, under the direction of our sewing teacher, made aprons and caps. On the caps are embroidered in green silk the initials J. C. S. They look very nice.\n\nThe only thing that mars the beauty in our kitchen now is the floor. It is all cement. Besides it has large cracks all over. In the winter-time it is very cold to work on. We are hoping that we will get wooden floors like the manual training room before very long. Ramona Underwood.\nPROFICIENCY BADGES\n\nFOR THIS YEAR\n\nThis year a number of girls have fulfilled the different requirements for sewing set by the Training Branch of the Department of Indian Affairs, and the names are being sent in for the following badges:\n\nFIRST YEAR SEWING: Rita Page, Margaret Rose Charlie, Florence Pelke, Phyllis George.\n\nSECOND YEAR SEWING: Evelyn Wilson, Virginia Jones, Mary Underwood.\n\nTHIRD YEAR SEWING: Ramona Underwood.\n\nOUR SIXTH BIRTHDAY\n\nJanuary 6th was the sixth birthday of the school. The girls of the cooking class gave us a pancake party. We had one on Hallowe'en and another at Christmas time. All the children like pancakes very much. We had syrup on the pancakes. Everybody ate lots. The girls had lots of dishes to wash after the party.\n\nCecelia Charlie.\n\nFIRE\n\nLast Thursday afternoon on March 21st, just after we got home from school, we saw the house of Norma Joe, one of our schoolmates, on fire. It was just starting to burn. We saved half of their things. The things upstairs were all burned. The house burned for a whole hour. We hope that Norma can hurry and get a house and then come to school again. Norma's father, Arthur Joe, was not home when his house burned.\n\nFlorence Pelke.\n\nQUESTION: Jackie, a non-Catholic boy, invites his friend, Tommy, to a picnic on Sunday. If Tommy goes, he must miss Mass. What should Tommy say to his friend?\n\nANSWER: Sorry, Sonny, God comes first!\nNEW MISSIONARY\n\nFather Stone is our new missionary priest. He took Father Seguin's place. Father has taken charge of our football team. The first thing Father Stone did was to get us sport outfits. Father bought some material and Sister cut out the shorts. Some of the boys' mothers made the shorts. Mr. Morrison designed a thunderbird for our crest. Father Stone made the crests out of green felt and painted the white lines, then Sister sewed them on the sweaters. We have the initials S. C. S. in the centre of the crest. The S. C. S. stands for St. Catherine's School. The sweaters have numbers on the back. Our sweaters are black and our shorts are blue.\n\nWe have won six football games and lost two. The first time we played at St. Ann's School and we won three to nothing. The second game was at Kuper School, again we won, two to nothing. The third game was at St. Ann's School, the score four-one, our favor. The fourth time, we went to Kuper, we won again two to one. The fifth game we played at St. Ann's, the score was three-one, our favor. The sixth game, the Kuper boys came to Duncan, the score was nothing-nothing. The three last games were in Kuper. We lost twice, won once, one to nothing.\n\nWe are now working up a softball team. WHO WANTS TO PLAY AGAINST US???\n\nDennis Alphonse.\n\nGIRLS' SPORTS.\n\nLast year the St. Catherine's girls' team were invited over to Kuper Island to play against the girls there. We left Duncan on the noon train on Saturday. When we got to the wharf in Chemainus, a gas boat was waiting for us to take us to Kuper. We stayed there one night. Sister Superior and the girls were very busy making room for us to sleep. Some of the girls slept together to give us enough beds. On Sunday we had a great time. We played the Kuper team. The score was 40-41. St. Catherine's won. The boys wanted to play against the St. Catherine's girls too. They sure licked us.\n\nWe expect to play with the Kuper girls in Duncan this year. We hope we can, and we hope we win again too, but if we don't we will be good sports.\nIn winter time the children play with Chinese checkers, and checkers. Jacks have died out this year.\n\nWith the nice weather we are starting to play out doors now. Some children play with skipping ropes, others play softball. We have four different places in the school yard where four different sets of children are playing softball. It is very exciting. The children look like a lot of flies buzzing around the playground.\n\nM. Rose Charlie\n\nWATER SPORTS.\n\nEvery summer the Indians have water sports at Cowichan Bay. People come from all over the Island to see our water sports. There are war canoe races. There are eleven men in each canoe. The race is about two miles long. Last year one canoe named \"O Boy\" sank. Watson Jimmy and Ernie Henry were in it. It was too small for the two of them. It is very exciting to watch these races. The name of the winner was \"SHADOW\" from Kuper Island. They have won for two years.\n\nThe barrel sweep is very interesting too. The tickets are sold at nearly all the stores in Duncan for over months. They are 25\u00a2 each. The money is put together for prizes. A barrel is floated from Cowichan Lake to the White Bridge in Duncan. Fred Thomas and Henry Williams follow the barrel until it gets to the White Bridge. They keep track of the time it takes. There are three prizes given. The one who guesses the nearest time gets $100, the second $50 and the third $25.\n\nLast year it took 13 hours, 20 minutes and 15 seconds. One year it took only 9 hours. The river is very high this year too.\n\nRoy George.\n\nDEBATES\n\nOn March 14th all the pupils of Grades 6 - 8 attended a debate in St. Edward's Parish Hall. It was between the C. Y. O. of Nanaimo and Duncan-Chemainus. The topic was \"France has done more harm for Spain than good.\" Both sides were very good. The Nanaimo team won.\n\nWe noticed many things because Sister had told us to watch the posture of the debaters, how they spoke out and the grammar and language they used. We have been very interested in debates since we had the opportunity of attending one at St. Ann's Boys' School. We went to this debate to learn more. I noticed that the debaters were not at all nervous but as calm as could be.\n\nNow we have a better idea how debates are carried on. We hope to have one sometimes before school closes. Right now we are working on Oral Reports. Each pupil is writing about one of the scientists he has studied. I am studying about Joseph Wedgewood.\n\nRamona Underwood.\nCLEANINGS FROM OUR MODERN FACTORY\n\nThere are lots of new boys this year who have not had manual training before, but they are good at it and very keen on doing as good work as the older boys can do.\n\nThere are several nicely made model trucks and jeeps painted and decorated as each boy liked. These would sell for good prices in any shop, but we are not in the business of selling, but learning. We are proud of the class of work we have done and hope that every boy will always keep up the high standards.\n\nRoy George.\n\nIt has been hard to get supplies of good wood lately, and for this reason most of the boys have been making small models. The toy trucks need just as much thought and tool work as do larger pieces of furniture. We are proud of the finished work which shows great care in measuring, cutting, fitting and finishing. After all, what we LEARN is more important than what we make.\n\nVincent Joe, of the junior class, made a sleeve board, which is used in the sewing room. All the boys work out their own ideas and designs, although the main measurements must be followed from the drawings, and if you don't believe it, come and take a great big squint.\n\nI was working on my manual training room. When work according to the sizes shellacked and drew on Then I painted it the looks pretty good. I fin- couple coats of clear varnish.\n\nNow I am well along with making a small bench down in the I finished the wood- of the drawings, I it an Indian design. colors I liked. It ished it with a night stand. It wide pieces and I am drawer.\n\nWe will soon need a show-room to hold all the finished models the boys have made. Visitors are surprised at the good work we do at St. Catherine's School.\n\nEverest Alphonse.\nIn the Manual Training period we can make anything we want, as long as we cover the work required for earning each year's badge. The Grade six and seven boys this year have only Friday mornings to work in our workshop, as they are preparing for high school. So they have not as much to show as the boys who come and work every day.\n\nWe think that Roy George's bench, decorated with his own Indian designs, is a very good piece of wood work. Visitors think that it is not hand done, but the design and the painting were his own ideas and work. When Reverend Father Bradley visited our school he gave Roy fifty cents as a prize for the good work he had done.\n\nMiss Edwards visited our school one day and she liked Roy's work. When she got back to Seattle, she sent Roy an artist set for a prize.\n\nRaymond James.\n\n---\n\nIn the Manual Training Room all the boys are working hard. I am making a waste paper basket. It is almost finished now. There are sixteen blind mortise and tenon joints in the legs and rails, all mitred. You cannot see these joints when the pieces are put together, but the work is there just the same. Besides those joints, there are forty mortises to hold the slats in place. Believe it or not??\n\nI have learned to use the new #55 plane to make grooves and hold panels. Everybody thinks I've got patience, believe me I need lots.\n\nEverest Alphonse is making a night Stand Cabinet. He has been making it for a month. Raymond George is making a wheelbarrow with an Indian design on it. He made his own pattern and designs. He is painting it the colors he likes, too.\n\nWe have all the tools we need now.\n\nDennis Alphonse.\n\n---\n\nWE MEET IN NEW YORK\n\nJust about this time last year Sister Larry Eugenia received the good news that she was going to New York to see her people during the summer holidays. She began gathering some little things for souvenirs to take along with her. The boys and girls had a surprise for Sister. They also wrote letters to her to be at New York when she arrived there. While the children were writing the letters Sister kept coming in and out of their room, and they had to keep on hiding the letters until she went out again.\n\nShe had a big surprise when she found that the senior boys and girls were at New York to greet her by letters. When Sister came back she told us all about the wonderful time she had with her people, and we were glad.\n\nEvelyn Wilson.\n## SENIOR CLASS\n\n| Name                  | Name                  | Name                  |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Everest Alphonse      | Roy George            | Virginia Jones        |\n| Dennis Alphonse       | Nora Henry            | Sarah Ryan            |\n| Ruby Alphonse         | Raymond James         | Evelyn Tommy          |\n| Josephine Bartleman   | Norman Joe            | Ramona Underwood      |\n| Helen Canute          | Virginia Jones        | Jane Underwood        |\n| M.

There were about six hundred Boy Scouts and Girls also there and about five hundred Girl Guides and little Brownies.\n\nWe boys Scouts and Girl Guides were fitted all around the park for about half an hour.\n\nAs the Chief scout drove around in his car we all cheered. After he got off and came to talk to the King's Scout. Afterwards he came and talked to Father Principal, then he came over and talked to our Chief. We were very happy.\n\nWhile we were in Vancouver at the rally Lord Lewis became sick. After we came home he had a very bad time. The doctor sent him to the hospital and both they and the doctor thought he would soon be better.\n\nThe girls were glad to see Sister Anna Maria and she was a great help to the school last week.\n\nThe girls were glad to see Sister Anna Maria and she was a great help to the school last week.\n\nKEEP SMILING LIGHTS\n\nWhile we were in Vancouver at the rally Lord Lewis became sick.

Everyone in the school was tested. It didn't hurt much but some of the little kids were afraid. All the children who were positive had to get an X-ray. Nurse Garry did the tests, Judge Ballock did the X-rays. In a month or two we will know how they turned out.\n\nJANUARY 8, MR. TAYLOR (EX A.J. JEFFREY)\n\nDuring October a banquet was held for Mr. Taylor, our new Agent.\n\nThe day before he came we decorated the senior class' room with red and white and blue streamers. The tables were brought up from the dining-room. They were covered with white tablecloths and fancy dishes and flowers.\n\nThere were eight guests at the head table. Mrs. Taylor was one of them. Violin Williams, Sue Mitchell, Natale Jackson and I. The Girl Guides and Boy Scouts were in uniform.\n\nAfter the banquet Father Principal gave a speech welcoming Mr. Taylor. He spoke to show his thanks. He gave us a holiday. Then the Girl Guides and Boy Scouts gave Mr. Taylor the Scout Salute.

The rule says, \"If the dribbler's path is blocked, he is expected to pass or shoot, that is, he ought not to try and dribble by an opponent unless there is a reasonable chance of getting by without contact.\" Then there are the dreamers who take anywhere from 8 to 15 seconds to throw the ball in when it goes out of bounds. The rule allows 5 seconds. The cheering section from across the road seem to set the tempo of the game. It is claimed that R. Ryce plays a strenuous game on Sundays, Wednesdays and Fridays.\n\nMovies\u2014A whisper went around the school\u2014\"We have a new talking-movie machine,\" David Jocko when asked about the machine kept his usual philosophical calm. Adam Roy said, \"It can't be true,\" Eugene commented, \"We haven't heard it, we believe what we see.\" On Nov. 3rd, Laflamme, \"The Movie Man,\" showed that western epic, \"The Plainsman.\" There are other good movies lined up for future showing with an educational program every two weeks.\n\nTOUCH RUGBY AND BASKETBALL\n\nLeague Standings For October\n\n| Seniors | Intermediates | Junior |\n|---------|---------------|--------|\n| Red Wings | 51 | Red Wings | 36 | Maple Leafs | 32 |\n| Black Hawks | 28 | Maple Leafs | 26 | Red Wings | 29 |\n| Canadians | 23 | Black Hawks | 23 | Black Hawks | 25 |\n| Maple Leafs | 20 | Canadians | 18 |\n\nTotals:\n- Red Wings: 139\n- Red Wings: 131\n- Maple Leafs: 111\n- Maple Leafs: 97\n\nTHE ROWING REPORTER\n\nREFORMS\n\nPractices have started for the full production of the Christmas Carol. Last year one scene was dramatized. Now the full play will be produced, with the dances and carols. It is reported that the director is looking for four boys to play the part of girls. Is that why J. Monigami is walking with such a dainty step these days?\n\nUnder the direction of Adam Commanda the rink is being put into shape for the winter. J. Nogangiljig and F. Commanda are very insistent that every board be accurate. Are they interested in the hockey games or in the skating parties?\n\nThere is no brotherly love when it comes to an apple. Joe Bonaparte watched Albert munching an apple. \"Albert give me a bite,\" \"No.\" \"Well, Albert, give me the core.\" \"There ain't going to be any core, no seeds, no stem.\"\n\nPaul Pitawendak and J. King were overheard arguing about touch-rugby. Paul with disgust said, \"Joe King your brains are outside your head.\" Joe hotly replied, \"Better there than nowhere.\"\n\nHALLOWEEN\n\nOn October 31st the Senior Girls and Brittany Pumpkin men and women were our guests. The Intermediate spent a pleasant evening at the country club. The High School boys and girls ran the bingo with such efficiency that henceforth they will always have the honor. The Paul Jones Grand March started the games.\n\nTHE LAUNDRY DEPARTMENT\n\nThe three laundry men were in serious discussion. A former friend, Jerome Pheasant, sent them a book he had written during his idle moments in the laundry, \"how to answer customers and win friends.\" Alphonse Shawana decided to follow the advice of such an experienced man. Alec Trudeau agreed with the torn shirt. \"Do you expect me to wear this shirt?\" \"It will ruffled every man to his own taste.\" \"But the shirt is torn.\" Alphonse smiled as the instructions advised, \"My dear Alexander, afflictions are blessings in disguise.\" Alec, ruffled, shouted, \"There are no buttons on the shirt.\" \"Ah,\" said Alphonse, \"Absence makes the heart grow fonder.\" Joe Conner then put his upstairs with a coat in his hands. \"I can't fit this coat on, it's too small.\" The novice laundryman smiled again, \"My dear Joseph, you never know what you can do, till you try.\" Joe sighed, \"At least give me a cap. That red ski cap will fit me.\" Alphonse remembered the underlined words on page 9 of the book: \"A soft answer turns away anger.\" He found this advice for Joe, by Joseph. Later in the morning J. Fox and R. Jacobs went to take the laundry to the convent. One of the bags was extremely heavy. Opening it they discovered Alphonse with a shirt and coat around his neck.\n\nPARTY\n\nAlvin is trying to figure the loft and right turns. Some of the boys were shy about dancing with the Witch's broom. Joe Alex profited by years of experience when it came to the Broom-Rally. Chancey Benedict sacrificed a dry shirt to duck for the last apple\u2014and he missed the apple.\nSCHOOL NEWS\n\nA WEEKLY NEWSLETTER FOR THE CLEAPSAUKEE AND OKEMHA RESERVES\n\nOctober 26\n\nThis week's news concerns the Senior School. When Col. Early was here two weeks ago, he instructed us to \"get started\" and named November 1st as a starting date. At that time it was expected that at least one bus would be ready, and other preparations complete. There has been some delay in Ottawa in clearing the sale of the bus, so that no permission has been given to remodel it. It may be ready by next Friday, and it may not. Our second teacher will scarcely be here, although there have been some replies to our Ad., and it should be possible to have her here in the near future. The classrooms have been cleaned, so the building can be ready. Mr. Floyd Johnston has been engaged as one teacher, for both Manual Training and classroom work.\n\nIt all adds up to this, we intend to start on Nov. 1st, even though it is a Friday, and with one teacher besides the Principal. This means that we can take only Grades 7 to 10 at present. It is a matter of the greatest concern to us that these senior pupils have missed so much of this year's work, especially since so many are keenly interested and anxious to get started. It seems to your Principal that no obstacle should prevent us from starting in next Friday, and I believe that our young people are interested enough and made of the stuff which will get them here, even if the bus system is not ready. Certainly some can get here without a bus, and for those at least, we ought to open school and let them get started. It is still possible that some means will be found of providing transportation for those who are some distance from the School; every effort will be made to secure this. I expect to be in touch with most of those concerned between now and Friday, but it may be necessary to issue a News Letter on Thursday with instructions.\n\nLet me stress the importance of ALL those wishing to take Grade 7, 8, 9, or 10 work along with as much practical work as can be provided, to come on Friday, Nov. 1st, at least, to enroll, so that we can know what to expect and what to provide for. Unless I am badly mistaken about you, you will find some way to get here. For four months I have been working to convince the authorities that we need a Senior School this year. The number who come will give the final answer. THERE ARE 43 who have expressed their wish to take work in these four grades, and who are eligible. How many of you will be here on Friday?\n\nM.M. Joblin.\nHockey is in the air but basketball still is the game of the season. But about a personal foul when both players are running for a loose ball or a pass? \"The ball is free. Two opponents start quickly for the ball and collide. The personal contact may be serious but no foul is committed if both were in a favorable position when they started. However if one player is about to catch a ball and an opponent behind him jumps into his path the player behind is irresponsible for the foul because he was not in a favorable position to get the ball.\"\n\nS.P.C. League - The last few games have been much faster because dribbling has been almost eliminated. The Red Wing Seniors are proving unbeatable although not a strong team on paper they play tough and fast and take advantage of every loose ball. Accurate passing and team-play could bring the Canadians to the fore, but alas....\n\nThe Intermediates have yet to learn a fundamental rule of good basketball - \"A player only dribbles when he is not able to advance the ball by passing.\" There is a rumor that they are going to learn this fundamental rule.\n\nConvent Basketball League - On Saturday afternoons when the boys are in class the Sunbeams, Flashers, Lightnings and Mercuries, from the Girls' School, take over the basketball court. This style of playing has improved a hundred percent. The little Intermediate team in red has the best passing combination yet seen on the floor.\n\nSHOE SHOP DEPARTMENT\n\nWell now, you would think that the Laundry Department has all the clever boys in the school. Just the other day Mr. Raymond Pitawanakut had a brilliant idea the other day. (\"It's a very good idea,\" he said.) When he repaired the small boys' shoes he left nails inside each shoe. He claims that they will not be able to walk or run very far and therefore will save shoe leather. James Venigwans can sew with his eyes closed. Yesterday he sewed both sides of a shoe together or rather he sewed the shoe together using rubber bands. He still persists in keeping the bladder inside the cover when he patches.... Paul Pitawanakut and Alce Trudeau are very forgetful. It takes them half the morning to decide whether they should be baking bread, repairing shoes or carrying ashes. They spend the rest of the morning explaining what they would have done if they had been in the right place, why the place they were was not the right place but the wrong, and why they were wrong because they were not right. Alphonse Trudeau has the important task of placing the left soles on the right shoes.\n\nMovies - The educational films are not as exciting as the cowboy movies; however they are very instructive. Teddy Bears, Three Little Kittens, Children of China, Eskimo Life, Making the Grade were very enjoyable. Brother Westaway had to keep a close guard over the kitchen dishes during the showing of \"Run in the Dark.\" In this thrilling Western the hero and heroine defeated the bandits by throwing dishes at them. Perhaps that explains the broken milk pitcher and saucers in the kitchen. Did Augustine and Stuart rout Robby Drybutch and Peter Deere?\n\nGrade Nine thumbed pages, frowned and concentrated on Friday evening. On Saturday Nov. 23 they wrote the final exam in Art Studios. After the extra studying there were some very brilliant answers. Dominic McCosher describing the Sudan wrote: \"There is plenty of grazing land, plenty of negroes and a great deal of heather.\" (We know that the Sudanese play the bagpipes but never heard they grow heather.) Harold Bilboe very crudely wrote about Cornwall as a great battle between the English and the French. (Forgot the body?) ... William Pitt was the superman of his age for according to David Jocko he fought in England and America at the same time. Grade Seven wore a harassed and frightened look. They rush up to study as soon as the doors open. \"What is the reason?\" Simon Kitching Ting always gets it snelling right. Has he been receiving extra help? James Venigwans and Theodore Roy have been installed as librarians. They have been kept very busy with requests for books. They are puzzled. Where do Harold Belleau and Alfred Cooper get the Western Stories?\n\nWhat happened in Grade Eight the other day? Louis Scott and Andy Murray actually announcing the Thespians in this end these. Grade Four has its motion and play producers. Dominic Contino was witnessed rehearsing the following thrilling drama:\n\nCowboy Contino Comedy - Act - 1 Scene,\nCowboy Contino - Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!\nCowboy Contino - Bang! You're dead.\nOn-Set Bang! Bang! You can't shoot, you're a horse.\n\nTHE ROUGH REPORTER REPORTS\n\nOur two great detectives - Shut-Eye Cameron and Never-Find Paddy - are investigating the case of the Multiplying Coats. Fr. Brown gave every boy a winter hat and a coat. Half an hour later there all lined up outside with his own hat and coat. Yet Fr. Brown picked up three dozen extra coats. When Shut-Eye Cameron dusted the extra coats to find fingerprints he discovered the mark of a horseshoe on one coat. He is watching all the horses. Never-Find Paddy found a feather on one coat. He suggests to the boys that the criminals hiding their new fire escape to put out for Harvey Contino's great production \"The Chicken Balls.\" Henry Dare caused great consternation in the Study Hall. He jumped up from his desk and asked Fr. Oliver, \"fay I die for Fr. Hannin?\" After a few moments' explanation it was discovered that he wanted to dye material to make curtains for the Boys' Recreation Hall and Library. Robin Villeneuve has suggested that shorter walks on Thursdays and Sundays would be better suited to his delicate constitution. He finds that after he walks more than twenty miles he cannot sleep in study. His feet are too sore.\n\nJeanne Souliere, Arthur Cocco, Mike Eskimo and John Souliere rushed up to the Proctor's Office in answer to the advertisements that appear below. John Souliere swelled his chest. Mike Eskimo's legs as Mike sought to prevent the others from reaching the door first. Wanted - A boy who works neatly and faithfully, pronounces his \"ts\" as \"ts\" and not as \"dz\", who participates in every undertaking, never says \"I can't\" but is willing to try, who congratulates others for splendid work and if he loses a game takes it in stride and is able to say \"That was the best game...\"\nSCHOOL NEWS\n\nA WEEKLY NEWS BULLETIN FOR THE CHIPPEWA, HURON AND ONTARIO RESERVES\n\nDecember 14\n\n\"There is no royal road to learning.\" Some of our students have rediscovered the truth of this old saying, by the help of the inevitable tests and examinations at the end of a term. Some have apparently thought that it would suffice to submit themselves to the atmosphere of the school, and by some magic they would be able to reproduce what they have heard. Some are capable of a large amount of physical activity with a minimum of mental activity, and little control, so that they resemble an army tank out of control. Some seem to be strangers to activity in any form. For not a few, the test results have been like a dash of cold water which has brought an awareness of their position and their need for some real mental activity. Learning does not take place by a mere passive acceptance of the spoken word, but requires the purposeful activity of the learner, while the good teacher can do much to secure this effort; there is a limit beyond which he cannot go, when the results depend upon the pupil.\n\nOther pupils have done conscientious work. We are proud of them whether they have obtained a good mark or not. Their work must be judged by their capacity and opportunity rather than by some other pupil.\n\nIt is probable that some examinations will be held over until after the holidays, because of the lateness in starting. This may mean that we shall be unable to provide reports now. In the new year, the Department intends to provide a uniform report card for use in our schools. These will be issued at regular intervals to the parents.\n\nThe Concert will mark the end of the term, since the pupils are expected to be present and take their parts. We hope that their parents and friends will be able to attend, and that they will help us make it memorable, this for our pupils. The girls and boys have decided to have an exchange of gifts, but this will not make a very well dressed tree by itself. The school is not planning to give gifts other than these. The whole venture is a student activity; they may find some way to use some of their proceeds for a well-earned treat, if your support is large enough.\n\nNo more News Letter until January 4. The Staff of the Mt. Elgin School and of the other Day Schools join in wishing all of you a very joyous Christmas and a Happy New Year.\n\nH.M.H.

No, Father put on the electric phonograph to listen to us for the Midnight Mass. After Mass, we went down to have lunch. We had cocoa and coffee bread. After lunch we had a nice sleep. \u2014Cortie Amos\n\nCHRISTMAS AT CHRISTIE\n\nOn Christmas Eve at midnight, we went to the chapel where we had High Mass followed by the Low Masses. We sang very well that night. Baby Jesus was there in the little crib.\n\nAfter that we went to get our lunch and then went to bed again, but I did not sleep until in the morning.\n\nAbout 10 o'clock we went to the Girls' gym where we got our Christmas presents. First the little boys and girls danced for some visitors. Then all of us sang the song, \"White Christmas.\" After that Father Mulvihill gave us our treats, candy, and cracker jack.\n\nThe children who live near by went home to spend the rest of the day with their families. Those of us left visited our brothers and sisters in the afternoon.\n\nAround two o'clock the boys came, bringing our Christmas mail and show. Supper was early, because the show was long.\n\nAs soon as the work was finished after supper, we had Jimmy Mulvihill's show \"Foot of the Alamo,\" and \"Junior Prom.\" Thus ended a happy and holy day for us.\u2014Johnnie George\n\nFAREWELL, 1946\n\nThe smell of popcorn gave away our preparations for a party on the last day of 1946. As soon as it was popcorn, buttered, and salted, the party started in full swing.\n\nThe boys and girls enjoyed themselves. We played all kind of games. It surely was fun.\n\nFor lunch we had popcorn, candy, cookies, and apples. \u2014 Irene Lee\n\nCELEBRATING THE NEW YEAR WITH A BEACH PARTY\n\nNew Year's day turned out to be such a lovely day that we celebrated with a beach party. While the girls prepared the lunch, the boys started fires on the beach.\n\nFor the water roast, we had great fun playing \"Stealing Sticks\" against the boys. Of course the girls won. \u2014 Agnes Brown\n\nBROKEN MOVIE MACHINE\n\nWe had a show about Tuberculosis from Coquiltza Hospital. Our movie machine got sick afterwards, so Father had to send it to Vancouver to be repaired. It probably picked up a T.B. germ. \u2014 Angela Smith\n\nWe extend our sympathy to Mr. and Mrs. Cecil Smith on the loss of their two children and home by fire.\nCLASS STANDING FOR REPORT CARDS\n(Highest in order - First half of class listed.)\n\nFIRST GRADE A\nSimon John\nFrancis Curley\nTheresa Ignace\n\nFIRST GRADE B\nNapoleon Vincent\nChristine Julos\nHazel Chipps\nDavid Nicely\nGerald Chipps\nFreddie Ginger\nGeorge Lucas\nBernard Williams\n\nSECOND GRADE\nNelson Curley\nMary Rose Hayes\nHelen Anne\nSarah Oscar\nNorm Hayes\nWilfred Frank\nEugene Leo\nRaymond Jackson\nStephen David\n\nSIXTH GRADE\nIrene Jones\nMargaret Lucas\nEffie Marshall\nPauline Vincent\n\nEIGHTH GRADE\nMarjorie Joseph\nLionel David\nWalter Marshall\n\nCHRISTMAS PROGRAMME\n\nOn Sunday, December 22, the pupils gave a very interesting program for their parents.

Songs: \"While Shepherds Watched\"\n   \"God Save the King\"\n   Senior Boys and Girls\n\nPatricia Oscar and Hazel Chipps had their tonsils taken out at the Tofino Hospital in November. Both little girls did very nicely.\n\nLast month just before Christmas, Ruth Tom's mother took her to Port Alberni to have her tooth fixed. No more toothaches for her! --Alice Joe\nA few weeks ago there was a rumour that a tall man, wearing a long coat, was prowling around one of the nearby villages, frightening people. This did not bother us until one evening a member of the staff told us girls that Gobol had seen what he thought was the same man outside near the carpenter shop. He had long yellow fangs and bush hair and ran off through the bushes.\n\nAnother staff member came along and tried to tell us ghost stories for about half an hour. We did not want to believe the story about the wild man, but we heard so many spine-chilling reasons why it could be so that we were really scared and did not want to admit it or show that we were frightened...but even a door slamming made us jump.\n\nAfter we went to bed, many of us lost half a night's sleep thinking of ghosts. I had just dropped off to sleep when I thought I heard a scream. I was certain that the man in the long coat was here at last. Dad had always told me there was no such thing as ghosts, but for a moment I doubted him.\n\nHowever, we had our revenge for those ghost stories. The same night the staff member who frightened us was coming up from the beach and ran into a snow man he had made and dressed up; so I imagine he was just as frightened as we were.\u2014Anna Joe\n\nOne of the staff members overheard two of the little boys, Simon John and Freddie Ginor, talking. They were trying to see who could spell the most words.\n\nSeeing Brother near, Freddie asked, \"Brother, how do you spell 'Ruth'?\"\n\nBrother asked, \"Why? Do you want to write to her?\"\n\nFreddie (without thinking), \"No, I wrote to her yesterday.\" Realizing what he just answered, he coloured and scurried away.\n\nThings we would like to know:\nWhy did Ruth get a drum for Christmas?\n\nOn New Year's evening we had an Amateur Hour. Every boy and girl had the opportunity to sing over the radio. Mr. and Mrs. Peter Brown favoured us by singing an Indian song. Father Burns sang a Christmas song in Chinook. We were sorry that both came so soon. \u2014Lillian Howard\n\nDEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION\nChristie Express\n\nBrother MacDonald took the boys over to Tofino twice during the Christmas holidays to get oil. Eleven large drums were loaded over in the freight boat.\n\nAnd, did we have fun running up and down the store, buying all sorts of things.\u2014Anthony Charleton\n\nA REAL MISSIONARY SPIRIT\n\nSo far this year we have sent in $145.12 for pagan babies and the missions. Sister Justin's class and Sister Loretta's class each have ransomed fourteen pagan babies so far.\n\nThere is competition in the senior classroom in saving cancelled stamps to send to poor missions. To date, the number of stamps for these grades are as follows:\n\n5th Grade - 448\n6th Grade - 694\n7th Grade - 877\n8th Grade - 1264 - Don David\n\nGOSSIP \u2014 Here and There\nBy Martha Smith\n\nFather Bossotto is back from the hospital. He was away on account of illness. We are glad to have him with us again.\n\nThe children from the nearby places went home nearly every day during Christmas week. The others spent a merry time at the school.\n\nWe also had a real Christmas dinner including potato salad and fruit cake fit for a king.\n\nThe girls spend many happy hours dancing to the music from the electric phonograph.\nSKATING AND SLIDING\n\nThe weather has been pretty cold lately. For a couple of days we were able to skate and sleigh ride, but yesterday it was cloudy, and the ice was melting. Today it seems to be clear again; so we hope we shall be skating soon. Anyway, we had great fun while it lasted.\n\nSUCH A SLIDE! WOW!\n\nImelda Macquinn, sliding on the ice, had such a bad fall that she could feel the blood flowing freely. She put her hand to the severe wound and found it was a squashed orange.\n\nIt is reported that Gertie Amos is looking around for a new tattooing shop. Her old place has lost a lot of customers.\n\nNOTABLE QUOTES FROM LOVE LETTERS FOUND Around the School\n\n1. \"Don't let the principal get this.\"\n2. \"You are a thousand times very nice.\"\n3. \"I will never like anyone else.\"\n4. \"Don't you think my writing is very ugly. Yours is so nice.\"\n5. \"You must keep this picture always.\"\n6. \"She is very jealous of me because I like you.\"\n7. \"I was sure lucky yesterday when you smiled at me. You have such nice eyebrows.\"\n8. \"Did you know who flashed the mirror on you yesterday?\"\n\nDO YOU RECOGNIZE THEM?\nMr. Taylor also spoke about the play \"The Great Christmas Gift.\" He said everyone could take a lesson from it about the evils caused by drinking and that if the cursed stuff didn't exist there would be less trouble among the Indians.\n\n**JUNIOR RED CROSS**\n\nWe had our December meeting of the Junior Red Cross in the senior class room. The Junior boys and girls who are members attended this meeting. Rev. Father Principal and all the teachers were present. Norman Joseph acted as chairman and Paul read the minutes.\n\nDuring the business part of the meeting it was decided that a basket of food be made up for two old people on the reserve. We decided to sell $10.00 to go to the Chippewa children's Fund.\n\nSome short talks were given about South America and some of our own work on South America was shown.\n\nRev. Father Principal told the speakers they did well and encouraged the boys or not letting a chance of getting up to speak at meetings and that their only way to learn public speaking is by speaking in public every time you get a chance.\n\n**ANOTHER WELL-WELCOME VISTOR**\n\nRev. Father Scannel, the superior of the Oblate Priests spent two days in the school. It was his last visit as superior for he is retiring from this work. May he will visit us again.\n\nI wish everyone could have enjoyed as nice a Christmas as we did here at Sechelt.\n\nWe all went to Midnight Mass in the Village Church which was beautifully decorated. The children made a procession up to Church and the big boys and girls dressed in Scout and Guide uniforms. The small girls were dressed in white with veils. One dressed like an angel. Just on the dot of time the children walked slowly up the aisle to the altar steps smiling and glad. Father took the statue and placed it in the crib.\n\nThe village people sang two Irish Masses and it sounded ever so nice.\n\nAt ten thirty the next morning we had our Christmas tree. All the people from the village came. She lit her tree's pillar was Santa and he handed us our presents and said things to make us laugh.\n\nThen it was all over the children from Sechelt went home with their parents. A few toys and girls...\nOn Feb. 26 the Junior team traveled to Sudbury to play Sudbury Imperial Juniors (21 years and under). Sudbury reinforced their team with three players from the Copper Cliff Wolves (Intermediate O.R.A.). A packed Cassoy Arena cheered our boys and boosted Sudbury because we feared hopelessly outnumbered. The fans enjoyed sixty minutes of fast, clean hockey. The speed of the Imperials carried them to a 4-1 lead at the end of the first period. S.F.C. fought hard and managed to hold their opponents to a 1-1 result at the end of the second stanza.\n\nThe third period opened up with a furious rush by our boys. Our smooth passing first found a weak spot in Sudbury defense. Short passes from Maxie to Frank and then over the boards resulted in four quick goals. Clever playing by our defense kept the puck in the Sudbury territory practically all the third period. Our opponents were checked at their own blue line and could not utilize their speed. A breakaway by Terrimont (Copper Cliff Wolves) ended in a goal. S.F.C. surged up once more around the Sudbury goal and crossed the score. Spectators were by this time shouting and yelling so much that the old Arena seemed to be shaking. The Imperials threw on their best line to break the deadlock and again went attacking. The fans begged and pleaded with S.F.C. to get a goal. We found the corner of the Sudbury net and made the score 6-0. The period ended with S.F.C. swarming around the Sudbury net trying to get the winning goal. Cassoy fans claimed that it was the best game seen in years. The two greatest displays of hockey of the game were the valiant rally in the third period when S.F.C. outlasted and outplayed the Imperial rink, and the clean, gentlemanly conduct of the Sudbury players. Sudbury was actually pleased that we had held them to a tie.\n\n| Games Played in 1947 |\n|----------------------|\n| S.F.C. | Blind River Cadets | St. Joseph's | Spanish |\n| 1     | 4                  | 8           | 3       |\n| S.F.C. | Blind River Cadets | S.F.C.      | St. Joseph's |\n| 4     | 4                  | 6           | 0       |\n| S.F.C. | Blind River Cadets | S.F.C.      | Espanola |\n| 5     | 0                  | 7           | 2       |\n| S.F.C. | Blind River Cadets | S.F.C.      | Blind River Juniors |\n| 8     | 8                  | 8           | 3       |\n| S.F.C. | Cassoy             | S.F.C.      | Cassoy Legion |\n| 13    | 0                  | 4           | 6       |\n| S.F.C. | Cassoy             | S.F.C.      | Sudbury Imperials |\n| 15    | 5                  | 8           | 8       |\n\nHockey Notes\n\nOne more game, the thirteenth, is still on our schedule: Wed., March 5, with Cassoy Legion.

M.M. Comanda, Robin Williams, Mike Zadko, Theodore Manitowabi, Isidore Solomon, and a score of others all tried to speak at once. Lawrence Emerson proclaimed himself President and therefore claimed exemption from all work. Isidore Solomon thought that he was the man for treasurer. He proposed that all contribute 10 cents a week or two chocolate bars. Peter Cooner, busily chewing on the end of a pencil, announced that he was the secretary. Isaac Smith, in his gentle voice, protested and suggested that Alex Marion, Billy Missanaski, and himself should be officers. He claimed that his officers had more experience in getting out of work. The only point on which all agreed was the proposal by Raymond Greenbird that the Bidgets and Juniors should do more work. Raymond pointed out that work was excellent training and that he was willing to sacrifice his share for the benefit of the Juniors. Lawrence Agnew, Stanley Smith, and Eddie Corbiere volunteered to train the Juniors. Next week the Union votes on officers. Jimmy Norton has started a \"Vote for Isaac\" campaign.\n\nDrama: The two hour comedy \"The Emperor's New Clothes\" will be produced on Saturday, Mar. 8. Leading roles are taken by Alphonse Stewart, Robert Dayhutch, assisted by Clement Prudencio, Joe Fox, Wilmer Morganosh, Joe Martin, James Morton, Russel Jocko, Theodore Manitowabi, Cornelius McComber.\nOn Feb. 26 the Senior team traveled to Massay to play against Imperial Juniors (21 years and under). Sudbury reinforced their team with three players from the Copper Cliff Wolves (Intermediate O.H.A.). A packed Massay Arena cheered our boys and booed Sudbury because we arrived several minutes late. The fans enjoyed sixty minutes of fast, clean hockey. The speed of the Imperials carried them to a 4-1 lead at the end of the first period. S.F.C. fought hard and managed to hold their opponents to a 6-3 lead at the end of the second stanza. The third period opened up with a furious attack by our boys. Our second scoring line found a weak spot in Sudbury defensive. Short passes from Jocko to Frank and then over to Adam resulted in four quick goals. Clever play by our defense kept the puck in the Sudbury territory practically all of the third period. Our opponents were checked at their own blue line and could not break through. Sudbury's breakthrough by Terrill (Copper Cliff center) resulted in a goal. S.F.C. surged up once more around the Sudbury goal and evened the score. The spectators were by this time shouting and yelling so much that the old Arena seemed to be shaking. The Imperials threw on their best line to break the deadlock and again went ahead. The fans begged and pleaded with S.F.C. to get a goal. We found the corners of the Sudbury net and made the score 8-8. The period ended with S.F.C. still driving around the Sudbury net trying to get the winning goal. Massay fans claimed that it was the best game seen in years. The two outstanding features of the game were the valiant rally in the third period when S.F.C. outskated and outplayed the Imperials, and the clean, gentlemanly conduct of the Sudbury players.

The lowest mark in the last examination was 81. Doctor Cooper received 100.

The little tots opened their eyes wide and wondered why two new statues were placed on the altar.\n\nAlphonse Trudeau reports that Joe Cameron and Jerome Pheasant carried on the same animated conversation at the last skating party. Bernard Ossewak is a mighty hunter. Stealthily he crept up on the poor bird in the underbrush. He drew back his string and let loose a dire hit with sound of victory he rushed to get his prey. Then he turned and ran. He had killed some farmer's stray chicken. Bernard disappears into a dark corner when any farmer comes to the school.\n\nMovies: The outstanding movie of the year was \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" (Educational Edition). The funniest was the exhibition of wrestling by Ali Baba, the Turk.\n\nThe First Meeting of the Household Workers\n\nThe meeting was noisy and exciting. Bill Commanda, Robin Williams, Mike Sabino, Theodore Manitowabi, Isidore Solomon and a score of others all tried to speak at once. Lawrence Ewiwe proclaimed himself President and therefore claimed exemption from all work. Isidore Solomon said that he was the man for treasurer. He promised that all contribute 10 cents a week or two chocolate bars. Peter Cooner, busily chewing on the end of a pencil, announced that he would be secretary. Isaac Ewiwe, in his gentle voice, protested and suggested that Alex Marion, Billy Missanakat and himself should be officers. He claimed that his fellow workers were too lazy to take charge of work. The only point on which all agreed was the proposal by Raymond Greenbird that the Midgets and Juniors should do more work. Raymond pointed out that work was excellent training and that he was willing to sacrifice his share for the welfare of the Juniors. Lawrence Agone, Malloy Smith and Eddie Cordy were volunteered to train the Juniors. Next week the Union votes its officers. Jimmy Norton has started a \"Vote for Isaac\" campaign.\n\nDrama: The two hour comedy \"The Emperor's New Clothes\" will be produced on Saturday, Mar. 8. Leading roles are taken by Alphonse Slawna, Robert Dayhugh, assisted by Clement Tricote, John Fox, Wilber Mogenson, Joe Martin, James Horton, Russel Jocko, Theodore Manitowabi, Cornelius McComber.\nThe best two games of the season have been against the Cadets. The teams were fairly evenly matched in speed though the Blind River stick handlers were heavier and older than our boys. Harold Belloeau in goal had Eugene Fox on defensive duties. The first line consisting of Harold, both players on the first line, and Blind River's goalie provided the scoring punch. The second line in the return game at Blind River was very wobbly during the second period and allowed itself to be pushed around. We were leading the Cadets 3-0 in the first period at Blind River. The score was tied at the beginning of the third stanza. S.P.C. completely dominated the play for the last ten minutes of the game and kept the puck in the opponents' zone but failed to get the winning goal.\n\nIn the remaining three games the third line went through at will and scored not only several goals away from the second line. The game with Esponola was played at very short notice. Our team was able to run faster. Until we have the return game it will not be fair to judge the team from the Paper Town.\n\n**Intercollegiate Hockey League Standing**\n\n| Team          | Intercollegiate | Total |\n|---------------|-----------------|-------|\n| Red Wings     | 12              | 49    |\n| Maple Leafs   | 12              | 48    |\n| Canadians     | 13              | 66    |\n| Black Hawks   | 6               | 32    |\n| Red Wings     | 7               | 32    |\n| Maple Leafs   | 6               | 18    |\n| Black Hawks   | 5               | 18    |\n\n**Coming Events**\n\n- Return hockey game with St. Joseph's at Blind River.\n- Two-hour hockey game with Esponola at Esponola.\n- Two game series with Kenosha.\n\n**Practices have started for the two-hour comedy \"The Emperor's New Clothes.\" Production will be at the end of February.**\n\n**Joe King**\n\nAn intelligent, kind young man to take my place sweeping the dormitory.

School boys.\n\nWhen the final score was tallied the results were so humiliating for the North Vancouverites that we hesitate to publish them. (We are not going to hesitate too much or courses. The score for Sechelt was 33, North Van had only 3.)\n\nThe game played was rugby.\n\nThe team, accompanied by the coach and manager Father Clarke, journeyed to Sechelt by Gulf Wing SS. They were guests of the school for two days.\n\nActually the purpose of the visit was to play our boys in basketball. (Print here on I wish we had a typewriter capable of typing very small print like the kind you see on the back of insurance policies, or at least some kind extremely difficult to read.) If the reader would like to skip the rest of this page, please do so by all means.\n\nWell we played a two game series with the St. Paul team and, yes, we lost - both games. We lost by 9 points the first night. The second night we - well who is interested in scores anyway? However, we have all kinds of reasons why we should have won and all that sort of thing.\n\nAll joking aside, we did enjoy their visit immensely. We have accepted their invitation to play them a return match sometime after Easter.\n\nDEATH\n\n\"THAT THIS SIGN SHALL THOU CONQUER\"\n\nChrist preached a new doctrine and by his life proved it; that suffering and sorrow are not the curse of man but his privilege; that he who would do the greatest things is he who can endure the greatest that only by suffering and sorrow can the evil of life be overcome. Human nature deserves worth by suffering and judges a man's bravery by his endurance of sorrow. Christ has taken this truest trait in man and united it to Himself; has perfected and purified it, and His is given back to man as His highest ideal \u2014 fortitude and courage in the face of trial and temptation to sin.\n\nOne way we can show our gratitude to God for all he has done for us is by making our EASTER DUTY well. This is a serious obligation for every Catholic.\nJUNIOR RED CROSS\nOct. 18 Paul.\n\nMiss Clarke, assistant Provincial Director of the Jr. Red Cross in Vancouver visited our school on Nov. 10th.\n\nShe showed us Red Cross magazines from different countries. She also showed us some stories of children and soldiers that the Junior Red Cross is helping with choruses.\n\nWe had our Guide uniform when she came for it was our meeting day. She asked us what patrol we were in. We told her. She said that she used to be in the Tarodale Patrol.\n\nShe enjoyed her visit and hope to see her soon again.\n\nHOW DID IT HAPPEN?\n\nThe senior girls played the intermediate boys in basket-ball and beat them by a score of 26-16.\n\nSome of the boys claimed they were scratched by the girls long finger nails, all so that they had to bend the referee as well as the girls humiliating - wasn't it boys!\n\nA SURPRISE ARRIVAL\n\nA short time ago we received a great surprise. Either bought us a new radio. The Layson lets us make what we like poles.\n\nUP IN THE SHOP\n\nIn our natu-ra-turing shop this year we have made lots of things. We have made benches for the show new stands and things.\n\nST. PATRICK'S DAY\n\nWe had a half holiday on St. Patrick's Day. We had class in the morning and in the afternoon we went on a picnic to Roberts Creek in the truck.\n\nWe played around the creek and in the woods for a while. Then we saw a horse. At first it was afraid of us, but after a while it let us catch it.\n\nAt lunch time we brought the horse along with us and we fed it bread. He would have liked to get on its back but I guess we were afraid. Anyway the horse had a sore leg.\n\nThat evening we had a movie called the Duke of West Point.\n\nA SURPRISE ARRIVAL\n\nA short time ago we received a great surprise. Either bought us a new radio. The Layson lets us make what we like poles.\n\nWhen the team came from North Vancouver to play us we had to put an extra table on the boys side of the dining room and move one table of girls into the recreation room to make room for them.\n\nThen we first saw them we thought that they looked kind of small, but that night when they began to play, they didn't seem to be small at all.\n\nOur team lost both games.\nCLASS STANDING (First half of class listed)\n\nGRADE VII\nRuthie Jacobs\nMary Pickett\nDelores Pielle\nFrank Wilson\nCharlie Newman\nPete Wilson\nHarvey Paul\n\nGRADE VIII\nRosie Wilcox\nTommy Paul\nEleanor Johnson\nLena Pollet\nHomadette Joe\nGlen T.\nCecilia Paul\nSue Mitchell\nMatt Jackson\nZister Julian\n\nGRADE II\n(Crazy Paul) Shirley Paul, Chester Peters\n(Loretta Joseph, Junior Joe)\n\nSCHOOL RESERVE DEPARTS NORTH VAN.\n\nOn Sunday Mar. 28th, the senior basketball team from North Vancouver Reserve were defeated by the Sochelt Reserve team at Sechelt. The game was fast and furious and that is stating the case mildly.\n\nThe majority of the boys from North Van came to Sochelt by gas boat. The remainder, including Father Clarke arrived by the Gulf Lines. The game was played in the afternoon. The whole Reserve, the school and several White people were on hand to witness the game. Mr. Taylor the Agent was expected but apparently was unable to make the trip.\n\nOn the 30th of this month the Sochelt team will go to North Vancouver for a return match. We wish them the best of luck.\n\nTHE END.\n\nCONGRATULATIONS TO THE EDITORS OF THESE EXCELLENT PAPERS. THE CHILDREN AND STAFF ARE KEENLY INTERESTED IN THE ACTIVITIES OF OUR SISTER SCHOOL.

It is most interesting to read of your activities. I was especially interested in the class reports of the senior grades. It is the sincere wish of the Indian Affairs branch that more of you will avail yourselves of the opportunities for higher education. We need especially Indian school teachers and Indian nurses. When you make that important decision as to what your future occupation will be, be certain to remember this fact.\n\nOnce again, may I congratulate the Principal, the staff and the pupils of the Alert Bay Residential School for a magazine which reflects the educational and athletic activities of their school.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

The production of a magazine makes a pleasant break in the usual routine of classroom life and is also an excellent educational project, affording responsibility to those who are producing it. When your young contributors are able to see their own work in print, and then they know that others outside their classroom are reading of their doings, they will take pride in the production of future copies.\n\nThis new endeavor will also serve to create a sense of fellowship within the class itself and an increasing loyalty to their respected Teacher, Miss Moore.\n\nAs Principal of St. Michael's Indian Residential School, I extend to you congratulations, wish you every success in your career as a school newspaper Editor, and I hope you will have an appreciative reading public. We shall watch your progress with great interest.\n\nYour friend and Principal,\nSt. Michael's School,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nS.J. Wickens.\n\nApril 11th, 1947.\nAt the invitation of the Mayor and Councillors of Somerville, your Editor was present at a recent meeting at which the discussion of the proper administration of the Town was the main topic.

Nearly all the boys read, so he went to Margaret and said, \"Are you going to read for me?\" Without waiting for an answer he walked away and said \"Thank you.\" Wasn't he a smart Inspector? Mr. Davey showed us a little experiment. He put a little piece of paper on a reader, then he took a fountain pen and rubbed the end on his suit. After that he put the pen near the paper and it acted just like a magnet.\n\nCLASS REPORTS\n\nGRADE VIII\n\nLouisa Morvon\n\nWell, we really had \"a going over\" by the Inspector. Mr. Davey gave us some tests that helped us pick out our weak spots. All of us are anxious to pass to Grade IX, so we have been doing our very best.\n\nGRADE VII\n\nDavid Scoow\n\nWhen we first came back to the classroom we tried the desks to see which one fit each of us best. Some of us certainly looked funny in the desks we sat in last year for we had grown so much! After we had our places we made a time table and started to work... The first\nthing we have is Bible Study. We take turns reading the Lesson each day. After that we have Social Studies, I certainly have learned a lot of History! We have learned all about the Kings of England since the time of James I. Then we have Maths, English, Science and Health. Right now we are working on an interesting Health Project. We are making T.B. Posters and we're hoping some of us may win prizes in the Contest.\n\n**Joyce Smythe**\n\nGRADE VI\n\nWe now go to School in the afternoon and we don't like it very much. It is easier to concentrate in the mornings. Miss Moore says we are improving, so perhaps there won't be too many of us who will have to repeat Grade VI.\n\n**Lucy Williams**\n\nGRADE V\n\nThe Grade V Class has been working very hard lately, especially since the Inspector's visit. We have oral reading every day, and we don't like it very much. We like everything else though. It won't be long until we go home, so let us keep up the good work!\n\n**A CHEERFUL CHERUB**\n\nDon't plan your work too far ahead,\nJust do the tasks near by.\nYou'll find out the right thing happens anyway.\n\n**Farmer**\n\nWhen we first came back to School there was a lot of weeding to do. We did nothing but weed for about a month. Then we started to dig potatoes, carrots, and turnips. The carrots and turnips are all dug up now, I am glad to say. Boy! It sure was cold working on the farm this year. We took the cows out to drink but then we took them in again. Now there are three baby calves and they certainly are cute. They run and play in the nice warm sunshine. We are starting to plow the fields and have already planted some vegetables. The tractor is on the go almost every day.\n\n**Cadets**\n\nBOYS:\n\nEver since we have been in quarantine (which was lifted last week) we have not been able to go on route marches. We just drill on the playground, or in the hall and sometimes play basketball. Some of the boys are getting to be really good shots now.\n\nGIRLS:\n\nOn Monday nights we have our Cadets. We get ready and put on our slacks. After drills we play basket-ball or other games. We all enjoy it very much. There has been so much sickness this year that we haven't been able to march down to Church very often. However, we hope from now on that all will go well. On Sunday, March 30th we were inspected by Mr. Roberts, both girls and boys. It won't be long before the military Inspector pay us a visit, at noon, in the evenings, outside if the weatherman is good, we'll be drilling in our\nspare time. We all hope Mr. Gifford will be proud of us; we will do our best to show that we have been well trained.\n\nRECENT VISITORS\n\nRev. and Mrs. Peter Kelly of Ocean Falls:\n\nWhen Rev. and Mrs. Kelly came to our School everybody was glad to see them. Mr. and Mrs. Wickens kindly welcomed them into their Residence. We had a very nice Service Friday evening and Mr. Wickens asked Mr. Kelly to speak to us, and everybody listened VERY INTENTLY, taking in every word he said. Then Mr. and Mrs. Kelly sang a duet for us and they certainly sounded good. Mrs. Kelly also spoke to us and told us she was glad to come here. We were glad too, because they are welcome to come here anytime, aren't they?\n\nSPORTS\n\nThe days are getting longer and the boys and girls are playing outside a little longer at nights. Mr. Gifford is busy repairing the ball diamonds - hanging nets that were kindly given us by the B.C. Packers. With Easter Monday so near we hope everyone is practicing to take part in the sports. Come on kids, all join in and make a good show! We see the girls are busy with the bat and ball these days. Some of them are getting pretty good with the bat. The boys have organized a football league and play Tuesdays and Thursdays. The teams are - The Big Wolves, Little Wolves, and Lone Wolves. The Captains are Alvin McKay, James Mack, and Rod. Robinson. The Referees are Mr. Jones, and Mr. Wickens.\n\nON A QUIET CONSCIENCE\n\nClose thine eyes and sleep secure;\nThy soul is safe, thy body sure.\nHe that guards thee, He that keeps,\nNever slumber, never sleeps.\nA quiet conscience in the breast,\nHas only peace, has only rest.\nThe world, and the might of kings\nAre out of tune unless she sings:\nThen close thine eyes in peace and sleep secure,\nNo sleep so sweet as thine, no rest so sure.\n\n- King Charles I\n\nEditor's Note: The Editor thought this poem should be included in the School paper as the class has been studying King Charles in their History, and the thought behind it is so beautiful.\n\nFLASHES\n\nThe Class is proud of their efforts to fill the Class Mite Boxes ...........\n\nThe whole School is sorry that Rev. and Mrs. Roberts are leaving.\nChrist Church. Mr. Roberts' Evening Services were always an inspiration to the Senior Boys and Girls who attended. Our prayers, thoughts, and best wishes go with them.\n\nThe Lantern Slides have been an added enjoyment to the usual Wednesday evening Lenten Services.\n\nThe whole School is happy that quarantine has at last been lifted, but particularly the Local boys and girls who once more can visit their homes on Saturday, and the Senior boys once more shop after school on Thursdays.\n\nFirst Aid and Home Nursing classes have started for the Senior girls; keep well, they are looking for victims!\n\nWe were happy to welcome Mrs. North, and sorry to see her go, and can only hope her stay was a pleasant one.\n\nThe Lower School boys are happy now that they have a new football field of their own. Some good games have been played, and they should be first-rate players by the time they reach Upper School.\n\nGrade 7 and Grade 8 are happy their Easter exams are over, now they can sit back and take life easy until...(When do we have our next exams?)\n\nThe Story of Easter\n\nPeople will say that Easter is late this year. Unlike Christmas it does not fall on any particular day, but is governed by the moon.\n\nEaster is always on the first Sunday following the full moon after March 21st. The earliest day that Easter can fall is March 21st and the latest April 25th. If you will look at your calendar you will find that the moon will be full on April 5th so that April 6th will be Easter Sunday.\n\nApril is one of the best months of the year, because the earth which has been bound up with winter frosts, starts to release all the lovely flowers we love to see, which have been buried under the hard ground all winter, which now come up in spite of frosts or snow, bringing forth promise of the glorious feast of colour. Who does not look forward to the Spring?\n\nIt is believed that April's name is derived from the Latin word \"aprilis\" which means to open. April is also sacred to Venus, the Roman goddess of beauty, named Aphrilla by the Greeks.\n\nThe early English name for April was Easter month, for it was sacred to Easter or Ostara the goddess of Spring. Although Easter is now a great Christian Festival, it was once Pagan, and some of the customs which still survive, such as the gift of eggs, date back to those by-gone days.\n\n- Mr. Gifford\n\nIt is the joyful Easter-time\nLet all sing Alleluia\nThe merry bells ring out their chime\nThey all sing Alleluia\n\nAt Easter-time the lilies fair\nAt Easter-time, at Easter-time\nWith lovely flowers all around\nTell how glad's the world\nAt Easter-time.\nIF I HAD THREE WISHES\n\nIf I had three wishes, my first wish would be to go to Europe and see all the places around there and see the people too. If I really did see the starving children, I guess I would think more of them.\n\nMy second wish would be to go to the United States and see all the tall buildings and the electric signs all around at night.\n\nMy third wish would be that I wish I had a thousand or more dollars to go to the Holy Land and see all these places I've learned about and see all the beautiful things around there. But most of all the son of Galilee because I have heard about that for lots of times. I know a man who went there, the step-father of one of the men who used to work in this school.\n\nAnd these are the three wishes I wish would come true.\n\nTell you a story children? well, gather around my knee, and I'll tell you what in that happened once to me.\n\nWhen I was just a little girl, I had to go to school,\n\nwhen I was bad I had to sit upon a little stool.\n\nNow, that wasn't very often, for you see I wasn't bad,\n\nBut sometimes I'd forget myself, and then I would be bad.\n\nOne day I pulled my neighbour's hair, she was sitting next to me,\n\nBut Teacher say no do it; and so you cross, so cross could be,\n\nShe looked at me, and sternly said, \"since you have been so cruel,\n\nJust march right up immediately and sit upon this stool!\"\n\nSo, let that be a lesson, and when you're feeling bad,\n\nRemember if you don't behave, you'll make your Teacher mad.\n\nA poor little maiden named Lily\n\nShe lived on hill, Oh, so chilly\n\nBut it was so hot,\n\nFor so small a tot\n\nShe was glad that at night it got chilly.\n\nI knew a young fellow named Abel,\n\nWho married a girl they call-\n\ned Isabel,\n\nThey fought over this,\n\nThey fought over that,\n\nAnd all this was done at the table.\n\nQ. What is the most polite thing on earth?\n\nA. A boat, it always advances with a bow.\n\nQ. What has wings but cannot fly?\n\nA. A totem pole.\n\nQ. What did one wall say to the other wall?\n\nA. Meet me in the corner.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: Well, folks, I haven't very much to say, but what I would like to say is this: We all thank the office for making room in our first newspaper. I hope the summerville citizens will keep their land. There is a rent deal we had to leave out because we want this paper to be short. We are hoping to have another longer and better paper at June. There is only one more thin' I've got to say: I wish everybody a Happy Easter.\n\n- David Seow\nMr. Bernard F. Neery,\nSuperintendent Welfare & Training,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\nSturgeon Landing, Sask.\n\nJanuary 1947\n\nAnother year has gone by and your children are going back to school. I am glad that they are doing well in good health, (while I am extremely sorry for those of you whose children will pass the holidays in the hospital) and I am satisfied that they have not lost their time here in school.\n\nIf you expect a very big change in your children and very much learning after one year of schooling, you may be disappointed. Just as a child grows very little at a time, so his mind and knowledge can be developed but little at a time, and no one should expect too much after even a few years of school.\n\nTo achieve in your children what you expect of them and what we would like them to have, we need your children for many years and this means three things:\n\n1- That they should come to school as soon as possible when they are 7 years old, and not wait until they are 10, 12 or 14;\n\n2- That once a child has started school, he should not be kept away from it for any reason. A child who comes to school one year and then stays home one year is hardly more advanced when he comes back the third year than when he started;\n\n3- That they should be left at school old enough to complete their studies; it is unfair for your children to sell them back home before they are 18 years old; their last years of schooling are the ones that show the most definite results.\n\nYes, dear parents, it means sacrifices for you to part from your children 10 months in one year for such a long time, but since you do it for the sake of your children's future, I ask you to be generous enough not to stop your children's development in full growth by withdrawing them from school when it is not time yet.\n\nIn shall, in return, ask you to make the school staff do our very best to make you proud of the progress of your children and the children themselves shall be happy about their own achievements while they enjoy the school atmosphere.\n\nYours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nWho's nervous?\n\nPupil: Sister, look! I asked the nurse for a nervous pill\u2014because I have to play the organ at Benediction.\n\nSister: Why, of course let the will be nervous\u2014not you!\n\nUnder the direction of Sr. Fran\u00e7oise de Jesus, the children are learning this year some special songs to sing at Mass, such as, for example, the Mass of the Angels, or the Virgin Mary; we also sing also the part of the Mass, Antiphon, Offertory. Now we are preparing some hymns for the Principal's Feast.\n\nAlbert Linklater\n\nPRO ORTON TEST \"Grade 2\"\n\nTeacher: The name of our Queen is?\n\nPupil: Queen Alphabet.\n\nI am glad a task to me is given,\nTo labor at day by day;\nFor it brings me health and strength and hope\nAnd I cheerfully learn to say:\n\"I see, you may think: Here, you may feel\u2014\nBut hand, you shall work always.\"\nOne way to break the ice at a party is to start making cracks.\n\nA boy stayed up all night to see when the sun would rise. Finally, it dawned up on him.\n\nJudging from the fashion displays we have seen in the store windows here, summer will be slack season as well as a short one.\n\nThe initial cost of building a home is a lot, there are lots of houses in the course of construction in this city. Just a sure sign of the progressiveness of a lot of people and their faith in the future of Wetaskiwin.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Aaron Peterson had as their guest Mrs. A. W. Anderson, formerly of Wetaskiwin, during her visit Mrs. Anderson was surprised and honored on her 75th birthday anniversary, many beautiful gifts were presented to her. Mrs. Peterson as hostess served a delicious lunch; Mrs. Anderson will spend awhile with her daughter Mrs. R. Kemp of Edmonton before leaving for leaving for New Westminster to visit her daughter, Mary. Mrs. Anderson spent the winter with her daughter, Mrs. Dave Pritchard of Lethbridge.\n\n-X-\n\nIncreases in Alberta's minimum wages to $25.00 per week for makes more than 21 years of age and $18.00 for experienced female employees were authorized in an order-in-council signed Thursday last.\n\nThe new schedule providing increases of approximately 20% over present minimum scales, will go into effect when published in the Alberta Gazette, probably within the next few days.\n\n-X-\n\nMrs. Jack Ingram has returned from visit with her parents at Edson.

Burroughs and latterly by Alderman Wm. J. Gillespie.

The boat may stray off its course for a little while, but if no one is guiding it, it will go off its course and land up on the rocks.\n\nNo parent should be so naive as to think that their children do not need guidance when they go home for the summer holidays. No matter how well the children have been guided during the school year, they still need the guidance of their parents when they return home. Like a boat they may stay on their course for a little while if no one is guiding them, but like a boat, they will not stay on their course for long if no one is at the wheel.\n\nBy the Law of God all children are obliged to obey their parents. By the same law all parents are obliged to insist on respect and obedience from their children. Parents who do not make their children obey them are guilty of serious sin. Too many parents do not press to realize the seriousness of this obligation which pertains to it only in a rainhearted manner.\n\nParents must see to it that the children help with the ordinary duties around the house. They should know where their children are at all times, particularly in the evenings. They must keep a loving watch over them at all times.\n\nThe class standing has not been listed as the June examinations will not be over until June 24th.\n\nThe School Staff extends to the parents and children best wishes for a pleasant summer holiday.\n\nIndian Affairs - School Files (RG 10, Volume 6034, File 150-62, part 2)\nCONFIRMATION.\n\nCATHERINE JIMME\n\nOn May 22nd His Excellency Archbishop Duke came to visit our School. We were all excited to hear of his arrival. He reached here with two other priests, Rev. Father Brown and Father Plamondon. They got here at noon hour.\n\nEarly next morning we were ready to go down to the church where His Excellency was saying Mass. He confirmed the children after Mass. We had a holiday the rest of the day and that night we had a picture show.\n\nWhen His Excellency was leaving we all went out to say goodbye to him and Father Brown.\n\nSPORT NOTES.\n\nThe intermediate boys softball team defeated the intermediate team from the \"White\" school by a score of 14 to 9. The white boys were leading until the fifth inning.\n\nNext week the senior girls will play the senior white girls and the senior boys will play the senior boys from the public school.\n\nThe arrival of a shipment of Lacrosse sticks has aroused great interest in Lacrosse on the boys side.\n\nTHIS IS WHAT WE HOPED MR. DAVIES WOULD SAY.\n\nCASINO POINT.\n\nMr. Davies, the school inspector and Mr. Taylor our Agent visited the school in May.\n\nOne thing we did for him was to put on a Scout and Guide parade. We marched to music and then we had a Prize and Demonstration. After that the Scouts did Morse Code Signalling. Mr. Davies gave a message to send. Dave Fraser sent it. Then we had a knot tying competition between the Scouts and Guides. The Scouts won. Mr. Davies took pictures of everything we did.\n\nMr. Davies spent two days inspecting the class rooms. We were all kind of nervous.\nSCOUT HIKE.\n\nOne day in May Father called the Scouts and told us he were going out at nine. We knew that Dr. Davies had given us a holiday because we got it by Horse Code when he was here.\n\nThe Scouts put on their outfits and went to the kit- chen to get a lunch and then they headed for the Lake eight miles away.\n\nAfter one hour's walking we ate our lunch. We had hard sandwiches, oranges and hard boiled eggs. Then we continued on again.\n\nIt took two hours to reach the lake which is at Half Moon Bay. The water looked warm and we wanted to go swimming right away, but we had orders to wait until Father came up with the rest of the children in the truck later on in the afternoon.\n\nThat was a long wait but at last they did come. After we had a swim Father told each of the Scouts to make a fire and cook his own supper. This was going to be our cooking test. Each Scout was given two matches for his fire and a piece of paper for the cooking. Then our fires were my test. Some let their meal fall in the fire. It passed good. The boys said they were better cooks than the girls.\n\nBefore we left for home we had another swim and then passed out the popcorn and afterwards we started for home in the truck. It was a good holiday.\n\nPICTIC DAY 24.\n\nLILLIAN JACKSON\n\nOn May 24th the boys went on a picnic to Wilson's Creek. The Scouts walked part of the way, the little boys went by truck. The girls went by truck too after lunch.\n\nWe had all sorts of sports and there was a first and second prize for them all. The girls lost the tug-of-war. It was the first time they ever lost. The girls lost the softball too. The boys had to bat left handed.\n\nWe went for a swim afterwards and that night we had a movie, \"Hollywood and Vine.\"\nDear Sirs:\n\n18 June 1947.\n\nAttached is a copy of our very first attempt at a school publication, per formation and suggestions offered through your very excellent Indian School Bulletins.

III\n\nSTRING CANOES AT NIGHT\n\nOn December 23rd, we went to all the houses in the village that night. We took a gift to each house. We had made them in school. We all had good time. We took many lanterns and flashlights. First we went to David's house. Then to another and another. At each we sang one or two Carols before we went in to say \"Merry Christmas\" to every person that we saw. The snow was so deep that night, it blew skirts so that our noses went right into the deep snow. The children that were too little did not go. Hannah Mathew was there in the School to see that the little people were not noisy. When we got to David Lourtit's house we all had two candies each also the staff. At Mr. Soper's house the girls sat down on the floor near the kitchen. The boys were in the porch. Charlotte, who works at Mr. Soper's house, was very busy giving us tea and biscuits. After we had our snack we went into the living-room to see the Christmas tree. The lights were red, blue and green on the tree. Mr. Soper gave us all some candies. We all had to go right home to the School. I was with my best friend Gracie Herodier. It was late, nearly twelve o'clock. We had had a good sleep. This is the end of my story.\n\nElizabeth Joyce Napash Gr. III\n\nCHRISTMAS DAY\n\nOn Christmas Eve Miss Quirt told us a story of St. Nicholas before we said our prayers. When we were all in bed the Staff sang a song of Santa to us. In the morning Miss Quirt said, \"Merry Christmas Girls\". We jumped out of bed to get our stockings. We looked at them to see what was inside them. Every one of the senior girls got combs, beads, handkerchiefs, hair ribbons and candles. Mr. Hittingham gave each of us a perfume bottle. After we dressed all the Staff came into our dormitories to see what each girl had. Then Mr. Senior, Jr., Hittingham and the boys came in too. After the boys had gone out we went to their dormitories and we saw everything that they got in their stockings. We senior girls went downstairs to put the food on the tables. We saw the Christmas tree decorated, the whole dining-room, each table and the staff table was in with ours too. The buzzer rung for breakfast. Then we lined up upstairs. We came down wearing our Christmas hats. After we finished eating we sang carols before Santa came. During our singing Santa Claus came running in. Some of the little girls were nearly crying because they were scared of Santa Claus. He called each person's name to get their presents. The senior girls got needle cases, belts, and triangular scarves. The senior boys got fountain pens and games of all kinds. The junior boys had toys and colouring books of all kinds and crayons. The junior girls had these too only dolls instead of toys. Every boy and girl had a big bag of candy. We played with our Christmas presents until dinner time. Each of us had half a white bird, potatoes, carrots and a dessert. When we finished the dishes we went home to our people. We showed them our Christmas gifts. We all had a happy Christmas and nice holidays.\n\nNellie Potts Gr. IV\n\nCHRISTMAS CONCERT\n\nThe Christmas Concert is always the great event of the year.

IV\n\n---\n\n**The Pageant**\n\nI want to tell you in a simple way about the pageant this year 1946. We had a good time this year in the concert. Elijah was Joseph, Nellie Potts was Mary, the mother of Jesus. All the Nations came to worship the Baby Jesus. First the three angels and three girls sang \"Holy Night\". They were doing the actions also. Then the three angels wore, like Shem, Ham and Jemima. The three girls were Mary and Joseph came on, with the oxen. We sang two verses of \"Once and Joseph came on, with the oxen. We sang two verses of \"Once in Royal David's City\". The first scene was the three shepherds who went around the fire.

There was a box for Valentine cards. Mr. Senior was the Postman. He gave each person the cards made by the school children. After Mr. Senior had finished giving out the cards we started to play some games. Then we danced. When the dancing finished we had a lunch. Then we went to bed. We had lots of fun at the party.\n\n---\n\n**Dinah Flowing** Gr. II\n\n---\n\n**Soper's Picnics**\n\nWe went on two picnics with Mr. Soper - all the boys but five little juniors. We went to Beaver Creek and the Island. We took the guns. When we got there Mr. Soper hang chewing gum on the tree to shoot. We all had a shot at it. After that we light a fire and ate sausages and bread and drink tea. We have lots of fun. Mr. Soper gives us candies.\n\n---\n\n**Saturday House**\n\nWe change our sheets on Saturday. The boys who sweep pile all the sheets. They carry the sheets to the Laundry. One boy does the pillow cases and one boy does the sheets. One boy does the pyjamas. Then we all make our beds. We go downstairs again to work. Still some boys are sweeping the bedrooms. Then they finish they gather the dust in one pile. One boy takes the dust and puts it in a basket and they go downstairs to work. The boys pile wood and keep the school room clean.\n\n---\n\n**Robert Matthew** Gr. IV\nThere are fifteen Girl Guides. We have our meeting on Wednesday.\n\nWe enjoy our Girl Guide work. Miss Quint is the Captain. We are not in groups yet. We like to play all sorts of funny games. The games we like best are Poor House and Grand Old Duke of York. We like our Captains, Miss Quint. She hasn't got a real uniform yet. Miss Quint is very kind to all in the School. She is a very good and kind Patron. We hope we will have a good time next year when we start again. We made Girl Guide Books. We put in them our Girl Guide Prayer, our Promise, our Law and Wood Craft Signs. We have learned about the flag and the hymn call our Girl Guide Hymn. \"I will not be afraid, I will look upward and travel onward and not be afraid.\"\n\nNearly all the girls are Indians, only four of us are Eskimos. We hope some day we will have Girl Guide uniforms, each one of us. We also wish that we had Girl Guide ties. We are getting along splendidly. We will be in groups next year. I would like to tell also, that we had our Enrollment on the Plat. of Park. We had to take our Promises. We had to wear white middies, navy skirts, brown stockings and blue ties. We wore our badges too. We invited the Scouts, Cubs and Juniors, also the Staff, to watch the Enrollment. Then it was over the children went upstairs to bed. Then we played games. Our happy evening closed with a snack of muffins and orange drink.\n\nWe hope we will go camping this summer --------Sally C.

She told us about the President, Vice President and Treasurer. Afterwards she gave us pieces of paper to write the names on. One of us gathered the papers and gave them to Miss Adams. She said, \"Who do you think is the President?\" We said, \"We don't know.\" She said, \"Mary Herodier.\" She told me to stand. The other girls clasped their hands. Mary Herodier, President; Nellie herodier, Vice President; Sally Naccappo, Secretary; Nellie Potts, Dorcas Secretary; Grace Herodier, Treasurer.\n\nWe had our G.A. meeting every other Wednesday after supper. We sang a hymn first, then Bible reading and prayers, hymn and the Grace. We sewed patches together for a quilt. We finished one quilt, made lots of Indian dolls, aprons, and all kinds of things for our G.A. Sale. We even sat outside in the evening to knit and sew (in the snow).\n\nMiss Quint took the Mission Study. She told us all about India. We were very interested. She took the Mission Study every second G.A. meeting.\n\nWe are very glad that we are doing Missionary work this year. I think we will do more next year. We just started this Fall.\n\n--------------------------------------------------Mary Herodier\n\nJUNIOR AUXILIARY\n\nI belong to the Juniors. We do pasting, sewing and sing songs. We play games.

III (Green Sixer)\n\nCHOIR GIRLS\n\nMrs. Senior has taught us how to sing, how to hold our books, how to open our mouths, and, when we are singing, to stand up straight. She told us to sing in harmony with the organ. We sit in the Chancel seats and can sing better now. We are happy because Mrs. Senior told us we had nice voices.\n\nThere are eighteen girls in the choir. Every Saturday we have choir practice in the school room. Each Sunday we sing three hymns. Our Church is called St. Phillip's. Mrs. Senior is the Minister. The choir sang carols at Christmas, special ones.\n\nEaster Sunday morning we sang and anthems. I sang a solo. This was the first time I sang a solo song. We never had a choir before at Fort George.\n\nNellie Herodier Gr. IV\n\nScouts and Cubs: In the Boy Scouts I am patrol Leader for the Owls. My friend Jerry Sam Atkinson is Patrol Leader for the Bear. In the Wolf Cubs Sammy House is the Green Sixer, Alec Chewynosh is the Red Sixer.\n\nJimmy Spencer Gr. IV\n\nHOME NURSING\n\nEleven of us went to the Hospital on Tuesday evenings for our Home Nursing classes. We did enjoy learning how to look after a baby, First Aid and Artificial Respiration. Also how to make beds, what to do when we faint. Miss Andrew told us very often how we must keep everything clean.\n\nMary Shom Gr. III\n\nHealth Note\n\nIt might be well to mention in passing that we are all very thankful that the school year now ending has been such a successful one from a health standpoint. There has been no serious illness among the children and they all have shown a gratifying gain in weight. Even the lumps epidemic which affected every child but one was not serious and recovery was complete.\n\nI. Andrew.\nThis is Miss L. Adams with a saucepan in her hand and a goose head bobs out of the saucepan. The goose starts to \"Honk! Honk!\" In this picture Miss Adams looks mad as anything and she looks funny too. Miss Adams likes Indians to bring geese to the school. When she hears somebody in the office she runs to see if they are Indians bringing geese.\n\nMiss Adams is a very good person and very kind to every boy and girl in the school. She likes to sing funny songs. She has taught us many songs. We like her very much. She taught us how to make cakes and cookies. We like cooking.\n\nSally Naeappo Gr. IV\n\nCHOIR GIRLS - (See Picture)\n\nThis is a choir picture. These three girls are singing. They are not holding their books because they know all the words. They open their mouths wide when they are singing.\n\nNellie Herodier Gr. IV\n\nErnest Atkinson is in Moose Factory. We hope he will soon be well.\n\nRichard Cookish killed a rabbit with a stick.\n\nNellie Petts was the only pupil out of 47 who didn't have the lumps.\n\nIn the Food Contest this year Mary Herodier, Sally Naeappo and Nellie Petts won first, second and third prizes. We are very proud of them.\n\nWe had an Empire Day service in the schoolroom. We decorated the room with flags and emblems of the Commonwealth. Mr. Senior spoke to us and Mrs. Senior played the organ.\n\nWe made a good job of cleaning up the grounds on Arbor Day, June 7th.\n\nThe ice started to move in the far channel on June 6th. It broke up on our side on June 8th. The river was not clear of ice for 5 days.\n\nCanon Shepherd from Fort Harrison and Rev. George Nilson, from Great Whale, have visited us this year. They like our singing.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Senior, the Staff and all the School and their good friends from the Hudson's Bay Company, had a very happy picnic in the deep snow after Easter. We crossed the frozen river and used our snowshoes.\n\nA reinforcement Cook from Moose Factory visited our school twice during the year.\nHORSEY HILL PICNIC\n\nWe went for a picnic on March 29. We went up to Horsey Hill and when we got to the other side we lit a fire. We had supper with Miss Quirt and Mrs. Senior. I found some blackberries on the rock.\n\nMargaret Pash Gr. II\n\nGIRL GUIDE PICNIC\n\nWe had a Girl Guide picnic. We put our bread in bags, tea, sweet milk, pail and the cups, sausages, sweet cookies, some candies. The other girls went to the Parish Hall to get the snow-shoes to wear then. Then we are all ready to go. There were fifteen girls and two ladies, Miss Quirt and Miss Adams. We all went together. We had the bags on our backs. We all wore snowshoes but Miss Adams. We walked on the ice on the river. We walk as fast as we can go. Miss Quirt knows how to walk with snowshoes. We came nearer, nearer to the other bank. Then we went up the bank. We put the bags on the ground but we did not take off our snowshoes. We went to the bush to get sticks to make a fire. The other girls went to the trees to get the branches to sit on. After that we make the fire and put snow in the pail. The snow melted. When it was boiling we made the tea. The other girls sat around the fire and cooked the sausages on sticks. After we had eaten our supper Miss Quirt took a picture of us. Oh, my, we had a jolly time that day. We put out the fire and came home when the sun was vanished. We walked on the ice. We put our snowshoes in the Parish Hall. We put our bags in the kitchen. We didn't feel tired. We thanked Miss Quirt for the picnic. Then we went upstairs to bed. It was beginning spring when we had our picnic. Only the Girl Guides went to the picnic that day.\n\nNellie Herodier Gr. IV\n\nBOYS PICNIC\n\nWe went with Miss Houldcroft and we did not take our guns. We crossed the river and as we came near the bush Miss Houldcroft gave us some candies. Then we went on again. We lit a fire and had sausages and bread. We had coffee. We put milk into the coffee. We slid down the hill and there were rocks at the bottom of the hill. We clambered up a tree and rescued Richard when he was caught on the ice and laughed and laughed. Miss Houldcroft told us a story of \"The Five Knight and the King\".\n\nR. Mathew.\n\nWhen we came home we went ahead on our snowshoes but Miss Houldcroft was away back. We had to wait for her.\n\nR. Kanatewat.\n\nBEST GOOSE DINNER\n\nOn our first goose dinner we were very glad to have a nice dish of goose. We were very very thankfull that we ate geese before the Staff did. We had plenty of goose that dinner dish. We had our first goose dinner on Saturday May 24th, 1947 A.D.\n\nMary Herodier Gr. XV\n\nBIRDS IN SPRINGTIME\n\nWe kill them with bows and arrows. We make the bows and arrows. We go out on the Common in the evening to shoot birds. Elijah made a net. We catch them with a net. We pull the stick with a string. The net falls down.\n\nJohnny Swallow Gr. III B\nGRADUATION\n\nOn Thursday June 13th, we had our Graduation dinner. The tables were decorated with green crepe paper and the daffodils we made for Easter.\n\nThe Staff and the Hudson's Bay and Miss Andrew ate with us. We had goose and lemon pie.\n\nMiss Adams led us while we sang the songs we liked best. Then Mr. Senior presented the Certificates, a Croc Book - \"The Ten Words\" and a pictorial \"Life of Christ\", to each one of the graduates. We sang \"He (or she) is a Jolly Good Fellow\" every time. After Mr. Senior had spoken to these pupils, Nellie Potts stepped into the centre of the room and made a very good thank-you speech. We stood and sang \"God Save the King\".\n\nThe school room had been cleared of desks and cleaned up by the boys so when we marched in we began to play \"Grand Old Duke of York\" right away. We had lots of fun. Mr. Senior taught us a new game. We laughed and laughed. We had orange drink and cookies and sang \"Auld Lang Syne\" and \"O Canada\".\n\nThe certificates are beautiful. Mr. Church of the Hudson's Bay printed them in Old English print. They have the Arctic crest on them.\n\nGracie Horodier Gr. IV\n\nFIELD DAY\n\nThis paper has been planned as solely a pupil enterprise. As this report must go to press immediately I regret that it cannot be inserted by a student.\n\nFriday, June 13th, has been a happy though strenuous day. Mr. Senior and Mr. Whittingham were in charge of the activities. Miss Quirt and myself lined the children up for each event. Miss Adams distributed the prizes to the excited winners.\n\nFour groups of girls and two groups of boys took part in the relay, sackrace, three-legged race, ball throwing, high and broad jumping and the 50 yard dash. Gracie Horodier, aged 12 years, vaulted 1\u00bd inches higher than any of the senior boys.\n\nGirls who won more than two prizes were, Nellie Potts, Sally Macappo, Gracie, Larry and Nellie Horodier, Elizabeth Mcpash, Gracie Linklater, Ellen Bobbass and Juliet Head. Among the boys the most successful contestants were Jimmy Sponcer, Jerry Sam, Elijah Menorik, George Snowboy and Alex Chewaynosh. The tug-of-war was as usual, a very keen, heated, hilarious event. The jubilant girls being the victors.\n\nRefreshment was served to the very busy judges at the hospital on the grounds of which the events were held.\n\nH. Houldcroft.\n\nAND SO TO PRESS:\n\nThe end of the official school year was marked in appropriate ceremony by a children's Thanksgiving service held in St. Philip's Anglican Mission Church on Sunday morning, June 15th, 1947. Bibles, suitably inscribed by the Missionary-in-Charge, were awarded to each of the four graduates; Nellie Potts, Sally Macappo, Dinah Fleming and Jerry Sam. The school choir led in the singing of special children's hymns of praise and thanksgiving.\n\nIn his farewell sermon Mr. Senior placed special emphasis on the blessing of the Almighty upon the School during the past year and asked the congregation for their continued prayers that the work of the School and Mission might go on to new height and achievements in the coming years.\n\nThe children returned to the School for dinner after which they were dismissed from School in the care of their parents or guardians.\nST. GEORGE'S DRAGON\n\n\"TOWARDS THE SUN RISING\"\n\nReynold Smith's illustration of our school motto has become a part of our history. We know where we are going. The way will not always be over a calm mountain-sheltered lake. There will be rocks and rapids to test the craftsmanship of the canoe, the strength of the paddler's arm, the cleverness of his brain. In storm and calm may the lessons learned at St. George's give help and understanding for a safe journey to all her children.\n\nReynold Smith's drawing is copied for us this year by Jeanette Dunstan.\nTHE PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE\n\nThis is just a short message to the \"Dragon\". I wonder what kind of a message St. George would have given to the original dragon? Perhaps this: \"Play the game, Dragon!\" These words are just an echo of those I gave you yesterday, just before you went to the Field Day sports at Lytton. All through the day, and after the day was over, I felt very proud of you girls and boys, because you played the game. Yes, you won the silver cup, and one of you girls won the highest number of points, but best of all, you were clean in all your games.\n\nMy most earnest desire for you, dear girls and boys, is that you will always play the game as you go through life. In all your dealings with one another, in all your dealings with your own self, each one, play the game. In all your work, and in all your play, play the game. Be clean and honest, kind and inspiring, and put your whole heart into the game of life. You may not win a medal or a piece of red ribbon; but you will win self-respect and the respect of other people, which is worth more than a silver cup or anything else material.\n\nThe cleanest and best Competitor this world has ever known was Jesus. He did not win a medal. It was a crown of thorns He won. He did not have a piece of red ribbon pinned on Him. They threw over Him a fool's scarlet robe. They did not shout \"Hurrah\" at the end of the \"Field Day\". They put Him on the cross and killed Him. And yet we know, and all the world knows, He won the race; and He has carried off the highest prize. Let Him be your Leader, your Guide and your pattern of clean sportsmanship.\n\nPrincipal\nST.

We will endeavour to uphold the ideals that they have set for us, and to prove to them, and to ourselves, that we have the true spirit of St. George.\n\nTo everyone, may I say that I hope you all have a wonderful holiday, and to the graduating class \u2014 the best of luck in the future \u2014 and remember our motto \u2014 \"Toward the sun rising.\"\n\n[Signature]\n\nAND A FEW WORDS FROM ME...........\n\nMy children, you have been a very good class in many ways. But what I think I shall remember longest is your wonderful cheerfulness. I hope you will always face your work in that spirit.\n\nI wish you all a happy holiday now, and after school days, a useful and happy life.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nSPORTS ACTIVITIES\n\n\"LOOK OUT BELOW\"\n\nIf you were one of those people unfortunate enough to walk past the \"Big Hill\" on a bright winter day no doubt you heard that cry. And if you were even more unfortunate and did not move quickly enough, you probably had someone come hurling down upon you -- one of St. George's amateur ski champions.\n\nLack of regulation skis did not hinder these enthusiasts. Any narrow board would do as long as it protruded an inch or two in front of, and behind your shoe. Skis ranging in length from one to five feet were frequently seen on the hill.\n\nFalls were numerous at first, even on the little hill behind the school, but as the winter progressed, technique improved and soon many of the boys were experts.\n\nThe more timid ones did their travelling on sleighs again - anything from a board or piece of tin to a toboggan would do. Even sleighing took a certain amount of courage, however. Especially if you consider the fence, the woodpile, and the barn which we had to contend with.\n\nEven snowballing had its place in our winter sports and the many battles were fast and furious. Altogether, with skiing, sleighing and snowballing, the winter passed quickly -- a winter full of great fun.\n\n-- Wilfred Wills\nA SOFTBALL GAME AGAINST LYTTON\n\nWe had a softball game against the Lytton School team on May 7th. In our first three innings we had 3 to their 11 but at the end of the fourth inning we had 14 to their 11. We beat them! This was our team:\n\nCatcher.............. Eddie Boston\nPitcher.............. Wilfred Wale\nFirst Base.......... Freddie Wale\nSecond Base......... Rhoda Spike\nThird Base.......... Corrine Jumbo\nShortstop........... Phyllis Dunstan\nLeft Field.......... Gerald Thom\nRight Field......... Albert Wells\nCentre Field........ Hector McIntyre\n\n--Wilfred Wale\nAlbert Wells\n\nFIELD DAY ON MAY 22ND\n\nWe had our field day on May 22nd.\n\nWe all marched down to the field before dinner and sat around in a circle and then the dinner was served to us.\n\nAfter dinner (about one o'clock) we started the races. The big boys had relay races and hundred yard dashes. The smaller boys and girls had seventy-five yard dashes, sack races, potato races and a few other races. There were only three boys in the high jump. The highest jump was four feet, nine inches, cleared by Hector McIntyre.\n\nAt the end of all the races there was a greased pole to climb. It was twelve feet high and the part that was greased was about four feet from the top. The boys that tried to climb it would get just about to the top and then slide down. Norman Bastace finally climbed up to the top.\n\nWe all had great fun that day.\n\n--Albert Wells\nTHE KITCHEN...........\n\nWhen it comes to dishwashing or pot-scraping, where you get all greased up, I feel like running away. But we really like working in the kitchen where it is training for best cooking. I like it so I'll know how to cook my own meals instead of somebody else doing it. We also learn to plan our own meals.\n\n--Amelia James\n\nTHE SEWING ROOM.........\n\nWe do lots of sewing up there besides housecleaning. Sometimes we sew by hand and sometimes on the machine. I surely like working up there when it gets to spring cleaning. Besides, I like that place because every year I learn new things to do in sewing.\n\n--Mary Jane Charlie\n\nTHE MANUAL TRAINING SHOP....\n\nWe go to the manual shop to learn about the machines and how to use them. Mr. Hill is our instructor and he has taught us how to use the band-saw, the sanding machine, the lathe, and a few other things such as hand tools.\n\n--Albert Wells\nTHE LAUNDRY\n\nThe laundry is the place where there is work to be done. I like running the machinery. I like the work but it is not a very good job on Mondays and Fridays because the room's just full of steam. On Wednesday we iron the clothes. I was taught how to run the machinery and how to stop it, and see that it runs perfectly all right. But one thing I don't like is washing by hand because I get so hot and the sweat goes down my face.\n\n--Annie Frank\n\nTHE FARM\n\nFall Work\n\nApple picking is liked very well by the boys because of the opportunity to eat. Nearly a thousand boxes were picked and stored in the cellar for winter use; also about a hundred and fifty boxes of pears were picked.\n\nPotato digging is also done. The boys don't like it very well, because they don't like potatoes raw. But just the same we got a good cellar full stored.\n\nThe canning of fruit and jam is done also. The jams were apple and apricot. The preserves were pears, plums, peaches and tomatoes.\n\nSome of the hay is put in the barn while most of it is stacked. Silage is made for the cows, and put in the silo.\n\nSpring Work:\n\nThe fields are first plowed, then disked, then harrowed. Some of the boys have learned to drive the tractor and the truck. The early potatoes were planted first. Then the grain and vegetables.\n\nThe pruning of trees was done by Harry Thom, who also gave instructions to the farm boys who were helping him.\n\nWinter Work:\n\nIn winter we haul hay for the two barns, and also for the sheep, and the horses cut in the fields. We grade the road with the tractor when the snow is too deep. Wood hauling is also done. Mr. Vaughn-Jones is the Farm Manager.\nThe Dairy\n\nWe have twelve milk cows at present which give around thirty-five to forty-five gallons daily. There are also eleven heifers. We have about fifteen to twenty hogs, and a big flock of chickens, which give about two pails of eggs daily. There are two turkeys which have a brood of about fifteen which are being raised for Christmas dinner. Mr. R. Biddle is the Dairy Manager.\n\n-------//-------\n\nSPORTS ACTIVITIES, Continued\n\nST. GEORGE'S AND LYTTON SPORTS DAY\n\nOn June 11 we had our sports at the Lytton Race Track. I think it was one of the best sports days we have had yet.\n\nMr. Medici, the owner of the New Lytton Hotel, put up a silver cup to the school that had the most points. St. George's School won it.\n\nThe events started off at 10:30. Some of the events were relay races, sack races, broad jumps, high jumps, dashes, and wheelbarrow races.\n\nAbout 12:30 we had our dinner. We had hot-dogs, ice-cream, cake, doughnuts and besides that we were given tickets to get free drinks and ice-cream.\n\nAfter dinner we had more events and after they were all over we had a softball game and Lytton beat us. The score was 15 to 13.\n\nAfter everything was over they added up the points to see which pupil had the most. Daphne Thom had most with 18 points and Wilfred Wells was second with 16 points. Both pupils are from St. George's School.\n\n\u2014Albert Wells\nAROUND ST. GEORGE'S\n\nThings We Could Do Without........................\n\n1. Cod-liver oil\n2. The 6:30 a.m. bell\n3.

We also had a new electric organ so Miss Hives played on it for some of our dance music. After having our refreshments we each received a Christmas present from Mr. Richard Spencer.\n\nJanuary 10th was the date for our next party - Mr. Hives' birthday. The girls took up a collection and bought him a wallet. I think everyone enjoyed themselves as we usually do.\n\nFebruary 14th, our Valentine's party, was also a grand evening. First we had a picture show from Lytton and then our party afterwards.\n\nMiss Hives and Miss Phelps took dancing classes with the boys and girls before and after Lent every week so that we would be ready for our next party which was on April 9th. May 7th was Mr. Hives birthday so we had a social that evening, too, and had a wonderful time.\n\n--Phyllis Dunstan\n\nTHE GIRLS' AUXILLARY AND WOMEN'S AUXILLARY SALE\n\nOn June 18th the Women's Auxiliary and Girls' Auxiliary had a sale of work and tea at 2:30 in the afternoon. The Women's Auxiliary made some delicious cakes, cookies, pies and candy which disappeared very quickly. Then outside was all the sewing, knitting, embroidery work, etc. While the W.A. was serving tea on the little lawn in front of the school, the bigger boys and girls, led by Mr. Arthur Hives and Miss Phelps, put on a display of calliophones.\n\nThere were quite a few of the children's parents present as well as other visitors from Lytton.\n\nAfter the sale, on June 21st, the G.A. had their last meeting, and also went out on a weiner roast beside the swimming pool. We each bought our own bottle of orange crush while Mrs. Ingram bought the hot dogs and doughnuts. I think we all had a wonderful time for after eating our hot dogs (which didn't take long) we sat around the fire and sang songs before going home.\n\n-- Phyllis Dunstan\nTHE CHURCH CORNER\n\nThe Wedding.....\n\nEveryone was invited to attend the wedding of Rosie Adams and Martin Abbott on Oct 1st, 1946. We were all neatly dressed in our Sunday best and all waiting for the first glimpse of the radiant bride.\n\nRosie wore a white satin wedding dress and carried a bouquet of white carnations and white asters. Her bridesmaid, May Dunstan, wore a pink dress and carried pink carnations and asters. Everyone was simply thrilled.\n\nThanksgiving Service.....\n\nOn Thanksgiving Day we had our regular Harvest Festival Service. Everyone that was able to attended. The church was specially decorated with farm produce as well as autumn leaves and flowers, by Miss Jobling with the help of a few girls. It was very lovely indeed.\n\nChristmas Service.....\n\nOn Dec 22nd we had our Carol Candlelight Service. On every window there were three candles all lighted and there were some very lovely flowers on the altar. The choir sang carols and the congregation in turn sang Christmas hymns. On the night before Christmas at 12 o'clock, we had our midnight celebration of Holy Communion.\n\nServices Before and After Easter.....\n\nDuring the Lenten Season we had evening services at 7:30, taken by Mr. Hixon and by Rev. Baker when Mr. Hixon was away. On Easter Morning we had Holy Communion at 7:30 and in the afternoon we had evening prayers and sermon at 2:30. We were all wearing our best. The church looked lovely with lilies and tulips. Everyone agreed that it was a lovely service. There was a service of Holy Communion on Ascension Day. There was Holy Communion in the morning and evening prayers and sermon at 2:30 in the afternoon on WhitSunday.\n\nConfirmation Service........\n\nOn Sunday, Jun 29th, the Bishop of our Diocese came to confirm over forty of the pupils. The service took place at 10 in the morning. We sang five hymns in our very best way. The Bishop said that he had never heard us sing so well before.\n\nNew Organ........\n\nDuring the year a new electric organ was installed in the chapel.\n\n--Marjorie Alec\nLIFE AT ST. GEORGE'S\n\nA whirr of an alarm clock and shaking of a head,\n\"Ahh! It is too early to get up from my bed;\"\n'Tis time to rise,\" says one, \"and be about.\"\n\"Where are my boots?\" I heard another shout.\n\"Now to milk cows, we must get dressed.\"\n\"Hey, wait, Alby, is your pants pressed?\"\nNow hear a clip-clop down the hall,\nWhich isn't necessary there at all.\nThen an impatient call \u2014 \"Come on, you girls!\nNow hurry up and brush those curls.\"\n\"These curling pins are tangled in my hair,\nHelp me, Amelia, do not stand and stare.\"\n\"All kitchen girls blow; rings cut the cry,\n\"I wish you wouldn't push \u2014 I cannot fly!\"\n\nThen rings that darn old bell again\nWhether in wind, sunshine or rain,\nSoon the great building throbs with wakening life,\nThe hum of action, clatter, too, of strife.\n\"We breakfast soon,\" say all, and stop below.\nSome hurrying, others still bemused and slow.\nMilkers are there returning from their chores,\nTreading with noisy boots about the floors.\nThe kitchen girls are scurrying here and there\nSetting tables, placing bench and chairs.\nAt length, in order every no lines up\nTo have their breakfast without ketchup!\nSoon they are eating milk and bread,\nAnd also porridge (a cereal I dread).\n\nBreakfast is done and now above the stairs\nWe line the hall, all reverent for prayers,\nAn hallowed moment ere begins the day,\nIts pleasures, disappointments, work and play,\nThat with its happenings of joy and pain\nWhen once departed never comes again.\n\nThen some boys chop wood down at the woodpile\nAnd they all sit with a happy smile,\nAlso others work down at the barn,\nAnd still others labour on the farm.\n\"It\", said a tall lad, \"to class must progress\nAnd there remain until recess.\nWilfred asks me how to pronounce a word,\nThe big-little-hard-easy word is absurd,\nBut I do the asking when it comes to arithmetic\nAnd when he doesn't know, I sure feel sick.\nBut soon the dinner bell will be ringing\nAnd by that time my stomach for food is singing,\nThen to the farm I must proceed\nAnd if I'm late, I shall have to use speed.\"\n\nBut after that noon bell rings very soon,\nSome girls are busy serving with a big spoon.\nThe dinner is ready and the children come in\nNot so quiet you can hear the drop of a pin.\nAnd none of the children are a minute late \u2014\nYou can tell by the clattering of each well-filled plate,\nAfter dinner starts the washing of dishes,\n\"I wish I were outside,\" Dorothy wishes.\n\nNow to the Laundry come will go,\nSome climb the stairs to learn to mend and sew,\nSome for their health's sake take a needed rest,\nWhile others go to classrooms neatly dressed.\nSays Johnny Joe, \"Who hath my pencil took?\"\n\"And who,\" says Wesley, \"has my spelling book?\"\nFrancis, as usual, is up to tricks\nWhile Gerald grumbles at Arithmetics.\n\"Sleep,\" quoth the teacher, \"will your life prolong,\"\n\"Will calm the nerves, and make the muscles strong.\"\n\"I'll try some, now,\" our gentle Jeannette sighs,\nAnd pillowed on her desk, doth close her languorous eyes.\n\nAt four o'clock they all come hurrying out\nWith marbles, balls and laugh and joyous shouts.\nFor this is playtime ore the evening's share\nOf labours, milking, supper to prepare \u2014\nAnd washing dishes comes to claim the hours \u2014\nToch us not skill of work, and greater powers.\nThen comes the evening, gently rises prayers,\nThe little ones soon after mount the stairs.\n\nMay sew or read according to their likes,\nSometimes the joyous sound of dancing feet\nSometimes the music of a sing-song sweet\nMay reach the ear, but soon 'tis hushed and still\nAs each one seeks their couch to rest until\nThe morn.\n\nI lay my weary head\nUpon the pillow of my welcome bed.\n\nNote: The above was composed by the School Poets, of whom there are (believe it or not) quite a number.\n\nDID YOU KNOW???\n\nThat the only way we could get our Editor to high-jump or run on the Field Day was to offer him peanuts?\n\nEd's Note: What do you mean \"peanuts\"?

Also, over one hundred \"Letters to the Editor\" have been written, the greater part of which obviously could not be published.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nTo Brother Riou, O.M.I., who has taken the photograph which appears on our cover.\n\nTo Brother Fournier, O.M.I., who has most generously given a great amount of his time to printing the photographs which appear in our Year Book.\nTo Our Parents\n\nIt is with the greatest of pleasure that we have looked forward to the day when we could again present you with one of our year books. We have all co-operated to make this piece of work as interesting as possible for both pupils and parents, as well as for our dear friends. For you especially, our parents, we have obtained the Interview and Historical Section, which is in itself very realistic, to bring back to you memories of the days you spent at school.\n\nBefore you could read this book, many steps had to be taken to get the required material, reports, critics and news, to say nothing of the photography, stencil work, drawing, printing, joining, trimming, and so on. However we did it to please you, and the task was an easy one.\n\nAll in all, I do believe our work has been a success; we sincerely hope that your pleasure in receiving it will be as great as ours was in doing it.\n\nTo you our parents, we dedicate this book.\n\nDorothy Dumont, Grade VIII\nRev. P. PICHE, O.M.I.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nMESSAGE\nfrom the PRINCIPAL\n\nThe Year Book for 1947 is going to press and again it is my pleasure to extend greetings to all the parents, ex-pupils and friends. Our students are happy to report to their beloved ones, their school activities and their achievements during the year which now comes to a close, and I wish to compliment the editorial staff for the excellence of this book.\n\nThe success of our pupils, during this year, in the various competitions with High Schools and Collegiates of the Province has added to the renown of our institution and is a credit to the parents and to the Indian people. The sons and daughters of your homes are fine boys and girls, and it is your prayerful desire to give them not necessarily what is easiest and sweetest but what is strong and of eternal value: Christian education.\n\nThis means that in the training of your children we endeavour to consider not only their mind and their body, but also their soul, their will and their heart. We strongly believe that the subject of true education is \"man whole and entire\", soul united to body in unity of nature, and that unless a man's heart is filled with high ideals of the dignity...\nof man, of the purpose of life, of his final destination and\nof the duties that he has towards God, his Creator, and to-\nwards his fellowmen and country, and lives and acts accord-\ningly, he is not educated.\n\nOn account of its utmost importance, this religious tea-\nching must be given not only in Church, but must start in the\nhome and should be continued in the School. If the home fail\nto give this training; the school can repair some of the harm\ndone, but will always encounter failures among its pupils. On\naccount of the lack of religious practice at home, the chil-\ndren will come to consider their duties towards God and their\nneighbours on a \"part time basis.\" We know that religion must\nbe on a \"full time basis,\" and must dominate all that we do\nand think, because there is no field of action or study where\none can consider himself independent of his Creator and Mas-\nter.\n\nThis year sixteen pupils are of age to be discharged.\nWe are pleased with the desire of many of them to continue\ntheir studies and training. Full opportunity and means will\nbe given them for advancement in higher studies, but it re-\nmains for you, parents, to get behind them and give them en-\ncouragement.\n\nThe Year Book records the interest our school is gi-\nving to Music, Singing, Dramatics, Calet Training and Voca-\ntional Training. We feel that all these activities meet with\nthe needs of our students and provide opportunities for main-\ntaining morale and good spirit, and for the building of cha-\nracter.\n\nMay my last word be addressed to you, ex-pupils and\ngraduates: The school wants to be proud of you. Keep in your\nheart the love of God and neighbour. Be honest and dependable,\nfor when it is said of someone: \"He cannot be trusted\", it is\nthe final condemnation. He has no place in society. In life\nyou will often meet with things that do not suit you, but you\nmust learn to accept them with a smile. Moreover, if you want\nto be successful, be good workers. Too many men with ability\nare failures because they are afraid of work. Do your work\neven if it is difficult.\n\nMy last advice: Be kind and unselfish. Do not always\nask yourselves \"What is in this for me\", but rather \"How can\nit help others\". All this gives room for plenty of work but\nit will lead you to happiness and prosperity.\n\nPaul Piche, O.M.I.,\nprincipal.\nLetters to the Editor\n\nOttawa, July 9, 1946.\n\nWe have received the splendid 1946 Year Book of your school. We would like to offer our congratulations to yourself, the members of your staff and to the pupils who helped in the publishing of this book. It is one of which you can all be justly proud.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\n**************************\n\nFort Qu'Appelle, July 4, 1946.\n\nIn acknowledging receipt of your 1946 Year Book, I wish to thank you for same and also congratulate you, the staff and pupils on preparing and editing such a splendid Year Book. The results of your efforts would be a credit to any white School, and should make the parents, ex and present pupils very proud to have the privilege of attending the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.B. Simes, M.D.,\nSupt., Qu'Appelle Indian Health Unit.\n\n**************************\n\nTo The Editor:- I would like a little more variety in the Year Book. How about squeezing in some jokes here and there. It would give more reality to the book itself, as well as relaxation to the reader. I am sure there are plenty of gags that can be put in. Frankly, I think there has to be something to laugh about \"Once in a blue moon.\"\n\nSincerely,\n\nCaroline Peigan, Grade VIII.\nTo the Editor:- I would like to see the Year Book about three quarters of an inch thick. I do not like to read a thin book like last year, although it was very interesting.\n\nYours truly,\n\nFelix Ashdohonk, Grade VI.\n\nDear Editor:- Many boys send criticisms to the editor, but I don't send any because I enjoy reading the Year Book when it is brought to us at home. I don't care how thick or thin it is, because it contains the news of the school.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeorge Kaiyasawatum, Grade VI.\n\nDear Editor:- It was remarked that there are too many articles in the Year Book about the girls, but I find that it is just the contrary, and would like to see more about the girls in the future.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nAntoinette Desnomie, Gr. VIII.\n\nDear Editor:- In the Year Book we read a lot about boys' sports. Why can't we girls have organized baseball games, basketball, etc., and play against other teams? Then we would be able to read about Girls' Sports too. As it is, there is no great interest in sports for girls. What do you think?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJean Yuzicapi, Grade VII.\n\nDear Editor:- I am very pleased by the way the boys are mentioned in the Year Book in every activity this year. Perhaps the girls get a pain when they read such things, (or perhaps they cry). Of course the girls are talked about too, but what do they do? Sing their heads off. Boys are not birds to sing all the time.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nAdam Goodpipe, Grade VI.\n\nDear Editor:- Could I put in a word about the organists? I feel that there should be more boys playing the organ. For the last two or three years it has been the girls all the time. I'd like to know why the boys don't want to come upstairs and play on the big organ. ...\n\nYours truly,\n\nClara Mini, Grade VII.\n\nDear Editor:- In a letter to the editor a girl was wondering why the boys don't play the organ. Before we answer, may I ask the girls why they don't play in the band?\n\nSincerely,\n\nRichard Poitras, Grade VII.\nDear Editor:- Would you be able to give an answer to a girls' problem? We don't know of any boys ever sending their woodwork to the Regina Exhibitions. Is it because they think it is not well done, or is it that they have no tickets? One way or the other it confuses us girls.\n\nVery anxiously,\nNorma Cappo\n\n**********************************\n\nDear Editor:- Why is it that Pauline Johnson's books and stories are not better known in the school? We learnt for the first time this year that there was an Indian author. We read \"Flint and Feather\" and enjoyed it greatly.\n\nVery sincerely,\nBeatrice Missens\n\n**********************************\n\nTo the Editor:- I would like to suggest that we send a letter to Ottawa asking for at least two dozen books annually per class, especially for the higher grades, and I think the teacher should be allowed to select them. The reason I suggest this is, that being a great bookworm I have much enjoyed reading the books that our principal and teacher had to buy when we were hard up for good literature. I speak on behalf of my friends, who like myself, take great pleasure in reading.\n\nDorothy Dumont, Grade VIII.\n\n**********************************\n\nDear Editor:- I would like to have this school teaching the same work and giving the same exams as the public schools of the province. In this way we would have a better chance to a higher education.\n\nYours sincerely,\nKenneth Goodwill, Grade VII.\n\n**********************************\n\nDear Editor:- I would prefer the grades as they are now, but I would also like to have a recognized certificate that I can show later on in life. I think that if we would work a little harder we would get somewhere.\n\nYours truly,\nCharles Bellegarde, Grade VII.\n\n**********************************\n\nDear Editor:- I would prefer class as it is now, because what we want is to work on the farm and in the shops and barns. We learn just as much by working out as we do in the classroom.\n\nYours truly,\nGordon John, Grade VII.\nSTORY OF OUR SCHOOL\n\nThe Boys Interview\n\nMr. LAFLEUR\n\nMr. Verreault: I am sure we are all very happy to have you with us this morning, Mr. Lafleur. We know that you have been at this school for 43 years, and we would like to ask you a few questions about the old days.\n\nC. Bellegarde: How did you come here?\n\nMr. Lafleur: I arrived from Ottawa by train, on Jan. 26, 1904.\n\nMr. Bedard: I wasn't born then! But tell me, what did I see look like in those days?\n\nMr. Lafleur: It was a tiny village, with the school, old convent, mission, and the houses of Mr. Goupal, Paquin, and Mrs. Desnoeux, about seven houses altogether.\n\nMr. Bedard: Were you always a baker?\n\nMr. Lafleur: I am now 72, and have been a baker all my life.\n\nC. Bellegarde: How many loaves of bread have you baked in all these years?\n\nMr. Lafleur: I did not count them.\n\nTom Desnomie: Have you known the first school?\n\nMr. Lafleur: It burned down three weeks before I came. I had met Father Hugonard in Ottawa, where he hired me, and he was on the way back when he heard about the fire.\n\nMr. Verreault: Weren't the pupils of those days the parents of the children here today?\n\nMr. Lafleur: Yes, I remember in particular Henry John, Pat Cappo, Joe Goodwill, Mike Dubois, Nicholas and Anthony Ironchild, and Alec Desnomie. There were also a few from Crooked Lake.\n\nTom Desnomie: What activities did the boys have then?\n\nMr. Lafleur: The boys worked on the farm or in the shops. There was the blacksmith shop with Mr. MacDonald, Carrier Brown and Carbonneau as successive instructors. Mr. Crossley was instructor in the carpenter shop. There was also a shoe shop with Mr. Richer, and a tinsmith shop with Mr. Polier.\n\nMr. Verreault: And of course, a bake shop with Mr. Lafleur. Did any of the boys work in the bake shop?\n\nMr. Lafleur: There were two boys in the bake shop until 1912. I remember having Noel Pinay and Anthony Ironchild. Baking was not a trade which could be used on the reserves, so these boys were merely helpers.\n\nPage 9\nTom Desnomie: What differences today do you find most striking?\nMr. Lafleur: The habits and manners of the children. And here, boys, I must give you a little advice. Be courteous and polite today as you are expected to be in the future. Through the years there has already been a great improvement. Be polite even to each other. Very soon you will be men; think seriously of the future.\n\nNorman Pascal: How many pupils were there in your time?\nMr. Lafleur: About one hundred and fifty.\nWillie Dumont: Have you ever seen any Red River carts?\nMr. Lafleur: No. That was before my time.\nTom Desnomie: Where did you come from?\nMr. Lafleur: From Ottawa. I was born in St. Benoit on Dec. 23, 1875, lived in St. Ad\u00e8le till the age of 16. I then came to Ottawa, which I left 43 years ago to come here.\n\nLawrence Dubois: Is this school on the same spot as the old one?\nMr. Lafleur: Yes. All three schools were in this same place.\nTom Desnomie: Did the boys play the same games as today?\nMr. Lafleur: Much the same. When I arrived in 1904, they had a powerful baseball team. I remember that Lawrence Thompson was pitcher, Henry Smith was catcher, Joe Moses was in the field and Pat Cappo on first. Football was also played, and I think it should have been continued.\n\nMr. Verreault: I heard that the boys in those days used to do their own laundry! Don't you think they should still do so today?\nMr. Lafleur: The laundry was then on the site of Mr. Bedard's house. The boys did their laundry there one day a week, and had to carry their water from the lake by cart. Perhaps they should do so today.\n\nTom Desnomie: How long were the holidays at that time?\nMr. Lafleur: Two months in summertime. In Father Hugonard's time about 35 children stayed at the school throughout the year, such as the children from Manitoba or Lake Pelleter.\n\nTom Desnomie: Had they any electric lights then?\nMr. Lafleur: At first we were using gas lamps. Electric lights came some time later.\n\nAnd now, boys, I must go back to my work. Always remember this: whatever work you do, do it well. Apply yourself to it, with the knowledge that it will be profitable to you later on. Look ahead of you and think of the future. Those only will succeed who make themselves ready to meet the problems of life. Do not wait for tomorrow; prepare for tomorrow.\nIn Our Parents' School Days\n\nAfter the first school had burned down in 1904, this question was present in the minds of many: \"Is the government going to erect another?\" Father Hugonard laid down plans for a new school but without immediate success. After two months of fruitless efforts he came back from Ottawa without having received even a promise of help.\n\nHowever before spring of 1905 things changed swiftly. Reconstruction began with $35,000. Father Hugonard's plans were followed as far as dimensions were concerned, but the execution was improved. Thus at the cost of $125,000, one of the best of Canada's Industrial Schools was built. It was opened in the fall of 1905. The new building had modern equipment, according to a uniform and carefully studied plan which facilitated supervision.\n\nIt was a beautiful three winged edifice with a stone foundation. The south wing was occupied by the girls, the north one by the boys, while in the central building were the chapel, the personnel's apartments, the parlors, the infirmary, the kitchen and the dining rooms.\n\nFather Hugonard regarded his school primarily as a tool for the christian civilization of the Indians. For over 40 years he devoted himself to mission work. \"He loved his Indians, and appeared fully happy among these little children whom he loved as a father, as a mother, as God alone can love\". He died in Feb. 1917. His loss was keenly felt at the school and in all the valley. After Father Hugonard's death a monument was erected to his memory. This memorial was unveiled in the summer of 1927, among an immense gathering. It represents Father Hugonard standing between an Indian boy and girl.\n\nOn Nov. 13, 1932, at 6:45 a.m., during mass, fire broke out in the girl's wing of the building. The blaze spread rapidly, and by 10:30 a.m., the entire school had been completely destroyed. Aided by the citizens of the town, and also by the scholastics, the staff saved everything that it could reach.\nbooks, clothing, furniture, etc. Some of the outbuildings were also saved. The financial loss was estimated at a quarter of a million dollars.\n\nThe Scholastics busied themselves in sorting, moving and putting away what had been snatched from the flames. Father Blanchin, superior of the Scholasticate sheltered all the boys, while the girls were housed in the town hall, old church. The Sisters divided their numbers between these different localities.\n\nAt the Scholasticate children and Scholastics mingled and became one large family. Shy at first, the boys quickly got used to the new order of things. Catechism was taught by the Scholastics. An instrumental band was begun and built up by Brother Piche, now principal of the school. The brothers acquired a fresh interest in Indian missions, and quite a few began to study the Indian language. Among the latter was Father Laviolette, who quickly mastered Sioux and is now missionary of the S\u00f4hian missions of Western Canada.\n\nThe girls had classrooms in the town hall, the old church was used as a chapel, dining room and recreation hall, while the basement of the new church was transformed into a dormitory. The staff and children were thus sheltered until March, 1936, when they moved into this the new school, a splendid modern fireproof building which now shelters approximately 300 pupils.\n\nRose Alma Bellegarde Gr.7.\n\nPhoto: The Second Indian School, (1905 - 1932).\nWORK AND STUDY\n\nProgramme of Studies\n\nThe basis of our programme of studies, as with all other Indian schools of Canada, is the curriculum of the province in which we are located. Therefore the instruction given in the Lebret Indian Residential School is fundamentally the same as that given in the public schools of the province of Saskatchewan. This programme provides instruction and experiences in ten subject. Four of these, language, reading, spelling and writing, are intended to develop skill in the use of the English language. Mathematics provides the pupils with the ability to perform the ordinary computations of everyday life, and forms a background for higher studies. Agriculture and science, social studies, health, art and music, complete the curriculum, with the purpose of making the children familiar with the many interesting aspects of nature, the community, and the artistic. In Indian schools, religious instruction has been added to this programme because of the undeniable necessity of religion in true education, and forms an important part of the activities of the school.\n\nAnother feature of the instruction of our school is Manual Training, which is intended to enable the children to earn a living successfully by manual work. This necessary addition to the programme makes it impossible to maintain the academic standards of the public schools in the higher grades.\n\nThe training division of the Indian Affairs Branch in Ottawa closely cooperates with us. This year it has introduced a number of new textbooks, and has shown its interest in our work by publishing a periodical \"Indian School Bulletin\", in order to guide us in the task of Indian education.\nReligious Instruction\n\nA new course in Catechism has been organized this year by Fr. Guy. Not a new doctrine, but every class has studied a different part of our faith in a different way. The course in Grade One deals with the preparation to the first communion. Grade II studied the life of our Lord in the form of Bible stories, His miracles, His apostles, etc. Grade III learnt that everyone is called to be perfect as His Father in heaven is perfect; therefore they have studied capital sins, the means to avoid them, and the sacrament of Penance. In Grade IV and V the Mass and Liturgy have been the central point of view; a study of the different vestments and articles with a review of a few other sacraments. The older pupils from Grade V up have studied the Creed and the Sacraments.\n\nOur aim in Catechism is to bring these young children to appreciate more and more the beautiful life of God in everyone of us, to bring their will to perform freely what is right according to their knowledge, to obey the authority of God as well as of men. The young Fathers and Brothers of the Scholasticate have been invited to come and give a lesson every week in each class and to prepare a classroom book for every grade as a guide for the future. They have gladly accepted and all the teachers have appreciated their help.\n\nPosters on Food\n\nTo all Indian Day and Residential Schools, a good drawing contest has been provided by the Indian Affairs Branch in Ottawa. The form of the drawing consisted of one poster in three parts, illustrating all three of the following points: the food I like to eat in a day, the ways I like to get the food, how I like to eat the food. A board of three judges was selected by Father Principal for choosing the three prize winning posters among the competing pupils of this school. Dr. and Mrs Simes from Fort Qu'Appelle and Father Lavigne, provincial, accepted the invitation as judges, and decided the three following posters worthy of entry for the Grand Prize Awards: First: Gracie Yusicapi, grade 7; second, Jeannie Cyr, grade 5; third, Lucy Desnomie, grade 4.\n\nThe prizes were $5, $5 and $2 for each Indian School, and $50, $25 and $10 for the Dominion Award winners.\n\nAmong the above three drawings sent to the Nutrition Division at Ottawa, news came shortly that Gracie Yusicapi's drawing had won the third Grand Award. Congratulations, Gracie!\nAdventures in History\n\nI was asked to give a short report on the programme in Social Studies followed in our school during the latter part of the current year. Social Studies never did appeal to me as a subject, yet I must say that I simply enjoyed it this year.\n\nIn as short a space as is possible I will give you an outline of the course entitled \"The Story of Qu'Appelle Valley\", prepared by Mr. Verreaux. It is part of a special programme suitable to Indian pupils.\n\n\"The Legend of Qu'Appelle Valley,\" a poem by the Indian author Pauline Johnson.\n\nQu'Appelle Valley, description and map study.\n\nThe Story of the Qu'Appelle missions.\n\nWestern Canadian History in Qu'Appelle Valley:\n- The Fur Trade - The Mounted Police\n- The Building of the Railway\n- The Qu'Appelle Indian Treaty\n- The American Sioux in Qu'Appelle Valley\n- Qu'Appelle Valley and the Saskatchewan Insurrection\n\nThe Story of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School:\n- The Foundation - The First School\n- The First Fire - Life of Father Hugonard\n- The Second School - The Third School\n\nThe Indians of Qu'Appelle Valley:\nSituation, establishment and history of the reserves of Tile Hills Agency, Qu'Appelle Agency, and the reservations of the Assiniboine and the Sioux Indians.\n\nThe author certainly deserves credit for the wonderful piece of work which he has accomplished, and for the amount of time he has spent preparing suitable material to make the work both interesting and instructive to us pupils. I am convinced that you will all agree with me in saying that the Social Studies class was the one most enjoyed.\n\nAntoinette Desnomie, Grade VIII\nManual Training\n\nShop-talk - Some people think that there is nothing to sawing a board. We carpenters know better. You first have to mark your board with a square to have a straight cut. Then you start sawing gently on the corner opposite to you, and carefully watch that the saw does not slant or get out of line. Driving a nail is another complicated operation. Greenhorns usually end up with a smashed thumb, a crooked nail, and a split board. There is beauty in driving a nail straight, in two or three clean strokes.\n\nWith these and many other principles in mind, the boys greatly enjoyed the day that they spent in the shop each week, and turned out a number of different articles; frames, cabinets, bookcases, dust-boxes, ironing boards, cedar chests, cupboards, tables, pews, ladders and stairs. The models are supplied by Mr. Joe Desjarlais, carpenter and instructor. The boys also worked at roofing and repairing the chicken coop.\n\nIn this way we learn the use of many tools, such as hammer, saw, chisel, plane, coping saw, key saw, square, drill, brace and bit, screwdriver, rasp, file, etc.\n\nIn other departments, Alfred Lavallee and Richard Poitras have had charge of the chicken coop, and have successfully taken two batches of spring chicks through the period of incubation. The boys have also worked on the farm and in the garden. Pat Fourhorns has spent the greater part of the year in the shoe shop, and from a torn, wrinkled old shoe can now make an elegant shining piece of footwear.\n\nA Stitch in time ... Look at this wonderful sewing-room! The sister in charge, small but active Sister Micheaud, is so proud of it that she would gladly show it to all the ladies, mammas and misses of the reserves and of the whole world. There, new clothes are made - old ones renewed, stockings knitted on the knitting machine and by hand - weaving is done - patches are put on - slick mending and darning goes on with the famous darning machine.\n\nWe must not forget the concert costumes, the various pieces made to obtain the proficiency badges, etc. If all these stitches are to be written in the eternal book, how many pages will it take?\n\nPots and Pans - I am sure that you will agree with me if I say that the kitchen is the most important department of the whole school. We do not always think of it, but what would happen if there were no meals ready when we come into the dining room with wide open eyes and empty stomachs? None of that in the Lebret School. Sister Neudel will certainly have a splendid reward, for she gives us not only a cup of cold water, but plenty of good food which is much appreciated by us boys and girls. And the Senior girls who have been under our cook's guidance will surely be the joy of their husbands if they ever have the fancy to get married.\n\nPage 16\nIn the shop: Moses Desgagnes, Roland Whitebear, Mr. Joe Desjarlais, Pat Fourhorns, Ben Bell, Victor Tachan, Leslie Hotain, Harry Bigheety, John James Yawiyacka, Billy Bellegarde.\n\nIn the sewing room: Jean Doris, Lillian Tuckanow, Mary Louise MacArthur, Lillian Tawiyacka, Sr., Michelina Mini, Ruth Bear, Bernice Desmarche, Dorothy Dumont, Rose Anne Desmarche, and Margaret Redman.\n\nSister Neumier, Pauline Leclaire and Marian Nokusis in the kitchen.

Herauf, Sister A. Gosselin, Father P. Piche, Mr. E. Doll, Mr. F Verreault.\n\nCaroline Peigan is a girl with high ideals. Her sole ambition is to become a nurse. She has completed her Grade VIII and intends to continue her studies. Her favorite subject is Literature. In class one usually finds her with a dictionary, looking up a new word to use in her vocabulary. One horrible habit of hers is to put her nose into a digest and ignore all else. Carol is a good seamstress, also very clever at crocheting and knitting. She does not like cooking. Some of her hobbies are reading, writing letters and skating. She is very fond of singing, especially the Western songs.\n\nDorothy Dumont of File Hills Colony is well known for her gaiety and dimpled smile. She is fifteen years old and has completed her Grade VIII. Some of her favorite hobbies are reading and playing ball. Literature is her preferred subject. One of her horrible habits is asking questions so she will have less work to do. She is very fond of cooking. In needlework she cannot be beat. She plays the organ and is often found practicing long after her time is due. When Dorothy has a favor to ask, you're sure to know, for she'll look at you with those sparkling eyes and pearly teeth, and say: \"Oh please, just this time, you know I said please!\"\n\nAntoinette Desnomie, curly hair, fairly short, pleasant disposition. She has completed her Grade VIII with honors and is the star of the class. I do believe she is very interested in all her class work, but certainly doesn't have a weakness for Maths. Antoinette is very skilled in any kind of needlework and also succeeds well in cooking. She is another...\nof our bookworms and prefers reading to almost anything else. She likes receiving letters but is not so keen about answering. Words seem to fail her. A horrible habit of hers is daydreaming.\n\nBernice Desnomie: wavy brown hair, pleasing face, rather slim. Her favorite subject is spelling because it is the easiest. In her free time you will find her at Rita's desk composing letters to Range Round Up, or painting snapshots. One of her horrible habits is saying \"Not I-I-I-I\" when Sister asks who is talking. Whatever Bernice does is well done and while working she hums and sings. Her preferred hobby is taking pictures and hiking. The manual work she likes best is cooking, perhaps because she succeeds so well. She likes singing cowboy songs.\n\nMary Julia Episkenow of Pasqua Reservation though not interested in class work she has her specialties, she has done some wonderful work in printing, copying music, sketching, etc. Her favorite sports are skating and hiking. Her pet word is \"Ah no!\" If you're looking for an errand girl just ask Julia, she'll run miles for you. \"Just fond of it,\" says she. She has the knack of getting around someone and gains many favors in this way.\n\nEmilia Cyr of Pasqua Reservation, Emily, for short, is of a quiet nature, quite short and chubby. She is fifteen years old and has completed her Grade VII. Her favorite spot out of class is the kitchen. In class she has no preferred subject but I do know that she doesn't like composition. One would never believe it but she is a great tease in spite of her bashful ways. Her favorite hobbies are reading comics and hiking. Although not much of a singer she enjoys listening to some good music.\n\nRuth Bear of Sioux Reserve. Though not very brilliant in class work this girl can surpass anyone in knitting. She is not much of a singer but never misses the Range Round Up Program at 4 o'clock. Her favorite hobbies are listening to the radio, copying songs and hiking. Enjoys watching hockey and ball games and is always ready to cheer. Ruth is of an easy going disposition and never gets excited about anything.\n\nGracie Yuzicapi is a fifteen year old brunette, with brown eyes and a chubby face, and has also completed her Grade VII. Gracie is quite a girl to know. Does work in every field, class, sewing, fancy work, housekeeping. She likes all her work. Her hobbies are painting, taking snap-shots and going for hikes. Her favorite subjects is Maths. Gracie is the teacher's right hand and we call her \"our artist.\" One of her horrible habits is trying to beat Gracie Lavallee in Catechism. She is also very fond of singing. Her pet phrase is: \"Now don't you dare...\"\nPatrick Fourhorns is remarkable for his strength and size. He can easily do the work of three men, and could, I believe, lift the school off its foundations if he had the fancy. \"Punchy,\" as he is known, is a character which seems to have dropped out of a western show, complete with ten-gallon hat, good-nature, and... muscles. He has worked in the shoe shop, barns and on the farm. Pat is a star hockey and baseball player, where his great strength and speed break all opposition. As to work, give him any kind.\n\nVictor Tachan is a good looking, rather reserved young fellow, famous for his sparkling laugh and comical ways. Though not outstanding in his studies, he does well and is reliable. He is very sportive, having played hockey and baseball this year with the senior team. He is a good worker and is ever ready to do his share. He likes farm animals, and is and will do well around the farm on the prairies of Manitoba, where he comes from.\n\nAllan Goodwill, of Sioux Reserve, is a rather stout boy. He is playful, always happy and full of jokes. He has good manners when he makes use of them, and is well liked by everyone. He excels in sports and in band music, and does fairly well in class. His main abilities are in carpentry and farming, and in these he will probably make his future.\n\nJohn James Tawiyaka, of Sioux Reserve, \"Jackson\" is a good natured fellow, friendly, and is liked by everyone. Although rather silent, he is full of energy and is active in every school activity. He likes sports, and has been one of our prominent school athletes this year, being a part of the senior hockey and baseball team and a representative of the school in the field meet. John James probably prefers outside work to study although he does well in class. Yet he seems more at home around the shop, barns or on the farm, where his work is always carefully done. In the future, we see him as a prosperous farmer, and, naturally, as a member of the Sioux Baseball team.\n\nMoses Deegan - \"Mosie\" is tall, strong, and wears a grin on his face. Although he likes to tease, there there can be no evil in him, and so he is the friend of everyone. In class he is not among the first, but does his best. He holds the pencil in his big left hand and writes in a large square handwriting. He takes parts in sports, baseball in particular, where he is pitcher for one of the teams. Mosie's domain is the out of doors, where his strength and conscientiousness make him fit for any kind of work.\nBilly Bollegarde, of Filo Hills. \"Freckles\" is the name he is usually known by. With all his bossiness, pep and self-confidence, Billy is nevertheless a popular boy, and is certainly as good as they come. He is highly fond of teasing and annoying his younger brothers. Billy is very successful in his studies; he is intelligent, ambitious and hardworking, and if he continues his school grades, as he intends to, will certainly do well. Baseball, hockey, band music are among his other activities, and in each of these he is outstanding. His hobby is hunting. He also works well, and with enthusiasm.\n\nBenjamin Bell, of Griswold, Manitoba. Ben is a small, quick and likable fellow. His wide smile, laughing eyes, and his peculiar front teeth give him a bright and frank expression, and all will certainly miss him a great deal. His usual occupation seems to be running from those he has teased beyond endurance. Ben is not a great scholar, but is a good worker, and a very reliable one. He can be seen at all times of the day, with his cap turned backwards, going to and from his chores.\n\nRoland Whitebear, from Moose Mountain. Roland is tall, powerful fellow, who moves quickly and noiselessly. The small boys in particular are fond of him. His favorite occupations are listening to the radio (he knows scores of cowboy songs) and can sing, yodel or play the guitar, and torturing his friend Francis. He seems to have a knack for picking up nicknames, such as Barabbas, Bonos, etc. Roland loves to work, and is ever ready to do any job he is offered, particularly around the farm.\n\nHarry Biggshotty, came to us this year from Northern Manitoba, and has quickly become one of us. He has a good character, and is famous for not minding his own business. They say he is the grand champion at the dinner table. Everyone rather likes him for his cheerfulness and pleasant personality. Harry is quite good in class although his headaches, if he has any, don't come from too much study. He likes to strum on his guitar and sing western songs. He is a steady and reliable worker, and does well the great amount of work that is asked of him.\n\nLeslie Hotain, of Oak River, is a steady, amiable boy who will probably never have an enemy, and has had good conduct all through his school years. He is very patient and reliable. Leslie excels in sports, and though not a scholar works well in class. He does best in outdoor work around the barns and farm, and is good in carpentry. No one has ever known him to be a job carelessly. His good character and seriousness will serve him well in the future.\nSept. 2: Opening of the school year. Most of the pupils enrolled for the coming year back. We find a few changes. Sister Superior Sauve has been replaced by Sister A. Gaudet, formerly of St. Michael's, N.D. We extend to her a hearty welcome. Her smiling countenance has already won our hearts. Miss C. Piche takes charge of the Grade II class. Being an accomplished pianist she will have many an occasion to show her talent. Sister Bilodeau and Laneville also are new-comers. Sister Winter, although a bit late, is nevertheless received with open arms, especially by the Senior Girls. To all we extend a glad welcome.\n\nMany of the pupils earnestly look forward to see whether or not they were awarded prizes at the Provincial exhibition. They were not disappointed, as our school had many prizes in art, writing, exercise books, pressed flowers and weeds, insects, embroidery work, crocheting, knitting, sewing and mending.\n\nSept. 9: Father Richard C.F.M. from Montreal took pictures of the pupils at work in the classrooms, sewingrooms etc., and also of the beautiful scenes of the valley. He is producing a film in color, which we hope to see some day.\n\nSept. 13: The Pupils and members of the staff go to Fort Qu'Appelle to see the show \"Bells of St. Marys\".\n\nOct. 2: Patronal feast of the school - Holy Guardian Angels - Holiday.

Our school put on two plays, \"Stolen Prince\" and \"Golden Slipper.\" The Stolen Prince is highly praised by Mrs. Harrison and takes first place.\n\nDec. 23: Jan. 5: Something very extraordinary takes place... The children, with the exception of a few from the distant reservations, spend their Christmas vacations at home. Now we have something to look forward to next Christmas.\n\nJan. 17: The sudden death of His Eminence Cardinal R. Villeneuve takes us all by surprise. A requiem high mass is sung on the 21st, for the repose of his soul.\n\nJan. 23: Everyone is bustling around this afternoon, for Mr. Os- trander, Indian Commissioner, is here and for the first time since his appointment we have a little concert for him. Perhaps he will come often now, since Father Principal had him understand that he didn't come very often. All turn out well and he grants us a holiday.\n\nFeb. 2: It being the Principal's feast day, we make the most of it. A very nicely prepared concert takes place in the evening, after which a reflection is served in the dining room. Everyone admires the cake which was made in the form of our school. Next morning a high mass is sung, followed by a holiday.\nFeb. 2-20: Great blizzards, railway blocked - no trains.

He enjoyed it immensely.\n\nMay 1: A surprise awaits us this evening. Mr. Doll is going to entertain us with another of his plays a drama entitled \"Lonely Lady.\" However, we were quite disappointed when all is over as we find it too short.\n\nMay 2: The news of the newly elected Superior General of the Oblate comes to us over the radio. He is a Canadian by the name of Father Deschatelets, former Provincial of the East. When one member is honored everyone is honored so Father Piche grants us a holiday.\n\nMay 7: No class. Teachers attend an Institute at Fort Qu'Appelle.\nMay 6. The sad news came over the radio this morning of the death of our Archbishop, His Excellency P.J. Monaham. He passed away in the Grey Nuns Hospital in Regina. We sing a Requiem high mass for the repose of his soul on the 9th. We hope his successor will be as kind hearted and good as he was.\n\nThis afternoon some unexpected visitors come to the classrooms: Mr. & Mrs. Gould and one of the Primary teachers from Moose Jaw Normal School, Miss Welland. They take everyone by surprise.\n\nMay 8 & 9. A lady from Ottawa, Miss Lock, spends a few days with us. She encourages all to eat vegetables, by giving a seven minute film \"Do You.\"\n\nPicture Show this evening, given by Father Joyal, who is in the School.

In the evening, at the town hall, we see a show entitled \"Desert Victory.\"\n\nBy Gracie Lavallee Gr. VII & Ella Cyr Gr. VI.\nfrom the four corners\n\n* Barbara Laswisse is apparently the most pious girl in the school. When she was asked one day why she was greatly pacing up and down the garden walk, she replied with dignity: \"I am reciting the breviary.\"\n\nAnimals and Friends - Bambi, our little deer, is quite a personality in the boys' playground. He is fond of us, but fonder yet of apples, which he crunches right out of our hand. When he had his horns, Bambi loved to fight, and Freddy Gordon was knocked down three or four times before learning to keep away. Bambi perhaps took him for a little buck.\n\nBirdie is the Grade IV Girls' canary. He is very fond of Father Guy, who often sacrifices part of his apple to bring vitamins to his little friend. Father Guy is trying to teach him how to whistle.\n\n* - Hello, Frankie! How are you this morning?\n--Ya,\n\nMimeograph and pantograph - Mary Julia Episkenow is an expert with the pantograph. She enlarges and reduces drawings, prints, etc., for the Indian Missionary Record. We need more skilled and patient girls and boys for this kind of work.\n\nThe mimeograph has seldom been idle this year. It has turned out heaps of circulars, forms, briefs, tickets, worksheets, programmes, and a complete hymn book, to say nothing of the Year Book. A whole staff of skilled technicians, headed by Kenneth Goodwill, has been trained among the boys, and can handle every step of this kind of production.\n\nPage 27\n* If you were to make a statue of these people, perhaps you should represent them as follows:\n  - Roland Whitebear: eating\n  - Irene John: knitting\n  - Father Guy: Standing in a field reading his breviary, with a rifle under his arm.\n  - Wilfrid Fayant: fighting\n\n* Gone are the days.\u2014The School bus has done its last mile with us. After having been part of every trip, outing, and adventure of the school for many years, after rattling on every highway, road and trail of Saskatchewan with the staff and pupils, it has been sold away, and will probably continue being the headache of mechanics for years to come. We have lost a good, though unreliable, friend.\n\nA bright new little truck has filled its place. We are glad to welcome this newcomer among us, and extend to it our wishes for a long and happy life.\n\n* Why mothers get gray:\u2014On the night of the flood, one of our small boys, Sweet Pea (Wilfrid Nokusis) tried to cut across the garden to be the first into playroom, but stuck fast in the mud. A big boy pulled him out of his shoes, and Sweet Pea walked in his stockings.\n\n- Whenever you ask Elvina Cappo to lend you her comb, she is certain to say: \"There are 18 teeth broken already. Be sure not to break anymore, or else I won't have anything left to lend you.\"\n\n- The boys were sliding on the hill one day, when something got into Mr. Muloin. Shortly after he was speeding down a hill on a sleigh, when suddenly a fence appeared out of nowhere. (!!!X$!X!) Both Mr. Muloin and the fence had to have a few repairs.\n\nArt and Crafts\u2014When George Lavallee knocked at the Junior Girls' classroom one morning to bring in the marvellous large show case he had made for us, we could hardly believe that we had enough articles to fill it, but come and see it now. We girls do all sorts of small pieces of work, woolen stocking, sweaters, dresses, scarves, caps, cushions, doll's clothes, toy animals, pottery, bird charts.\n\n* * *\n\nDuring our spare moments in the intermediate girls' playroom, many of us have taken to knitting and at Christmas were proud to take home a good pair of socks, made with our own hands. We are getting so smart that Sister Michaud takes us like the senior girls on holiday afternoons in the sewing room. You should see us all at work, knitting, sewing, mending, ripping old clothes and even trying ourselves on the weaving and knitting machines. Violet Blacksioux has a very nice knitted dress for the exhibition and Marjorie Goodwill a beautiful sweater.\nJeannie Cyr and Marjorie Goodwill, our talented artists, have provided the show case with many delightful articles, apart from their numerous Christmas cards and their oil-paint decorated dish-boards for the Fathers' dining room.\n\n* * *\n\nBeauty and proportion is a great help for a girl to keep a home later on. A well decorated home with curtains, carpets, cushions, quilts is more beautiful. Sr. Winter who took charge of fancy work this year has found great talent among the girls for this work. The girls also helped in decorating cakes. Father Principal's birthday cake represented the school and his mission churches, and himself coming back from Pasqua with David Sayer in a cutter.\n\n* * *\n\nEven the small girls seem to be busy. \"After we started to learn how to mend and knit, Shirley Strongeagle and Loretta Bellegarde were able to knit each one a pair of Short stockings. The same two, and also Lorraine Bellegarde, Florence Ward and Rose Alice McArthur made each one a spool knitted cord for the cross of our missionaries.\"\n\nBe The Valentine - On Valentine's Day most of the girls sent cards to the boys. Seeing the boys had no money (!) to buy cards they sent back the same ones. It seems that one of the Fathers told them to do this. I hardly think they would have thought of it by themselves.\n\nFire, Wind and Water. - Four a.m., Dec. 22. The snores of the boys are suddenly interrupted by the cry of fire. In the reddish light of the blaze everyone makes his way to the windows of the dormitory. The hockey club house beside the rink is a mass of flames. The boys battle a while for a good view, and then settle down to looking at the building burn to the ground.\n\nThe February storm hit us hard. Mountains of snow were shovelled off the rinks every day, and every morning were back again. Coal became scarce, and the two boys classrooms were sent one morning to see what wood they could find, should the bad weather keep on. We struggled a whole morning in four feet of snow and returned tired and soaked to the bones.\n\nIn April came the big thaw. The creek which crosses the school grounds overflowed, and all the school turned out to see the flood. Mr. Bedard had a hard time keeping his wood, and perhaps his house, from going down into the lake.\n\nWise Girl - While sliding at the Scholasticate Antoinette and Rita sprained a knee and an ankle, and had a sleigh ride back to school. Antoinette had a week's rest, reading and advancing her fancy work. Dorothy Dumont, who had not managed to sprain anything, but wished she were in Antoinette's place, froze her feet.\nEpiphany - Sophia was elected queen and Gorion John, king. A banquet was served in honour of their majesties in the Senior Girls' dining room. As they entered we sang God Save the King and entertained them with music and songs. That evening, Fathers, Sisters, Brothers and pupils had a skating party with music on the boys rink. Ruth Bear, Roland Whitebear and several other sang through the microphone. The party was followed by a swell lunch, to which Father Principal sweetly contributed a box of chocolates.\n\nGirls' Sports: * Results of a hockey game between Brother Montgrand and the Senior Girls: Brother 22, Girls 2.\n* From the medium girls: \"After Christmas Father Principal provided us with skates. How we enjoyed our skating parties on holidays! Now that summer is coming, swings, merry-go-round, ball and picnics are our best recreation. Father Dion has also given us a nice football.\"\n* From the small girls: \"Now that spring has come, guess what we play? Not only little baby games, oh no! We play baseball. We do not play yet like the big ones and we never break windows, but just the same we have many good players.\"\n\nNature Hike: May 21 found everybody in Grade III looking happy. It was a beautiful sunshiny day, and a hike had been promised for the afternoon...We had no sooner started to climb one of the hills when a rabbit darted away at the sight of so many children. But James Tuckanow finally caught the rabbit stuck in a low bush. A box was at once prepared for the rabbit so as to take him home alive. The following day, however, he was allowed to go back home and hop up and down the hills in freedom. When the butterflies, beetles, wild flowers and weeds were carefully collected, we had a fine lunch of bananas and cake.\n\nFun and Frolic: Several bingo and card parties took place during the year in the different playrooms. The most popular seem to be those in which the Senior Girls invite the Senior Boys. In turn the boys invited the girls to their skating parties, and waltzed them around the rink with grave courtesy. Hikes, picnics, hunts, cornroasts, too numerous to mention, have also been part of each playroom's fun.\n\n* \"On the second of February, we feasted Father Principal. We the small girls played 'The Little Housewives', and we enjoyed it very much. Everybody laughed at us.\"\nDramatics\n\nThis year the pupils took a very active part in dramatics. Four plays were presented throughout the school year with great success. Plenty of work is attached to dramatics. One rehearsal follows another, until the director is satisfied that the actions, emphasis, tone, are perfect. Our reward arrives on the night of the first performance, and in knowing that we are putting the play over with success.\n\nThe Golden Slipper: Directed by Sister Herauf, this play was entered in the local festival with an all-girl cast, and every part was well acted. The interest of the audience was held throughout the play. The costumes were beautiful.\n\nThe Cast: Helen Bellegarde, Gracie Lavallee, Flora McNabb, Mary Florence Rockthunder, Pauline Leclaire, Linda Anaquod, Elvina Cappo, Rose Mary Tuckanow, Martha Chaplean, Doreen Muskeg and Evelyn Daniel.\n\nHere Comes the Bride: Directed by E.J. Doll. This play was enjoyed by all who saw it. A laugh in each line. What was enjoyed most was the scene in which Francois Pascal is forced by his college pal Billy Bellegarde to play the part of the bride.\n\nThe Cast: Billy Bellegarde, Francois Pascal, Frank Dumont, Gracie Lavallee, Allan Goodwill.\n\nLonely Lady: Drama, directed by E.J. Doll. This play was very much enjoyed by the audience. It showed the acting ability of the pupils. Every part was well portrayed, with every actor living the part to perfection. All the actors deserved to be congratulated for their fine performance.\n\nThe Cast: Caroline Feigen, Arthur Obey, Helen Therese Bellegarde, Gracie Lavallee, Billy Bellegarde.\nThe Stolen Prince\ndirected by E. J. DOLL\n\nThe Cast:\nCharlie Bellegarde, Kenneth Goodwill, Lucy Desnomie,\nClifford Goodwill, Yvonne Desnomie, Willie Dumont,\nDavid Episkewow, Percy Yukiapi, Frank Dumont,\nMartha Chapleau, George Cappo, Herbie Strongeagle,\nPrisque Buffalo, Alvin Piapot and Clifford Tawiyaka.\n\nThis play was entered in the local dramatic festival and won top honors. Willie Dumont brought more honors to the school by winning the medal for the best actor, in portraying the Property Man. This play was invited to take part in the Regina Festival. Here the competition was much keener. Again we had the honour of winning, which placed us in the Southern Saskatchewan finals in Moose Jaw.\n\nAlthough the play had received the most applause, and its cast was the only one to be called back on the stage for a second curtain, we came second, one point behind the winning play.\n\nThe cast enjoyed the trip, especially while in Regina. Thanks to Father Principal we stayed two days at the King's Hotel. We also had the pleasure of repeating our play for Mr. Scott of Toronto. He had heard so much about it while adjudicating the finals in Regina that he just had to see it for himself. He congratulated the actors on their splendid performance, and added that had the play been in the Saskatchewan finals, he would have had a more difficult task in awarding the trophy to the winning play.\n\nCharlie Bellegarde\nKenneth Goodwill\nClifford Goodwill\nThe Musical Clock\n\nThe boys and girls have again during their school year made a good showing in music. The band under the direction of Father Laviolette and the Senior Girls' chorus directed by Sister Gosselin are certainly to be complimented for the enjoyable entertainment they gave us. The first concert was given on January 25 in honor of Mr. Ostrander. Here, the girls sang \"Welcome Song\" and Brahms' \"Lullaby\". The band played \"Sharpshooters' March\" and other selections such as \"Lindenau\" and \"Cuckoo Waltz\". Gracie Lavallee and Helen Therese Bellegarde rendered a solo. Mr. Ostrander assured us that he had greatly enjoyed this programme.\n\nThe second concert was held on February 7, on Father Principal's feast. The musical programme consisted of selections by the band, girls' chorus and numbers by Grade 2 and Grade 3, with also a piano duet by two young pianists. The Grade 3 boys and girls sang the \"Fest Song\", Shirley Capo, Louise Poitras, Ruth Ann Cyr and Alice Fugar of Grade 3 sang \"Gentle Night\". They were accompanied by Lorraine and Barbara Bellegarde. \"The Pells of St. Mary's\" sung in two parts by the Senior Girls was warmly applauded. The evening was most enjoyable.\n\nTwo other public appearances were made. On May 16, the band and chorus accompanied the dramatists to Iorrie. Then on May 24, the boys and girls gave an \"Open Air Concert\" for the sick people at the Indian Hospital in Fort Qu'Appelle. The Senior Girls on this occasion sang \"Come to the Fair\" for the first time. Besides such concerts, the chorus took part in an \"Amateur Night\" in the Lebret Town Hall on March 21. They won a $5 prize for the highest mark.\n\nReligious music is also of interest. Two new Latin hymns, well worth mentioning, have been learnt this year; Jesus Salvator and Christus Resurrexit. Sister Gosselin is director.\n\nMany compliments to our organists, both the accomplished ones and the beginners. Special thanks to Mary Doota for her readiness to teach the organ to the beginners. We must not forget to mention our very young pianists. These are Ruth Ann Cyr, Louise Poitras, Lorraine and Barbara Bellegarde, Shirley Capo, Esther Wajuhunta, and Shirley Bellegarde. Although they do not play perfectly yet, they have done marvelous work.\n\nCaroline Peigan\nMusical Festival\n\nOn the evening of May 13, at 8 o'clock, the Lebret Town Hall opened its doors to all music lovers for the third musical festival. So once again our boys and girls exhibited their musical talents. This time they carried back not only the highest mark in many competitions, but also awards and scholarships.\n\nTo the enjoyment of all the audience, on the adjudicator's signal, the Instrumental Ensemble tuned in with the snappy music of \"Indian Trail\" and Golden Spur. Eight boys then proceeded with their playing of Mendelssohn's \"On Wings of Song\" on various band instruments. These boys were Charlie Bellegarde, Billy Bellegarde, Sam Cappo, Clifford Goodwill, Kenneth Goodwill, Gilbert Bellegarde, Alfred Lavallee and Gordon John. All were given very good marks; but Gordon who played the Euphonium with extra smoothness deserved the highest mark, which was $4. He was awarded not only a silver medal but also a $10 scholarship.\n\nThe harsher tone of brass and horn was then replaced by a smoother one. And that is, of course, by the delicate voices of our soloists, Helen Therese Bellegarde, Mary Julia Episkenow and Gracie Lavallee. The three were praised by the adjudicator for \"their pleasing voices\". Helen Therese, who charmed the adjudicator with her sweet little voice, obtained a scholarship for $25. Wonderful work, Helen!\n\nMore honors for our school kept rolling in during the next day's sessions. For in the morning the Grade II pupils performed a very attractive singing game \"Fly Away Crow\". The little ones worked their way up to an 87 mark. So three cheers for the farmers and crows!\n\nChoruses and boys' vocal solos were the main attractions of the afternoon's sessions. Both the Grade II and the Grade 7 and 8 Girls' Choruses were very much enjoyed by all. We're very happy to say that the girls' chorus, who sang \"There Is Joy in the Song We Sing\" and \"Fairy Belle\", came out first of their group with 85 \u00bd. The adjudicator, Mr. Ian Barrie, remarked that the work was very nicely done, musically good, had a sweet tone, pure and clean but that the words needed more vitality.\n\nIn the boys' vocal solos, only one of our boys took part, and that is no other than Willie Dumont. Willie sang with much expression \"The Spider Hunter\", and although he did not win either a medal or a scholarship, he came in third with 84 \u00bd. We enjoyed your song very much, Willie!\n\nIn the evening the band played Laurentian Echoes and Sharpshooters' March. Their performance was highly praised by the adjudicator, who awarded it 88 \u00bd, the highest mark of all the festival.\n\nPage 34\nHelen Therese Bellegarde, Gracie Lavallee and Mary Julia Episkonow, soloists.\n\nGrade 2 singers who obtained a mark of B7 with their singing game \"Fly Away Crow.\"\n\nGrade 7 and 8 Girls' Chorus.\n\nHelen Therese Bellegarde and Gordon John, winners of scholarships.\nMilitary Band\n\nDirector and Bandmaster: Rev. G. Laviolette, O.M.I.\nM. Bedard, B.A. (Reeds) J.L. Desnomie (Brasses)\n\nInstructors\n\nMembers:\nCornets: John Louis Desnomie Kenneth Goodwill\nAlfred Lavallee Harvey Dumont\nAn awkward instrument to play because of its small mouthpiece.\nIt usually plays the melody. The cornet player has to watch for \"bum notes\" and sputtering.\n\nClarinets: William John Bellegarde Charles Bellegarde\nGeorge Lavallee Sam Cappo\nThe clarinet's many keys make it difficult to play, and the instrument often lets out squeaks. It is said that Sam Cappo has the record for squeaks.\n\nFlute: Billy Bellegarde\nA wood wind instrument, quite hard to play, which usually accompanies the melody.\n\nBaritones: Gordon John Orville Peigan\nThis instrument is easy to play and seldom misses notes. It has won often in instrumental solos.\n\nTrombones: Roderick Aneskan Lawrence Dubois\nThis is the slide trombone. The director often tells these players to give a loud crack on some notes.\nIt has the important part to play in \"Trombone Tobaggan.\"\n\nAltos: David Bellegarde Herbie Strongeagle\nAn easy instrument, which usually plays off beat.\n\nBasses: Harry Biggety David Sayer\nAlfred Montgrand, O.M.I.\nA large, loud instrument, whose large mouthpiece makes it easy to play.\n\nSaxophones: Mr. Maurice Bedard Allan Goodwill\nGilbert Bellegarde Clifford Goodwill\nIts easy blowing, quick mechanism and variety of tones make it very popular among boys.\n\nDrums: John James Tawiyacka Arthur Obey\nClifford Goodwill\nThe drums are naturally. You strike them and out comes the sound, and you never get out of breath as with other instruments.\n\nPage 36\nKenneth Goodwill\nActivities of the Band\n\nAlthough our director was absent most of the time this year, the band under the direction of Mr. Bedard has continued its improvement. Greater success would be obtained if the revenues of our public appearances were used for purchasing better instruments.\n\nLessons are given every morning before class by Mr. J.J. Desnomie and Mr. Bedard. Several beginners have begun learning an instrument this year with these two instructors: Jerry Anasquod, Ivan Obey, Albert Bellegarde, Alvin Sayer, Albert Beeskie, Leslie Yusicapi, Harvey Iron eagle, William Dumoulin, Wilfrid Dubois, Johnny Bellegarde and Henry Bellegarde. Band rehearsals are held four times a week after class.\n\nThis year we have used a new Band Music book entitled \"Old Favourites.\" The new numbers that we like best are: Sharpshooter's March, Under the Double Eagle, Cuckoo Waltz, Krakowiak, Laurentian Echoes and Lindenau Folka. Then there are the old numbers which we still enjoy a great deal, such as Indian Trail, Marine's March, Football Squad, Colonel Hoge and Beer Barrel Polka.\n\nIn June 1946 several members of the band went to Isle-a-la-Crosse to play on the occasion of the centenary of the foundation of the mission: Brother Montgrand, Tony Peigan, Allan Goodwill, George Lavallee, Gordon John, and also John Louis Desnomie, Mr. Bedard and Father Laviolette. They seem to have had the time of their lives.\n\nThe band took part in two amateur nights held in Lebret during the year, and played at the school on a few occasions, such as Father Lavigne's jubilee and Father Principal's feast. At the Valley Music Festival, the band performed Laurentian Echoes and Sharpshooter's March, was warmly praised by Mr. Barrie and obtained the highest mark in the festival. Another public appearance was at Lorril on May 16, where the school children were putting on a concert for the people of File Hills.\n\nOn May 24 the band played at Fort Qu'Appelle at the Sport's Day, under Mr. Bedard's direction. One of the spectators, seeing us for a moment without a director, placed himself before us to conduct, and was saying: \"On the down beat!\" So we started on the down beat.... We then went to the Indian Hospital to play for the patients.\n\nOn June 8 the band will play at the procession of Corpus Christi in Sedley, and on June 15 in Lebret. We will also play at Balcarres and Vibank, on June 7 and 9, at the local Sports' Days.\n\nRoderick Anaskan.\n\nPage 37\nBackground: The Hugonard Cadet Corps was organized in 1944 by Lieut. Maurice Bedard with a strength of 31 cadets. This corps came first at the annual inspection made by Major P.C. Jardine, Cpt Pearce and Sgt. M.Jr. Vint.\n\nIn 1945 the corps was reorganized with Lieut. Bedard and Mr. F. Verreault as instructors and a strength of 49. The inspection was made in May by the same officers, who reported they were much impressed by its fine performance.\n\nThe corps continued its work in 1946 with Lieut. Ed. Doll as instructor and Lieut. Bedard in administration, with a strength of 50.\n\nActivities of the Year: Most of our time was spent in lectures given by our instructor Mr. Doll. In Fundamentals we learnt of the organization and purpose of the Cadet movement, of military ranks and badges, etc. Another activity was First Aid, where we studied the treatment of shock, fractures, bleeding and so on. In Woodcraft we covered such topics as living outdoors, building camp fires, outfitting, handling boats and canoes. We did not do much drill during the year, but received some training in tactics in preparation for the coming inspection. We have Physical Training nearly every day with Mr. Bedard, and once in a while also some Small Arms Training.\n\nVisits: In November Sgt. Vint and Sgt. Gaunt came to visit the corps. After a period of drill Sgt. Vint announced that he would be leaving the Cadet Services, and said that he hoped we would continue our work as in the past.\n\nCorporal Hasty, who was now in the position formerly held by Sgt. Vint, visited the corps in March, and gave us a test on the subjects that we had taken. He gave us lectures on fieldcraft and camouflage, and related the story of the African Campaign.\n\nPromotions: Around the beginning of March a few of the cadets began training to qualify as Cadet Officers and N.C.O.'s, and were promoted at the inspection on May 28. They were: Lieut. W. Bellegarde Cpl. R. Poitras\nSgt. A. Obey Cpl. C. Bellegarde\nCpl. G. John Cpl. A. Goodwill\nAnnual Camp: Last year twenty boys of our corps volunteered to attend the camp at Dundurn, but most of them did not go. Arthur Obey and Alfred Laval\u00e9e were the only ones who went, but they did not enjoy it as much as if they had been among boys they knew.\n\nThis year the camp will be in Clear Lake, Manitoba, from June 29 to July 9. Twenty boys are again expected to attend. Clear Lake is one of the finest places in Manitoba.\n\nAnnual Inspection: May 28 was inspection day. While the boys were preparing for this our instructors were busy measuring the grounds, putting up flags and a platform for the inspecting officer. After going through the movements with Cpl. Hasty everything seemed ready and the inspecting officers, Major Jardine, Major Fennay and Lieut. Harrington came into the playground accompanied by Father Principal. The inspection proceeded then with the march past, after which we were divided in three groups under the direction of our cadet officers. The first group under Sgt. A Obey was taking Physical Training, and we bravely took off our coats in spite of the icy morning wind. The second took First Aid under Cpl. C. Bellegarde, and after a while showed the spectators the cadets they had bandaged up. They looked as if they had gone through a threshing machine. The third group took Rifle Drill under Lieut. P. Bellegarde, Major Jardine inspected each group.\n\nLieut. Harrington then asked us a few questions on Fundamentals, after which Father Principal had the band boys play a few marches for the officers. Major Jardine congratulated the corps for its continuous success during its three years of training, and announced that he was now retiring from the Cadet Services and would be replaced by Major Fennay.\n\nGordon John\nPercy Mandy\n\nAt the Annual Inspection.....\n\nPage 39\nOur sporting activities this year were very successful under the coaching of Mr. E. Doll. These activities consisted of baseball, hockey, softball, boxing, ping-pong, and a field and track meet.\n\n**Baseball**: This is our No. 1 summer sport. Our league again was reorganized this spring with four teams: Balcarres, Lebret, Fort Qu'Appelle and the Indian School, battling for top position and the right to get into the play-offs for the trophy donated by our principal, Father Piche, O.M.I. To date we are first in the standing with 5 wins and one loss. If the team can keep on playing as it has been, its chances are good for winning the trophy.\n\nBesides our league games we also have played several exhibition games with the towns. There we have won all behind the steady pitching of George Lavallee and Art Obey. Our biggest thrill will be on May 31 when from Notre Dame College at Wilcox the Hounds will come for an exhibition game. We have no idea of the outcome, but we do know that it will be an interesting game to watch.\n\nNot only the seniors play ball. We also have an intermediate league for all those who are not fortunate enough to make the team. In this league we have seven teams, all named after the American and National League teams. Father Principal is also donating a trophy for the winning team. At present the Pirates are on top, with Red Sox and Cubs a close second.\n\n**Softball**: This game has lost its popularity with the boys since baseball has made a comeback, but we still get in the odd game and it's a pleasing change.\n\n**Rugby**: We play rugby mostly in the fall. It serves a dual purpose; it replaces baseball and it gets us into condition for hockey. The boys enjoy rugby very much, although at times it's rather hard on clothes and skin. This does not make Sister Michaud or Sister Piche very happy.\nHockey: We wouldn't say that we love baseball better than we do hockey, as it is our favorite sport. Last season after a poor attack we did not expect to end up the season the way we did. We did not look very promising to our coach, but after plenty of bawling out and work-outs we started to click. Unfortunately we started a little late in the season or we would have been entered in the Saskatchewan playoffs.\n\nIn hockey we have two outstanding teams: Bantams 13 years and under and Midgets 10 and under. Both teams lost only one game each. The Midgets played 10 games and the Bantams 7. The big thrill last winter was our double header at Melville. The Bantams won their game and the Midgets lost after leading by 4 - 0. We sincerely hope next year to have a few more games with them to make up for our loss.\n\nArthur Obey and Billy Bellegarde\n\nField and Track Meet: The Field and Track Meet is an annual affair in which all the schools of the district participate. It took place at Fort Qu'Appelle on May 30. The Indian School has had entries in all events and made a very successful day of it. The forenoon was taken up by the field and track meet itself. Apart from the numerous red, blue and white ribbons won by our athletes, a medal was awarded to Paddy Crowe for first place in his division. The school won the Intermediate and Grand Aggregate Cups again, and tied with Fort Qu'Appelle for the Junior and Senior Cups.\n\nIn the afternoon seven softball teams competed for the ball cup. The final game was played between Fort Qu'Appelle and the Indian School, and was a very exciting and keen game. Fort Qu'Appelle finally won the game and the cup. We gladly take this opportunity to thank Father Principal for his interest in our welfare.\n\nCharlie Bellegarde.\n\nThe School Ball team:\n\nBack row: Art Obey, George Tavellee, Pat Fourhorns, William J. Bellegarde, Billy Bellegarde, Vic Tachan\n\nFront Row: John James Tawiyaka, Norman Goodwill, Richard Poitras, Gordon John.\nPostgraduates\n\nBernadette Anaskan: Quiet, serious and likable girl, Bernie sweats from morning till night in fear of not being in time with her stews, whose disappearance on the tables is a sure sign of their flavour. She has no less ability in sewing; she even bought herself a brand new \"Singer\" machine with her savings.\n\nBeatrice Lavallee: Tender and likable girl, and a steady worker, she is in charge of the big boys' mending; she will grunt when the overalls are too greasy, but does a perfect job. Friendly with everyone, she likes to receive letters and knows how to write one. Looks sometimes worried?\n\nCatherine Goodfeather: Katy is the ever ready miss. Don't tell her how to wash kitchen pans and how to make toasts, but ask her how to prepare a good meal, she knows. But oh when a boy passes outside, she sure does a lot of window-shopping.\n\nMary Doota: Tall, slim, jovial and well-mannered girl! The pots and pans sure fly with her in the kitchen. She knows the hour when the milkers arrive with their cans and is always there to help them. Smiles and jokes with them all, but her admiration is for one in particular... She is a girl with character and should do well in life.\n\nFront Row: W. J. Bellegarde, C. Goodfeather, Father Piche, B. Anaskan, George Lavallee.\nBack Row: R. Stemchild, Eva Horsefall, B. Lavallee, M. Doota\n\nG. Lavallee and samples of his work\n\nPage 42\nEva Horsefall: Nice looking when her hair is curled. She enjoys working with the sewing machine which she handles with ease. She takes time to look through the window when Sister Michaud happens to leave the sewing room. She talks to herself when she has nobody to talk with. Expert on the electric mending machine, she has the ambition of opening a manufacture for overalls in her old days... if nobody claims her. Eva likes evening walks when the moon shines bright, and ten o'clock then always comes too soon. Eva, with years, will get older.\n\nPearl Stevenson: A graduate from St. Philip's School, Pearl is now one of ours. She brought with her a big baggage of kindness. Her slow, soft and sincere voice has already won her many friends. Perfect seamstress... even on a machine that sews backwards. To make six shirts a day is a pastime for her. Pearl will be worth a pearl to anyone.\n\nPatrick Goodpigs: Pat has always kept a wonderful record, and is a good and reliable worker. He knows the secret of good farming and operates the tractor with skill. He is one of those boys who foresees the future. With his savings, he has bought himself implements, seeding drill, plough, disk harrow, and two horses. Success is awaiting you, Pat, if you keep on!\n\nGeorge Lavallee: Calm, never in a hurry, George is skillful in woodwork. His altars, cupboards and dining sets reveal his ability as a cabinet maker. There is only one thing that George cannot repair, and that is the hole in his purse. He likes mechanics but the tractor was his main worry this spring. He had to be on it every time it had a breakdown. George also pitches for the baseball team. With more steadiness and will power in your life the future is yours.\n\nRaymond Stemchild: Here is a boy that will make his way through and will be an asset to the country. Good-natured, kind-hearted, quiet, and never scared of work, and always ready and on time for any job. He likes to relax with his fiddle. He would willingly remain a bachelor but the kitchen girls won't give him a chance.\n\nWilliam John Bellegarde: Never shall we understand why in school he was called \"Bad Boy\". Polite, courteous, interesting in conversation. He has been working in Lethbridge for two years and has been one year in the army, and has now come back with us to resume his studies. He has put many hours a day on his Grade IX subjects. He is fond of Mathematics and wishes to take up Bookkeeping and Accounting. He is on the baseball team and plays the clarinet in the band. Bad Boy, the world belongs to those who conquer it!\nHonor Roll\n\nScholarship:\nGrade 1 ..... Hilda Anaskan, Marcel Yuhaha\nGrade II ..... Esther Wajuhunta, Edwin Taylor\nGrade III .....

Headed by Mr. Pegg and Mrs. Kerans a committee of one person from each ward will draw up a schedule, that can be published in each issue of the \"Gamsell Arrow\". If the committee meets once each month then all complaints can be heard. The following is the schedule for August and September:\n\n| Ward    | Date   |\n|---------|--------|\n| 9 A or C | Aug 12 |\n| 4       | Aug 14 |\n| 10 B    | Aug 19 |\n| 2       | Aug 21 |\n| 8 B     | Aug 26 |\n| 1       | Aug 28 |\n| 3       | Sept 2 |\n| 4       | Sept 4 |\n| 9       | Sept 9 |\n| 2       | Sept 11|\n| 10      | Sept 16|\n| 1       | Sept 18|\n| 8       | Sept 23|\n| 3       | Sept 25|\n| 9       | Sept 30|\nProtection\n\nTuberculosis is a contagious disease. The germ which causes the disease is spread from a person who is ill with tuberculosis to healthy persons.\n\nEvery time a tuberculous person coughs millions, even billions of these germs are spread into the air for a distance of at least ten to fifteen feet. The sputum raised is completely filled with these germs as well. So the people around you are liable to breathe in this air, and so become infected if you are careless in your coughing and raising of sputum.\n\nIf you cover your mouth every time you cough, and carefully spit into your sputum box, then the danger to people about you is very slight.\n\nThese germs, usually enter the body with the air that is breathed, but they are also swallowed, reaching the stomach and intestines, when food which is contaminated with the germs is eaten.\n\nThe germs of tuberculosis seem to prefer the lungs as a place to settle and grow \u2014 thus so many people have lung tuberculosis. On the other hand the germs at times are able to enter the blood stream, and thus drift throughout the body, settling down in various locations, such as bones and joints, the kidneys, and the coverings of the brain.\n\nWherever the germs are found in the body, the only real weapon we have to fight them is our body resistance. There is no magic medicine yet discovered which can kill these germs.\n\nThe body resistance can be compared to an army. The blood and its cells are the soldiers. In order to overcome the germs of tuberculosis, we must rest all the time, so that our soldiers can spend all their time fighting the germs.\n\nThis fight usually takes months or even years to win, but our soldiers finally overcome the germs either killing them or placing them in prison (surrounding the germs with scar tissue). Then and only then can we return to our normal way of living.\n\n(Cont'd)\nSo to each and every one of you I say:\n\n1. protect your loved ones and those who look after you by ALWAYS covering your mouth, and using your sputum box.\n\n2. take all the rest you can, and so help your body soldiers win their fight over the germs of tuberculosis.\n\nH. Meltzer, M.D.\n\nA WORD FROM OUR DENTIST.\n\nIn our hospital there is a team. It is comprised of every member of the hospital staff. It has a captain, Dr. Meltzer, and the whole team is working to get our patients well.\n\nThe dental clinic is going to try to be a worthy member of this team. Our job is to see that every patient has a clean and healthy mouth. This can be accomplished only by the fullest co-operation between the patient and dentist. While we are sick, it is only natural that our gums show a weakened condition. They become spongy and tend to bleed. If this condition is allowed to progress, particles of food stick in the crevices and form pyorrhea pockets, and cause dental caries.\n\nThis condition can be overcome by more careful cleaning of the teeth, massaging the gums, and the use of mouth washes.\n\nWe are most anxious to help. So, any time you have dental problems come, and pay us a visit.\n\nH.M. McCaffery, D.D.S.\n\nA kindly act is a kernel sown,\nThat will grow to a goodly tree,\nShedding its fruit when time has flown,\nDown the gulf of eternity.\nA FAREWELL MESSAGE.\n\nIt is with a feeling of regret that my first contribution to the Arrow must also be my last. As you all know, Dr. Bill and myself are leaving the Charles Camsell Hospital in order to continue our studies in medicine. We have enjoyed our year here very, very much. We have enjoyed meeting people from places as far apart as Holmon Island and Cardston and all the territory in between. In looking after patients with tuberculosis, one has an opportunity to get to know the patients very well. In that respect it has been a very profitable year to us.\n\nWe have also greatly enjoyed our association with Dr. Meltzer, Dr. Matas and Dr. Porth. We have learned a great deal from them. Before we came to this hospital we had done very little work with tuberculosis, so that we were learning all the time from them as well as doing our best to help the patients. We think you are very fortunate to have these doctors.\n\nThe nurses here, too, we have found to be grand to work with. You are very lucky to have such fine nurses to care for you.\n\nWe are both sad and happy at leaving. Sad because we have had such a good year and we hate to leave it but happy that we have the opportunity for further study. We wish you all the best of luck in your efforts to overcome your disease. We will look forward to receiving monthly copies of the Arrow in order to keep in touch with you all.\n\nGood-bye and best of luck.\n\nM. Barclay\n\nThe next issue of The Camsell Arrow will be published on the fifteenth of September. Please let us have your news items by the first of the month.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nMY TRIP TO THE YUKON.\n\nOn July 22 I started for the Yukon to see about the Indians there and in northern British Columbia and between here and there. I took with me Nurse Helen Larkin who was going in to help look after them.\n\nThe Yukon is a very big country covered with low mountains and with many rivers. The Indians, here, do not live on large reserves, but in villages. The biggest village is made up of perhaps thirty families and there are many of only two or three families. It is a good fur and game country and the Indians spend most of their time in the bush, hunting and trapping. Some catch and eat fish. They are not very poor people but many of them live along the rivers a long way from town. Not many of the children ever get to school, but, you would be surprised how many of them speak English for all that.\n\nThere is quite a lot of tuberculosis here. Many of those who have it never get to a hospital nor do they want to go to one. The well are catching the disease from the sick and I do not see how tuberculosis is ever going to be stamped out if hospital treatment cannot be arranged for them.\n\nThese people look and dress the same as other Indians but they speak a language which Indians in Alberta could not understand.\n\nNow, if you look at a map you will see how we went, by train to Dawson Creek where the Alaska Highway begins, then by bus to Fort St. John on the Highway, and from there by aeroplane to White Horse in\n\n(Cont'd)\nthe Yukon. It was open country with plenty of hills and bush until we got away north of Fort St. John. From there we went over mountains which were not very high.\n\nWhite Horse is a small town, not as big as Wetaskiwin, on the Lewes river, often called the Yukon river. It has a great airport on a high hill above the town. There is a railway to Skagway, Alaska, on the Pacific Ocean. Many summer visitors come in by the railway to see this country where the sun stays up nearly all night in the summer.\n\nFrom Whitehorse we drove fifty miles to Carcross. Here is found an Indian Boarding School. The boarding school is small and the buildings are not very good, but the children looked happier than some I have seen in larger and richer buildings. They are learning to read and write just like other school pupils. They had the mumps. We had the X-Ray with us and made chest films of all the Indians. Here are found also, a few families of Indians living in fairly good houses. Some trap for a living and some work on the railway.\n\nOn returning to Whitehorse I took the plane to Dawson, five hundred miles north, down the river. This is where they dug the gold fifty years ago. You can read about it in the poems by Robert Service. I passed over Lake Laberge, where Mr. Service says they tried to burn the dead body of Sam McGee. All that happened was that he thawed out and said that he was warm for the first time since he left his home in the States. They still dig gold at Dawson but now they use big machines. As they dig they find the horns of big elephants who lived in that country about a hundred thousand years ago. They must have been big animals for their horns or tusks are about eight feet long and as big as a fence post.\n\nIt is so far north that the ground never thaws out at Dawson, but it does thaw enough on the top so that they can plant gardens and raise good potatoes. In the middle of summer it never gets really dark and at Christmas they see the sun for only an hour or so.\n\nNear Dawson is an Indian village called Moosehide. Nearly all the Indians were away hunting but we saw an old blind man, Richard Martin, his wife, two or three old women and one family. Their homes were not very good.\n\n(Cont'd).\nI came back to Whitehorse by plane and spent three days with the nurses and Indian agent. We talked about what could be done to make sick Indians well and keep the well Indians from getting sick.\n\nFrom Whitehorse I took the plane south to Fort Nelson, on the Alaska Highway. The Indian agent from Fort St. John met me there with his truck. We saw some Indian people at Fort Nelson. There is a school there for the Indian and white children and a missionary.\n\nThen by the Alaska Highway we came to an Indian village where there is a day school and a missionary teaching. There is a gas well there. There we no people at home, but we found them camped beside the road about thirty miles away on their way to the mountains to shoot moose, caribou, mountain sheep and bears. They were having a dinner of meat. They like meat and will not eat any other food if they can get enough of it. Each person had a horse and tents, blankets and grub were carried on a wagon.\n\nAfter driving all day we came to Fort St. John by evening. The Indians of that Agency do not live on reserves, except at one place. They hunt and trap over a country covering a distance equal to that from Edmonton to Calgary. They have many horses and move to a new place as soon as the horses eat up the grass where they are. Here, too, we find a great deal of tuberculosis, and it is going to be hard to do very much about it, as the people never stay in one place for more than a few days, and very few families ever stay together for any length of time.\n\nFrom Fort St. John I flew back to Edmonton. It was a great trip but I didn't see any place better than Edmonton, Hobbema, Blackfoot, Sarcee, Morley, the Blood, the Peigan or Saddle Lake.\n\nDr. E.L. Stone.\nWARD I.\n\nHelen Laroque, Ruby Cutknife, Mary Littlechild, Lucien Roughfoot, Mary Listner and Lena Cardinal enjoyed a car ride last week. We visited the Journal building and saw the press. From there we went to the south side over the high level bridge. On our way home we passed the airport. Then we came home by way of St. Albert Trail. Ruby Cutknife did not recognize the staff units, as we passed them, and said, \"These cottages look like the Camsell Hospital.\" She must have been badly mixed up. We enjoyed our ride very much and hope to have another one soon.\n\nMany of our people stopped to visit us on their way home from Lac St. Ann. Every year hundreds of people go there for a pilgrimage.\n\nWARD II.\n\nOn Wednesday, July 30, ten of us girls went for a very interesting car ride to McGavin's Bakery. After we were shown through the bakery we were each given a nice package of cookies. We enjoyed the ride so much that we wished we need not come back to be in a hospital again. But the cookies helped to make up for that.\n\nViolet Cutknife from Hobbema has not been feeling so well lately and has been moved to a private ward. We were sorry to see her moved and hope that she will soon be well and moved back again.\n\nAgnes is the only one who gets local mail regularly. Lucky girl, isn't she? I wonder from whom?\n\nWe are glad to welcome three new girls to our ward: Ruth Kennedy, Lillian Frank and Yvonne Tibbet.\n\nOn July 22, Adeline Jackson and Delia Cardinal were fortunate in having visits from their folks. Delia had not seen her relatives for almost a year.\n\n(Cont'd)\nOne morning Lily Papin was playing with a wheel chair and suddenly over she went, wheel chair and all! Lily is the chief entertainer in the ward and is always doing something to make us laugh.\n\nWe can have an orchestra without instruments. Eliza Whitehead plays well on an imaginary guitar and Agnes Augibelle turns a pillow and stick into a violin and bow. The music is so good we dance to it.\n\nWe are glad our teacher, Mrs. Grantham, is back from her holidays. While she was away we enjoyed reading story books but now we must get busy with school work again. Mrs. Kerans showed us a nice picture show while Mrs. Grantham was away.\n\nWe were sorry our night nurse, Mrs. Jesse, was ill. It was nice of Miss Kautz to take her place and we appreciated having her.\n\nWARD III C\n\nWe think that the name \"The Camsell Arrow\" for our newspaper is very suitable. We are very pleased to have our own newspaper so that we may hear from the other patients. We all wish our paper every success and will look forward to it each month with pleasure.\n\nOn Tuesday July 22, we had the pleasure of seeing two Educational shows, the story of Rubber and on Fishing. It was very interesting to see where rubber came from and how useful articles were made out of it. We are looking forward to the next one, so that we may learn more about our surroundings. We wish to thank those who make these shows possible.\n\nOn Tuesday Nellie curled her hair so tightly that she couldn't close her eyes to go to sleep.\n\nMaggie Royal and Margaret Eaglechild are both in casts. They are very fond of one another. Sometimes, however, they get into arguments and wave their fists at one another but we just laugh at them and they soon get over it.\n\nWe think Maggie must be trying to run a store. She has everything on her table but the kitchen sink. She even boasts of having a\n\n(Cont'd)\ntoboggan but it is not on display with her other goods as she sleeps on it.\n\nWe wish to express a word of thanks and appreciation to our doctors, nurses and staff for the many kindnesses and their efforts to please us and keep us happy. Sometimes we may appear to be rebellious, but at heart we know that all regulations are made with the sole object of restoring us to health. We also wish to thank those who provide entertainment, and the teachers for their lessons, books and picture shows. Especially did we appreciate Dr. Meltzer's talk to us in the last \"Arrow\". Most of us understand what the doctor expects of us and will try to do what is asked.\n\nWARD III F.\n\nThree of us go out walking every day. On August the first we were walking along the highway when a black cat crossed the road in front of us. We said it meant \"bad luck\". Elizabeth Villeneuve wouldn't believe us. But, sure enough, she had the bad luck, for she fell into a ditch. When we go out we leave Ethel Coutoreille all alone. She enjoys herself reading and playing cards.\n\nA new patient, Leona Chalifoux, from Grouard, came into our ward a week ago. We are very pleased to have her with us.\n\nDuring the rainstorm last week we had quite a time dodging the drips from the ceiling.\n\nWe had a lady in our ward weighing 275 pounds. One day she quarrelled with a little girl of 7 who called her a \"big egg\". They have both gone home.\n\nDr. Porth comes to see us every day. All the patients like him. We hope he'll be our doctor till we go home.\n\n---\n\nGirl: \"There are just two things that keep you from being a good dancer.\"\nBoy: \"What are they?\"\nGirl: \"Your feet.\"\n\n---\n\nJim: \"What is more wonderful than a horse that can count?\"\nTim: \"A spelling bee.\"\nWARD IV.\n\nNo news Ward 4? I wonder why!\nDoes no one get a letter?\nIs no one feeling worse to-day?\nIs no one feeling better?\n\nDoes no one have a guest, perhaps?\nDoes no one see a show?\nDoes no one ever take a pill?\nOr no one have a beau?\n\nDoes no one ever play a prank?\nHave any fun at all?\nDoes no one have a tummy ache?\nOr have a game of ball?\n\nThe other wards are waiting,\nTo hear of what you do.\nThe \"Arrow\" asks that next month\nWe have some news from you.\n\nWARD VIII.\n\nAlex Cryer has been in the hospital for five months and not\nbeen out, not even to the front door. On July 24, by means of a wheel\nchair, he looked the hospital over pretty carefully. He has decided\nthat it is a fine place and that 8A is the best ward.\n\nJune Lily spent a few weeks in 8C while in the hospital.\n\nJimmy Whiteknife was admitted to our ward on July 14.\n\nLast Wednesday Isadore Thomas was admitted to Ward 8C with\na fractured collar bone. He was thrown from a horse when riding in\nStony Plain Stampede.\n\nDoctor - (Bracing himself to pull the adhesive tape off the\nroll) Pretty tough stuff! It surely sticks!\n\nIsadore - Sure does! If I had had some of that at the\nStampede I wouldn't be here to-day.\n\nWARD IX A.\n\nSimon Johnson has been transferred to Ward IX C. We miss\nyou, Simon.\n\nTeacher: Tell two things that a milkman, a postman and a\nnurse does.\n\nMaurice: A milkman carries milk and bottles.\nA postman carries parcels and letters.\nA nurse spanks the boys and she washes the walls too.\nWARD IX B.\n\nJohnny Seeseeqon, a patient here for quite sometime, has been very ill. He was moved into a private ward off X A a week ago. We hope Johnny will be back with us soon.\n\nBill Musquito, from Peace River, is a new patient in our ward.\n\nWARD IX C.\n\nWe are holding a cribbage contest in our ward. Harry has been doing very well. Keep it up, Harry, and you'll be the champion.\n\nI see Johnny has been getting a lot of local letters lately.\n\nSay, girls! Why not remember the rest of us?\n\nJames Eagle must have made a mistake and thought we were having an eating contest instead of a weight contest. The other day his canteen order was 5 chocolate bars, 2 packages of candy and 3 soft drinks. When it was delivered to him he started in at once. Before you could turn around, bars, candy and drinks all had disappeared. We were surprised to see the empty bottles left.\n\nNurse: Did you get gas today?\nPatient: Yes,\nNurse: How much?\nPatient: Six gallons.\n\n------------------------\n\nTeacher: \"What is the meaning of the word space?\"\nJohnnie: \"Well, it's something where there isn't anything. I can't describe it exactly, but I have it in my head.\"\nWARD X A.\n\nOn July 9, we went for a car ride. We saw the different types of dairy cows at the university farms. It was a real pleasure to see the outside again after being indoors for so long. We hope we may have another ride soon.\n\nOn Friday we had watermelon for supper for the first time. Harry Kigiona had never seen watermelon before because his home is almost at the north pole. We had to laugh at him because he didn't seem to know what to do with it.\n\nOn July 13 three of the boys went outside for rest period for the first time. They seemed to enjoy it so much. They liked to watch the small animals and birds that came around.\n\nRichard Dick is the best patient in our ward. Keep it up Richard, and you'll be well soon.\n\nEmile Quinn is our violinist. If he works hard at it maybe some day he'll be a great man in the music world.\n\nWe would like to make an entry in the weight contest. We have a lad that has gained 51 pounds in eleven weeks. He now weighs 195 pounds. Can anyone top that?\n\nAbraham Okpik is a wonderful friend to us. He makes our ward a much happier place.\n\nWARD X B.\n\nOne night the patients were disturbed by a visitor who came in the back door without a pass from the doctor. The sad part of it is that he died in the ward. No inquest will be held. Don't feel badly, folks, it was only a mouse.\n\n(Cont'd)\nWilliam Rain was transferred to the main building last week after an operation. We are pleased that he is back with us again. We hope he feels better soon.\n\nMr. and Mrs. R. Grey have returned after their holiday. We are glad to see Bob back with us again.\n\nThe boys in ward X B are allowed to rest outside in the shade. After several days they decided not to go again as they were getting too much sun tan. They did not want to be too dark.\n\nRobert Onespot and Ernest Horseman are having an eating contest. They are to clean their plates every meal for a month. After one week Robert gave up, because of a pain in his stomach. So Ernest was the winner.\n\nMrs. Jack Royal spent two days with Jack in the latter part of July.\n\nErnest Horseman will be having an operation shortly.\n\nWe regret that Dr. Barclay is leaving the staff. We will miss him very much for he was not only our doctor but our friend. Dr. Barclay cared for our health, but he was also ready at all times to listen to our troubles, give advice and help in any way he could. We all join in wishing Dr. M.F. Barclay and Dr. Wm. Barclay every success, the best of health and happiness.\n\nWARD X C.\n\nThe patients in our ward are fine. Joe Grandbois went home on Saturday, August 2nd. He was glad to get home. He made the rounds and said good-bye to all of us.\n\nAlcysius Good Rider was moved into our ward from ward 8.\n\nDanny Norris has visitors from town nearly every day.\n\nThe boys on Routine 4 and up sit outside in wheel chairs when the weather is fine.\nDear Mr. Editor:\n\nThis issue of the School paper contains a farewell to those who are graduating from School this spring, and I am glad to be able to add my wishes to those Junior pupils who will be ending their days at St. Michael's at this time.\n\nOver 1,300 boys and girls have passed through these walls through the years of our history. There may be great changes in the future when the recommendation of the Special Parliamentary Committee comes into effect, but it is certain that St. Michael's will continue to make a worthwhile contribution to the education of the Indian people on the Pacific Coast.\n\nThe group who leave us at the end of June to take their place in the school of Life will be on trial. They will be judged by those with whom they work, in their homes, and in their villages.\n\nWhat do people expect of St. Michael's Graduates? They expect something different. Perhaps a better education, but certainly a better character. The influence and training given you over the years should make for Christian character.\n\nRemember it is not only the Graduates that are on trial - but our School, our Staff, will all be judged by the way you live.\n\nDo not let yourselves down, do not let the School down, do not let the School Staff down.\n\nMay God bless you all.\n\nYour sincere friend and Principal,\n\nS.J. Wickens\n\nS.J. Wickens,\nMESSAGE TO THE GRADUATES\n\nAs you graduate from this school you have come to one of the turning points in your life. From the protection and guidance of life in school, you go back to your village to take part in another way of living. It will bring you the great happiness of being with your family, but nevertheless, it will undoubtedly present some problems to be overcome in the greater freedom of village life.\n\nWhile in school it has been our aim to give you the knowledge which will help you to meet these problems and overcome any difficulties.\n\nDuring the past year you have developed greatly, and one may say with confidence that you will become useful members of your communities. You have shown the quality of leadership and you will have many opportunities in future to use this gift. Do not be discouraged when difficulties come to you, but hold fast to the teachings you have been given, stand firm for what you know is right. Be honest, true, and faithful.\n\nMay God bless you all and give you His guidance in the new life which is opening before you.\n\nD.M. Lucas,\nP.M. Lucas,\nHead Master.\n\nMy Friends:\n\nOnce more we have reached the completion of another school year. I feel that this year has been a very successful one, both for the students and for the staff.\n\nEach one of you has advanced further into the state of womanhood and manhood and I trust that as you continue to advance you will remember the foundation of \"good citizenship\" in which we have tried to instruct you. Loyalty and Honesty are the two main items which make the \"inspector worthy of his hire\". It is not how much we can get out of life that counts, but how much we put into it for the benefit of others that pays us on the day of reckoning.\n\nThere will never be any need for a Graduate of St. Michael's School to hang the head in shame if you practice the Christian principles in which you have been instructed. Your road is long, and the fight is hard, but each one of you has the strength and ability to succeed if you keep honesty on your side.\n\nIt has been a great pleasure to have worked with such fine, outstanding boys and girls. I wish you one and all a very pleasant and successful holiday.\n\nYour friend,\n\nT.H. Bulteel,\nVice-Principal.\nSchool Days\n\nGrade Eight\n\nI don't think there is anybody who graduates from a school, and forgets everything he has learned. Nor does he forget the fun he had in all his school days. It gives him a nice feeling when he looks back and thinks of all the things he used to do in school. Sometimes he laughs at the silly mistakes he made when he was young, but he is probably ashamed when he thinks of the bad things he did.\n\nSome people who have the opportunity to go to school never think of going to higher grades. All they think of is leaving school when they finish grade eight, and having a good time. Those who don't have the opportunity to go to school are the ones who do their best to keep on. Often it is not until one is older that he realizes how important an education is. Then he is sorry for not having carried on. He finds that living an adult life or \"loafing around\" is not so much fun after all. Learning while young makes later life easier.\n\nSo, boys and girls, do your best while you are still young. Don't be foolish and just stop when you get to grade eight. The best days of your lives are your\u2014\n\nSCHOOL DAYS!\n\nLouisa Morvon\n\nTo those of you who are coming back I hope that you will not do many of the things that I have done. I used to gaze out of the window when I was supposed to be studying or doing my work. When our exams came I studied the last minute and didn't have enough time. My marks weren't very high, so I hope you will try hard in your lessons. I hope that you will all keep on in school and get a good education.\n\nI know what it is like in school. Sometimes I wished I were not then something new and hard came up. I fooled around when I didn't know how to do the subject that was new to me. Of course I had to do it when I got up in the higher grades, so please try your best while you have the chance.\n\nGloria Morvon\n\nWhen I was at the Day School at home, I did not learn very much. I always ran away from school. Early in the morning we would sneak our clothes out and go up to the lake and stay there the whole day. When I went home my mother used to find out that I had not been to school that day, and she would spank me and tell me not to run away from school. I would be good for about two days, and then I would start to run away again. I was still in Grade One when I was sent to this school, where I have learned more than when I was at home. I have been in school for seven years. If I pass my exams this year I would like to go on to grade nine; but I wouldn't mind doing grade eight over again. If, however, I don't come back next year, I won't forget \"St. Michael's School\" where I have had so much fun.\n\nKenneth Windsor\nSchool Days - (continued)\n\nMy six years at St. Michael's have been happy ones. Although I have been scolded at times, I ought to thank those staff members who punished me or gave me a tongue lashing, as this is the only way I could learn not to talk back or give dirty looks.\n\nAmong the many things I have learned while here, is the art of farming - how to run the machinery, care for the animals, and plant and harvest the crops. I also had a course in Animal Training, which will come in handy some day. But most important of all I have learned to be obedient to those who are younger.\n\nI want to thank the Principal and his staff for giving me a good time during my stay at St. Michael's.\n\n- Rev. Robinson\n\nThe reason why I like a Residential school better than a Day School is, because we learn a lot more. I started school at home in a Day school, and I'm sorry to say that I didn't go to school every day. I played with some of my friends instead of going to school sometimes, until I came to this Residential school. Now I can't stay out of school even if I want to. Perhaps we would learn more if we had more teachers here and a whole day of school, but it can't be helped now, and we learn a lot more things than at any Day school. In the Ojibwa we learn how to march, shoot, and many other things that may help us in the future. I don't think any Day school has things like the Ojibwa. We learn to work with our hands, and to use many different tools. I know it is hard to leave your parents, but it is better for you in the end.\n\n- James Cook\n\nIn St. Michael's School we have made many friends that we would not have met anywhere else. We were kind of shy when we first came, but the boys and girls were friendly to us and made us happy. When we were lonely these friends cheered us up. Now I've been here for five years. I try to do the same for the new boys who come each year. St. Michael's School is the best school I have ever attended, and I will never forget \"Good old St. Michael's\", nor all the things the staff have done for me.\n\n- Percy Campbell\n\nIf I were to be given another chance of coming back to St. Michael's School next year, I would certainly accept it. Now that it is getting near the end of the school year, I am beginning to realize the benefits of this school. I didn't want to stay here, I wanted to go home, but after a while I began to like it. Now I don't want to leave. I've been here six and a half years, and I hope the Principal will let me come back for another year.\n\nThere are a great many things I neglected to do, just because I was careless. One of the things I did often was to waste my time in school. In our classes I usually finished my work first, and that was usually before the time was up. I had some extra time, but I was foolish enough to waste it. I just sat and daydreamed. When my teacher used to ask me about that, and I used to think that she was just pickin' on me. Now I don't, I guess I know better now, but I still waste my time once in a while. There are some subjects I don't like in school, but I do them, because if I don't, I won't be able to pass on to grade nine.\n\n- Alvin McKay\nVALEDICTORY ADDRESS\n\nJune 16th 1947\n\nGreetings to the Principal, Staff, Graduates, boys and girls of St. Michael's School, and friends.\n\nOn behalf of the boys and girls of St. Michael's I wish to thank the Principal, Head Matron, Vice-Principal, and staff for all they have done for us during our stay at St. Michael's, for education, friendships, and a broader view of life through having lived away from home although we have missed our parents a great deal at times.\n\nNow we are to meet the challenge of Life, but we trust that with the aid of God's help, and the outlook on life given us at school, we may go forth into the world with high ideals, and our eyes raised to the noble goal of being the best person possible. We hope all tried our best, faltered, and sometimes failed, but I think what we have learned will stay with us, and as we look back we will remember all the good things we learned and will practice them more steadfastly when we are on our own, than when we had the school to lean on and guide us.\n\n-Roderick Robinson\nValedictorian\n\n1947 Graduates\n\nAlvin McKay Poroy Campbell Louisa Horvon Doroon\nKenneth Windsor Rod. Robinson Gloria Horvon Dawson\nJames Mack Teddy Wilson\n\nNEWS OF FORMER GRADUATES\n\nBERTIE OKAY, graduate of 1945 has attended high school at Langley for the past two years. Bertie has visions of becoming a missionary.\n\nOEGIL REID AND TAYLOR BROWN joined Bertie last year to take Grade X. We hear they have both done very well.\n\nEMILY WILSON, is taking her Grade X near Seattle, U.S.A.\n\nO.CAR LEROER (Grade X) and PERCY ADAMS (Grade IX) are continuing their studies at Prince Rupert.\n\nBEVERLEY ASON, TEDDY WILSON, and BASIL ASBER, returned to St. Michael's to take Grade IX. They attended the Superior School. Unfortunately Basil had an accident during the Easter holidays and could not carry on.\n\nWe are glad to hear that the following girls and boys are continuing their schooling at Bella Bella:\n\nDORIS HALL (Grade VIII) DELAVINA HULCHITT, DONALD MARTIN, PETER LACON, and TOBY HULCHITT (Grade VII)\n\nDORIS LACON attended Grade VIII at Sunnyside until, due to the illness of the teacher, the school was closed.\nCLASSROOM NEWS\n\nNow that the School Term is over, we look back over what has passed during the year. Some of us are happy for we feel we have done our best, but others of us are sorry for we know we could have done better. On the whole, however, I think we must have done quite well, for Miss Moore seems pleased with us.\n\nMiss Findlay and her Grade VIII pupils visited us for two days while Mr. Haywood, the Superintendent School Principal gave the Grade VIII Class a set of Achievement Tests. There were twelve pupils in all - seven from our school and five from the Day School. The three teachers were quite satisfied with the results.\n\nWe hope many of these pupils will carry on with a higher education. Let us remember the encouragement our staff have given us.\n\nWe are proud of the fact that all four of the Grade IX pupils that graduated from our school last year took radio X this year and that four of the six Grade VIII pupils that actually graduated went on to Grade IX.\n\nBEST OF LUCK TO THE GRADUATES OF 1947!\n\nThe Certificates for the best girl and boy in each Class were awarded to the following:\n\nGrade V - Girl - Cora Robinson\nBoy - Victor Jackson\n\nGrade VI - Girl - Joyce Smythe\nBoy - Thomas Dawson\n\nGrade VII - Girl - Amy Willie\nBoy - Jimmy Hall\n\nGrade VIII - Alvin McKay (only one award for a small class)\n\nACTIVITIES 1946 - 1947\n\nThis has been a great year even though we were in quarantine for nearly three months. We certainly appreciated the shows we had each Saturday afternoon during that time. We also thought it nice of Mrs. Wickens and her helpers to open the candy counter for us each week.\n\nOur first big party of the year was Halloween. It was a great success and everyone was dressed in gay fashion. We marched up the stairs and through the dormitories so the Lower School could have a look at us. Also made a funny clown and made us laugh all evening.\n\nWe did the same things at Christmas as we usually do. The school was beautifully decorated and we were sorry when we had to take down the decorations. Little \"Yankie\" cut the Christmas cake and my, his eyes got big and round.\n\nWe also had a nice concert this year. Some of the children sang...\nand danced. The staff put on a skit. Mr. Jones was supposed to be a teacher (such a funny wig he wore!) and the other staff were his pupils. They had the same names as our own. How we laughed at them!\n\nOur Easter Service was lovely, and the Church looked very nice that day. We had our Easter party a week later, but we certainly had a grand time. The boys' orchestra played a few pieces for us.\n\nFinally there were the Graduation Service and Exercises.\u2014When the Graduates received their Bibles and diplomas, many a person's eyes were blurred at those last events, and I think each one sincerely meant every word of the hymn when we sang \"God Be With You.\"\n\n**Cadets \u2014 Boys and Girls**\n\nThe Cadets will not soon forget the past year. Lieut. Robertson inspected the Corps in May and he complimented Lt. Gifford and the Cadets on their fine performance. He said that he had seen \"a lot worse Cadets in Victoria.\"\n\nWe were proud to have Bishop Sexton, Rear-Admiral Laingay, and Capt. Evans, take the salute as we marched to our Confirmation Service. Rear-Admiral Laingay is in command of the Pacific Coast.\n\nIn May the Cadets paraded with the sailors who made a \"stop-off\" at Alert Bay for a few hours. Again on the 24th of May they took part in the Lay Day parade.\n\nThe end of another school year has come and the end of my term as Sergeant-major. I would like to thank all the Cadets, both boys and girls, for their cooperation. It has been a great privilege and a lot of fun being Sergeant-major. Although there has been quite a lot of work to do, I have usually enjoyed doing it. I hope the Cadets will behave as well with their new Sergeant-major as they did with me.\n\nAlways remember that whether you are a Sergeant or a Private you are an important part of the Corps. Everybody has to play his part in order to accomplish anything; and always keep in mind that you have to work up from the bottom in order to get to the top.\n\nIn closing, I wish to thank Mr. Gifford for all the things he has taught me. If it weren't for his help, me when I didn't know what to do, I guess I couldn't have done very well.\n\n\u2014 Alvin McKay\n\nThis is a wonderful privilege of having the opportunity to write about my Cadet Girls and the work I have done with them as a Sergeant-major.\n\nThere are so many nice things about them that I can never express in words. Of course there have been miserable days when they have got into trouble for things that they shouldn't have done, but I used we all have our ups and downs.\n\nLooking back to when I began my duty as a Sergeant-major, I feel very happy and proud of all the different girls that have become Cadets, now ranking near the top. These girls worked hard to be a credit to their parents and school, besides trying to earn marks for their teams.\n\nThey were such tricks they did not want to do but had to do because they were examples to the smaller girls.\n\nIt is very simple to spell or pronounce the word \"Cadet\", but being a Cadet is quite a difficult thing for some boys and girls. Each one must learn to take and obey orders.\n\nNow that I am older, I understand this better, and I appreciate\nGaleto - Boys and Girls (continued)\n\nall that has been taught me by both staff and pupils. I hope as long as this school stands, there will always be boy and girl co-educators who will prove a credit to their instructors.\n\nIn closing, I would like to thank Mr. Gifford for all the help and kindness he has given to my Galeto and myself. I wish to extend my appreciation for the cooperation the girls have given me as our co-educator.\n\n\u2014 Beverley Mason\n\nSPORTS\n\nThrough sports we learn to be good losers as well as good winners. This is the way we can learn to make good citizens.\n\nIn a Democracy, the people choose their leaders through a system of voting. The majority always wins. In order to make good citizens, the minority must be good \"losers\" and be willing to support the chosen leader.\n\nBy participating in sports, we also learn to do whatever the captain says, to cooperate with others, and most of all to \"give and take.\" This is one of the ways we may learn to become one of the \"third group of Indians\" mentioned in the Brief that the Native Brotherhood presented to the Special Joint Committee at Ottawa.\n\nSo, \"kids\" continue to take this advantage of preparing yourself for the future.\n\nSports - Upper School\n\nSt. Michael's Day\n\nIn the morning the track races were held. Both boys and girls took part in an effort to earn marks for their teams. Team 4 won the boys' relay race. Capt. David Scott, Basil Anderson, Norman Dawson, George Smith. In the afternoon there was a football game. Captain of the Blues - Percy Campbell. Captain of the Yellows - Kenneth Hindoor. The day drew to a close with David Scott carrying top honours for the boys and Joyce Nelson for the girls. The Cups were awarded in the evening.\n\nEaster Monday\n\nSports had to be postponed for a week because of bad weather. Foot-ball was held in the morning. \"Little wolves\" - Capt. James Jack vs \"Lone wolves\" - Capt. Red Robinson. Highlight of the day was a ball game between staff and children. Of course children won!\n\nHolder of the Cup: David Scott, boys - Hector Maxwell, girls.\n\nMay 24th\n\nThis is the day when all the people from the Village come up to the school grounds. The winners of the races are awarded money. This year the boys and girls were tired after having marched in the parade as Galeto, nevertheless, many of them went into the events.\n\nJames Jack won the hundred yard dash. The most important event of the day was the relay race for the Hudson Cup, which was awarded to the Alert Bay Town. The runner-up was the S.M.S. Team, just three-quarters of a lap behind the winning team.\nsports (continued)\n\nSt. Michael's Tent, runners-up for the Hudson Cup:\n\nPercy Campbell, David Scott, James Mack, Teddy Wilson, Roll Robinson,\nErnest Mountain, Norman Davison.\n\nNOTES\n\nThe girls enjoyed a First Aid course under Miss Matthews.\n\nMr. Gifford gave the senior boys a course in First Aid.\n\nMrs. Wisconsin's music class made good progress this year. Ruby Schaefer played a solo, Dorcan Davison, Grace Dixon, Emma McKay\nand Margaret Folken played duets at the Graduation Exercises.\n\nSome of the boys formed a little orchestra, and we all agree - it was a fine one.\n\nVISITORS\n\nThere were several visitors to the School this year. Our old friend, Mr. Okay was up several times with his movie machines. His films are very educational, and are much enjoyed.\n\nCanon Coleman was here in the Fall. We had hoped he would be able to come again before holidays, so we all enjoyed his visit very much.\n\nIt certainly was nice to have Rev. P.R. Kulley speak to us; we hope some of our boys will try to be like him some day.\n\nWe weren't so happy when we heard Inspector Davey was coming, but he turned out to be a very nice man. In fact, we all will be looking forward to his next visit.\n\nOne Sunday we got a thrill when Dr. Powles and his Father took the service at Christ Church. Then Canon Powles, who is a missionary in Japan for many years and has now returned to his work, gave us a talk about the Japanese.\n\nOur last visitor was Bishop Sexton. Oh, how he made us laugh! It was just like having a holiday in class when he was there. Bishop Sexton confirmed the Confirmation Candidates while he was here.\n\nDO YOU REMEMBER?\n\nThe time LORETTA fell off the lockers and broke her arm?\n\nThe time one of the girls gave ANNA SPENCER a sleeping pill?\n\nSledding on the hill after the big snow storm.\n\nHow it poured rain the day of Cadet Inspection.\n\nWhen the snow broke loose with Miss Hoare on it.\n\nThe time HELEN dropped the staff pudding.\n\nWhen Mr. McKone and the Graduates were locked in the library.\n\nWhen BAGL fell from the fire escape pole.\nDo You Remember (continued)\n\nThe outdoor weddings the girls held.\n\nWhen the boys let Godfrey down from the roof in a stretcher (just practice).\n\nThe meetings the girls had in the library.\n\nThe day David Scow started the tractor, but didn't know how to stop it.\n\nFishing over at the Nimpkish.\n\nBenny's story of Rod Robinson and the grizzly.\n\nHow Alvin fell over Kenneth playing football and put his elbow out of joint.\n\nPercy Campbell's back luck on St. Michael's Day, first he had his hand stepped on during the wheelbarrow race, and then somebody kicked the football against his stomach and knocked his breath out.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE:\n\nWe, the Grade VIII pupils, have strived very hard to get this paper published, but it has been mostly fun for us. We hope you will enjoy reading it for we have tried to make it interesting.\n\nThrough publishing this paper, we have learned much and gained an appreciation of some of the difficulties of running a paper.\n\nAs this is the last issue of the term we have gathered a round of the year's happenings.\n\nWe wish to thank Miss Matthews very much for the mimeographing of the paper and for the help she has given us. We wish also to thank Miss Moore in directing us in how we should go about arranging our material. Thanks also to everyone who has kindly contributed articles for our paper.\n\nWe are very sorry about not having the pictures ready.

Percy\nSup't Training Teacher\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Canada\nTHE PARLIAMENTARY OBSERVER\n\nTo sum up one's impressions of the evidence given to the Parliamentary Committee on Indian Affairs in the past two years it seems evident that two factors in improving the status of the Indians will be immediately acted upon.\n\nThese are up-to-date legislation, together with a more streamlined administrative policy, and, secondly, a larger financial appropriation. Public opinion has reacted favourably to the pressing needs of the Indian population of Canada. The Indian problem tends to aggravate itself yearly with the increasing rate of births. We can foresee a 200,000 Indian population within the next 30 years.\n\nThere remains, however, an element of the problem which cannot be solved; neither by legislation nor by money. This is the Indian's own code of standards of progress such as the present state of our civilization exemplifies. There are standards of living which are commonly accepted in North America, and which can be attained by anyone, provided a reasonable effort is made. Whether the Indian wishes to become a full-fledged citizen or not, it remains that no degree of self-sufficiency and of freedom can be obtained without a minimum of effort.\n\nWhen one considers that millions of immigrants have come to America in the past century, penniless, and have through their own personal efforts and ingenuity, achieved an honored position through their education and wealth in our society, it is hard for the ordinary citizen to conceive that a group of privileged people should be perpetuated under governmental care forever. This is the case for the Indians of our country. The Indians have undeniable rights granted them by Treaties; these rights, however, are sometimes extended by some persons a long way beyond what was originally promised in the Treaties.\n\nIt would do well to consider that what was actually promised in the text of the Treaties, in many instances, did not amount to very much; and it would not be rash to affirm that the Government of Canada, as a whole, has done for the Indians a great deal more than what was promised in the Treaties. No matter what the new legislation may be, no amount of additional grants of money are to be spent to improve the lot of the Indian population so remote that unless the native population takes hold of the present opportunity and uses it to achieve progress through their industry no real change for the better will be made.\n\nThe example set by the numerous Indians who have attained economic independence would induce everybody to strive to rely upon their own personal effort and earnest toil. Thus the solution of the Indian problem will be hastened considerably.\n\nThere are groups in Ontario, in British Columbia, and in other provinces, as well as numerous individuals throughout Canada who have advanced to a stage that renders them undistinguishable from their white neighbors. In general, however, the reserve system has unfortunately engendered conditions of economic dependency which have killed outright the initiative, courage, independence for which the Indians were so well noted before the arrival of the white population.\n\nINDIAN MISSIONARY\n\nNew Appointments To Indian Health Services\n\nOTTAWA\u2014To help meet the need for better health services for Canada's Indians and Eskimos, two regional medical superintendents for Quebec and the Eastern Arctic have been appointed in the Indian health services directorate of the Department of National Health and Welfare and the acting director of Indian health has been confirmed in that position by the Civil Service Commission.\n\nConfirmed in the post of director in which he has acted since January 1946 is Dr. J.M. O'Leary of Ottawa. Dr. O.R.A. Lercou, for the past 11 years with the Royal Army Medical Corps, has been appointed for the Quebec region and for the Eastern Arctic area. Dr. H.W. Lewis of Ottawa since 1931 in Indian medical work in the northern parts of Alberta and Saskatchewan. (Dr. Lewis was making his second trip to the north, his first in his new post, on the \"Nootka\" wrecked off Baffin Island.)\n\nExpansion of the health services to the Indians and Eskimos is part of a long-range plan to meet the health and welfare needs of a widely-scattered and nomadic group.\n\nIt would be unfair, therefore, to lay the blame for the Indians' failure to advance entirely upon the Indians themselves, as the fundamental failure was with the system of administration used in the past, and with the lack of sufficient funds allotted to the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nNow given a chance with a new and adequate modern legislation for the Indians, and the assurance of increased funds, it is hoped that the Indians will receive an education which will make them economically self-sufficient, and that they will be given a training to govern themselves, to accept responsibility, to handle money and to generally fit themselves to a much higher standard of living.\nIndian women of the Battleford Agency gathered on Thunderchild Reserve, Turtleford, Sask., July 29-31, for the first Indian Women's Homemakers Convention to be held in Saskatchewan. Also present were Rev. Fr. Armand Allard, O.M.I., Mrs. James Warden, and Miss C. Boyko, of Meadow Lake; Mrs. Paul Lewis, Little Pine, and Mrs. F. L. Ross, Thunderchild. The 17 Indian delegates presented came from Little Pine, Poundmaker, Meadow Lake, Moosomin and Thunderchild I.R. An interesting and helpful program was carried out with Mrs. F. L. Ross presiding and Rev. Allard acting as secretary.\n\nChief James Okanee, Thunderchild I.R., gave the address of welcome.\n\nMr. C. S. Bell, Indian Agent, Battleford, in his talk to the group stressed the benefits to be gained from Homemakers work on the reserves. This year he said prizes were to be given for the best kept home on each reserve in the Agency.\n\nMrs. J. Warden spoke on the need for three good meals a day which included vegetables, eggs and milk.\n\nA report on the Indian Women Homemakers Convention for Eastern Canada, held at Caughnawaga, Quebec, was given by the delegate from Saskatchewan, Mrs. F. L. Ross.\n\nRev. Fr. Allard took as his topic, \"Discipline in the Home.\"\n\nAbout 50 women and children listened to a Health talk by Miss C. Boyko, R.N., Public Health Nurse.\n\nMrs. Paul Lewis demonstrated canning.\n\nMost encouraging perhaps was the part taken by the Indian women themselves. Mrs. William Gladu who spoke on \"Gardens\" and Mrs. Agnes Desjarlais who gave a humorous demonstration. Also the reports of the delegates: Mrs. Albert Merasty, Meadow Lake; Mrs. Lucy Favel, Poundmaker; Mrs. Beatrice Night Traveller, Littlepine; and Mrs. Catherine Okanee, Thunderchild.\n\nA bonfire and wiener roast and Indian dances were enjoyed one evening.\n\nIt was decided to accept the invitation of Chief Tom Favel to hold next year's convention on Poundmaker Reserve.\n\nThe Officers for the coming year are:\n\nHon. Pres.\u2014Mr. J. P. B. Ostrander, Sup't. of Ind. Affairs, Regina, Sask.\n\nHon. Sec.-Treas.\u2014Mr. C. S.

Fr. A. Allard, Corr.)\nFROM COAST TO COAST\n\nINDIAN PAGENT HELD AT CAUGHNAWAGA\n\nIn the evening of Sept. 1, Caughnawaga Indians gave a splendid theatrical representation recalling the history of their tribe and the triumph of civilization over paganism.\n\nThis representation has been put up by the Jesuit Fathers of St. Francis Xavier Mission. Thousands of Montreal visitors and American tourists were in attendance, and their contributions were used to help poor children on the reserve.\n\nRev. Fr. Real Lalonde, S.J., assisted by some other religious members of the mission and by Chief Pokanoket Fire (Mr. John McCumber) and Mrs. McCumber, organized this beautiful manifestation; actors had been picked from the Caughnawaga Indians.\n\nDifferent scenes depicted the primitive life of the Indians before the arrival of the missionaries, also the wars between Iroquois and Hurons. Between these war pictures, a few scenes representing the life of the first missionaries and the good results of their apostleship.\n\nRev. Fr. Lalonde acted as director. After long and minute studies of the Caughnawaga History, he portrayed it in the most lively and realistic manner.\n\nFORT CHIPWEYAN CELEBRATES 100th ANNIVERSARY\n\nThe hundredth anniversary of the foundation of the Nativity Mission at Fort Chipweyan was celebrated on July 5-6-7 His Excellency Bishop Trocellier, O.M.I. presided at the celebration.\n\nEASY MONEY\n\nCARLYLE, Sask.\u2014An Indian on the White Bear reserve, 11 miles north of Carlyle, who found a litter of 14 coyotes received $70 in bounty for his find. It was the largest litter he had heard of, he said.\n\nMIDLAND, Ont., Aug. 3.\u2014Standing Rock, the much sought Huron Portal to the \"Land of Souls,\" remained a closed door to the past. The heart of Huron mythology, Standing Rock was frequently mentioned in the relations and reports of the Jesuit missions to the Hurons, and the lights or reflection of village fires commented upon. The object of the test was to light a huge Indian-type fire on the village site and motor the 40 miles from Standing Rock to the look-out point above the ruins of old Fort Ste. Marie, checking either the flames or the reflection with these ancient reports penned as far back as 1636.\n\nA party, headed by J. N. Bourrie, and Wilfred Jury, curator, Museum of Indian Archaeology, University of Western Ontario, left the proposed village site the main test. A large swinging electric light had been erected from Standing Rock, itself situated on the summit of the village flat lands, on the Blue Mountain, where the end of the Niagara escarpment towers over the surrounding country, some eight miles from the Canadian National Collingwood station.\n\nAt a point about 20 miles north, on the shore of Nottawasaga Bay, the light could be seen distinctly, but there was no trace of the fire or its reflections. At French's Hill, about seven miles from Fort Ste. Marie, the light was thought to have blinked, but the view was indefinite. Plans were made to re-light the fire on Saturday night at the same hour, but thunder clouds gathered above the mountain and a drenching rain fell. It was as if the Thunder Bird or the Huron Spirit of the Storm had flown across three centuries to defeat the project.\n\nThe actual site of Standing Rock is such as would give rise to the Huron legend. It projects upwards and outward from a bare side of a cliff. Some tremendous convulsion of nature thrust it from the main cliff and deposited it where we see it today, the mountain, dropping to 90 feet in depth, might easily be looked upon by primitive Hurons as torn asunder by the mighty spirit of the rock.\n\nThere are three possible sites of Standing Rock, all the relations of 1636, a Jesuit writer, Father John de Brebeuf, at Thonatiria, eight miles inland from the mouth of Nottawasaga Bay, says \"one day I asked one of our savages, where he thought Village was, described it was. He answered that it was in the direction of the Petun country, that is towards the west eight leagues from us, and that some had seen them as they journeyed on. The road they followed was wide and paved well and that they passed near a rock, which they called Ekaremioni-di. It was often found embellished with the paint which they used to daub their faces.\"\n\nHuron Quotation poses two questions to investigators, first why was Standing Rock in the Petun, or tobacco, nation country. These first growers of Tobacco in Ontario, were the enemies of the Hurons. A clue may be found in the Huron name for them\u2014People Who Spoke the Same Tongue.\" It is believed that originally they were a part of the Hurons and later broke away; the second question is the derivation of Ekaremioni-di\u2014a better translation, either as \"The Rock That Stands Up,\" or \"The Rock That Stands Out,\" the inland rock stands up in a rocky open country, it is further stated that the departed souls, \"passed by Standing Rock and were seen no more.\"\nN.A.I.B. Calls Convention\n\nThe annual convention will be held this year in the Y.M.C.A. Bldg., in the City of Ottawa, commencing at ten A.M., September 26th.\n\nThe convention will consider the recommendations of the Indian Act Committee of Parliament so that the N.A.I.B. may express its opinion and its own recommendations.\n\nIn compliance with the decision of the 1945 convention an election of Executive Board Members will also be held during the three-day convention.\n\nAndrew Paull,\nPresident.\n\nIndian Cadet Corps Wins Sask. Grand Challenge Cup\n\nResults of grading of all provincial army cadet corps in a series of inspections covering the spring and summer months were announced Aug 3rd by Maj. W. J. Fenny, Saskatchewan area cadet training officer.\n\nTop place went to Hugonard cadet corps of the Lebret Indian School which received the grand challenge cup in the final grading of leading corps in each of five groups into which the inspections were classified, and also the Group E special trophy.\n\nCadet corps were grouped from boarding schools teaching high school subjects, other high schools, combined high and public schools or open corps with enrolment of 25 or more, combined high and public schools or open corps with less than 25 enrolled, and boarding, public or separate schools teaching only up to grade eight.\n\nComplete results of corps standing were:\n\nGrand Challenge Cup: Hugonard. Tied for runner up: Star City, St. Joseph's College, St. Thomas College.\n\nClass E Trophy was awarded to Hugonard Cadet Corps. Competing in Group E were: Hugonard, Kapuskasing public school, St. Joseph's school, Maple Creek, Moose Jaw schools, Sacred Heart, St. Augustine, Holy Rosary, St. Barnabas Mission, St. Philip's Indian School, Cowessess Indian School, Muscowequan Indian School. The cup and trophy are to be officially presented in October.\n\nHome Planning Contest Renewed\n\nThe Home Planning Contest advertised in our April issue (page 4) is extended during the fall months. A total of $15 in prizes is now offered as follows:\n\n$5.00 donated by His Exc. Bishop Guy, O.M.I., as First Prize,\n$1.50 each for 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th prizes donated by Mr. A. Adam, Pine Falls, Man.\n\nOne subscription to the Indian Missionary Record, each for 6th to 10th prizes, donated by Miss Annette Dodge.\n\nAll essays should be mailed no later than November 5th, to Rev. Father Dodge, O.M.I.,\nIndian School,\nLESTOCK, Sask.\n\nThe topic of the contests is \"Home Planning\" for ex-pupils of Indian schools, and should be treated along practical lines, remembering the following points: religious life, building a home, food and clothing, saving money, occupations, arts and crafts, etc.\n\nMany excellent entries have already been received to date; you still have time to send in your entry. Names of the winners will be published in the December issue of the Indian Missionary Record.\n\nDuck Lake Indian School Wins Prizes In Guild's Exhibition\n\nThe Duck Lake Indian School won prizes in the Canadian Handicrafts Guild's exhibition at Montreal lately.\n\nSophie Littlepine won the General Prize for the finest costume in the competition. This was particularly commended by the judges as having been sewn throughout.\n\nAnother General Prize has been awarded to a member of the school, Marie Louise Badger, for the heading on her coat, which the judges considered well balanced, and excellently distributed, and in thoroughly good trim too. In spite of her having used a good many shiny beads. Of these two costumes the first, that of Sophie Littlepine, was bought for the Travelling Exhibition which has gone on tour to the West.\n\nBeaded moccasins and cap bands were bought for Exhibition. Sophie Littlepine's quill work moccasins are in correct tradition and are beautifully done.\n\nThe Judges have felt that the work of St. Michael's School is outstanding, and the school has, therefore, been awarded a prize of $15.00 for the encouragement of this work.\nTrap Lines For Indians To Be Registered\n\nAt the treaty paid here in June the Chief game warden of Sioux- Lookout and an official of the Department of Game and Fisheries of Ontario accompanied Mr. Swartman, our Indian agent, on their purpose of registering all the trap lines held by Indian trappers. This measure is to prevent white trappers from taking trap lines owned by Indians but not registered.\n\nBEAVER SEASON\n\nThe beaver season which used to open on the first of Dec. and close on the first of Jan., will be changed to a later date, most probably in March.\n\nSUMMER SCHOOL FOR INDIAN CHILDREN\n\nA summer school was open to Indian children in July. The council-house, to which an addition was built, was used for that purpose. During August the Indians having gone berry picking on the north shore of the lake, the Catholic Mission was able to put one of its buildings at the disposal of the children and school was taught there to avoid making the children travel too far every day. Cecil Hatson was the teacher. Besides teaching in two schools during the day, he also taught adults three nights a week. We thank him for the splendid work he has done and hope he will be with us again next summer.\n\nArchbishop G. Cabana's Visit To The Catholic Mission\n\nThe Most Reverend Georges Cabana, Archbishop of St.-Boniface, visited the Catholic Mission on Aug. 23, and 24. He was accompanied by Rev. Fr. J. E. Desorcy of St. Boniface. It was the first visit of His Grace who had travelled to Lac Seul by plane from Hudson. His Grace explained the meaning of the ceremony that took place: the blessing of the stations of the cross and the benediction of the Blessed Sacrament.\n\nCONFIRMATION\n\nConfirmation took place on the 23rd. Two persons were confirmed. A solemn Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament closed the visit of His Grace.\n\nChief and Councillors Pay a Visit to His Grace\n\nShortly after the arrival of His Grace the Chief of Lac Seul Band John Little accepted the two of his councillor, John Little Denon and Charles Thomas, paid a visit to His Grace at the Catholic Mission.\n\nHis Grace seems to have enjoyed his stay very much. At the close of the visit he expressed the wish to see a larger building erected for the church. He has also promised the Indians that they will always have a Missionary for their spiritual welfare.\n\nOn behalf of all the Indians of this Mission we thank Archbishop Cabana for his long stay with us, and also for his kindness in visiting our homes and school. We hope to see him again and wish him success in his work.\n\nBlueberry Season\n\nThe blueberry crop is fairly good this summer and if there is no early frost it will last for a long time.\n\nHospital-Sanatorium For Indians at Sioux-Lookout\n\nWhile visiting the summer school school last August our Indian Agent Mr. G. Swartman told us that he has received word from Ottawa that a hospital for Indians will be built in Sioux-Lookout. Part of the hospital will be used for Tuberculosis cases. There will be wards for contagious diseases. Construction is to begin this summer if possible.\n\nMany Indians in the past had objected to go to the Sanatorium because it was too far from home; some went to Selkirk, others to Fort- William, Hailbury and even Cochrane. With the new San in Sioux-Lookout nobody, we hope, will object to going there if suffering from Tuberculosis.\n\nMany Indians have been working for the Patricia Transportation during the summer months. Some found employment in the different sawmills in Hudson.\n\nIndian Trappers Voluntarily Restrict Beaver Catch\n\nNative trappers of northern Saskatchewan have been conservative conscious to the point of sacrificing several thousands of dollars on this year's catch, the Hon. J. L. Phelps, Minister of Natural Resources of the Sask. Government said when announcing that more than ten percent of the beaver trapping seals issued last March had been returned unused. The seals had been distributed to Indians in proportion to the number of beaver in the conservation area was believed capable of supporting.\n\nIn returning the seals the Indians said they had cut their traps so that there might be a sustained catch from year to year and thus ensure a constant source of livelihood. Trappers from the Sipamok, Reindeer Lake, Pelican Narrows, Red Earth, Wabwood and Love were among those who voluntarily restricted their catch.\n\nMaking a survey of the beaver population the trappers used the figures as a basis to set the number of pelts to be taken. Trapping was less than allowed by the provincial Game Branch more than 300 seals were returned to head office amounting to a loss of approximately $30.00 on each seal taken, Mr. Phelps said.\n\n\"The Trappers in this area have shown community spirit to the extent that they distributed their muskrat catch returns proportionately among every man, woman and child in their conservation area. At Canoe Lake the Indians decided to forego the catching of muskrat for fear that the beaver in the vicinity might accidentally get caught\", the minister stated. The transplanting of nuisance beaver from the south of the province is continued with some 500 being live trapped for transportation to the north this year. Special permits are issued for trapping in the south where beaver are surplus and destructive, Mr. Phelps pointed out.\nThe Only True Sacrifice\n\nAs man had not in himself the power to offer an acceptable sacrifice to God, and as God could make him holy by purifying him from his sins, Christ, the Son of God made man, could be the only one whose sacrifice would be accepted by God.\n\nAs St. Paul writes in his Epistle to the Hebrews: \"Sacrifice and holocaust for sin Thou wouldest not, for they did not please Thee. Then I said: Behold I come to do Thy will.\" (Hebr. X: 6-9).\n\nThe first picture shows Jesus, the Son of God, coming from heaven, at His Father's bidding, to offer Himself as a victim in the sacrifice which would save mankind. Christ is shown here wearing a stole, sign of his priesthood, and the cross is shown the cross on which He would die. On the right is shown the altar of the sacrifices of the Jews, which sacrifices God could not accept.\n\nThe only true sacrifice, therefore, is the Incarnation of Jesus Christ, that is God the Son becoming man in order to sanctify the human race. Mankind is \"sacrificed\" in Christ\u2014as \"sacrificed\" means \"made holy.\"\n\nThe word \"Christ\" means \"anointed.\" Priests, victims, kings were anointed with oil as a symbol of consecration. As the oil penetrates through any substance, the divinity of the Son of God penetrates and makes holy human nature, through His birth as the Son of the Virgin Mary.\n\nThe second picture illustrates the Virgin Mary offering to God, the Father, her living Son Jesus, as a victim. The Holy Ghost is pictured as a dove. The whole picture shows the mystery of Incarnation: the Son of God becoming man, by the operation of the Holy Ghost, in order to sacrifice Himself as a victim for the salvation of mankind.\n\nAs the blood of the animals offered up to God could not satisfy the justice of God, nor purify mankind from its sinful state, the infinite merit of the God-Man, shedding His Precious Blood, could be accepted by God as a satisfactory sacrifice.\n\nThe third picture shows Christ dying on the Cross and shedding His Blood in a chalice. The word \"chalice\" comes from it is often used in the Scriptures in such expressions as 'the chalice of salvation,' in reference to the shedding of Christ's blood\u2014therefore His death\u2014for the salvation of mankind.\n\n(Next month: Baptism\u2014Sacrament of the mystery of death and life.)\n\nWATCH FOR OUR OCTOBER ISSUE\n\nLARGER \u2014 MORE PICTURES\n\nPlease note our new address:\n\nINDIAN MISSIONARY RECORD\n\nBox 5, ST.

But he has little evidence to back up the story. Creel Indians here are quite familiar with the creature.\n\nAccording to Mrs. David Sagetehaway, the creature is \"something like a big snake. It's as big as a barrel, and it goes under the water. The head was covered with hair and the thing had a mane like a horse. It undulated as it went through the water.\"\n\nThe Indians naturally were skeptical, so Daniel Wopese went out in a freighter canoe with an outboard motor. He broke all speed records coming back. He said that he had seen the \"thing\" and that it was too horrible to describe.\n\nSouth Sea Islanders May have American Origin\n\nLIMA, Peru, July 19\u2014Radio reports say six Norwegian scientists sailing a frail balsa wood and bamboo craft have successfully completed a 3,500-mile crossing of the south Pacific by reaching the Marquesas Islands.\n\nHeaded by Thor Heyerdahl, 32-year-old ethnologist and archeologist the expedition was designed chiefly to prove his theory that the South Sea Islands were populated originally by a pre-historic South American people who crossed the Pacific on rafts impelled by ocean currents.\nThe Patriarch Abraham\n\nMany years after the human race had scattered from Babel, there lived in Ur, a herdsman called Thare, who had three sons, one of whom was called Abram. (Ur is in Chaldee, see Map).\n\nThey moved their family from Ur to Haran. After Thare's death God told Abram to leave his native land, and He promised Abram he would be the father of a great nation. In obedience to God Abram moved to the land of Chanaan; when Abram reached the city of Si-chem God said to Abram: \"To thy children I will give this land.\"\n\nAbram built altars to God. Then as a famine spread over the land he moved to Egypt in order to escape it. Returning to Chanaan, Abram settled down near Bethel. Abram grew very rich.\n\nSome time later foreign kings invaded the country, making prisoner the nephew of Abram, Lot; Abram went to war to rescue his nephew, and on his return from the battle, Abram was blessed by the King of Sodom. The prayer of God, who in thanksgiving offered a sacrifice of bread and wine. After this victory God made a covenant (or treaty) with Abram, saying: \"I am thy protector,\" said God, \"and thy reward is exceedingly great. Look up to heaven and count thy stars at their count, so shall thy descendants be.\" (Second picture).\n\nThus God chose one nation to belong to Him in a very special manner. Abram was to be the father of the \"Chosen People.\" God changed Abram's name to \"Abraham\" meaning \"Father of a multitude.\" A son was born to Abraham, named Isaac.\n\nTo test the faith of Abraham God called on him one night and told him: \"Take your son Isaac and go to a mountain which I shall show you and offer him to Me as a sacrifice.\" Having travelled three days Abraham saw the mountain; then he climbed with Isaac, there he built an altar placed wood upon it, and bound Isaac and placed him on the altar; as Abraham reached for his sword and was about to slay Isaac an Angel stopped him: \"Do not lay your hand upon the boy. Now I know thou fearest God and hast not spared thy only-begotten Son for His sake.\" (Third picture).\n\nAbraham took Isaac off the altar, and offered up instead a ram as a sacrifice to God.\n\nThus Abraham died his son Isaac married Rebecca. Abraham lived to the age of one hundred and seventy-five years. His life was filled with exemplary faith in God and trust in Him. Abraham was buried in Hebron, near his wife Sara.\n\n(To be continued)\n\nPLEASE RENEW YOUR SUBSCRIPTION PROMPTLY\n\nADDRESS ALL CORRESPONDENCE TO:\n\nINDIAN MISSIONARY RECORD\n\nBox 5, ST.

THE SECOND COMMANDMENT OF THE CHURCH.\n\nBy this law the Church imposes the obligation of fasting and abstinence from meat on certain days of the year.\n\nThe Church has good reasons for doing so: Fasting and abstinence are beneficial both for the body and the soul.\n\nModeration in eating sharpens the power of the mind. It strengthens the will power and brings the body in subjection to the soul. Our bodies, like wild animals, need to be tamed, so they will be receptive to spiritual food.\n\nModeration in eating is a most powerful means to overcome temptations of the devil, for the body is his best weapon.\n\nModeration in eating improves the health: \"He that is temperate shall prolong his life.\" (Ecclus. 37, 34). \"A moderate man also rejoices with sound and sound sleep.\" (Ecclus. 37, 34).\n\nFasting inclines to prayer. It helps one to master himself. It is a remedy against sin. By fasting the Ninivites obtained mercy for their sins.\n\nThe Preface for Lent sings of Christ, whose grace, through bodily fast, restrains our vices, uplifts our mind and grants to us strength and rewards.\n\nFasting is commanded on all days of Lent.\n\nABSTINENCE from meat must be observed on all Fridays of the year, except those on which is celebrated a Holyday of Obligation. In case the Church will not impose penance upon us on days given to rejoicing.\n\nFASTING and ABSTINENCE are observed on Wednesdays and Fridays of Lent, on Ember days, and on vigils (days preceding special Feasts).\n\nThe Ember days are 3 in number: Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.\n\nEmber days are observed at the beginning of each season:\n- in Winter: third week of Advent;\n- in Spring: second week of Lent;\n- in Summer: week following Pentecost Sunday;\n- in Autumn: third week of September.\n\nVigils on which fasting and abstinence must be observed are the day preceding the four great festivals of Christmas, Pentecost, Assumption of the Blessed Virgin and All Saints' Day.\n\nOn Friday, meat, and all dishes in the preparation of which it enters, are forbidden. Fish, eggs, butter, milk, cheese etc., are permitted.\n\nThere are three reasons for this measure: Firstly, in honor of our Lord, who, on a Friday, sacrificed His flesh for us; Secondly, as a means of penance, because we can easily dispense with, and yet it is a food men generally like best. Another reason is as a reminder that we must restrain our appetite which the use of meat fosters.\n\nDuring Lent, only one full meal a day is to be taken. (Either noon or in the evening.) At each meal meat must be eaten (except on Friday and Ember days). Eating between meals is forbidden; drinking is allowed.\n\nThe Law of Lent obliges all between the ages of 21 and 60, whose health and work permits. Fasting must not impair one's health or the fulfillment of his duties. (In case of doubt consult your Pastor).\n\nThe purpose of Lent is to honour our Lord's fast of forty days; it is a time of penance and sorrow for sin; a time of preparation for the great Feast of Easter.\n\nEmber days are observed in order to pray to God for good priests, and to thank Him for the benefits received during the last season.\n\nCAMPERVILLE, MAN.\n\nJuly 18\u2014Our Annual Picnic was held at the Beach with a large crowd in attendance. Even though the clouds were threatening, it did not dampen the spirits. First Prize of $100.00 was won by the Minotonas Baseball team against Camperville. The second prize of $50.00 was won by the Camperville Baseball Team against Pine River, with a score of 13-1. There was fun galore for everyone of all kinds of games and delicious treats. All monies collected went towards the Memorial Recreation Centre, to be built in the near future.\n\nJuly 20\u2014Annet McLeod, eldest daughter of John McLeod and Virginie Guibiche, and Valentine Nepinak, son of Jerome Nepinak were united in marriage in the Church here. Rev. A. Plamondon, O.M.I officiated.\n\nMarcel Nepinak, son of Pat Nepinak, age 13 years and 11 months died of a long illness. He was a Scout and belonged to the first Camperville Scout Troop. He died as he lived, like a little saint. Burial took place in the Camperville cemetery.\n\nHaying has started here and a good crop is reported. Commercial fishing has also started on Lake Winnipegosis.\nConfederacy of the Interior Tribes of B.C.\n\nThe object of the Confederacy is to work in union for the general welfare of our people, and to make known to the governments our requirements so that we may assist each other in the attainment of these requirements.\n\nLast year all the chiefs of the Interior of B.C. received a circular from the Joint Committee of Parliament inquiring into the Indian Act, through our respective Indian Agents, wherein they were asked to express our opinions on the eight points contained in the circular letter. Some of the tribes replied to the circular letter, but others had not replied. We had hoped that our accredited delegates would be given an opportunity to make representations to the Joint Committee. We have been with great concern that the Native Brotherhood of B.C. has presented a brief purporting to be the desires of all the Indians in B.C. We wish to say to the Government of Canada through the Joint Committee that the Native Brotherhood of B.C. did not represent our views or opinions, and that their delegates did not have our permission to speak for us, and that Guy Williams, the alleged delegate for the unaffiliated did not speak for us, and we disavow anything which he may have taken, as it was performed without our knowledge and consent and contrary to our pleasure.\n\nWe do not approve or in any way endorse the brief presented by the Native Brotherhood of B.C. to the Joint Committee of Parliament in Ottawa during the month of May, 1947.\n\nWe desire to discuss with the Government, without delay, an adequate compensation for the rights we, the Indians, have had taken away from us, but it is to be understood that we do not abandon any of our rights until such time we accept a settlement.\n\nWe ask in a most sincere way that a Royal Commission from the Joint Committee make a tour of B.C.\n\nIndians Play Large Part In Lillooet Stampede\n\nAn attractive feature of the day was the beautiful acrobatic performance staged by a troupe of boys from St. Mary's Indian School at Mission, B.C. These lads were well trained and brought considerable praise from the spectators of the boys' fine musical talent and they supplied music for the dances at the Lillooet Rancherie.\n\nTaking first and second place in the horse race was O. Tresman. This was a unique event when Tresman rode the course first and then, while the other contestants were getting organized, caught and saddled another bronc to come in first again, taking second money.\n\nSTAMPEDE WINNERS\n\nWinner of the various events are:\n\nBest dressed and Cared for Indian Baby\u20141st, Mrs. Lawrence Doss; 2nd, Delia Harry.\n\nPony race\u20141st, Baptiste Frank; 2nd, Johnny Scottman.\n\nCowboy Hustle\u20141st, Jimmy Macdonald.\n\nHalf Mile Relay\u20141st, Stanley Alec; 2nd, Joe Alec.\n\nLillooet Derby\u20141st, Richard Edwards; 2nd, Johnny Scottman.\n\nMountain Race\u20141st, Bert Grinder; 2nd, Strawberry Sam; 3rd, Johnny Scottman.\n\nWild Horse Race\u20141st, O.

Visitors came from near and wide and riders entries were reported from as far north as Chilcotin.\n\nThe day's events started with the judging of the baby contest. The $10 prize was won by Mrs. Lawrence Doss, of the community. Also this evening Miss Hazel Dobson, Invermere Department Nurse, Dr. M. Miyazaki, and Rev. Patterson, O.M.I.\n\nArena manager was Clarence Bryson, who made a special trip from the Chilco Ranch in the Chilcotin to attend the Stampede.\n\nStrawberry Sam won the trophy donated by Col.

The dress with its royal cape may be part of the statue itself, or may be made of velvet or silk and trimmed with fur or pearls. If the dress is made of cloth, very likely it is the gift to the Infant Jesus from someone who wishes to show him for favors He has granted.\n\nHave you ever wondered why a statue of the Christ Child should be dressed this way when everyone knows that the Child on earth, He was very, very poor? One reason is, of course, that He is really the King-King of all the universe, of all the starry worlds. But there is a story about this particular little statue that children always love, and now is a very good time to tell it.\n\nA long, long time ago, for around the world there were lived a very kind lady who was very devoted to the Infant Jesus. She was a very rich woman, and she used her riches to help the poor in memory of the poverty of the Holy Family when they were on earth. This made her very pleasing to God. You must have heard the saying that God would give her all she asked for in prayer; but God does not always answer our prayers in just the way we ask them. For the good lady had a great sorrow: she had no children of her own, and kind as she was to other people's children, she was often lonely. Finally her prayers were answered and a little son was born. But he died soon afterwards, and she was lovelier than ever.\n\nTHE CHILD WALKED\n\nSo that night she did not go to bed, but watched from behind a heavy curtain. And when all the house was quiet, a light was shining through a high window, the statue moved\u2014and a lovely Child, all radiant with light, stepped down from the pedestal and walked down the chapel aisle and out the door! She followed Him as though in a dream. And at midnight she followed His heavenly Child as He walked up and down, the roads of the world looking for sinners to save. No wonder His little shoes and dress were worn! Hers were worn, too, when at last they slipped back into her little chapel and she saw the little figure standing on the pedestal, and the light grown. And she never again forgot to pray for sinners, so they say.\n\nHow much of the story is true and how much a legend, it is hard to say. There really is a little statue with richly decorated dress and golden crown. It is called the \"Holy Infant of Prague.\" It has a long history wherein the Holy Infant has blessed and cared for those who venerated His statue, and many miracles are reported by the good Carmelite priests who guard it. But whether or not there ever was such a lady, it is a good story for us to remember, especially at Christmas time. For the Holy Infant still comes at Christmas-time, to go up and down the roads of the world and look for sinners to save. When He knocks at your door, be sure to let Him in!\n\nSHUSWAP, B.C.\n\nDeaths\n\nOn July the 17th, the sad news spread around that our good friend Mrs. Allen was found dead in Armstrong; the body was sent to Salmon Arm for burial. We all miss her, she leaves to mourn her five grandchildren, and a brother Alec Johnny.\n\nAccidents:\n\nMrs. Eileen Jim Andrew of Salmon Arm lost her foot in a train accident on June the 8th. She is still in Hospital at Kamloops.\n\nBorn to Ann and Henry Sampson, a baby boy at Chase. A boy was also born to Mr. and Mrs. Nazare Sapollo of Chase. His name is Hector Pearson.\nThe Trail of Hanpa\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE VISION QUEST\n\nDaniel had found his grandfather unable to rise from his pallet one morning; the Sun-Dreamer had taken very ill.\n\n\"Grandfather, grandfather what is the matter?\" cried Daniel as he tried to lift up the heavy old man's head. He brushed the white hair away from his pain distorted face; he gave the man some cold tea to drink. The old man would not eat anything.\n\n\"Grandfather, come with me, and incense it with sweet grass... In that leather bundle is my Sun-robe... my grandson, be brave, I am going to seek the sun soon.\"\n\nHis heart aching, Daniel unwrapped the bundle and unfolded the Sun-robe. It was a hide, well worn, and decorated with designs with a faded yellow sun surrounded by the stars (Wicahntpi-oyate), the moon in its decline, the rainbow, and a larger star. At each corner were two wakan-tanka (pipe-blowing flutes), and tied to the four corners were eagle plumes.\n\nWith moist eyes Daniel joined his grandfather in prayer; the humble adobe shack was now a sacred shrine where unseen beings seemed to be present.\n\nPausing up with pillows and supported partly by Daniel, the Sun-Dreamer prayed thus:\n\n\"Wakan Tanka, look down upon me and see me. I am humble and I am pitiful. Give me a strong mind and a brave heart. I desire that all will be well with These and with me. Sun, Tunkanshila, Thou who crossest the earth, and art present down on the nation and see all, O Sun, my Lord, who was pleased to reveal to me who Thou art, and to make me to be of service to my people. Look down upon me. O moon, Hanwi, Thou who wast pleased to come with Thy sacred robe, pity me. Star Nation pity me, I commit myself to you.\n\nPausing for breath he added weakly:\n\nprayer. To him the prayers of the christian were empty recitations, meaningless and void.\n\nWhile his grandfather prayed to the Sun, to the Moon and to the Nation, the hero lay below. Daniel felt the mysterious power hovering over the Sun-Dreamer's bed, he united himself with all his heart and soul to his grandfather's prayers. Although he had been taught Daniel preferred to practice his religion in the pagan manner, without questioning or rationalizing just because his grandfather believed so, and told him so. It was a typical Lakota trait in him to be always subconsciously aware of the Supernatural Powers, therefore though he felt helpless and humble. While he did not actually worship or pray to the manifestations of nature which are not in themselves Wakan he saw the Wakan in all things. Faithful to the oldest tradition of his people he sought recourse to the supernatural for help. His prayer to the sun was the most ardent of all.\n\n\"The only way of communicating with the Supernatural lay in the quest for a vision. He felt inescapably the call for this effort, and he decided to call upon his kola, a cousin of his called Toto, who had already been through such an experience in his youth.\n\nLeaving his grandfather after a few days of watchful care, in the hands of relatives, Daniel left with his cousin Toto, for the Rock Creek canyon, in the Bad Lands, some twenty miles west of White Mountain, and where Sitting Bull seeking refuge in Canada, had made once his winter camp.\n\nFor many days Daniel had forgotten all about Marianne, the only thing on his mind was that his aged grandfather was about to die, and that he went upon the sacred quest for a vision.\n\nAs the two companions rode on they saw many farmers tilling the land raising grain, but their mind and attention was fixed on the picked secluded trails so they would not be met by any one on this secret mission. The moon was very bright for this time of the year, clouds of dust raced across the horizon. The men rode in silence for several hours before reaching the secluded spot where the quest was to take place.\n\nArriving at the canyon, they prepared a sweat bath where Daniel cleansed himself thoroughly, in the meantime Toto disappeared into the \"Wakpa\", and bedded the ground with dry dead wormwood on the edge of a reed bed.\n\nThe companions remained separated; Daniel tied a white eagle feather to his close cropped hair; then naked, he ascended the hill, and laid himself down on the offerings of tobacco and of bright-hued cloth. Then he stood erect, holding reverently the sacred Pipe in one hand; and the other hand he clasped to the heavens in supplication.\n\nHe had nothing to eat, nor to drink. Now and then his voice rose in prayer, and the cool wind the rose from the deep canyon. As the night wore on, it grew colder, the chilling damp air cut and stung at him, yet he showed no physical discomfort. He never moved, except for changing the pipe from hand to hand. He had eaten nothing that day his head had become very light, his senses were so delicate and acute that even a little bit of pricking stick was unbearably intensified. There he waited on the hallowed plot, until some one came to lead him into the realm of the Wakan. If a bird called his mind heard a noise from the spirit world, if an animal came near, he might see it as a guide to his vision...\n\nBetween midnight and dawn he went and prayed; his very soul cried out to the Wakan Tanka. Lightning flashed in the West, thunder pealed, then a terrific downpour drenched his body, yet he stood there unmoved, until dawn...\n\nThat day Daniel returned home.\n\n\"How are you grandfather?\" he asked entering the hut. \"I am happy you came back, grandchild,\" answered the Sun Dreamer, \"where have you been? I have waited two days for you to return... Now I know, I smell the odor of wormwood upon you\" he added in a whisper.\n\n\"You have to know, grandfather,\" replied Daniel with reverence and in subdued tones. \"I was at Cankausa Wakpa\".\n\n\"What was your vision, grandchild?\"\n\n\"Grandfather, I saw a great river flowing into darkness. The river was not of water, but of human faces... and these faces were of two colors: white and red... far away in the veiled horizon the river was forked and it disappeared in the darkness beyond... that is all I saw, grandfather...\"\n\nAfter some time, the Sun-Dreamer spoke again with effort: \"Grandchild, I believe you have recognized someone in that river of faces...?\"\n\n\"No one, grandfather,\" lied Daniel, for he had seen the face of the Sun-Dreamer in that river.\n\n(to be continued)\n\nINDIAN MISSIONARY\n\nRECORD, SEPTEMBER 1947.\n\nMEADOW LAKE, SASK.\n\nI.

No. 8\nMAY, 1947\n\nSENIOR PLAY A SUCCESS\n\nThe Senior Dramatic Club presented \"The Upper Room\" on April 3rd and 4th. It was the most successful production of the year. Each part was well interpreted by the actors. The simplicity and sincerity of the players impressed upon the audience the spirit of the passion. The choir of thirty voices, singing off-stage, provided a suitable background for the sacred theme. Particularly noteworthy was the singing of the lamentations during the scene depicting the death of Christ. The audience was requested before the play to remain silent between acts and to give no applause. This helped to bring home the sacredness of the play.\n\nSpecial praise should be given to the veteran actor, Dominic McComber for his performance as Samuel, the servant. At no time did he overlook his part. Throughout the play he was the key figure in every action. Joe Fox, minor, as Our Lady, and Cornelius McComber, as Mary Magdalene, handled the female roles with skill.\n\nThe Cast\u2014Achaz, Harold Belleau; Samuel, Dominic McComber; Our Lady, Joe Fox; Mary Magdalene, Cornelius McComber; Judas, David Jocko; St. John, Alfred Cooper; St. Peter, Francis Commanda; Joseph of Arimathea, Julius Neganigig; Longinus, Joe Alice; Veronica, Clement Trudeau.\n\nMob Scene\u2014Alvin Nosikere, Rudy Rice, Eli Commanda, Adam Roy.\n\nCostumes\u2014Harold Belleau, Francis Commanda, Alphonse Trudeau, Alfred Cooper.\n\nSets\u2014Paddy Jocko, Maxie Mishibin-Ijima, Adam Commanda.\n\nGrades Three and Four are nature students.

The vacations, from April 4th to the 12th passed like one day. The Midgets and Juniors engaged in hard fought basketball games every morning. In the afternoons we all went for a walk. The Seniors stretched their legs with a four or five mile jaunt. The Juniors and Midgets joined Cowboys and Indians in the woods on top of the hill.\n\nEvery evening of the holiday was filled with some activity. Great was the joy among the Midgets when they were allowed to stay up late to see the Cow-boys' movies. The special feature of the holidays was the Senior basketball games. The girls played their games first and then cheered the boys on to victory or defeat. The walls shook from the yells of the Green, Yellow, Red and Blue teams swept into action.\n\nAlphonse Trudeau and Julius Neg- anig tastefully decorated the Boys' Dining Room with blue, yellow and white streamers. The decorations and the green curtains gave the place an Easterly appearance. Two large paint- ings, six feet by four feet, painted by Julius, were hung in the dining room.\n\nThe hallowed name of St. Peter Claver has gone. Henceforth we shall be known as The Garnier Residential School. This name is more appropriate than St. Peter Claver. The bell in the school belfry is inscribed Garnier School and this shows that years ago it was the intention of Superior, to change the name, St. Peter Claver, honoured in South American while St. Charles Garnier was one of our own Canadian Martyrs. Therefore it is more fitting that we should honour him and ask his protection. S.P.C. was known up and down the North Shore for hard fighting, clean sportsmanship. We hope that the same adjectives will be attached to the name Garnier.\n\nTHE CLUB STAR\n\nA Monthly Bulletin published by Garnier Residential School Spanish, Ont.\n\nEDITORIAL\n\nIn 1928 and 1929 the first school paper appeared in Spanish. It was called the \"Wigwam\" and had a limited circulation. In 1945 \"The Club Star\" made its appearance in mimeograph form. It met with an enthusiastic reception from the boys, their parents, and friends of the school. The name Club Star was suggested by Henry Deere. The Club is a special privilege of the Senior boys. It is open nightly from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. There they can play bridge, checkers and other games; read the newspapers, listen to the radio, and discuss the weighty problems of the world. The idea of the paper originated from the Club and the paper mainly records the activities of the Senior boys.\n\nDuring the months of May and June the Grade Niners will have special classes in practical electricity, auto mechanics and welding. They will follow the courses taught in the Ontario Vocational Schools. There will be lectures and field work under the direction of Brother Lafontaine and two assistants. Grade Nine completed its Health course and are almost finished their course in Vocational Guidance. Under the capable guidance of Mr. Sinnon, B.A., the entrance class of seventeen is in their final lap. Grade Seven will prize and play. Brother Sinnon's theme song should be\u2014\"The yanks are coming.\"\n\nSPORTS\n\n2nd Wings Win League.\n\nPlayoffs Start\u2014\n\nRed Wing Seniors are the league winners in their division. In the great hockey game after game by large scores. They had a much harder time in the Spring schedule. This was due to a mistake in field generalship. Macs was shifted to guard, thus breaking up the best combination in the league. Maxie and Frankie.\nSPORTS (continued)\n\nThe playoffs started on April 21st. The lowly placed Maple Leafs knocked out the league leading Red Wings. The Black Hawks overcame a powerful Canadien squad. The Maple Leafs will play with the Hawks for the cup. The Leafs are erratic, play well in goals but have a good scoring combination. The Hawks are a strong skating team but weak in passing and shooting. After the upsets in the playoffs it would be difficult to call a winner.\n\nThe Teams:\n\nRed Wings\u2014F. Commanda, M. Mabibinijima, A. Cooper, C. Trudeau, A. Roy, H. Deere, D. McComber, S. Johnston.\n\nCanadiens\u2014H. Belleau, F. Jocko, E. Commanda, H. Contin, P. Deere, C. Benedict, R. Pitawanakat, J. Alec.\n\nBlack Hawks\u2014J. Neganigig, A. Neshkwe, A. Trudeau, E. Fox, J. Cameron, J. Fox, J. Pheasant, D. Wassegigis.\n\nMaple Leafs\u2014J. Fox, A. Commanda, A. Trudeau, R. Ryce, L. Solomon, J. Wemigwans, M. Esquimaux, B. Osawamik.\n\nIntermediates, Junior Playoffs have started. Black Hawks and Canadiens are the teams. Black Hawks won the first game 39-31.\n\nOur one and only Simon is puzzled. When you cross the field instead of taking the road, it is called a shortcut. He wants to know why the road route is not called a longcut.\n\nHIGH SCHOOL VIGNETTES\n\nBelleau, Harold\u2014Genial, good natured. He is the best goal keeper along the North Shore. Active in sports and captain of the senior Canadiens. Played the part of Achaz in the Easter play. A first class tailor and painter.\n\nCommanda Francis\u2014Quick, energetic, co-operative. Captain of the school hockey team. Captain of the Senior Red Wings who won the Touch Rugby, Hockey and Basketball leagues. Played the part of St. Peter in the Upper Room. Interested in Christian Island (or is it Golden Lake?)\n\nCooper Alfred\u2014Cool, calculating; leads his class, always managing to get over 90 in every examination. Played in the school hockey team, a member of Senior Red Wings. Took the part of St. John in the last play. First class tailor and painter. Other interests hard to define.\n\nJocko David\u2014Slow but sure, a very painstaking worker. Specializes in art and dramatics. He has played the roles of the Robber Chief in Ali Baba, the ghost of Jacob Marley in a Christmas Carol and Judas in the Upper Room. It is reported that he is interested in Cape Croker.\n\nThe chickens went on strike in protest against that dictator, Harvey Contin. He was trying to make them lay two eggs a day. Harvey has been removed and when last seen was making flower beds.\n\nPerhaps Peter Deere needs some hard work. The uniform that he wore in last May's production of the Pinocchio is now five sizes too small.\nTHE CLUB STAR\n\nGarnier Residential School\nSpanish, Ontario\n\nVol III No 10 OCTOBER, 1947\n\nGARNIER'S SCHOOL SPIRIT\n\nHere at Garnier, there's even doubt\ngreat Shamrock was as being one hun-\ndred per cent \"on the beam\".

They were empty, but they held the eyes of the whole village. Everyone had heard the news and children had gathered in front of the old stone church and rectory built high in the forest. The school bus watched the buses speed along in procession up the last mile of curving road. As the buses came behind the other, the crowd grew mushroom-like.\n\nBoys and girls for Spanish get ready! Girls girls in the first bus! Small girls and boys in the second bus! Older boys in the last! Without ado boys and girls took leave of parents, sisters, brothers and friends. Words were few, but feelings countless as the stuff. In each parent's heart waged a battle, the sense of loss was struggling fiercely against the hope for a happier future. That somber tone of the same struggle echoed the hearts of many a tired bus boy was evident from the deep hush that followed the closing of the school doors. However, the quickly changing countryside and a few of those magnificent views that swell the heart with Divine beauty soon healed the hearts that bled. Remember the wonderful view of bay and town just before we reached Manitowaning? Remember the strands we saw far below us at Ten Mile Point?\n\nPerhaps the loss isn't so bad if they give us free bus rides.\n\nTHE DEPARTMENT'S INTEREST IN THE \"CLUB STAR\"\n\nWe are always pleased to hear from those who are interested in the boys and work done at Garnier.

Perhaps we see a house, a man, an animal, a flower. We see so little, when in every picture there is a whole story, the background, the foreground, the main subject.\n\nWill you read the pictures in this little book? At first glance they are just pictures of boys and girls. Perhaps you are particularly interested because some of them are your boys and girls, perhaps you do not even know any of them. Whether you know them or not, they all have their story to tell you, and it is well worth the reading.\n\nRead these pictures slowly and carefully\u2014get the story from every face, then put the stories together and you will have one of the truly great stories of the Missionary Educational Enterprise of the Church and Government in Canada.\n\nSchool and Buildings from South Side of Assiniboine River\n\nThe school is situated on the north bank of the Assiniboine River just west of the City of Brandon, in the Province of Manitoba.\n\nThe first building was opened in September, 1885. The original register records 29 boys and 27 girls from six Indian Reserves in Manitoba in attendance.\n\nAs time went on it became necessary to enlarge and finally rebuild the school to provide accommodation for the steadily increasing number of students.\n\nIn 1929 it was felt that the building then in use had served its day and should be replaced. Plans were accordingly made to erect a modern fireproof structure on the same site. The new building was finished and opened in September, 1930. The registration this year is 175 with an average of 173 in residence.\nGrades III, IV, V, VI\n\nThe beginning came a little late for some of these, but, under interested, careful teachers and staff members, development has been rapid.\n\nIn these grades pupils become acquainted with the necessity for, each one in their turn, making a contribution in labor for the well-being of the whole school. The boys in work of general mixed farming, repairs to machinery, and minor repairs to the school buildings. The girls in the general and specific duties of home making, housekeeping, cooking, sewing.\n\nThis is the end of the grade school experience, the next step is Junior High School.\n\nBeginners to Grade II Senior\n\nYes, here is where we begin. For some quite early enough, for others two, three, five years later than it should have been. Parents! Guardians! Friends! What does this mean for the future of the race?\n\nHow many of these will, because of a late start, leave school before graduating?\nJunior High School Grades, VII, VIII, IX\n\nHere it is that we watch the unfolding and developing of the individual personality of the student. The exploring of many paths in his or her search for the right path.\n\nNo one reading these faces slowly and carefully could help but be enthusiastic about the possibility for their futures.\n\nAt the same time, what a challenge the opportunity to guide and help mould their characters, provides.\n\nCollegiate Institute\n\nThis is possibly the most difficult period in the whole of school life.\n\nHere the pupil meets the challenge to face difficulties, accept a more rigid self discipline, and prepare through further study for a vocation of service and the acceptance of the responsibilities of leadership in the various spheres of life.\nThe Class in Music and Piano\n\nTEACHER: MRS. J. A. MCNEILL\n\nAll our boys and girls love music. Some delight in melodies in the minor keys and cowboy songs with innumerable verses; others are happy when plucking the strings of a Spanish guitar.\n\nThese boys and girls are interested in learning to read music and play the piano.\n\nWill they become concert pianists? Perhaps, perhaps not. Whether they do or not, their own lives will have been enriched by the experience and constant practice, and they will be equipped to make an acceptable contribution to their home communities.\n\nGirls' Gymnastic Group\n\nMISS BETH THOMSON, Leader.\n\nDuring the past two years we have been carrying on a program of physical training under the Manitoba Provincial Government Physical Fitness Campaign. Two trained leaders from the Brandon Y.M.C.A. Leaders Corps instruct classes two evenings each week.\n\nThis group was selected to represent the school at the Brandon Gymcana. Each girl made her own costume in the school sewing room under the supervision of Miss L. Maguire.\nMy Dear Friends:\n\nIn July of this year I began my twenty-fifth year of service in Indian Mission work.\n\nLooking back over the years there is so much for which I am thankful to Almighty God. I also see much that I would have liked to accomplish remains undone.\n\nLooking into the future, in the light and with the experience of the past I am more than ever conscious of the immensely big task that lies ahead. Particularly am I impressed with the need for trained Indian leadership in the administrations of the Church, the Nursing and the Teaching professions.\n\nI am today very much concerned with the seemingly indifferent attitude of our young people; their apparent unwillingness to pay the price demanded in terms of self discipline, time, and application to study; so necessary for them to attain to the academic standards required for leadership both now and in the future.\n\nI am convinced that there is no easy way\u2014not any short cut to economic security for our people. Blind indeed we are to all the lessons to be found in the histories of the different races and nations that have peopled this earth, if we think that suddenly\u2014somehow tomorrow\u2014we shall achieve, without adequate preparation today for that tomorrow.\n\nThe Staff and Physical Directors\n\nLeft to Right: Front Row: Miss M.

In the words of our Latin motto \"Vincit Qui Patitur\" \"He conquers who endures\".\n\nBrandon Residential School offers to Indian boys and girls an opportunity for the training of Body, Mind and Spirit. Not an easy path to success, but a carefully balanced, disciplined course of training that will prepare any normal boy or girl to meet the experiences and accept the responsibilities of life with heads lifted and spirits eager and unafraid.\n\nThe general course to Grade IX offers an opportunity in addition to the units in the classrooms, for the boys to get a good working knowledge of general mixed farming, including the care and operation of tractors and power machinery.\n\nFor the girls, qualification as home makers through experience in housekeeping sewing and cooking in the respective departments of the school.\n\nSpecial grants from the Indian Affairs Branch together with certain scholarships provided from other sources make it possible for students with ambition and ability to proceed to matriculation and entrance to schools of nursing, provincial normal schools, and any of the professions through university graduation.\n\nFor the days which lie ahead, both Mrs. Strapp and I wish you God's richest blessing. To all our people we pass on a message given many years ago to the students of The Mount Elgin Residential School in Ontario by Rev. Dr. Arthur Barner, who was then superintendent of Indian Missions for the United Church. \"There is no defeat, except from within.\" In closing may I say to all young people, Where there is the will to do a task\u2014The way can always be found.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nOLIVER B.

The meeting was well attended by teachers and Inspectors, and was further supported by the presence of Col.B.F.Neary, Superintendent of Welfare and Training, Indian Affairs Branch. Teachers in convention are not usually very easily satisfied, but it should be said that Col.Neary succeeded in reassuring those present of the real concern of the Department in the education of the Indian people. The choice of school materials, texts and supplementary books etc., was encouraging. The most heartening feature was probably the presence of a man of Col.Neary's ability, training, experience and enthusiasm in such a position.\n\nThere have been other indications that appointments are being made with greater care than heretofore, particularly in the case of Indian Agents. The Department appears to be quite well aware that no program can succeed without a trained and effective personnel to put it into effect, especially in the field of education or administration. We rejoice that the number of these men who inspire confidence is increasing, yet we cannot quite shake off the apprehension that they are frequently prevented from carrying out their good intentions by the incomprehensible methods which governments seem to have of passing responsibility around until somewhere it is dropped and lost. It is highly frustrating to all concerned when capable men with excellent intentions are prevented from carrying out their programs by a highly involved and inefficient \"system\". Perhaps it is not too much to hope that one result of the parliamentary committee will be to make it possible for such men to meet a need promptly without fear of consequences.\n\nWAMPUM regrets the loss of Rev.G.C.Dickin as a neighbour and as a missionary to the Indians. He will not lose his interest in them, however, and will continue to assist us as business manager. Note his new address above. We wish him God's blessing in his new parish.\nNew Zealand Letter\nBy Dr. Daniel J. Smith\n\nThe following items have been taken from New Zealand papers:\n\n\"Rod Indian Nurses. Maternity training will be put to use among their own people. Two Rod Indian nurses, Miss Martha Soonias and Miss Dorcas Gladstone, who arrived in New Zealand from Canada to do a two years course in maternity nursing, commenced their training at St. Helen's Hospital, Wellington. When they have finished their training they will return to Canada to work among their own people. Miss Gladstone comes from Alberta and Miss Soonias from Saskatchewan. Both say that after the wide prairies of Canada they feel shut in by the hills in Wellington and the buildings seem so tiny. Used to central heating they feel the cold inside New Zealand buildings. When they went for a walk to look for the 'drug store', that famous American and Canadian institution round which the social life of young people in those countries revolves, they did not find one. Both girls are olive skinned with dark eyes and hair. They spoke English with a pleasant accent as well as their native dialects of the Crow and Blood tribes of Indians.\"\n\n\"Since 1931, Dr. Gordon started travelling scholarships in obstetrics, the funds for which were derived from a foundation established by the women of New Zealand, had been granted to outstanding graduates of the Medical School in Dunedin, but the conditions of service in the Dominion were not such as to attract back to this country men with high qualifications. Dr. Gordon said: 'From the viewpoint of the welfare in gynaecology and obstetrics of the women of New Zealand, who had endowed these scholarships, I cannot but deplore the policy which is depriving the Dominion of these men who should rightly be consultants in large provincial areas. As Director of Maternal Welfare I am greatly perturbed at the dearth of obstetrical nurses and sisters here, and I cannot help feeling that if our New Zealand policy had been progressive enough to have attracted back all these brilliant men to their own country, obstetrical nursing would have obtained new distinction and lustre, whereas now it is obviously the Cinderella of the services.'\"\n\n\"A relatively high infant mortality rate in Hamilton is pointed out by Dr. E. McKeal in a letter to the Herald. He says that in 1946 Hamilton showed the rate of infant mortality for non-Moros to be 42.3 deaths per 1000 children born alive.\"\n\nIntrigued and puzzled, I have pondered these things far into the night - many nights. Why does man always follow the rainbow seeking the pot of gold? Why does he look outside himself for that which can only be found within? Why does he look afar off for that which is to be found at home?\n\nThe Indian people have slumbered - many generations - but we are becoming aware. We are trying to rise. We shall rise. Let wisdom guide us in this time of awakening. Test all the avenues we will take.\n\n(continued next page)\nNEW ZEALAND LETTER\n(continued)\n\nSee that our people are not led by interests which will take advantage of this period of awakening to further political and commercial aims, or for personal gain.\n\nOnce we had wise and honourable leaders, and we were a great nation. If we had not been great people we would not have survived the chaos and degeneration of the long period of confusion through which we have been passing. Now we desire to build again - order out of chaos. Plan well and build slowly lest we make haste to follow the paths which are not fundamentally good for us. Weigh in the balance everything we would do. Consider all the things which have depleted us, and first eliminate those weaknesses. When we ourselves, individually and collectively, have awakened within to our full stature, then nothing can prevent us from reaching our goal.\n\nWhat is our goal - to become part of, and lost in, a confused, unhappy world? Are we prepared to follow the well-worn political, economical and spiritual paths of the day - man's world of today? There does it lead? Are these so-called freer people more happy, more hopeful than we? Or, do we aspire to rise above the fog to take our place in the sun - God's sun? Were not our people happy, prosperous, peaceful in that day when they lived according to the natural laws, and God's Wisdom as they interpreted it? They did not need another race to lead them.\n\nImmediately you say: but circumstances are different now. Of course they are, and will always be as time moves on. That continuous change has served to confuse us and bring about an attitude of hopelessness, but also therein lies hope, our hope, as out of change come better things.\n\nEverywhere we hear talk of the new era. What is a new era? Is it not a change in the understanding of the fundamentals of life, the attitude toward, and philosophy of life? Is it not a turning away from the errors of the past? Is it not a turning away from darkness into light? In every country the people cry aloud for this new era, yet everywhere is disharmony, destruction, death, and no hope is expressed. Yet, all the time there is light. In all things there is light, yet in all things man sees darkness. To those who are in light this may seem incredible, yet to God who is Light this is understood because in the beginning the end was known. To man there came darkness, yet there has always been light. Man could not see the light because he peered into darkness. To those who are trained to peer into darkness, sickness, death, the way is hard and discouraging and is ever joined to disappointment and failure, to the joylessness that darkness brings.\n\nIt is time to be joined to light, to turn our backs on darkness, to be joined to God's way - joy, health, life. Life is now in its awakening. As yet man sees not life but death. Yet even so, life is awakening and all things will know life. The present is but the result of the past, and we cannot alter the past, so let us look forward, let us look to a future that is open to those who will take it. It is not a time to follow, but a time to lead. (continued next page)\nNEW ZEALAND LETTER\n(concluded)\n\nTo prepare for leadership, individually or collectively, the laws are the same: self-discipline, self-development, self-training and above all, an all-consuming desire to do so. Long ago our leaders were developed from childhood for the day when they would be called upon to lead. That race which will lead its brother races must awaken, prepare, now for that day when the opening will present itself. It is evident that time is closing the present chapter; the age of exploitation of soil, animal, man. In as much as we stray from natural laws, to that degree we invite destruction, sickness, death. Man must reap that which he sows. An exploited, depleted nature must build again in all its branches. Leadership must go to those who are capable of grasping this understanding\u2014those who can turn aside from darkness into light.\n\n\"A Native Voice\"\n\nWe welcome this second letter from New Zealand. This time from \"A Native Voice\", Dr. Daniel J. Smith, Futaruru, New Zealand. We feel it would be worthwhile to include his letter as well, giving a brief biographical note.\n\n\"Dear Sir,\n\nEnclosed is an article which you are at liberty to use if you see fit. I am a Mohawk of the Six Nations, born at Brantford. Most of my folks live there. I have signed my letter 'Native Voice'.\n\nI have read Wampum with great interest for some time now. The high standard and voluminous wisdom contained in this periodical are certainly of the new era. The world is in desperate need of such wisdom and leaders. The trouble is that we are too easily misled by unscrupulous men. Consequently we miss the main issue.\n\nWe live in hope of a better world. For that better world of the future we must prepare now in all sincerity so that the hoped-for better world can become a reality. So that which we build now will be our future. If we can attune ourselves to Universal Intelligence and listen in to the source of all wisdom, then we can turn from darkness into light. Our ancestors, many years ago, knew the source of all wisdom and we were a great nation. Today we are lost in the fog of this mechanistic-materialistic world.\n\nThe Indians must be grateful for the interest that you and your associates have expressed through Wampum.\n\nSpiritually Yours,\nDaniel Smith.\"\nAnamie - Nagamon\n\n\"Sacred Song\"\n(23rd Psalm)\n\n1. Kitchi Manitou, Great White Eagle of my Dream! O little prayer fire\n   -- my tobacco!\n\n2. Lo! in the dusk do I repose upon the needles of the Signal Pine.\n\n3. He restores me to myself: He blazes a good trail.\n\n4. In the rapids, He steadies my canoe. I know no fear, O Mino Manitou.\n\n5. Lo! unto me-nah-ga, the island of the blueberry, I am guided, and\n   there, even where atchitamo, the red squirrel, hoards the butternut\n   beside the secret pool of the trout, namegoss, there do I make my fire,\n   by unfamiliar hills well hid. Nor have I drawn upon non-dah-min,\n   my little store of corn.\n\n6. Surely, on the Wings of the Eagle am I borne to the mountain. Hear\n   me! On the wapuu waters of waning day my white canoe will move,\n   gliding, soaring into the setting sun, to the land beyond tomorrow.\n\n   Ass-e-na! This my incense! I have spoken.\n\nAuthor's note:\nFor those who do not readily grasp the fidelity of this Ojibway\nrendition of the 23rd Psalm, the following will be helpful: (1) God is\nlike the sacred dream of his youth, his guiding light. It is a holy\nthought, only to be mentioned ceremonially, with prayer incense (tobacco).\n(2) The right trail was marked, often, by a signal pine. (3) His confid-\nence in himself is restored. (4) Obvious. (5) On his journey through\nstrange and dangerous territory, God has led him to food in abundance,\nand has found for him a hidden hollow where the smoke of his fire will\nnot be seen by anyone. He feels secure, doesn't have to draw upon his\nreservoir store of food. (6) In the main, this is obvious; the exclama-\ntion, Ass-e-na!, at the end, means \"Tobacco\", a little prayer cloud\nwhich is the equivalent of \"Amen\". But I doubt if the white man says\n\"Amen!\" with the same sense of absolute reverence with which the\nRedman made his prayer cloud.\n\nWallace Havelock Robb.\nAnglican Activities\n\nSaskatoon, Sask. A native ministry to serve Canada's Indian population was proposed at a meeting here of the General Synod of the Church of England. Expressing concern over present inability to minister adequately to the Dominion's Indians, delegates said lack of funds and personnel are the main handicaps. The situation was described as being particularly acute in British Columbia, but a problem elsewhere as well.\n\nArchdeacon H.C. Cooke, of the Moose Jaw diocese, suggested that Indian workers entering the missionary field could live among the Cree Indians for two or three winters, learn their language, and later do some translating. A Cree language catechism is greatly needed, he said. Some of the language problems could be solved if a native ministry were built up, it was pointed out. Such a move would also ease the present shortage of white missionaries.\n\nFrom United Church Observer, October 1st.\n\nDoctor Edward Ahnakew\n\nThe Annual Convocation of Emmanuel College was of special interest to Indian workers this year as one of our own \"old boys\" received the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Divinity.\n\nCanon Ahnakew is well known in East and West and many will rejoice that he has received this mark of distinction. He is a true son of Emmanuel for he received his first education in the old school in Prince Albert and in later years took his theological and arts training after the College was removed to the Campus of the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon....\n\nAfter completing High School, Edward Ahnakew secured his L.Th. from Emmanuel and his B.A. from the University. He also studied for a time in Wycliffe College, Toronto, and in the Medical School of the University of Alberta. He has spent his ministry in Saskatchewan, latterly at Fort la Corne, and for some years was travelling missionary of the Dioceses of Saskatoon and Saskatchewan. He has also edited the \"Cree Monthly Guide\" and took an active part in the preparation of the Cree dictionary. May his achievements many other Indian boys to study and advance to positions of honour and influence.\n\nFrom \"Topeee Tidings\", June, 1947.\n\nThe Beaver Magazine for September includes a story by Raymond Bell of the broadcasts of Rev. R.B. Horsefield. The opening paragraphs are quoted here.\n\n\"Wacheyak netotemek\": with this greeting brown ears are alerted in a score of little settlements in the northern wilderness within 150 miles in every direction from Flin Flon, Manitoba. It is the opening moment of the Cree language broadcast that goes out twice a week from radio station CFAR, Flin Flon.\n\nThe idea was hatched a year ago by Rev. R.B. Horsefield, for twenty years a missionary to the Indians in northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan, and one of the compilers of the Cree dictionary published by the Anglican Church in 1838.\nHe knew that Indians have a hard time understanding what is going on in the white man's world, and that few white men have the time or the imagination to explain things to them. So he sought the cooperation of the management of CFR, which was readily afforded him, and began to broadcast once a week a five-minute summary of the world news.\n\nThe response was immediate. Indians stopped him on the streets of Flin Flon to tell him how much they appreciated the service, and letters began to flow in, laboriously traced on all sorts of strange scraps of paper, in pencilled syllables, with the same message, and always asking for more. At the end of a month it was found necessary to have two broadcasts a week\u2014\"Teepee Tidings\" on Monday at 4.15 continuing the world survey, and \"Teepee Chitchat\" on Friday to answer the correspondents' letters and to pass on intimate bits of news, humorous anecdotes of the hunt and the trail, messages from patients in hospitals to their friends at home, and enquiries about the whereabouts of relatives from whom no word had been received in the ancestral lodges for many moons....\"\n\nPort Franks Flint Middens\n\nLondon Free Press, July 11, 1947.\n\nFirst projectile manufactory in Western Ontario, the key to Indian politics, is this site at Port Franks (on Lake Huron) explored by a University of Western Ontario excavating team led by Wilfred Jury. The diggings were made recently and reports are now being compiled. The Attawandrian Indians controlled the flint beds, at the point where the old bed of the river flows into Lake Huron. Indians carried the flints along the river bed to chipping beds... There they used granite-headed hammers to pound the flints into sharp tools and projectiles. Fine edges were procured by pounding with deer antlers. Through control of the flint beds, the Attawandrians managed to remain at peace with both the warlike Iroquois and their enemies, the Hurons and Algonquins. All three tribes needed the flints of the Attawandrians, and remained at peace with them to procure their supply. In 1640, the French, for this reason, nicknamed the Attawandrians the \"Neutrals\", a name which has stuck.\n\nMidland, August 1. What may develop into one of the most important archaeological finds in ancient Huronia has been made by Wilfred Jury, curator, museum of archaeology, University of Western Ontario, at Teanocostay. Once the bulwark of Huronia's southern frontier, the site is located overlooking the Coldwater River, near Hillsdale, about 13 miles from here. As a result of a number of test holes made over an area of about two acres, Mr. Jury found evidence to show that Teanocostay had been occupied both before and after the arrival of the French in the country of the Hurons, in the first half of the 17th century, and that it had been destroyed by fire....\nYouthful Indian Artist\n\nBy Humphrey Davy.\n\nJudith Phyllis Morgan, a pretty 17-year old Indian girl who up to seven months ago never held a paint brush in her hands, today is being acclaimed by B.C. professional artists as a painter of exceptional talent. The Indian girl is the first member of her race to win the $150 scholarship offered by the B.C. Indian Arts and Crafts Society at an exhibition held in the West Coast capital recently. The exhibition was open to all Indian school children in British Columbia.\n\nFive feet tall, with an attractive bronzed complexion, Judith is quiet and reserved; she has poise and is perfectly at ease with strangers, but is reluctant to talk about herself. She belongs to the proud Tsimsian tribe who inhabit the Skeena River in the B.C. mainland, about sixteen miles south of Prince Rupert. She has three sisters and eight brothers. Two of her brothers, Kelly and Raymond, fought in the war, the latter having been wounded in Sicily. Raymond, she says, was a skilled wood carver until he was seriously wounded in the arm when his tank blew up.\n\nJudith was brought up in accordance with the strict traditions of her people, a famous fighting tribe. She was initiated into the secret tribal societies and was taught native tribal ritual and dances at a very early age. But her parents found the educational facilities were inadequate on the Skeena Indian reserve, and sent her to Alberni four years ago to continue her studies. She has just completed her ninth year in school.\n\nWhen an art class was formed at the school last December under George Sinclair, a well-known Victoria painter, Judith from the outset showed exceptional talent. Within a few months she had outstripped her classmates, and was producing paintings fit for an art gallery. Even before her work came into public notice, people were offering her up to $100 for her works. She has refused the offers on the advice of her instructor. Judith says she got a surprise when informed she had won the scholarship; she had hoped to be able to hold her own against scores of competitors from all parts of the province. Now, greatly encouraged, she wants to continue with her work and to paint Indian scenes and the legends of her people.\n\nSince Judith has come into public notice, she has met some of the best professional painters in British Columbia. Her paintings, along with others, are on exhibition in Vancouver. Her teacher, George Sinclair, considered hard to please, described his pupil as \"a girl exceptionally talented and one who has shown great promise.\" He admits, however, at first he was afraid that his pupil's success might go to her head. \"But I had no reason to be afraid,\" he says, \"she is a level-headed girl and will go far with her work.\"\n\nArthur Mielke, one of the best known anthropologists in the province, and who has one of the largest private collections in Canada, said she was a \"discovery.\" \"West Coast Indians are artistically gifted,\" he commented. \"She is undoubtedly the forerunner of many others who are to follow.\"\n\n---------- From The Standard, Montreal, July 26, 1947.\nCommittee Recommendations\n\nOttawa. - Setting up of a separate Indian affairs department with civil service preference for Indians employed on its staff was recommended by the joint parliamentary committee on Indian affairs. The committee's report, tabled in the Commons by chairman Don Brown, called for widespread changes in present Indian administration. The report also recommended appointment of the committee again next session to consider \"long overdue\" amendments to the Indian Act.\n\nOther recommendations:\n\n1. An Indian claims commission be established to inquire into the terms of all Indian treaties.\n2. That enfranchisement be left for further consideration of the committee next year.\n3. That the Indian Affairs Branch take \"immediate steps\" to remove non-Indians from reservations consistent with the wishes of the band concerned.\n4. Decentralization of the Indian administration with regional directors for various parts of the Dominion.\n5. Widening the competition field, now confined to local districts, for appointments as agents.\n6. Abolition of the \"permanent quota\" for the Indian administration staff.\n7. Immediate adoption of a project to erect central hospitals in northern agencies with nursing sub-stations in remote areas.\n8. Statutory provision for the care of aged, infirm or blind Indians.\n\nThe committee proposed appointment of an Indian commissioner with deputy-ministerial rank as an alternative to establishment of a separate department. The commissioner would have two assistant commissioners, one of whom would be a Canadian of Indian descent.\n\nThe committee noted failure of the administration to act upon a recommendation made last year that more direct methods be used to collect land rentals on behalf of Indians. It urged that immediate steps be taken to remove this grievance.\n\nPending further decisions with regard to education, the committee urged that all educational matters, including the selection and appointment of teachers in Indian schools be placed under the direct and sole responsibility of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nG.L.\n\nFrom the Indian Missionary Record, July-August, 1947.\n\nDietary Ditties, No. 1.\n\nThe centipede said with a groan,\nWhen you've dozens of legs of your own\nAnd must keep them in step,\nThen you need lots of pep!\nSo eat all kinds of vegetables known.\n\nFrom Canada's Health and Welfare, May, 1947.\nIndian Achievement Medal\n\nDr. L.

The presentation of the medal by Whitney Eli Powless, Oneida, president of the Council Fire was the highlight of a colourful program of Indian dance and song, and a \"fashion show\" of tribal costumes by Indian women. Chiblabaos, outstanding Chippewa singer, came from Minneapolis for the occasion.\n\nDr. Hill is one of the only two Indian women physicians in the country, and she was awarded the medal for her long record of humanitarian service to her people, and for unusual personal achievement.\n\nDr. Hill is the fifth woman, and the first Mohawk, to receive the Indian Achievement Medal since its inauguration in 1933 at a Century of Progress.\n\nThe Indian Day program took the form of a benefit for Navajo Indian relief.\n\n---\n\nIndian Council Fire, 30 West Washington St., Chicago 2, Ill., have sent an announcement of a new and revised edition of \"Indians of Today,\" compiled and edited by Marion E.

Paul Martin announced today.\n\nConfirmed in the post of director in which he has acted since 1940 is Dr. P.E. Moore of Ottawa. Dr. O.R.A. Leroux, for the past 11 years with the Royal Army Medical Corps, has been appointed for the Quebec region and for the Eastern Arctic area. Dr. H.W. Lewis of Ottawa, since 1931 in Indian medical work in the northern parts of Alberta and Saskatchewan (Dr. Lewis was making his second trip to the Arctic, his first in his new post, on the \"Nascopie\" wrecked on Tuesday off Baffin Island).\n\nExpansion of the health services to the Indians and Eskimos is part of a long range plan to meet the health and welfare needs of a widely-scattered and nomadic group, Mr. Martin said. The program, which is being put into effect, was first outlined in detail in 1946 to the special joint committee appointed to examine the Indian Act. Appointment of regional superintendents is expected to relieve the headquarters staff of detail work and to give better, on-the-spot service.\n\nDr. Moore entered Indian health work in 1931, immediately after graduation from the University of Manitoba, and for seven years was medical superintendent of the Fisher River Indian Agency in Manitoba. He came to Ottawa in 1938 as assistant superintendent of medical services in the Indian affairs branch, Department of Mines and Resources, and since 1940 has been acting head of the medical work. From 1940 to 1945 he was medical advisor on Eskimo health to the Bureau of the Northwest Territories and Yukon Affairs. He served in the Royal Air Force in the first World War.\n\nDr. Leroux, a graduate of the University of Ottawa and the University of Montreal, practiced at Grenville, Quebec, until 1935 when he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps. He served in the British Isles, India, Burma, British Honduras and various parts of the West Indies before being discharged this year with the rank of lieutenant-colonel.\n\nA graduate in medicine from the University of Manitoba and in public health from the University of London, Dr. Lewis was in private practice in Winnipeg until 1928. After three years as superintendent of the Saskatoon City Hospital, he entered Indian Medical work at Fort Chipewyan, later becoming medical superintendent for northern Saskatchewan with headquarters at Battleford. He has served a total of nine years in the Canadian medical corps in the two world wars.\n\nOfficial Press Release, Dept. of National Health and Welfare.\nCOMMUNICATIONS\n\nFrom Vancouver,-\n\n\"I have enjoyed reading your publication and enclose 50\u00a2 for renewal.\n\n\"Of much interest to me is the poetic representation of 'A Summer Night' composed by a young girl of the 10th grade, Mount Elgin.

Raley, D.D.\n\n--------\n\nFrom Toadlena Mission, New Mexico,-\n\nA request has reached the editor's desk for an exchange of publications with 'The Christian Indian', a monthly printed 8-page paper 'For Christian Indians and their Friends'. Publication address is, Gallup, New Mexico, P.O. Box 949, 200 West Coal Ave.\n\nTo Mr. J.C. Robes, Missionary of the Christian Reformed Church among the Navajo Indians, we express our thanks for this invitation, and welcome such an exchange of news with our fellow workers in New Mexico. The subscription rate for the above is 60\u00a2 per year.\n\n--------\n\nThe Native Voice, 509, 16 East Hastings St., Vancouver, B.C. This young publication of the Native Brotherhood of B.C. has grown rapidly and is a most interesting and informative paper. It merits wide support from the Indian people.\n\nThe Totem Pole, Bulletin of the Aboriginal Research Club, Detroit, continues to provide interesting materials on the history of the Indian people. We are honoured that they have used numerous articles from WAFTU from time to time.\n\nOut of the Tepee, a teen age study book on the Church's work among the Indians, has recently been published jointly by the Committee on Missionary Education and the Literature Department, Woman's Missionary Society of the United Church of Canada, 299 Queen St., West, Toronto. It combines in an interesting manner information and illustrations of the work being done, with suggested projects for teen-age programs. Indian workers will welcome this booklet, which is, we hope, but the first of several on the subject.\n\nFirst Canadians, a booklet on the Indians and Eskimos of Canada, has been published by the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada (604 Jarvis St., Toronto). It provides a well-illustrated story of the Church's work, and a list of their workers in the various types of work. Together with their publication \"Tepee Tidings\", this will provide valuable information on the Indian missionary work in Canada.\nBig White Owl, Toronto writes to tell of a growing demand for a dramatic presentation entitled \"Black Trail,\" in which he takes a leading part, and which seeks to portray the urgent need for a greater understanding of the Indians' needs for justice and friendship. Mr. Jasper Hill, as he is known in Toronto, has also been introduced in the work of the Red Cross, and the possibility of enlisting their help in the care of the Indian people. In this connection he reports that a stimulus ally has been found in Magistrate D.R. Tucker of Cochrane, Ontario. Mr. Tucker has been active in presenting the needs of the Indians of the James Bay area. All such champions of the Indians have together brought the matter forcefully before the mind of the Canadian people and will in the near future, we believe, lead to greater medical attention for those needy people. It would seem certain that many changes for the better are being made. In the face of severe conditions, it will seem too slow in coming. Nevertheless, a better day is dawning. We are indebted to all those who have fearlessly presented the Indians' cause.\n\nBrandon Indian Residential School, Manitoba, under the principalship of Rev. O.J. Stripp, has recently prepared a splendid little booklet on the life and work of the school. Perhaps we can share a part of the principal's message:\n\n\"...Particularly am I impressed with the need for trained Indian leadership in the ministrations of the Church, the Nursing and the Teaching professions.\n\n\"I am today very much concerned with the seemingly indifferent attitude of our young people; their apparent unwillingness to pay the price demanded in terms of self-discipline, time and application to study, so necessary for them to attain to the academic standards required for leadership both now and in the future.\n\n\"I am convinced that there is no easy way - not any short cut to economic security for our people. Blind indeed are we to all the lessons to be found in the histories of the different races and nations that have peopled this earth, if we think that suddenly - somehow tomorrow - we shall achieve, without adequate preparation today for that tomorrow.\n\n\"The climb to the heights of success is a slow, laborious, even at times dangerous task but success rewards the climber with a consciousness of the wonder, strength and beauty of God's world.

The new Anglican camp on Thetis Island under the auspices of the Diocese of British Columbia, will be an important link in vital work among young people.\n\nA score of white-sarafine clergy trod in stately procession through the woods, carrying the Litany led by Rev. F. Pike of Victoria. The scarlet and purple robes of the senior clergy made a splash of color before the laity bringing up the rear. Residents of the island were well-represented and a number of visitors came from Vancouver Island.\n\nBishop's Blessing\n\nCommencing at the main building, home of the late Major Henry George, the ceremony included Bishop H. E. Selton on the work of the camp. Separate benedictions were pronounced on the dining hall, the sleeping huts and the playing field, all recent additions to the campsite.\n\nThe ceremony concluded with the unfurling of the flag of St. George by Captain C. E. Gibson of Victoria. Brilliant sunshine prevailed during tea on the lawn, served by members of the staff. Host was Rev. Canon M. E. Coleman, chairman of the camp committee.\n\nAmid Island Beauty\n\nMonths of work by this committee have ensured safe and happy camping amidst the natural beauty of one of the loveliest of the Gulf islands. The outdoor chapel, still \"in the making,\" is already a quiet place of inspiration.\nA Chat with the Editor\n\nChart and compass come from thee, Jesus, Saviour, pilot me.\n\nDOMINION\n\nIt is a wise provision that our Canadian Prayer Book contains a form of service \"For Dominion Day and other occasions of National Thanksgiving.\" It might however, make for the more general use of the service if it contained the direction for its use of the Sunday preceding the following July 1st. Such a tragedy as Dominion Day became nothing more than a national holiday where there can be few countries which have greater cause to be thankful to God. In a world in which the grim specters of want and famine confront millions we live in the age of plenty. If we add to our present blessings the wealth of untapped resources and the potential riches in areas into which exploration is only now pushing, we have a picture of national wealth which can have few parallels.\n\nBut privilege is always accompanied by responsibility and our thankfulness should be coupled with a rededication of ourselves to Him who has been forced into the corner of our feet in so large a room\". \"A mari usque ad mare\" stands as our motto, but let us not forget the Psalm from which our name came and the vision of \"Dominion\" which the Psalmist saw. The elements of true greatness lie in the very soul of man and can only be quickened by the sense of God's Let us make Dominion Day the occasion to reaffirm the Dominion of Christ in our souls and in our lives\u2014So that loving Thee above all things, we may fulfill Thy gracious purpose in this land.\n\nOUR GIRLS AND BOYS\n\nSermon for the Netherwood School Closing Service at St. Paul's Church, Rothesay, N.B., on June 8, 1947, by Sydenham B. Lindsay, Rector of the Church of the Advent, Westmount, Que.\n\nOur Lord Jesus Christ says to us: \"I am the Vine; ye are the branches.\"\u2014St. John XV: 5.\n\nThere is no one thing in the world more valuable than a girl or boy. But the saddest spectacle possible today is that many girls and boys at the present day, is that they have little or no religion. It is certainly not their fault. These girls and boys have well-meaning parents who believe that their bodies are nourished with a balanced diet; but by strange inconsistency allow them to grow up without practically no spiritual diet. To have a child without definite religion is leaving out the most important spiritual vitamin. Religion is the meat of the soul; Christ Himself said so. Speaking of His friends He declared: \"My meat is to do the will of Him that sent Me, and to accomplish His work.\" (John iv: 34) Many parents are challenged on this point, they become in some cases an attitude, that is hardly believable. \"Why don't you give your child some religion?\" we ask. \"O if she wants any religion, she can have it, if she wants to go to Church, it's up to her. When she grows up, it will be time enough for her to decide how she wishes to live. We as well say about a child: \"If she wants a balanced diet of milk and meat and vegetables and fruit, she can have it; but if she prefers a diet of candy and ice cream, it's up to her. She can decide about her own diet, when she grows up\". But by the time she grows up, it may be too late: if she has been feeding upon the wrong kind of food, taking some essential calories and nutrients, she will have developed an unhealthy puny body, and when she has grown up, it is too late to cure the damage. It is just as foolish and just as harmful to bring up a child without any religion, as to bring her up without proper food. No girl can be or do her best without religion. Religion gives moral fibre and spiritual muscle.\n\nSpiritual Health\n\nIf you ask what I mean by religion, I would reply: UNION WITH CHRIST. To be united with Jesus Christ is to be in a state of salvation; and salvation is nothing else than spiritual health. Christ Himself summed up the whole thing in those eight words, which I chose for our text: \"I am the Vine; you are the branches. Just as a branch is nourished and fed and developed by the life of the vine, so we Christians derive everything we need spiritually by being united with Christ. By union with Him we absorb the spiritual power we need, we become inoculated with a sense of the Divine presence and the grace of God has plenty of opportunity to permeate our souls. By union with Christ the Holy Spirit guides us in difficulty and uncertainty, and makes us strong to do what we should. Union with Christ gives reality and effect to all experiences of the Christian life in prayer and worship, in the use of the Bible, in Sacraments, Christ strengthens and nourishes the Divine life in our own souls. Union with Him sanctifies our relationships one with another, our intercourse, and our friendships. There is nothing to fear in the fellowship of good friends if they have the Spirit of Christ in their hearts.\n\nNot only is union with Christ essential, if we are going to be able to do anything but that is, we cannot get along without Christ. Individuals need Him, families need Him, nations need Him, the whole world needs Him. Christ is the only Saviour of the world, and apart from Him we cannot advance very far, we cannot achieve very much. Not long ago the representatives of the United Nations were gathered together at Moscow, for weeks; and then they disbanded after accomplishing so little. Why? They were sincere, they were all anxious to draw up a wise and just treaty, but they failed. I don't like to criticize or condemn, but I would point out, that not once did we read of these representatives kneeling down at their meetings and asking the Holy Spirit to show them what to do. We cannot get along without God; God is our greatest need. Just as the Vine provides the branches, the Vine abideth in Me, and I in Him, the sameareth much fruit: for apart from Me you can do nothing. A great statement! David (Psalm 28:1) has said that the world must make its choice between two alternatives: Christ or chaos.\n\nSometimes you hear a person say: \"I know a man, who has given up going to Church and saying his prayers, and yet he is leading a good useful life. Yes; I know a man, whose branch may be cut off from a vine, and go on living for a while; its foliage may keep on growing, and it may even produce fruit. The explanation is that the branch has put into itself the life and fruitfulness of the vine, which it retains for some time. But how long can a branch go on like this before it withers away? And how long can a man, who cuts himself off from Christ, go on keeping to Christian ideals and principles, before he falters and weakens? It is given this advice: Any one who is leading a good life apart from Christ, would lead an even better life, if he were united with Christ. We must be united with Him, if we are going to be and do our best.\n\nThe Solution\n\nIn Christ you can find the answer to all questions, and the solution of all problems. There is one question, which everybody must answer. Many of you girls have undoubtedly answered it already, but some have not. The question is: man is. What are you going to do with your life? What is your vocation? In answering this question, put aside all thought of money and worldly advantage, and ask Christ to show you to what state of life He is calling you. Only by accepting God's vocation for you can you be really successful, making a good mark for yourself, your family, and adding lustre to the good name of your school and your country. And now it is time again for me to say, I must say how greatly I appreciate being asked to preach to you on this important occasion; it is certainly a privilege and a pleasure. In conclusion, let me say a special word to the girls of Netherwood,\u2014in particular to those who are graduating, and yet to the entire school without exception. Most of you I don't know, but I know I am sure you are all like the ones I do know\u2014full of life, full of charm, eager to do things. Remember there is no one thing in the world more valuable than a girl or boy, but if you are going to be your best, you must be united with Christ. You need Christ, and Christ needs you. To each one of you I say, in the blessed name of Christ, that you may be blessed, that you may be God bless your mind, that you may do your work well, God bless your feet, that you may see only God, God bless your lips, that you may have His Word, God bless your lips, that you may spread His message, God bless your hands, that you may always walk in the right path, God bless your feet, that you may walk in the right path. And may you always live for the Glory of God and the good of mankind\u2014in Simplicity, in Sincerity, and in Service.\n\nNoted Physician Becomes Missionary\n\nPhiladelphia, Pa. \u2014 Dr. Henry P. Brown, Jr., of Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, has given up his work here and is on his way to Kunming, China to serve as a medical missionary, working with Bishop Quentin Huang, of the Chinese branch of the Anglican Church.\n\nDr. Brown has been Professor of Surgery at the University of Pennsylvania and chief surgeon at both Pennsylvania and Presbyterian Hospitals, Philadelphia. He took with him to China his own medical library and surgical instruments, with a large supply of drugs needed in his work. Bishop Huang commented: \"It is a great miracle; we have been very much touched, encouraged and inspired by his spirit of sacrifice.\"\n\nCANADIAN CHURCHMAN, JULY 3, 1947\nGOD AND HUMAN ILLS\n\nIt is a queer quirk of human nature which puts all the blame on God when things go wrong and takes all the credit to itself when things go right. It is a strange insensibility for man to say \"If God only a little make Him responsible for human ills; when during all the sunny days of life he acted as if God didn't exist; or to teach the conclusion that because human life is chaotic, therefore there is no God.\n\nIs it not odd that, with all the boasted intellectual development of the human race, the struggle does not persist? Is it a problem as old as the race, the problem of human suffering which fastens itself not only upon the obviously wicked but also upon the presumably righteous and innocent. It is the problem which righteous Job had to face. The reluctance of men to face up to the real issue even in this twentieth century of enlightenment reveals the fact that spiritually the human race is still in its childhood.\n\nWe are still refusing to understand God's character and purpose. We still side-step the issue and refuse to take the long view of life, to see that with God one day is as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day.\n\n\"The Lord is no God\" says a woman whose parents have all but reached fourscore years, years of singular happiness and freedom from the ills which beset mankind, but who now are stricken, one physically, the other mentally. \"I don't believe anymore. They lived good lives. Why should they not be allowed another five years to enjoy the fruits of their labours?\"\n\nThat is an unreasonable and impossible attitude, and yet in the variety of ways in which the problem affects us\u2014war, depression, sickness, accident\u2014it is fairly generally held. It is a denial of the interdependence of all the beings with each other. It is a belief in individual responsibility alone, an assumption that some are so virtuous as to merit immunity from suffering. It is the reducing of man to the status of an automation which is the very thing that God refuses to do.\n\nGod has created in the dignity of man. He made him His noblest creature, but in the very nature of things \"male\" has no meaning apart from the possibility of being ignoble. God so loved man that He made him free\u2014free to choose Him or not to choose Him, free to do right or not-right. Without that provision freedom would not be true freedom. God may not love Him, but He has given him free will, for that is the only liberty in which love can be real and service perfect freedom. In exercising that free will mankind sometimes rises to great heights of noble living, sometimes he sinks to ignoble acts which re-act upon himself and others and result in suffering and sorrow. But God does not give up special grace; but if we have faith in God we soon come to see that sense of mind which understands that there is a balance of things which adjusts itself sooner or later, and that suffering, rightly accepted, bears rich fruit in the moulding of character. Despite all the problems it raises, it is better to be free than to bound unwillingly even to God. That is God's plan.\n\nA few years ago Bishop Walter Carey wrote a little book entitled \"Thinking Straight about this War\". He gave a very lucid illustration of this problem of suffering and free will. He asked us to imagine a perfect human father. His son grows up with complete freedom, an all-clearance and a latchkey. He tells him what the risks are. After that the boy is always free to remember his father's advice and example, and if he does so he will have no inflicted punishment. But if he uses the latchkey to come in at three in the morning after drinking, then he will be punished. He has purchased himself with degradation, and his father may also be caught in the meshes of evil which others bring upon him. May be knocked down by a drunken motorist. And this is because the world is one. We are interlocked, intertwined. A man runs away with somebody else's wife. What does that mean? \"It's a man's life, isn't it?\" But does the devil has it got to do with anyone else? That is just where the devil comes in. It affects a deserted husband and a deserted wife and perhaps deserted children. The world is affected, downwards.\n\nThe \"perfect\" earthly father does with his son what God has done with all His children. If all goes well He rejoices and helps. If anything goes wrong, He grieves but still loves and is always ready to build up, but until repentance comes he can do nothing else.\n\nThis stubborn refusal to understand God's relation to man is responsible for the various ills related to the problem\u2014fallenness, apostasies, wholesale. It is the root cause of present day unrest. It adds greatly to the very ills against which men rebel. It is responsible for the indifference to religion which betrays the frustration besetting men's minds. Honest thinking which courageously faces the issue is not only the solution of the problem itself, but the only way to secure that serenity of life which every man craves.\u2014An editorial contributed by Canon C. A. Moulton, Church of St. Simon-the-Apostle, Toronto.\n\nTHE QUIET HOURS\n\nCHRIST'S GREAT WORDS, \"WATCH\"\n\nAmong the great words of Christ there is none in which our relation to Him is revealed more intimately than the word, \"Watch\". In only one passage in the Gospels does He refer explicitly to His soul, His inmost being. It is in the most tense moment of his recorded experiences where He says \"my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death, tarry ye here and watch\". The watching He refers to is that the watching of the unconscious, the sleeping, the faltering of life. Not is it the curious peering of the \"crystal gazer\" who seeks to find out what is coming to pass. It is (1) The watching of the Sentinel; or The Shepherd o'er his flock; or The servant at his work. It has in view the warding off, of an enemy; or fidelity to duty. There is the original language which suggests \"keeping awake\". In Christ's world the night was divided into \"watchings\" measured by the times when Sentries were changed. St. Paul has the idea in mind when he bids us in the presence of the principalities and powers of darkness to put on the whole armour of soul and body, to stand in the full assurance of faith, and to be in business alert to seize every opportunity, and to do the most of it. The tragic element here is that we fall asleep when the chance to do something serviceable presents itself. The door closes and the opportunity is gone. \"But once we pass this way... the door opens... charity is there which was not there before. It is the invitation. It is Christ searching the horizon for a sail. It is the lover waiting for the beloved one. Tragedy here may rise to a higher pitch. \"My beloved had withdrawn himself and was gone\", \"How often would I have gathered you, and ye would not\". \"Who holds a stake in the doomed stock\". It is the hunter here whose faithful watcher is faithful to his watching come in the highest moments of Christian experience, where Christ is all and no other. \"Whom have I in heaven but Thee and there is none upon earth that I desire in comparison of Thee\".\n\nAll this is the heart of Christian experiences. It is therefore at the heart of Christianity. It points to the Church's great opportunity. Only in the life of the Church do such experiences be hoped for and developed. Then they emerge into being; without them the world perishes.\u2014W.C.C.\n\nOUR WORLD\u2014Whither Bound?\n\nThe miracles of modern science have reduced our world to the dimensions of our neighbourhoods. Within that neighbourhood a surging complexity of social and industrial forces which constitute and harmonious principle of reconciliation must be found, or else\u2014? Nothing less than a world-wide explosion is the only alternative. And with the forces of atomic power increasingly at human disposal, explosion is not too strong a word to describe the possibility in one direction.\n\nOne point is clear enough. No nation in such a world as ours can behave as though it were independent of, or unrelated to, the universal issue. We ought to have learned that lesson already, those of us who have lived through two \"World Wars\". It was a common theme in my lectures in the last war that the first explosion was the lawless ambition of a megalomaniac that plunged us into the second, more widespread, convulsive, catastrophe. That, no doubt, is an over-simplification of the issue, but there is enough truth in it to encourage us to think seriously, and it is as certain as anything on earth can be that if, instead of having our interests and fate in the hands of all the facts and all the warnings, the upshot will be more complete, more universal, more convulsive, and more destructive than anything we have yet experienced; perhaps than anything we can anticipate or imagine.\n\nWe must believe that the only inference to be drawn from the unmistakable facts and tendencies is that it is dark and despairing in the extreme. And when we learn the lessons provided by history, contemporary international affairs, and a realist estimate of human nature, it is sheer madness to disregard and ignore the ground for pessimism. Christians may well ask 'Has God so completely forsaken the World He made and redeemed?' And if not, \"Whither bound, this one World?\"\u2014T. W.

Ward\n\nA great deal could be said about the choice of music in services of radio worship. If the music is to get across to the congregation, as it must if it is to be of any real value, several things must be remembered. First, in radio worship the congregation, in effect, have no books. If in church with all the words before them they like familiar hymns, surely there is much to be said that they will plead for these in the home. Not only are they without books but they are an interdenominational group. They do not have more truly, about two-thirds of the countless little units that listen will be of another denomination than that of the broadcasting church. It will be wise then to choose hymns that are used in common by the various denominations.\n\nWhen we say they have no books this is not quite all true. Some and their nearest souls do take out their hymn books and actually sing with the broadcasting congregation. For them, hymn numbers are not sufficient. They probably have the same book. But the first words of the hymn mean a great deal. They ought not to be left to guess at them when the choir begins to sing. The announcement of the words would not help them find their place but gives them the feeling of belonging to the worshipping group. It might be a distinct gain if from time to time a complete verse might be read on the microphone in this way.\n\nSay the Prayers\n\nIt has been the experience of the writer that immersed prayers are more musical and on a microphone than they do in church. Even in a sung service therefore it may be wise to sing the choir parts and say the actor prayers.\n\nWhen we come to anthems, we enter into the field of the musical specialist here and there will be little agreement. One or two things though may be said. If the anthem is to be considered mainly as a sort of tone poem, there is little need for discussion. That kind of an anthem may have its value for an electric gramophone, but most anthems are heard in some sense as a musical commentary on a text. They are meant to add to the feeling of worship and to carry through a certain message or something more than just music to the hearer. In listening to a great many services one is given the impression that most choirmasters sacrifice the message for a striving after quality of tone. Very rarely do we hear a choir whose broadcast words are clear. Except in broadcasts of a recital type, we wonder why choirs do not perform an anthem in radio worship. One cannot help but feel that it would be a distinct gain could the words be clearly expressed and transmitted to the hearer.\n\nEnunciation\n\nTwo things at any rate might help here. First, there is a certain type of singing in which the parts play against each other and in which the words are considerably mixed. It may be wise not to use this type more than necessary. Certainly the words must be more clearly heard when all the voices carry them alike across the stage.\n\nSecondly, in listening to, in fact and broadcast it will be found that some choirs will articulate clearly in patches and in other places give the words so indistinctly as to be hardly distinguishable. This seems to be due partly to lack of enunciation and preparation, and partly to the degree of familiarity with either the words or music. The average choir seems to be incapable of enunciating both words and music when either one is not fairly familiar. In broadcasting one cannot help but feel that there would be a distinct gain if the choirs could give the hymns or the anthems sufficiently in advance and could be induced in some way to become so thoroughly familiar with the words, or the music, or both, that they could naturally find it easy to speak their parts. Were they taking part in a play this would be demanded of them or they could not go on the stage. They are the medium of worship and through them only can the words of the hymns and psalms and anthems, which constitute about half the service, be carried to the ears of the listeners. They are not asked to go on the stage in this way, without their books but a reasonable familiarity with what they are doing would greatly help.\n\nThe Essential Thing\n\nHaving said this, our final essential is often lost sight of in our radio services. Worship is the essential thing. That is what we are in church for. It is what we are seeking to foster and transmit, the whole feeling and spirit of worship into the homes of our listening people in such a way that they will not only listen but worship. The only instrument we have for doing this in broadcasting is the quality of the human voice. Through the voice alone can we hope to transmit the spirit for which we meet.\n\nThe choir to a great extent leads this worship. Unless they themselves worship, a great part of the meaning of the broadcast is lost. We must see that whichever we are perfectly aware that the singing is good and the reading done perfectly so far as musical or voice techniques is concerned, but we find our hearts touched and feeling no warmth of heart that draws us into a friendly spiritual circle. Maybe it is asking a great deal but it might be a good thing for churches occasionally to discuss what the purpose of a choir is, what it is in the general picture of that which we do in church on Sunday and try to send out something that is particularly needed in the shorter services that we broadcast though, which may be broadcast from churches, are virtually studio services. In these, there is no congregation present and it is easy till it is terribly easy, for the whole group both choir and speaker to let the microphone take the place of God.\n\nIn all our broadcasting activities we shall see that a great ministry, if not far greater ministry than any of us have ever dreamed of before the radio came into play. It is a ministry that brings great rewards but that also holds a great responsibility and has in it the demand for a peculiar and intimate approach which can only be attained by earnest thought. It is as a side thought thought that very short articles have been written.\n\nBanker Enters Ministry\n\nPhiladelphia, Pa. \u2014 The Rev. Vernon Mattingly, new pastor of the Episcopal Church of St. John the Evangelist, Philadelphia, was a business man, associated with the trust department of a bank for seventeen years, prior to entering the ministry.\n\nMen must be decided on what they will not do, and then they are able to act with vigour in what they ought to do.\u2014Menchus.\n\nCANADIAN CHURCHMAN, JULY 5, 1947\nChurch News\n\nOne holy Church, one army strong,\nOne steadfast high intent.\n\nTwelve Families United\n\nThe Holy Church of St. James, Port Colborne, Ontario, was filled with worshippers for the confirmation service, when twenty-nine members sincere, repentant and with faith, received the sacrament of the laying-on-of-hands by the Rt. Rev. L. W. J. Broughall, D.D., Bishop of Niagara. The Rector, the Rev. H. G. L. Baugh, B.D., presented the candidates most of whom were adults and ten of whom had been baptized at the usual evening service two weeks before. At this confirmation service twelve families were united in their church affiliations while before had been divided, nine wives and three husbands now became Anglicans. The Rev. Col. Sherring, M.A., of the Cathedral, assisted as Bishop's chaplain and Mr. Robert Hearne, parishioner lay-reader, read the Scripture lessons.\n\nDiocese of Quebec\n\nThe Very Rev. A. H. Crowfoot and Mrs. Crowfoot have left for England where they will be on holiday for a month.\n\nThe Rev. Canon Hughes has arrived in Quebec from England and will be in residence at the Deanery and in charge of services at the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity during the Dean's absence.\n\nA memorial tablet of buff-coloured stone was unveiled last Sunday at St. Matthew's Church, Quebec, on Trinity Sunday in memory of the late Ven. Archdeacon Frederick George Scott who for nearly fifty years ministered as a priest in that parish.\n\nSir Richard Turner, V.C., in unveiling the tablet, paid tribute to the outstanding work of \"Canon\" Scott at Chatham in the Great War of 1914-1918. The Rev. Professor Elton Scott was celebrant at the Choral Eucharist while the Rector of St. Matthew's dedicated the tablet which is inscribed on the text: \"Thine eyes shall see the King in His Beauty\". This text may have been the inspiration for the closing line of the Archdeacon's hymn \"Cast thy cares on Me\" which forms the inscription at the bottom of the Memorial Tablet: \"Thine eyes shall see Him and be satisfied\".\n\nThe Rev. R. L. Gourley (Valcartier) has been appointed priest in charge of Comeau Bay and will take up his work there on September 1st. Summer services at Comeau Bay will be in charge of the Rev.

Belford, Chaplain of Ashbury College, Ottawa, will minister to the Frampton-Beauce Mission during the summer months.\n\nThe Rev. Desmond C. Hunt has been appointed Port Chaplain for the Port of Quebec.\n\nR.C. Veneration of Mary Assailed\n\nRev. Alford Abraham, rector of the Church of St. Andrew Memorial, said in a sermon at London, Ontario, the veneration of the Virgin Mary at the Roman Catholic Marian Congress in Ottawa cannot be condoned by Anglicans if they \"would be true to the Scripture and their church.\"\n\n\"However broad-minded and charitable they want to be,\" he said, \"Anglicans cannot condone in any way, shape or form anything that vies with the fact that Christ is the only Mediator. There is no other name.\"\n\nMr. Abraham charged that \"more and more the distinctive feature of Roman Catholicism is the cult of the Virgin Mary.\" He quoted the passage from the truth of the life,\" from John 14, verses five and six, and said it was plain that \"no man cometh unto the Father but by me.\"\n\n\"Let it be proclaimed,\" he added, \"from every Anglican pulpit that the mediatorial office of Christ, our great high priest, must not be compromised through the use of human names in religious invocation.\"\n\nBitterness Caused\n\n\"Let me stress however that I do not believe in bitter denunciation,\" he said. \"It causes only bitterness and spreads bigotry. Our aim is to elicit truth and in our search we do not advocate temporizing or evasion because some people may not like what we say.\n\n\"I have no patience with critics who say this Congress should be stopped, nor with those who say that lumber should not be used for the purpose of the Congress. It has been reported that it has been heard about the use of lumber for construction of stands for the Marian Congress. Congress officials have said, however, that the lumber could be used again for ordinary purposes without damage.\"\n\nAt the Opening of Toronto Synod\n\nHead of the procession from St. James' Parish Hall to the Cathedral is shown. Behind the cross-bearer are Provost R. S. K. Seeley of Trinity College, and James Nicholson, veteran lay secretary, who retires this year after 30 consecutive years in office.\n\nRefresher Course For Clergy\n\nA Refresher Course for Clergy is planned for the first week in September at Quebec Lodge, North Hatley.

Dr. Gordon Siscoe, General Secretary of the United Church of Canada, has been asked to speak on proposals for a common ministry from the point of view of the United Church.\n\nEverett Morgan said it: \"The Christian who fights and runs away will fight the same battle another day!\"\nQu'Appelle Diocesan W.A.\n\nAt the 45th Annual Meeting of the Woman's Auxiliary of the Diocese of Qu'Appelle, held in Regina June 10, 11 and 12, there were 162 delegates and visitors in attendance.\n\nVery Rev. Wm. Cole, D.D., Dean of Qu'Appelle conducted the opening Evensong in St. Paul's Pro-Cathedral, assisted by Rev. Albert Woodside.\n\nHis Lordship, the Bishop of Qu'Appelle was present at the opening session. He expressed his regrets at the loss of the former President, Mrs. H. O. Harris, who resigned recently, and he welcomed the new appointed President, Mrs. Wm. Cole of Regina. His Lordship thanked the W.A. for all their assistance and asked God's blessing on the meeting.\n\nIn her presidential address Mrs. Cole spoke very highly of the work done by Mrs. Harrison in the past, and said she deemed it a great privilege and honor to be appointed fourth president of the Qu'Appelle Diocesan W.A.\n\nMessages of greeting were read from nearly all Diocesan W.A. Boards and from many old friends of the Qu'Appelle Diocese.\n\nReports of the various officers showed progress in all Departments. Miss Arva Stewart is at present working in the Diocese and also attending the former Girls' Branches. The total amount raised in the Diocese was over $50,000.00, Dominion Pledge was paid in full.\n\nGuest speakers at the meeting were: Mrs. G. W. Rhodes of Rosetown, who spoke on \"What the A.A.A. means to W.A. Members\", and Miss Arva Stewart, Regional Girls' Supervisor, who won the hearts of all with her charming manner.\n\nThe Lord Bishop presided for the election of officers, which resulted in the following being re-elected, with the following exceptions: First Vice-President, Mrs. N. H. Street, Regina; Second Vice-President, Mrs. T. J. Stephenson, Regina; Delegates elected, etc., and the Dominion Annual Meeting were Miss Elsie D. Parkinson of Regina and Mrs. T. H. Smith of Rosetown.\n\nDuring the sessions, corsages were presented to Mrs. J. R. Peverett, former Diocesan President, and Mrs. P. C.

The Right Rev. L. W. B. Broughall was present for the day, preaching at morning and evening service. In the afternoon Bishop dedicated a big bronze memorial lamp presented in memory of the late Sheriff Henry Endacott, also a tower memorial window, \"Ged's Sepulchre\" in the big three panel West End Window. At the evening service a class of 44 candidates was presented by the rector Canon H. A. West McMaster for confirmation.\n\nThe clergy of the Deanery of Wellington were guests of Canon West McMaster recently for a day's fishing and picnic. Through the kindness of local people a fine summer cottage and several boats at Caledon Lake were placed at the disposal of the visitors. A dinner, fishing and a happy social time made up the program.\n\nW.A. Conference\n\nThe Annual Conference of the Woman's Auxiliary of the South Simcoe Deanery was held on Wednesday, June 11th, in St. Andrew's Church, Alliston. The proceedings opened with Holy Communion conducted by the rector, Rev. D. V. Wigmore, assisted by Rev. W. J. Conner, Rector of Rosedale and Rev. F. B. Cooke of Beeton. Rural Dean R. Atkinson was in the chancel. The sermon was preached by the Rev. A. Herbert, for many years missionary among the Indians of the Hudson Bay Region. He gave a glowing account of the work carried on with these primitive people, of the remarkable response to the gospel, testimony and their ability to carry on in the face of very great difficulties. He stressed the need of more missionaries to fill the posts of those who were not doing their work.\n\nThe afternoon session was taken up by the hearing and receiving reports of the branches, the sale of bunsesses of the Deanery W.A. Addresses were delivered by Mrs. W. J. Robinson, and Mrs. A. MacDermid of the Toronto Diocesan Board. Mrs. Helen Wilkinson who has spent twenty-three years in India came to that land next September gave a very interesting and instructive lecture of the work in the district of Kangra, stressing the efforts made among the women and young people. Her view of the future was a very encouraging one.\n\nAn invitation for the Conference to meet in Cookstown next year was accepted.\n\nRural Dean Atkinson then installed the officers elected for the coming year, and brought a very inspiring Conference to a close. The officers for the year are: Hon. Pres., Mrs. R. M. Melville of Alliston; Pres., Mrs. F. E. Fisher, of Cookstown, Vice-Pres., Mrs. W. J. Emigh of Tottenham, Sec.-Treas., Mrs. R. M.

Simpson, of the General Theological Seminary, New York.\nThe Church Story\n\nThe temple of thine own elect.\nBoth now and ever; Lord, protect\n\nBishop Attacks Evil Propaganda\n\nThe importance of Sunday school activities and organized work among young people to combat \"the propaganda of subversive, anti-Christian organizations\" was stressed by Rev. H. R. Ragg, Anglican bishop of Calgary, in his charge delivered at the 32nd meeting of the synod of Calgary Diocese in the Pro-Cathedral.\n\nClergy and lay members of the diocese which takes in the southern part of the province from Lacombe to the border attended the sessions in Paget hall and the cathedral.\n\nBishop Ragg also urged the adoption of world evangelism to bring about world peace, the recruiting of young people for the Church of England's mission work in Canada and abroad, the introduction of Anglican religious instruction through the radio, the retention of the church's stand on divorce and re-marriage, and the resumption of the Re-Union Conversations with other Christian Churches.\n\n\"We live at a time when subversive organizations \u2014 organizations definitely anti-Christian \u2014 have deeply laid and actively propagated plans to seize the imagination and loyalty of youth and children. These plans are as deeply laid and as active in their operation as those of Adolf Hitler and his nazi philosophy.\n\n\"The clergy is failing in its ministry if it allows one possibility of contacting the youth of the parish to escape. No part of a parish's ministry is of greater importance.\"\n\nHe urged the establishment of Girls' Auxiliary groups to take the place of the C.G.I.T., \"which is not an Anglican organization.\" Religious instruction over the radio should be started soon by the Anglican Church to \"counteract the sentimental emotionalism of some (denominations) and the insidious propaganda of others.\"\n\nBishop Ragg announced the appointment of Archdeacon Robert Axon as warden, and Rev. J. M. Roe as Chaplain of the Diocese Lay Readers' Association.\n\nThe Diocesan Advisory Committee on Church Architecture was composed of Bishop Ragg as chairman, Archdeacon Axon, Canon E. H. Maddocks, E. E. Peterson and W. S. Bates.\n\nDean Smye met with Dr. Charles Howard Wilson to discuss the possibility of starting branches of the John Howard Society for work among discharged prisoners. Such branches could be started in Calgary, Lethbridge and Edmonton.\n\nMore than 90 per cent of the immigrants brought to Canada in the years from 1921 to 1931 were of the Roman Catholic faith, and everything possible done to keep people of Anglo-Saxon origin out of the country, stated Hugh C. Farthing, K.C., Chancellor of the diocese.\n\nKingston \u2014 Rt. Rev. John Lyons, Bishop of the Diocese of Ontario, announced the appointment of Sqdn. Ldr. W. J. Swan, M.A., senior Protestant chaplain at RCAF training centre at Trenton as rector of St. John's Church, Portsmouth. He succeeds Rev. A. E. Martin, who died last November. The new rector was formerly at St. Mary's Church, Vancouver, before he enlisted for service with the RCAF.\n\nRev. J. O. Ware, rector of Tamworth Anglican Church, has been named rural dean for Lennox to succeed Rev. Herbert Pringle, deceased.\n\nAppointment of Rev. Reginald Stewart, B.A., as rector of the Parish of Tyendinaga has been made by Bishop Lyons. He succeeds Rev. Herbert Pringle, deceased.\n\nRev. Mr. Savary is a son of Archdeacon Savary, Halifax, formerly of this city.\n\nA War Memorial Dedication Service was held at St. George's School, Vancouver, B.C., on July 15th.\n\nActive in the Anglican ministry for many years, Rev. Arthur Stewart Madill of 102 Wells street, Toronto, died suddenly while visiting at the home of his niece, Miss Arthur C. Thomson of Clarkson. He was in his 79th year.\n\nAT NIAGARA DIOCESAN CONFERENCE\u2014The recent Youth Conference of A.Y.P.A. in the Niagara Diocese, held recently in Burlington, proved a most successful meeting, with large representations from the district. Those taking part were, left to right, Jack Hall, Niagara Falls; Harold Baron, Hamilton, president of the Diocesan Council; Rev. C. J. Loat, of St. John's, Elora, chaplain; Rt. Rev. L. W. B. Broughall, Bishop of Niagara; Rev. C. F. Heathcote, Burlington; Miss Kathleen Donkin, Burlington, secretary-treasurer; Jack Paterson, Catharines, president of the Lincoln-Welland local council, and Rev. A. E. Ongley, diocesan youth chaplain.\n\nCANADIAN CHURCHMAN, JULY 3, 1947\nThe Nippon Sei Kokwai, the Anglican Church in Japan, corresponding to the Episcopal Church in the United States, has its first postwar Presiding Bishop. The Church was held together by its leadership through the war, in spite of difficulties and persecution. Now the church is stronger than ever before and more useful.\n\nThe new Presiding Bishop, The Rt. Rev. Tadamu Sugai (center) received his theological education at the Episcopal Church's Seabury-Western Seminary, at Evanston, Illa. He had been a teacher at St. Paul's University, Tokyo, and later was Bishop of South Tokai. During part of the war he was a solitary prisoner in a dungeon for defying the Secret Police and refusing to join the state-sponsored Union Church.\n\nIndians Need Our Help\n\nMention has often been made in your columns of the great need for workers in the Residential Schools. Dr. Alderwood has appealed for workers in every department of the schools and still the vacancies are filled.\n\nThe Residential School work is only part of the educational work that is undertaken by the church on behalf of the Indian people of Canada. Missions are carrying on their arduous duties among the many scattered Indian Reservations throughout the land.\n\nWe have in Saskatchewan in the Diocese of Qu'Appelle seven reservations where our work could be carried on but for the shortage of workers. There are but two full time missionaries to carry the Gospel and to interpret the Gospel by their lives to the people of five of these reserves. Two reserves are wholly neglected because there is no one who can go to them.\n\nTwo of these schools are in operation for two reserve alone, one at Little Pine and one at Red Pheasant. Teachers are needed for these schools and a great opportunity for the advancement of the educational work among the children by qualified teachers of Christian character stands out as a challenge for those who will answer the call.\n\nThe Indian Department has introduced a new plan of bursaries for teachers which should be an inducement to many to answer this call which is among the foremost that the Church sends out. The Class's holding 2nd Class Certificates are at a salary of $1,200.00 and may increase to $1,560.00, while First Class Certificates command a salary up to $1,980.00 according to special qualifications and service given.\n\nOpportunity of a special nature often offers to such to whom the appeal of Missionary work appeals in any of its many branches. We are always looking for persons to work on Reserves among the people. In such cases one can well see the opportunity which would afford ample scope for service to a man or woman who could take the Day School while his wife as a qualified nurse would carry on her special work in the homes of the people. There is need of such team work and we are ready to consider the application for this work. However it should be understood that the best qualification which will stand against the rigor of life and the occasional isolation is a deep devotion to serve the Master in His Cause and a determination to raise the standards of thought and concept of the Indian people to a place where they can express their Christian Faith in nobler Christian living.\n\nAny enquiries regarding Field Work and the missions to the Indians will be attended to by myself or by our co-workers in the special field to which the applicants' qualifications and desires seem to point, each being their own sphere of opportunity. Rev. Canon H. E. Hives, Box 61, North Battleford, Saskatchewan.\n\nFifty-Four Years' Mission Work Expands\u2014New Harbour Boat\n\nSt. John's, Newfoundland\u2014In bright sunshine, though with a chill wind blowing, a service unusually impressive took place at Bowring's Wharf in the presence of a large congregation, when the sixth mission boat used by the Newfoundland Cathedral Men's Bible Class was dedicated for its work. After the opening hymns, to the music of the Church Lads' Brigade brass band, and prayers by the Chairman of the Class, the Rev. Winterton, the Lord Bishop the Rt. Rev. Philip S. Abraham vested in cope and mitre, proceeded to the dedication of the boat.\n\nCommenced in 1923, this mission work has continued to the present day without a break. The Cathedral Men's Bible Class bears all the expenses and furnishes all the equipment. Others in the crew are engaged in the work; the boat crew visits every ship in harbour every Sunday morning from the beginning of May to the end of November, distributing tracts and other literature to the ships' crews, inviting them to the services of the city churches, and in every way possible trying to bring the Church to them. A similar crew does like work among the longshoremen. In 1929, this mission was affiliated with the Church Missions to Seamen, and now carries the flag of the \"Flying Angel\".\n\nMuch of its success is due to the inspiring leadership of the Class Chairman, the Rev. J. Brin-son, who this year commenced his forty-first year as service as Assistant Priest at the Cathedral. In tribute to his guidance the Class insisted on calling the new craft the \"Jacob Brinson\" and they felt it is due to him the men of the class continue to do a worthwhile piece of lay evangelism.\n\nMinistry of Healing\n\nA plea for closer unity between parish priests who practise the Church's ministry of healing, and the members of the deaconess was made by the Rev. F. S. Sinkler, officiating chaplain to the Guild of St. Raphael, at the annual meeting of the Guild at Mary Sumner House. He said that much could be done by establishing contacts with ordinands and medical stu-\n\ndents to secure their early interest in a most important branch of the Church's work.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. G. Croydon, chairman of the newly formed Church's Council of Healing, presided.\n\nWeston, Ontario\u2014Service to the Weston community totalling 179 years was celebrated at morning and evening services by the congregation of St. Philip's Anglican Church.\n\nThe New Yorker includes the following from the weekly bulletin of St. Mark's Church, Philadelphia: \"CHOIR BOYS: Ten new boys are needed immediately for the Choir. It is hoped that members of the congregation will do all they possibly can to help keep the Choir supplied with new boys.\"\n\nIn failing health during the past year, the Rev. W. G. G. Dryden died in the Oshawa General Hospital. He was in his 84th year.\n\nA graduate of Wycliffe College, he was a former financial secretary of Deaconess Home of Church of England, Toronto. Mr. Dryden served as pastor for 50 years, having served in Beeton, Ivy, Creemore, Scarborough and Bobcaygeon. In 1914 he retired to live in Toronto.\n\nMission Study for 'Teen-Agers'\n\nPLEASE NOTE THIS PRICE CORRECTION:\n\nFIRST CANADIANS\u2014the textbook for 'teen-age' girls and boys will sell at 60\u00a2 Net\u2014not 90\u00a2 as had been expected and as we advertised in the issue of this paper for June 19th. We regret that a later estimate from the printer makes this change necessary.\n\nThis book, as already stated, will consist of the three chapters on Indian and Eskimo work in the adult text-book, ONE FAMILY, with special opening and closing chapters, questions for discussion, etc. It is hoped that it may be ready the latter part of July.\n\nWe repeat: FIRST CANADIANS, 'teen-age' mission study text-book, .60 N.\n\nLiterature Department, M.

Beverley Enthroned\n\nAs Bishop of Toronto\n\nThe ring and staff of his office were presented to the Rt. Rev. Alton Ray Beverley during his enthronement in St. James' Cathedral as Lord Bishop of Toronto. During the ancient, powerful ceremony Ven. W. P. Robertson, Archdeacon of Peterborough, presented the staff and said:\n\n\"This staff I now hand to you, reverend Father in God, and may you so tend the flock of Christ that together you may rejoice in the day when the Chief Shepherd shall appear; and may you receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.\" Ven. A. G. Emmet of Orillia placed the ring on the fourth finger of the Bishop's right hand and said: \"Let this ring be to thee a token of the divine espousal of Christ the bridegroom and the Church, His bride, of whom thy office is a seal and a witness.\"\n\nNear the close of the service, Bishop Beverley, who had served as suffragan under the late Archbishop Owen and was elected to his present office last month at a special Synod, raised his staff in blessing over the congregation of laity and robust clergymen.\n\nIn his charge to Synod on June 17th, he referred thankfully to the work of Archbishop Owen and read notices of other members of Synod who had passed away.\n\nHe spoke in appreciation of the labours of clergy and the laity and could see many reasons for a hopeful outlook. He stressed the importance of Missions and spoke of the progress of the Anglican Advance Appeal.\n\nOn the subject of Church Union, Bishop Beverley discussed the progress made and suggested the study of the report of the committee on Reunion. No definite action could be taken until general approval had been won.\n\nThe Church Extension Committee had acquired twelve sites for new Churches and had to consider also the matter of rectories. Money was urgently needed for these developments.\n\nBishop Ragg announced the appointment of three divinity students to points in the province for the summer. They were Ellis M. Kerr, B.A.Sc., who will go to the Foothills mission near Pincher Creek; Leonard D. Leighton, L.Th., who will go to Brockert, and James C. M. Clarke, B.A., who will go to Red Deer-Sylvan Lake.\n\nPage Nine\nCanadian Youth\n\nYouth of the world arise,\nCourage and service bring.\n\nThrill of a Lifetime\n\nSome 32 Canadian Boy Scouts are due for a thrill when, on August 2nd, they sail from Halifax aboard H.M.C.S. Warrior, Canada's first aircraft carrier. The lads will be members of the Canadian contingent to the Boy Scout Jamboree of Peace in France which will be attended by 30,000 scouts from 40 different countries. The Jamboree Troop, which will be representative of all Provinces, is scheduled to assemble in Halifax on July 27th, for a ten-day training period at the Halifax District Scout Camp at Miller's Lake. Three leaders will accompany the Troop overseas.\n\nChapel is Nautical\n\nNew York, N.Y.\u2014The Chapel at the Seaman's Church Institute of New York expresses its nautical flavor in its most prominent font in the design of a ship's wheel surmounted by a shell; by a remote painting on the sanctuary wall by the famous marine artist, Gordon Grant; by the ships' lights, lighthouses, gulls, carved in the Gothic wooden frame for the Grant seascape; and by anchors and other nautical symbols on light fixtures and paneling. The Institute is an organization of the Episcopal Church in the Diocese of New York.\n\nTen Rules of Christian Living\n\n1. Consider your body as the temple of the Holy Spirit and treat it with reverence and care.\n2. Keep your mind active. Stimulate it with thoughts of others which lead to doing something.\n3. Take time to be holy with daily Bible reading and prayer.\n4. Support the church of our faith. Mingle with others.\n5. Cultivate the presence of God in your life and as far as you let Him.\n6. Take God into the details of your life. You naturally call upon Him in trouble and for the bigger things.\n\nWilliam Booth\n\nStudent Magazines Vulgar\n\nSir James C. Irvine, Principal of St. Andrews University, has been criticising student magazines. \"There is not the slightest doubt in my mind,\" he said in the first number of Carrier, published by the students of University College, Dundee, \"that student publications have deteriorated in quality during the past century. There were times when the lower level of cheap journalism was reached, sinking to the depths of vulgarity in some publications.\"\n\nSupports Separation Of Church and State\n\nNew York, N.Y.\u2014The Episcopal Church has gone on record officially by vote of its National Council, that it \"supports the American principle of the separation of Church and State and opposes the use of public funds for sectarian educational purposes.\" The Council mentioned specifically recent legislation which would provide bus travel and text books for nonpublic schools, \"and other provisions undermining the principle of separation.\"\n\nYoung People...\n\nAdd to your personal income or to the income of your Church organization by securing subscriptions for Canadian Churchman.\n\nPlease write to Canadian Churchman, 371 Bay Street, Toronto, for particulars of our attractive plan.\n\nCANADIAN CHURCHMAN JULY 3, 1947\nEducation\n\nGod send us men alert and quick\nHis lofty precepts to translate.\n\nWill City Parents Ever Understand?\n\n\"What are you going to do this summer?\" a retired farmer friend of ours asked the high school son of a friend of his, as he grasped the arm of a fine husky boy of seventeen.\n\n\"Well, I hoped to be a caddy at Jasper, but nothing doing. The trouble is I'm not eighteen so I am trying to get a job in a broker's office.\"\n\n\"Why a broker's office? Why don't you take that good 'muscle' to a farm and make it even better, and at the same time help the farmer to produce food?\" our friend asked.\n\n\"Well, Mom and Dad are afraid I wouldn't be properly fed and housed on a farm.\"\n\nWhat ignorance! The good farm homes of Canada excel the best city homes in the quality of the food and in the excellence of the personal care given the household. Canadian city parents who do not know that their children could be improved vastly, physically and mentally, by a summer of outdoor work, fresh, superlatively-cooked foods, and sound sleep, are not aware of how best to complete the education of their children.\n\nThe greatest lack in the development of Canadian youth is the simple discipline of work. Any Canadian city family that does not know personally a half-dozen fine farm families, in whose homes the food and personal care is equal or far better than in theirs, should get out in the country and get acquainted. The growing gap in understanding between the farm and city people of Canada is a basic cause of the economic inequalities which are resulting in an abnormal reduction in farm population, and the less-than-potential production of food in a world which food cannot come\u2014from The Scene from Shingwauk Farm, Bracebridge, Ontario.\n\nRemember that mud thrown is ground lost!\u2014Wingspread.\n\n\"The wicked flees when no man pursueth,\" but they make better time when someone is after them.\n\nA parent's good example will assist the tempted child in solving his own problems.\u2014Dr. John W. Holland.\n\nIs Text-Book Knowledge All Your Son Needs?\n\nThe fundamental aim of education is not to produce accountants, attorneys, or engineers, but to develop able, earnest, great-hearted men\u2014men of broad vision and impartial understanding, free of superstition and prejudice. Textbooks themselves are not enough. The aims of a child's varied interests, tastes, and latent talents must be awakened and cultivated by trained, experienced teachers. At Appleby College classes are small, and the staff is carefully chosen to provide the friendly, individual supervision needed. A diversity of hobbies and sports are a regular part of the curriculum and the course of studies provides entrance to all Universities.

Bell\nHeadmaster\n\nAPPLEBY COLLEGE\n\nCANADIAN CHURCHMAN, JULY 3, 1947\nAn Episcopal Craftsman\n\nThe first Bishop of Jarrow, Dr. G. Nickson, who is living in retirement at Church Stretton, has designed and made a pastoral staff, which he has presented for the use of succeeding Bishops of Jarrow. The body of the staff is in flinted ebony. Its crook and supporting ornament are of ivory, intricately carved and fashioned, and adorned with enamel work and semi-precious metalwork.\n\nThe present Bishop of Jarrow possesses a gold pectoral cross, also the work of Dr. Nickson.\n\nCareers for Girls\n\nOf interest to young women who are considering the question of a career is a study of the Ottawa directory of personnel of the Civil Service in Canada.\n\nThere are, of course, thousands of clerks in the service, and these come and go\u2014or remain doing a necessary job. But in this service also are, or have been, women with special training, doing good work along special lines, of whom little is known.\n\nThere was recently, for instance, in the Department of External Affairs is a young woman lawyer, acting as junior legal advisor.\n\nWith the Justice Department is also a young woman lawyer, and others are working as solicitors in the Department of National Revenue.\n\nWith Mines and Resources, in the Forest Products Division, a woman is doing work in timber pathology; and another in the same department is engaged in fossil research.\n\nWith the National Film Board are women editors and research workers.

There is so much of it used in building houses, and big stores and bridges and ships.\n\nIt is very interesting to study how steel is made. I am told that heat to three thousand degrees Fahrenheit is necessary\u2014the great furnaces. That's pretty hot when you compare it with a hot summer day.\n\nSome of this steel is then manufactured into very beautiful table knives, but how terribly tarnished they become and mother has to work hard to polish them up when company comes.\n\nIn order to prevent these knives from tarnishing, the steel, now, is dipped in some counteracting solution which gives us stainless steel.\n\nWhy is the metal of your bicycle dipped in chromium or painted red? Not really to make it look nice, but rather so that it won't rust. Wood is painted so that it won't rot.\n\nGod has a great deal of wonderful work to be done to build this world as He wants it to be. He is depending on you boys and girls to do your part. The only way to keep bright and ready for service is to dip your life deep in the character and love of Jesus Christ, to keep the spirit and stains away. From Modern Parables for Young Folks, W. A. Wilde Company, Boston.\n\nThe Bishop of Algoma, the Rt. Rev. W. L. Wright, D.D., visited Parry Sound on Sunday, June 15th. His Lordship was the celebrant of the service of Holy Communion in Trinity Church. At the eleven o'clock service the Bishop dedicated two candlesticks \"To the Glory of God, in memory of Flying Officer Hal Taylor and his Living Mother Mrs. M.\", a Font Cover \"To the Glory of God, in memory of Arnold Forder\", and a silver collection plate given by the Chancel Guild.\n\nIn the afternoon the Bishop visited Deep Harbour on Parry Island. A baby boy was brought to a close with a confirmation at Trinity Church, Parry Sound. This was followed by a congregational get-together in the crypt of the Church; the Archdeacon of Muskoka accompanied the Bishop on his visitation.\n\nCANADIAN CHURCHMAN, JULY 3, 1947\nPray for Healing\n\nAs a constant reader of your valuable Church paper, may I suggest the idea of a day of Prayer to God the Father Almighty, on behalf of the thousands of sufferers through the dread disease of cancer, that the cause and the cure might now be revealed. Thousands suffer and die each year and large sums of money are spent for the elucidation of the mystery, and the sick are not relieved. And if this thing has been promised by the House of Israel to do it for them, \"And the prayer of faith shall deliver the sick.\"\u2014Rev. J. P. M.\n\nThe Hebrew Idiom\n\nI have just today received your issue of June 5. In passing I wish to congratulate you, not only on the vast improvement in your paper, but on your declaration of attention to continue improving. Being as it is well described as \"Make-believe life in death,\" and though life is equally well described as a comedy of errors, it is the only way we propose.\n\nBut my immediate purpose is to comment on your editorial, \"The English of The Bible.\" Its purpose, and in general its matter, are excellent; though personally I fancied it would have been improved by omitting the list of figures of speech and possibly introducing more illustrations. I suggest that at any rate a course would have made it more intelligible to the average reader.\n\nBut my particular point is the use of the quotation from Genesis which is God's. The use of these is not due to being better English, but to the impossibility of giving a reasonably literal translation of the original Hebrew without them. Anyone who has even a rudimentary acquaintance with Hebrew knows something of the use of the so-called \"Van converter\". I am not going into the exact nature of it other than to say that it is one of the most characteristic of Hebrew forms, essential to the verbal structure of the language, and that in many it is best expressed by not the literal hint of its chief purpose in the Hebrew.\n\nI am not attempting to pose as a scholar; but you yourself will admit that apart from the Bible where its use was necessitated by the Hebrew idiom, even the standards of the translators' English would condemn translations of such a multiplication of \"ands\" in such a short passage anything but good form.\u2014Harry Allan, Smooth Rock Falls, Ontario.\n\nThe Challenge in the North\n\nIt was my privilege to follow the discussion of \"The State of the Church in the Deanery of Mackenzie River\" at our recent Provincial Synod of Rupert's Land. So critical are Church conditions in this Deanery that His Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land made a special scow visitation to get as much first-hand information as possible.\n\nIn 1920 Bishop Lucas asked me to act as his deputy and pay a visit to all the parishes of the Mackenzie basin. Church conditions have changed very little since then. I thought the impressions that were made upon me then might be of some little help to our Church leaders to-day in dealing with this critical situation.\n\nCanon Gould, Secretary of the M.S.C.C., asked me for any observations that I might care to make. Some were as follows:\n\nOne of the chief complaints that were made to me by the missionaries, was the frequent and lengthy periods of absence of the Bishop from the Diocese. I explained that Bishop was abroad in order that he might obtain more helpers and more money for the work.\n\nWas this condition improved when this great territory was attached to the Diocese of Athabasca? The answer is definitely no. I consider it was a great blow to our work in Mackenzie River to cease to be a Diocese. The cure was not less episcopal supervision but more.\n\nWas that brought about? My firm conviction is that the Diocese of Mackenzie River should be reconstituted with Fort Chipewyan as the See Town and that a good river boat be provided for the use of the Bishop on his parochial visits.\n\nNot only for the sake of our Indian people who were largely Christianized by the great missioners (e.g., Bishop Bonomi, Archdeacon MacDonald, Rev. Mr. Spedding) and others, but also because of the fact that the Mackenzie is becoming a second St. Lawrence, with its great potential oil, lumber and industrial life that is being developed in that mighty land.\n\nThe native work is most important, but even more important is the white work that our Church should and must be interested in. We have pride of place in strategic centres, e.g., Fort McMurray, Fort Chipewyan, Hay River, Fort Simpson, Fort Norman (where the great oil wells are) Fort McPherson and the truly wonderful Church centre at Atklivik. Also the great mining centres that are being developed.\n\nThe north was won by our Church, are we going to throw it away? It is a great opportunity to our Collegians and younger Clergy. We older men have done our bit\u2014let the younger Bishops and younger men accept the challenge and go to work to save our heritage and as God has given us the opportunity and call let us rise up and do His work.\u2014Christopher Carruthers, Chaplain, Deer Lodge Military Hospital, Winnipeg.\n\nSacraments Are Necessary\n\nIn recent months we have heard much about the few who attend church services at present day; of the many who prefer something else to church. This paucity of numbers at our services has caused great alarm in this country and in England. So much so that committees have been appointed to study the problem. The Canadian Church is considering proposals of affiliation with other bodies, believing that such unity will counteract the difficulty. We wonder sometimes if we are approaching the problem from the right angle?\n\nI was on the train a year or two ago en route to Toronto. When about sixty miles from the destination, a man from an Ontario town boarded the train on his way home. As we moved along he pointed out many places, one of which of course was now almost dormant. This, he eagerly pointed out, was the result of Wycliffe teaching. Far be it from me to say anything of that kind. I believe the roots go deeper. With the Reformation the church of the Sacramental life of the Church was swept away. Sacraments no longer held their esteem in the eyes of the people. Under this system of Papal surveillance, that gave rise to Protestantism. This new aspect of religion, disregarding the Sacraments as necessary to Salvation, placed Christ on a pedestal. He, who had once lived among men, was now ascended far above the heavens, out of the sight of men. People were called upon to look to the Holy Spirit to fill Him. All very true, but He is not here anywhere on earth, but in heaven. With the absence of the sacramental part in worship came the necessity of introducing the social side and making it a purely moral religion. I feel we are still suffering the after effects of the Reformation and shall not improve our position by organic union with protestant bodies, or by condoning a moral and socialized form of belief, but by a return to the sacramental. The Church has always regarded the Presence of Christ in the one great Sacrament. If this strue, then His presence is not sent from the world, but presents it. It is here that men must come to know Him, receive Him and be that which is spiritually Hiskin the flesh. They must know He is not only as One who ascended, but One who is here, though hidden beneath earthly elements.\u2014A.\n\nSerene will be our days and bright.\nAnd happy will our nature be\nWhen love is an unerring light,\nAnd joy its own security.\n\nThere are no common things in spite of what men may say and do, but all things are glorious, because God made them.

Suet\n\nThe greatest need in leadership training for lay workers in the local church is an adequate theory of Christian education. At present too much reliance is placed on the Sunday school. The Sunday School has not outlived its usefulness, as some say. It must be strengthened. But in its very nature the Sunday school alone cannot meet the whole job of Christian education. It is a necessary part of a total program, including training in home and family and in many other church activities for nurturing the Christian life.\n\nLay workers for Christian education in sufficient number and of high quality will respond to the call of the church for workers when the following conditions are met:\n\n1. The call to service must be a dignified call, officially representing the entire congregation.\n\n2. The demands of the task must be clearly defined, with standards set high enough to challenge thoughtful people. Our aims are now too abstract and hazy to attract busy and earnest persons, our standards too low.\n\n3. There must be a very clear spiritual emphasis. The evangelistic motive has a central place in education which must not be obscured.\n\n4. There must be recognition and appreciation. It is a justifiable human desire to be appreciated. An important responsibility deserves high honor and teaching is one of the most essential and distinctive of services in the church. Yet often it seems a thankless task\u2014a cheap function among church activities.\n\n5. The church must have a long-range, intelligent plan for finding, enlisting and training lay workers. Our present haphazard, \"hand-to-mouth\" plan of finding teachers is destructive of morale and lowers the prestige of the Sunday school. Choosing a teacher for a class of children may be as important as choosing a pastor. The teacher may much more profoundly affect the lives of those children.\n\n6. The church must be ready to train its new workers. Teachers must be persons with a religious experience to share. But teaching needs skill and the floundering teacher is soon discouraged. When an intelligent person accepts a job he wants to know just what is expected, just how and where to begin, and how to move forward toward definite results. Training is a task undertaken on the job and essential to sustained interest. Every failure of a volunteer leader is a hard blow to morale.\n\n7. We shall enlist lay leaders readily in Christian education when we cease to use so largely in our lesson helps and books on educational methods, a \"professional\" vocabulary which leaves the average layman uninspired. We must have sound educational theory in everyday terms of the common life so that they may be understood.\n\nChristian Education in The Local Church\n\nBy Dr. Philip Cowell Jones\n\nOur greatest failure has been that we have been tacticians rather than strategists. One cause has been reverting to traditional denominational formulas; it is as though some imitable law had bound us to ox-cart methods in the airplane era. Perhaps the chief reason for our \"survival strategy\" is that we have not yet mastered our best Protestant brains.\n\nWhen the war required that our industry be converted, the requisite intelligence and skill were found to be immediately available. The \"know-how\" latent in the Protestant Church, waiting to be requisitioned, but our most able people will not be interested in tinkering with the ox-cart.\n\nVacation Schools Released\n\nTime Education, Sunday Schools\u2014these and other agencies, which have been found useful, must be perfected and used connectedly, but the time demands long-term planning, encompassing the entire church\u2014on parish, denominational and united Protestant levels\u2014and confronting an age which is, to our dismay, almost completely secularized.\n\nSome of the current issues which must be met with wisdom, vigor and persistence are the alarming incidence of divorce, the sexual revolution, the urbanization of our life, materialistic standards of success, racial and cultural bigotry, the liquor problem.\n\nIssues of such magnitude cannot be met\u2014to say nothing of being solved\u2014without a long-range strategy which will affect our total program. The Christian Church cannot be sufficiently vital to be truly effective unless it undertakes to be redemptive, not only of our individual lives, but of our social institutions.\n\nIf we muster all of our available Protestant leadership, we shall discover in our Christian faith, with its Book of Life and its available Power, the incentive and the \"drive\" needed to infuse our people with a dynamic which will not be thwarted.\n\nTHE LAW AND THE PROPHETS: by Ernest Marshall Howse, S.T.M., Ph.D., (Ryerson Press, Toronto: $1.00) is a series of sermons \"on the making of the Old Testament.\"\n\nThey were preached by the author to his own congregation in the Westminster United Church, Winnipeg. The first sermon is a clear and rapid survey of the rise and fall of the successive empires of the ancient Near East. The second tells the story of the travails and spiritual growth of the little nation of Israel during the seventh century B.C., the Century of Woe. Then follow three further biographical studies of the three great prophets\u2014Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Second Isaiah. The two concluding sermons develop the return of the Jewish refugees from the Babylonian Exile and the growth of the canon of the Law. Each of these sermons is reared by the author with his evident knowledge of his subject and his enthusiasm for it; these must have been interesting and stimulating to hear. In their present form they make very good reading and are full of suggestions for any interested in interpretation of the Old Testament and making it real and alive for his hearers.\n\nDr. Howse's approach is historical and topographical. It is the history of empires, the characters are kings and governments and the theme is the work of the prophets which are his central theme and constitute the largest part of his message. The distinctive religious teaching of the various prophets and the religious developments of the period cannot be neglected. The author in his treatment shows how these emerge in each case out of historical situations or the personal experiences of the prophet writers. The canon of the Bible is God's Book and ours. It is completely adequate as the Source Book of our individual and separate spiritual life. Today we see His Book being embraced with widespread enthusiasm, and we hear the cry: \"We must put content into our Christian teaching.\" Indeed, we must turn back to the Book and know what we believe, but we must look back at what we must advance. Theological ideas alone do not automatically save. Indeed if we communicate to others an individual salvation alone, this may be but a retreat from reality; for true redemption is in the life process or it is no redemption. We shall find in our gospel the urge to accept social responsibility or fail to meet the paganisms of our day\u2014which threatens not only the Christian Church but all life. Discovering the true Gospel, we shall find that it involves unending struggle but in striving we shall find that we need God's power and, discovering our importance, we shall find it.\n\nCANADIAN CHURCHMAN, JULY 3, 1947\nMusic and Worship\n\nThe death of Sir Sydney Nicholson removes from the sphere of contemporary Church musical circles one who combined religious devotion with his art. Those of us who had the privilege of knowing him over a long period of years will agree that our Communion has lost a master among \u201csuch as found out musical tunes.\u201d\n\nSir Sydney Nicholson will always be remembered as the Organist and Choirmaster of Westminster Abbey who gave up his high position in order to devote himself to the study of Anglican Church Music and its better rendering. With this aim in view he founded the School of English Church Music, later to be honoured by His Majesty the King with the title of The Royal School of Church Music. His scheme was widely supported, and there are few places where the Anglican Communion is to be found which have not their associated choirs. The School now has its headquarters at Canterbury, a fitting home indeed.\n\nThe spirit of music is a tremendous thing. It is a gift from God \u201cflowing from the glory of the Almighty.\u201d By it the artist expresses, and helps others to express, the beauty, the gladness, the moving splendour of the pressions which have become his own, a part of his very self. The function of all art, like that of religion, is to make us aware of great truths. And whatever the form of the art, if the artist\u2019s impressions are good, true, and beautiful, the expression will take care of itself.\n\nThe simplest form of religious musical expression is the hymn tune, and here, despite the highbrows, we may put in a plea that in considering the hymn tune the emotional appeal may not be forgotten. The words which the tune accompanies may be pure and faultless; and yet the hymn may miss its mark. It is easy to write down a tune as merely a mental or commonplace, yet many a hymn thus condemned has moved the hearts of millions. Such is the subtlety and mystery of musical expression. Those who have heard Sir Sydney Nicholson conduct a choir practice\u2014not of some great Cathedral choir, but of lesser mortals in the chorister world\u2014will recall how the great man led the souls as well as the voices of the singers and made even a hackneyed hymn sound fresh.\n\nThe Church may thank God for the care, the pains, and the devotion of her choirs and choirmasters and organists. We have become accustomed to think back on the thousands of men and women in our land who devote much time and care to this service that it has become a commonplace and we do not realize what it means. In village, town, and city this fine devoted service continues, and we shall do well to recollect this as we honour the memory of the man who, to use colloquialism, definitely put our choirs on the map, and taught the smallest and most inexperienced rascal of a choirboy something about the privilege of singing God\u2019s praises in God\u2019s House.\u2014From The Scottish Guardian.\n\nJuicy Voices\n\n\u201cI AM TIRED,\u201d said the Reverend Stephen F. Bayne, Jr., Colonel of Columbia University, in an address to the students, \u201cof men\u2019s juicy voices creeping into my room and talking about my digestion. I am tired of being told that bad breath is the only thing that can happen to you. I am tired of the whole shamelessness of having my body and its needs held up as the Summon Bonum. I am tired of a society in which the dollar value of what a man does has become his master, so that his lonely livelihood and his very life depend on a blind, vulgar chance. . . .\n\n\u201cWhat counts in our world is whether a customer can be hoodwinked, flattered, cozened into buying something he does likely does not need, and which is carefully designed to wear out as quickly as possible so he\u2019ll buy another one . . . a world in which every appeal is made to our vanities and fears, our lusts and selfishness\u2014and all that degrading and humiliating apparatus of commerce is necessary in order that another man may earn his daily bread. . . . We listen to the clamour through the walls of our indigestion. A man depends for his living on somebody else being made anxious to buy for $20 what is worth $10. . . . It is not the profit motive or free enterprise that is wrong. It is that it has a kind of cancer, with gain alone growing and crowding out all the parts of a man. . . . It is a world upside down.\u201d The Chronicle, U.S.A.\n\nChurchmen\u2019s Dinner\n\nSponsored by Canon H. A. West McMaster of Orangeville, Ontario, the Churchmen of the County of Dufferin held their annual dinner at St. Mark\u2019s Hall, Orangeville, Wed., June 25th.\n\nDufferin County is divided between the three dioceses of Niagara, Huron and Toronto, but ignoring district boundaries the parish in the county was represented. Members of St. Mark\u2019s Chi Rho Club served a hot dinner in a very attractively decorated hall. Mr. J. M. Aiken of Orangeville presided as chairman, with Col. N. N. Wardlaw as secretary.\n\nWith Dr. J. L. Gulley at the piano the evening opened with a singsong. Laymens\u2019 Hymn and Prayer by Capt. J. W. McIlwain. Mr. Shaw of Arthur proposed the toast to \u201cCanada,\u201d responded to by Mr. Alf Manary of Grand Valley. The Toast to the \u201cChurch\u201d was proposed by Mr. Fred White of Sheppard and responded to by Mr. Roy Coleman.\n\nRev. Canon J. W. McDonald of Wycliffe College introduced the speaker of the evening, Mr. R. H. Soward, K.C., of Toronto, who gave a most inspiring and helpful address on \u201cWhat the Laity expect from the Clergy and what the Clergy expect from the Laity.\u201d H. B. Church, K.C., of Orangeville, moved the vote of thanks to Mr. Soward for his fine talk.\n\nShort addresses were given by Dr. H. Zinn of Shelburne, John Talbot of Arthur, Jos. Parker of Mono Mills, M. Potter of Mt. Forest, and Mr. Wardlaw of Orangeville. Rev. R. V. Wilson of 1st United Church gave two violine selections. Mrs. J. C. Huether, Church Warden at St. Mark\u2019s, expressed the thanks of the gathering to the Chi Rho Club for their bountiful and well served dinner, at which Mrs. H. S. Poppe, President of the Club, replied. The gathering enthusiastically decided to hold next year\u2019s dinner in Shelburne.\n\nSunday evening, June 22nd, the Masonic Lodge of Grey County held their annual church service at St. Mark\u2019s, Orangeville. Rev. J.W. Bro. C. V. Jeffrey, D.D.G.M., was in charge with officers and members from several Lodges attending. Canon H. A.

It must be handled on preventive lines by setting up a more healthy form of society. It could not be solved merely by Government planning or without the assistance of psychological advisers.\n\nYouth services were fumbling and faltering, and they needed to be equipped with individuals in the better and happier use of spare time. Social evils such as drink, prostitution, and delinquency came about because people were not happy.\n\nPage Fifteen\nShould the Dying Be Told?\n\nShould a dying person be told of his condition? This question was among those discussed at a recent meeting of the E. Hospital Church (in Fallowfield), held at Guy's Hospital which was addressed by Dr. R. Kelson Ford, Medical Superintendent of St. Stephen's Hospital, Chelsea, London, England.\n\nThe doctor described how the knowledge of impending death might make a man more determined to live or might make him give up his remaining senses. The Rev. J. Gordon Cox felt that presumably in the first case to tell was right and asked whether in the second case the slight shortening of life really mattered much. The doctor said he thought ecclesiastical opinion was little more certain on that point than normal. The general feeling among those present was that they personally would resent not being told, but that this did not apply with some people, particularly with strong religious convictions. The Rev. Shell pointed out that it is possible to prepare people for death without giving any opinion as to expectation of life.\n\nDeath of Bishop Farthing\n\nRecalls Interesting Incident\n\nThe death of Bishop Farthing, at the age of 85, has drawn from both secular and religious observers warm eulogies on his contribution to the life of the Church of England in Canada. It is interesting to recall that his career once touched the Bishop's career on a personal point. Back about 1905, Canon Farthing, of Woodstock, (as he then was) and Canon Dann, of London, went a visit or more at Fern Cottage. Both were convalescing from rather serious illness. One day the present writer received a private and confidential letter from Mr. E. B. Penne, editor of the Kingston Whig and then the leading Anglican layman in Kingston, stating that Canon Farthing was being considered for the post of Dean of the Cathedral, and asked whether, in his opinion, the Canon, whose nervous system was reported to be severely shaken, was likely to regain complete health within a reasonable time. On consulting the Canon's local physician, we were able to give Mr. Penne assurance on this point, and shortly afterwards it was announced that Canon Farthing had been appointed Dean of Kingston Cathedral. Some years afterwards he became Bishop of Montreal, a position in which he won a wide reputation for tolerance, wisdom and eloquence. Even after retiring he maintained vigour of mind and body, and continued to give much useful service.\u2014Orillia Packet and Times.\n\nOur Greatest Hour\n\nPerhaps for the Christian every moment is a critical moment, but for our Christian Church this is our greatest hour. \"Now is the accepted time.\" Much of the paganism, as the Old Land Churches have discovered, in our own villages, towns and cities is now an unparalleled opportunity to \"Go into all the world\" with a witness that will break down all material and secular barriers and establish Christ's Kingdom, even if we, like the early apostles, must begin at Jerusalem. If the world is to be won in this hour both pew and pulpit must accept their responsibilities, for this task is a task for all Christians.\u2014Presbyterian Record.\n\nThe Whole Faith\n\nThe Church must overcome its present loss of nerve. It must present the pagans of today with the faith once delivered to the saints, and win the sacramentals of the Gospel. It must be frankly recognised that there are limits to co-operation with Protestant bodies in the task of evangelisation. To \"steal the Nonconformist thunder\" does not mean to take the case of the thunder, but often crackles like a damp squib. Churchmen need not look outside their own armoury for the weapons of evangelisation.\n\nThere are bishops today capable of raising the lead. There are priests in plenty, particularly members of the Religious orders, who are expert mission-preachers. Throughout the country there is interest in religious discussion of religion, dear for religion. As the Priest of Southwark impressed on our Special Representative, the Church of England must apply herself to the task for which God has destined her\u2014to proclaim the whole faith of Christ to the whole people of England.\u2014Church Times, England.\n\nThe Language of the World Inadequate\n\nThe task of those who are called to be the apostles of the good news of God in a world which has forgotten Him, will not be easy. The world no longer speaks the language of Christendom. A generation is growing up to whom our ideas and phraseology of Christian thought are unfamiliar. They demand that the Church should speak their own language to them.\n\nAt first sight the demand seems reasonable enough. But sooner or later the language of the world proves inadequate to express the truth of God. An individual outlook which is bounded by nationality can never find words to express the truth which the Spirit reveals to those who put themselves in the way of learning by practising religion.\u2014Church Times, England.\n\nElected to High Office\n\nBishop A. R. Beverley, Suffragan Bishop of Toronto under Archbishop Owen, was elected successor to the late Primus on May 12. Dr. Beverley was elected sixth Bishop of Toronto on the second ballot, an almost unprecedented record in Canadian Anglican circles. For many years before moving to Toronto Dr. Beverley was rector of the Anglican Church in Barrie.\n\nThe newly elected Bishop of the important see of Toronto is widely known for his kindly spirit, genuine tolerance, broad sympathies and true humanity. He is a \"slow\" churchman of repute, standing more in the evangelical than the sacramentarian tradition. As Bishop of Toronto he is almost certainly an addition to the evangelical movement, of which the late Dr. Derwyn T. Owen was a staunch protagonist.\n\nBaptists who know Dr. Beverley, through association with him in inter-church circles, will welcome his election to the responsible position he now holds. Those who have not known him personally will, as the years progress, recognize in his work and public utterances convincing evidence of the grace and power of the Spirit of God within him.\n\nThe Canadian Baptist extend every good wish in Christ Jesus to Bishop Beverley, together with the hope that his tenure of office will be fruitful in all blessing for the Church of England in Canada.\n\nCommunism\n\nCommunism: Above the apex of the pyramid of human life is God Himself whose will is made known to us through His Word and by His Spirit. He is the high source of all authority. All human authority comes from Him. He is its ultimate source. At the head of human society and under God is the King or it may be the President. Authority then broadens out to the Parliament that makes our laws and the Judges and Magistrates who administer them, and to the police and other officials who are responsible for their effective exercise. Parents, teachers and many others share in varying degrees in these responsibilities. But the authority proper to any office ultimately derives from God Himself.\n\nNow these facts and this faith is plainly incompatible with Communism as it has been preached and practised in this present century.\u2014Australian Church Record.\n\nThe Sinners' Club\n\nNo meetings.

God doesn't lead people as the Bible says He led the children of Israel out of Egypt! What, the Communist asked, had I to say to this?\n\nFirst, it is necessary to get it clear in our minds that in these stories, the Bible is talking in pictures. What the Bible means is that God is working in the world. God is concerned not only with what takes place in churches on Sundays; God is concerned with the whole of life. It is a perversion of the truth to suppose that religion is something apart from the ordinary business of living. In the Bible there is no distinction between sacred and secular. The Bible deals with the unfolding of the purpose of God in all life. The Bible tells of the coming of God into the world's life, the act of God God working for a deliberate end. The meaning of the Bible is that we do not live in a universe where things happen without cause or reason. At the very core of the teaching of the Bible, from its earliest pages, is the belief in God as the Author and Upholder of all things, a belief in other words, that God is working in the world, that God is making history.\n\nIt is God's purpose that man should discover and obey the purpose of God in every field of life, and the Bible is of unique importance to man in this task.\u2014The Bishop of Ballarat (the Rt. Rev. W. H. Johnson).\n\nThe Power Behind Sound Government\n\nBy The Rev. Alan Gardiner, M.A., B.D.\n\nToday is one of the important festivals in the Christian World. It is Ascension Day. The Gospel describes the Ascension of Jesus Christ very briefly as follows. \"And after Jesus had spoken these words He was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God. And they went forth and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following.\"\n\nThe truth embodied in this last event of His life of Jesus Christ upon earth, by that life He showed us how we should live to secure happiness and peace in the world. Now having given us a sound example of the way to go and have opened the way to the heart of our Heavenly Father by His death upon the Cross, He spends His time praying that we will give a good account of ourselves in His footsteps. The writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews tells us, \"For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but one who has been tempted in all points like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.\" Hebrews 4:14-16.\n\nWe are living in God's world. Jesus Christ the Son of God, by His example showed us what our family life, our social life, our everyday personal life should be if people are to live in love, happiness, and peace day by day. He stated one indissoluble rule of life, \"I am the vine, ye are the branches: he that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; For without Me ye can do nothing.\" During the recent war, when things were tense, dangerous, and perilous, prevalent, all thinking people were convinced that without the presence and power of God, all of our plans and purposes for victory would have been but little. Prayers for God's help were offered daily in our churches and cathedrals. The answer to our prayers came by way of an overwhelming and convincing victory to our men and arms.\n\nThen came the peace. Certain restraints were removed from our daily lives. The smooth waters of our civil life have been ruffled by economic disputes and social unrest. Multitudinous schemes for the establishment of peace and security at home and abroad have been suggested, some of which are being tried. Yet things are not going so smoothly as we had hoped. The Festival of the Ascension of Jesus Christ rings out the message \u2014 God reigns. He has given us the formula for securing peace at home and abroad. His formula cannot become effective until the people of our families, our communities, and our nation accept and follow the Message of our Lord and His way of life in their way of life. The heads of our families, the leaders of our communities, and the citizens of our nation must be all people everywhere all over the world to follow the example of those who witnessed the Ascension of Jesus Christ, before God's will can be expressed in our social and economic life. \"They were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.\" The movement in God's world cannot be achieved apart from God's presence in the minds of men.\u2014From The Cranbrook Courier.\n\nThere It Stands\n\nThe late Dr. A. Z.

Then there's turning on the organ for the organist to play, And putting on the lights so that folks can see their way, And there's lots of other duties that our Rector has to do That might easily be done by either me or you.\n\nFor example there's the furnace which must be lit at night, And the ringing of the bell making sure it \"tinkles\" right. And also there's the money which must be locked away, And polishing the brasses to make them shine each day. Then to help our dear Rector in the jobs he has to do, Let's call for volunteers and attempt to form a queue. Because when things are unobtainable and cleaners very few, There's lots of things that could be done by folk like me and you.\u2014G.M.D.H.H.\n\n\u2014The Scottish Guardian.\nSt. Paul's, Fort William\n\nOn Sunday, June 22nd, a very beautiful stained glass window was dedicated in St. Paul's Church, Fort William by the Rector, Archdeacon C. W. Balfour. The unveiling was done by the People's Warden, F. T. Delgatv, and the Superintendent for the last 16 years of the Church Department of the Sunday School, Mrs. Little. The window illustrates Our Lord seated receiving little children and young people. The font has been moved to stand below the window and a Baptistry arranged. The window is the gift of those baptised at St. Paul's chiefly, with help from others interested.\n\nThe Rector has resigned St. Paul's Parish, to take effect at the end of the summer. He is now serving as Associate Pastor in Peterborough. He has served 47 years in the ministry, nearly all of which have been given in the Diocese of Algoma, at Huntsville, North Bay, Sault Ste. Marie and Fort William. He has been Archdeacon of Algoma for 21 years.\n\nNormal Youth\n\nGRAND RAPIDS, Michigan\u2014Normal religious experience for normal youth should be the aim of church programs for youth, declared Dr. Paul Weaver of Columbia, Mo., director of the department of religion and philosophy, Stephens College, in speaking before the closing session of the Division of Religion of the International Council of Religious Education at the 25th annual meeting recently.\n\nOpportunities for the application of Christian principles to social life in a community should be afforded through work projects, which identify religious values as the expected conduct of the normal life instead of making religion a thing apart, Dr. Weaver recommended.\n\n\"The youth of today need a cultivation of their capacity to feel in terms of objects worthy of their emotion,\" Dr. Weaver said. \"They need sensitivity toward the real issues of life. However, we have given them self-confidence without sensitivity and that is dangerous.\"\n\nDr. Weaver scored the church for its habit of letting poor planning and inadequate preparation be the church's answer to the spectacular productions of the theatre and modern advertising.\n\nWarning that youth makes these comparisons to the disadvantage of religion, he said:\n\n\"We can no longer countenance a lack of enthusiasm in religious programs for the youth in our churches. Our cause must have nothing but the best.\"\n\nNormal Youth\n\nGRAND RAPIDS, Michigan\u2014Normal religious experience for normal youth should be the aim of church programs for youth, declared Dr. Paul Weaver of Columbia, Mo., director of the department of religion and philosophy, Stephens College, in speaking before the closing session of the Division of Religion of the International Council of Religious Education at the 25th annual meeting recently.\n\nOpportunities for the application of Christian principles to social life in a community should be afforded through work projects, which identify religious values as the expected conduct of the normal life instead of making religion a thing apart, Dr. Weaver recommended.\n\n\"The youth of today need a cultivation of their capacity to feel in terms of objects worthy of their emotion,\" Dr. Weaver said. \"They need sensitivity toward the real issues of life.

The Act gave the Church\na chance of keeping as many aid-\ned schools as she could possibly\nmanage.\nTurning to the Sunday schools,\nCanon Lesson observed that these\nhad set the pattern for State-aided\nschools long before the latter\ncame into existence at all. The\nSunday school teacher could not\nbe regarded as a Cinderella of\nthe teaching world. Speaking as\nan ex-headmaster and a parish\npriest, he considered that it was\neasier to teach in a day school\nthan in a Sunday school. He had\nbeen at Winchester said that they\nwould like to be teachers, he gen-\nerally advised them to get teach-\ning experience first in the Sunday\nschools of their parishes.\n\nEvery man feels instinctively\nthat all the beautiful sentiments\nin the world weigh less than\na single lovely action.\u2014J.

Every phase of Indian law, administration, education, medical services and general welfare has been quite well discussed and covered either by the witnesses called or in the briefs submitted by various organizations. There are many divergences of opinions, due mostly to the great variety of Indian tribes in Canada, and to their different status.\n\nTo get a true picture of the situation one should travel through the breadth and depth of Canada from the Arctic to the Pacific, from the U.S. border to the Arctic sea. It seems that many groups of Indians are ready for local self-government; incorporation in villages, hamlets, municipalities would give them a greater degree of self-governance, assigning them with definite rights and responsibilities. For other groups, less advanced, or nomadic, it will be some time yet before they can achieve any degree of self-government.\n\nThe recommendations of the Parliamentary Committee to the House of Commons, made in their fourth report, July 10, (published elsewhere in this issue), cover the main points discussed at the advancement of the Indians. It is regrettable however that the House of Commons has not paid much attention to the recommendations made in previous Committee reports. One instance: on August 15, 1948 it has been recommended that: \"more direct action be taken for the return of rentals collected on the behalf of Indian lessees\", -which recommendation has not yet been implemented.\n\nThe Old Age Pension Bill did not include any provisions for the Indians, the 1949 bill report states that there are no provisions to be made for the adequate care of aged, infirm or blind Indians; and that in the meantime rations given to properly care for Indians should be sufficient in quantity and quality.\n\nThere are many recommendations which require very certain and immediate implementation without necessitating the revision of existing legislation, and which, if they were put in immediate effect would remove some of the causes out of which have arisen many grievances and complaints of many Indians.\n\nIt is hoped that the new ministerial staff for Indian Affairs will be brought to bear in full the estimates made by Departmental officials. When an Inspector of Agencies tables his estimates, usually reduced to a bare minimum, it is most distressing to him to be told to further reduce his estimates, as there is not even money enough by far, therefore to cover them. While 40 day school rooms are urgently needed in Saskatchewan alone; yet only four schools will be built this year.\n\nA substantially larger appropriation and an immediate improvement in the administrative set-up and policy will go very far in fulfilling the obligations of Canadian citizens towards the Indians.\n\nIndian Missionary Recommendations\n\nOttawa\u2014Setting up of a separate Indians' affairs department with civil service preference for Indians employed on its staff was recommended by the joint parliamentary committee on Indians.\n\nThe committee's report, tabled in the Commons by chairman Don Brown, called for widespread changes in present Indian administration.\n\nThe report recommends re-appointment of the committee again next session to consider \"long overdue\" amendments to the Indian act.\n\nOther recommendations:\n\n1. An independent commission be established to inquire into the terms of all Indian treaties.\n\n2. That enfranchisement be left for future consideration of the committee next year.\n\n3. That the Indian affairs branch take \"immediate steps\" to remove non-Indians from reservations consistent with the wishes of the band concerned.\n\n4. Decentralization of the Indian administration with regional directors for various parts of the Dominion.\n\n5. Widening the competition field, now confined to local districts, for appointments as agents.\n\n6. Abolition of the \"permanent quota\" for the Indian administration staff.\n\n7. Immediate adoption of a project to erect central hospitals in northern areas and nursing sub-stations in remote areas.\n\n8. Statutory provision for the care of aged, infirm or blind Indians.\n\nThe committee proposes appointment of an Indian commissioner with deputy-ministerial rank as an alternative to establishment of a separate ministry. The commissioner would have two assistant commissioners, one each for Indians and Catholics of Indian descent.\n\nThe committee noted failure of the administration to act upon a recommendation made last year that more Indians be employed to collect land rentals on behalf of Indians. It urged that immediate steps be taken to remedy this grievance.\n\nPending further decisions, the committee urged that all educational matters, including the selection and appointment of teachers and school sites be placed under the direct and sole responsibility of the Indian affairs branch.\n\nIndian Aid Plea Made\n\nOTTAWA\u2014J. P. B. Osterland, inspector of Saskatchewan Indian agencies, told the joint parliamentary committee on Indians that large financial appropriations would be necessary before any program could be carried out.\n\nHe predicted \"the whole work of this administration will fail\" if more money is not granted for extension of education and health, upon which the future of the Indians depends.\n\nSaskatchewan needed buildings and teachers for 40 additional day schools to accommodate 900 children.\n\n$15 Million Grant for Indians Turned Down by Committee\n\nOTTAWA, June 10\u2014The joint parliamentary committee on Indian affairs rejected, not opposed, a motion recommending that at least $15,000,000 be granted to the Indian affairs branch this year.\n\nThe committee heard that Indians were in need of immediate assistance, was placed before the committee by John Blackmore, supported by G. R. Campbell.\n\nProgressive Conservative and Liberal committee members who opposed the measure said it failed to offer a plan by which the money could be spent. They opposed the committee defer any recommendations for expenditure until an interim or final report on its proceedings could be compiled in the fall.\n\nMr. Blackmore argued that some money should be spent in order to give departmental officials the opportunity to show what they could do with it. He said many members of the committee were agreed that expenditures in the past had been woefully inadequate.\nSurvey of Remote Bands\n\nOttawa\u2014An intensive survey of the economic, social, educational, and health status of one or more bands of remote Indians began in mid-June.\n\nThe purpose of the study is to examine the whole texture of life among the Indians and thereby to obtain a sound basis on which to plan ways and means of assisting the Indians to become self-supporting and to improve their way of life.\n\nCosts are being borne by a grant of $12,000 from the Canadian Life Insurance Company. Additional funds will be raised by the Indian Affairs Branch of the Department of Mines and Resources and the Indian Health Division of the Department of National Health and Welfare. A number of the investigators are donating their services.\n\nDuring the survey field activities will be carried out by specialists in agriculture, forestry, fisheries, education, nutrition, economics, sociology, and various aspects of public health and welfare.\n\nThe investigation was endorsed by the joint committee of the Senate and the House of Commons which is examining the Indian Act.\n\nToronto Folk Festival Features Indians\n\nToronto never before has seen an event so full of the elements contributing to contemporary civilization as the formal opening of the Folk Festival at the Art Gallery of Toronto June 19-20.\n\nIt combined, with thoroughness and artistry, all the factors contributing to the evolution of a distinctive Indian culture, now already taking form, but promising more for the future.\n\nThe keynote of the ceremony was struck by Chief Os-Kee-Pee-Ton, famous birchbark canoe builder, whose powerful effect on the oldest native North American songs, an invocation to the Sun, with which great councils of pre-discovery tribes were opened.\n\nRaymond Sappier and Audrey Sappier, Maliseet, N.B., married Feb. 16, 1947.\n\nWILCOXOMAGH, N.S.\n\nWe are sorry to report that Dr. McLeod passed away this loss is deeply felt by all who knew him.\n\nJoe Green and Dorothy GeoGoo have spent some time in Inverness Hospital. (L.J. GeoGoo, Corr.)\n\nColorful Show Includes Demon Masks to Scare Off Disease\n\nThe Canadian Handicrafts Guild sponsored an exhibition of Indian crafts at the Montreal Art Association.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes, of the Indian Affairs Branch, officially opened the display. He noted that the arts and crafts of the Indians expressed their moods, dreams and aspirations in life and varied exhibits demonstrated their versatility.\n\nThe speaker said that the Government department was most interested in the work of the Guild and its exhibition was very important from the cultural and aesthetic viewpoint, he stressed, and would help foster and revive the great cultural and historical significance of the Indian race.\n\nMr. MacInnes was introduced by Mrs. George Currie, president of the Quebec branch of the Guild, and thanked by Miss Alice Lighthall, chairman of the Indian and Eskimo Committee of the branch. The latter explained that many of the exhibits were the result of a contest in a nationwide contest for modern Indian craftsmen sponsored by the Guild to overcome the reluctance of the young Indians to use traditional techniques of their people.\n\nThe exhibition is largely made up of items from Canadian museums and private collections. During the tour the travelling exhibit will be sent throughout the Dominion and will be supplemented in each section by the handicraft of local Indians.\n\nIt is hoped to use the old standard of old-time Indian craftsmanship to inspire present-day Indians to do similar work.\n\nThe exhibition and exhibits include every phase of Indian craftsmanship and range from a birch bark canoe to demon masks to frighten away disease.\n\nRECORD, JULY-AUGUST, 1947\n\nCamperville, Man.

We received Children of Mary not only wear medals, but we have to give a good example and give ourselves to Mary and tell her many things about our Heavenly Mother.\n\nAfter Benediction we went to the picture show; there we met for the election of officers. Then the Creed was sung. We took some papers and pencils and we took a vote. Irene Levasseur was elected President and Marie Isabel McKay Vice-President, Isabelle McKay, Secretary, Dorcy Levasseur, Treasurer, and Elsie Sutherland, sacristan. Afterward we had lunch and we had lots of fun. To close we sang some songs to the Blessed Virgin Mary. As a result for our efforts, Father promised us a picnic. We are all very grateful to dear Father who is so generous and ready to please us.

He had a stroke, which looked fatal, but he regained consciousness and was able to confess his sins and receive the sacrament, the reward of his faithfulness to Sunday Mass, notwithstanding bad weather, poor roads and rough going. \"That knees was not enough, but it became worse on account of a fall on the bare ice while calling on a dying friend across the river. It caused much suffering during several months, but it was the occasion of much comfort and consolation by all his children and grand-children. Two of his sons, Gabe and Antoine, had to walk in swamps and wade through water in order to reach him. His son Charles was 82 years old. He had been married 55 and a half years. His funeral service was very moving, containing His Grace's great example\u2014a Christian life and of faithful marriage\u2014to his many relatives. R.I.P.\n\nFine Falls, Man., former Reserve land. The Fine Falls town would not be situated where it is today, had the Fort Alexander Indians refused to occupy the land.\n\nIn 1923 the Manitoba Paper Co. leased 520 acres at $2.00 per acre per annum. In 1926 the lease amounted to $3,120.00. The company purchased the cattle at $40.00 per acre. The sale gave $15,600.00, as total amount. In 1933 the Company returned the leased land, after paying $4,600.00.\n\nThe mill spoils the river, but it gives much employment to the Indians for the cutting and handling of pulp wood.\n\nOur sympathy to Adeodat Adam for the loss of his beloved father, who passed away on May 11th.\n\nOver the waves.

Paradis, O.M.I., the young men of this reservation organized a hockey team. The officers elected were Mr. Yenne, Pres., D. Lafond, Sec., D. Greyeyes, Coach.\n\nA rink was constructed and completed in two days. Two pie and bingo parties were then held to raise funds for the team. The sum of $110 was realized from these two parties. There were also several donations.\n\nStrenuous workouts were then held under the able eye of the coach whenever time permitted.\n\nShortly after Christmas, the team began to play with the nearby towns. Unfortunately, these teams proved no match for the razzle-dazzle play of our boys, and each time they were swept aside by a decisive goal.\n\nLater the team was invited to participate in Hockey tournaments held in Blaine Lake and Shellbrook for the Albany and Demers trophies.\n\nAt Blaine Lake, our boys managed to edge out the host community in the first game, 2-1. This game was the thriller of the day. They then ran riot over Marcellin in the second, 8-4; and went on to soundly trounce Blaine Lake in the final, 15-3.\n\nAt Shellbrook, competition was much stiffer. In the first game they edged out the home town by a score of 5-4; ran berserk over Pauling Lake, in the second, 11-4; and in the final they had to settle for a 1-4 defeat in the last two stanzas to end the important game of the day, 6-4.\n\nHad it not been for the unusual early thaw this spring, they would certainly have added more victories to their collection. They have been unbeaten during this past season. This is a very remarkable record for a team in its first season.\n\nIt is anticipated that next season will be bigger and better still. The team will then greatly be strengthened by discharged pupils from St. Michael's Institute, Shellbrook.\n\nAll members of this year's hockey team are ex-pupils of the above school with the exception of the coach, who received his hockey at Lebret, Sask.\n\nN.H.L. talent scout, where dost thou keep thyself?!!\n\nREV. MOTHER ST. JEAN BERCHMANS VISITS SURGEON LANDING, SASK.\n\nHeartily greeted by everyone, Rev. Mother St. Jean-Berchmans accompanied by S. S. Bernard, was our most welcome guest when she landed here on March 26, to spend the shortest week of the year.\n\nReverend Mother Marie kept us most keenly interested with her conferences; however none were as captivating as her tales of travels from Africa where she spent six months recently.\n\n\"A Welcome Concert\" was given by the children. The girls gracefully executed \"Just Like a Rainbow in Our Sky.\" Boys in military parade the hall to the tune of \"Marching as they marched to joyous chords of the Rhythm Band.\n\nOn the 27th Guides and Scouts rallied for celebrations. Flora Curstel's address was the expression of a heartfelt \"Thank You\" to our Reverend Mother who had generously answered their need of an extra Sister as claimed by the Guide Organization so well fostered by Reverend Father A. Giard since two years. The Red Cross Guides gave a First Aid demonstration.\n\nThe most striking event remains the courtesy of Rev. Father L. Pollier, our Principal, to whom we owe an unswerving pilgrimage, in honor of Divine Mother, a sleigh pilgrimage to the new Grotto erected last September.\n\nOur best wishes for the Missionary tour were most sincere on Wednesday, April 2, when our Reverend Mother Superior left for The Pas.\n\nRECORD JULY-AUGUST, 1947\n\n(Takwatcimowinensan)\n\nOo nin gi inatcimotak Pierre Katcheway Wackawinaning. \"Ni mindimoem Marie ka naitang mewija apine ki kitci akosise.

As part of its kind ever offered to cooks in the Indian schools, it was followed by a course specially planned for cooks' assistants.\n\nSponsored by the Indian affairs branch, instruction was given by Misses Margaret Lock, Alice McCready and Helen Wilson of the nutrition division, Department of National Health and Welfare.\n\nThe course stressed the importance of food as a means of improving and maintaining the health of the residents. The residential school cook included menu planning, use of recipes, food preparation, cooking and service, food storage, sanitation and the different phases of kitchen operation. Instruction was given on how cooks may teach Indian girls proper kitchen procedures and simple courses which they will do later in their homes.\n\nFor cooks' assistants the instruction covered the more important aspects of food service with special emphasis on food preparation, cooking and cleanliness. The cooks' assistants' course began July 11 and also lasted a week.\n\nSpanish School Changes Name\n\nThe Indian residential school conducted by the Jesuit Fathers at Spratt, Ont., is now called GARNIER School, in honour of St. Charles Garnier, one of the Canadian Jesuit martyrs.

If a young child is in evil surroundings, he will be more liable to turn out to be bad, whereas if he is placed in good surroundings, he will most likely turn out to be good.\n\nHence the Catholic Church has established its system of Catholic schools which, under the capable and pious direction of Sisters and Brothers, is a good place for children to be. The Sisters and Brothers spend two or three hours a day in prayer, meditation, and reading of spiritual books. All through the day they are thinking about the interests of God and not about the money they are going to get. All their work is done for the love of God. They are building up the matter; and they know that God loves children, and that is the reason that they, too, love children, and spend their whole lives in teaching children and in bringing them up to be good, respectable citizens.\n\nThe Sisters in the classroom help the children, natives in teaching the children. What could it be? They do not get money for doing this. They do not try to make leisure or ease for teaching children in a classroom is no easy work. Why do they do it? They do it because Christ loved the little ones. It is from the little ones of today that tomorrow's citizens are to be made. Besides teaching the children, they arithmetic, spelling, writing, reading, and so on, things which are necessary for good citizenship. In truth, the Sisters are also in earnest to see that the children prepare themselves for the life hereafter in heaven, when if they lose, they lose everything.\n\nIn other words, the Catholic Church is here to teach the truth. She received the authority to teach the truth from Christ. She teaches the truth about earth and about heaven. Her ultimate purpose is to lead men to heaven by teaching the truth as Christ taught it. This is one of the best ways for children to learn the straight road to heaven is through the agency of the Catholic School.\n\nAlberta Indians Would Rather Roam\n\nEDMONTON\u2014Provincial and federal government officials are wondering if they will ever succeed in getting 200 Indian signatures on the dotted line.\n\nTwo hundred Chippewa Indians, responsible for the longest holdout in the relations between the white man and the Indian, are making the 40th consecutive year they have refused to sign a treaty with the federal government.\n\nDominion and Alberta government officials recently returned from Rocky Mountain House, where they met here, in the latest of a series of unsuccessful attempts to induce the Indians to sign the treaty.\n\nThe party was led by M. McCrimmon, chief of the reserve division of the department of Indian affairs. He returned to Ottawa Monday night that the day is not too distant when the Chippewa band, members of the Algonquin tribe originally living in the vicinity of Lake Superior, would join their elders in signing the treaty.\n\nThe history of the Chippewa Indians opposition to treaty signing dates back to the late years of the last century when, all chiefs of the Indians nations of western Canada signed for their tribes.\n\nLater the situation was changed so that each Indian was required to sign individually for treaty rights. During the past 40 years the Chippewa Indians have refused to sign.\n\nThirty thousand acres of land are provided for the Indians in the same manner as other bands but the Chippewa tribesmen rove about in nomadic style on land to which they are not actually entitled.\nCaughnawaga Indians Hold Meeting\n\nMINUTES of a meeting of the Caughnawaga Band of Indians, held at the Kateri Tekakwitha Hall in Caughnawaga, May 26th, 1947, at 8 p.m.\n\nThe Indians attending chose Mr. Tom Lahache as Chairman, who acted as such throughout the meeting; and chose Mr. L. E. Beauvais as Secretary.\n\nAfter preliminary explanations, as to the purpose of the Meeting, came the question of Education for the Indians, particularly as regards denominational schools and non-denominational schools for Indians, and after a lengthy discussion by various speakers on Section 10, Sub-section 2; Section 10, Sub-section 3; and Section 10, Sub-section 2 and 3, of the Indian Act, it was unanimously decided by all Members of the Band present, as follows:\n\n1. That the Sections of the said Indian Act above quoted, namely\u2014Section 10, Section 100, Sub-sections 2 and 3, should remain as they are.\n\n2. That no change in the Indian Act should be made which would prevent Catholic parents from sending their children to Catholic schools.\n\nIn answer to the following question\u2014\"Where do you want your children, or grandchildren to go to school?\" each Indian present answered that they should be in favour of denominational schools, that is, to be able to send children to the school of their own faith.\n\nIt was also unanimously decided to request and urge the Indian Affairs Branch of the Department of Mines and Resources to adopt a policy of assisting and aiding Indian boys and girls to pursue studies in High Schools, Colleges, and Universities of the country, and that proper and sufficient financial assistance be given to such Indian Students by the Department.\n\nL. E. Beauvais,\nCaughnawaga,\nSecretary,\nMay 27th, 1947.\n\nMARIEVAL, SASK.\n\nWe, as treaty Indians, and members of the S.H.K. Club, wish to protest against any changes in our present school system for Indians, which in any way will alienate education from religious instructions.\n\nWe notice, in the Submission of the Union of Saskatchewan Indians to the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons, that it is stated that the two forms of education be separated. We are strongly opposed to this as we wish our children to have the benefits of religious instruction in their schools.\n\nFrom our own experience while attending Schools, we know that it is not beneficial to have religious teachers coupled with educational training. We do feel that our children should not be deprived of this great asset in building their character.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned\n\nThe S.H.K. Club:\nJ. Spryler, Pres.\nPaul Acosee, V.Pres.\nLieut. I.

Indians' children should be protected with prayer, religious and moral instructions in parochial schools of their faith. We believe that religion has a real bearing on the development of character.\"\n\nPreviously the Oak Lake, Oak River, and Standing-Buffalo Sioux had filed petitions for the opening of day schools on their respective reservations.\n\nThe brief lists 21 recommendations concerning the presentation of appreciation for services rendered to the Sioux Indians by the Government of Canada and by the religious bodies which have been devoted to their welfare and education.\n\nG.L.\n\nTHE PROMISE OF A REDEEMER\n\nAfter the fall of man from the grace of God, the earth seemed enveloped with darkness. You will find that the promise of salvation was given to men before they became numerous; and even after the destruction by the flood, the children of Noah, who were spared, in their turn also grew away from God.\n\nGod sent, from time to time, prophets, to renew among the nations the Faith in the Redeemer promised to our first parents.\n\nTo Abraham, to Isaac, to Jacob, God renewed His promises. Next to Moses, to King David, to Isaiah, next to the Prophets, finally to St. John the Baptist.\n\nA sacrifice is essentially the offering of an object to God alone, and the consuming of it to acknowledge that He is the Creator and Lord of all.\n\nThe purpose of the sacrifice was to make the people holy. It comprised three rites or ceremonies:\n\n1. OFFERTORY\u2014the victim was given to the priest for him to offer it to God.\n\n2. CONSECRATION\u2014the victim was laid on the altar, slain, and destroyed by fire to show how completely the offerer was giving himself to God.\n\n3. COMMUNION\u2014a part of the offering was given back to the offerer to sanctify him.\n\nHowever worthy these sacrifices were, they could certainly not satisfy the justice of God, nor could they possibly purify men from their sins.\n\nThe sacrifices made under the Old Law, foreshadowed the sacrifice of Christ on the Cross.\n\n(to be continued)\n\nSIOUX SPORTS AT FORT-QU'APPHELLE, SASK.\n\nOn July 11th the Standing-Buffalo Sioux played baseball.

Adrian, Corr.)\nTHE GREAT FLOOD \u2014 THE TOWER OF BABEL\n\nWhen God saw that the people had become evil, He was sorry He created them, and said: \"I will destroy man and all living creatures that I have created, from the face of the earth.\"\n\nAmong the sinful people there lived one just man who still loved God, his name was Noah. God spoke to him and said: \"To punish men for their wickedness I will send rain upon the earth, and there shall be a great flood. Every living creature shall be destroyed. Only you and your family shall be saved because you have loved and obeyed Me.\"\n\nGod then told Noah to build an ark of wood, three stories high and divided into little rooms.\n\nWhen the ark was finished God told Noah to go into the ark with his wife and his sons and their wives, also with seven pairs of clean animals and one pair of all the other living animals and other creatures, as well as much food for his family and for the animals.\n\nIt rained in torrents for forty days and nights; the waters covered the trees and the houses, and lifted the ark above the high mountains. Every creature was destroyed. The waters remained on the face of the earth for one hundred and fifty days, and gradually dried up.\n\nNoah's ark finally rested on the top of mount Ararat in Armenia. Noah opened the ark's doors, having sent out a raven, which did not come back he sent a dove which returned. A week later he sent the dove out again, but it came back with an olive leaf; the third time the dove was sent out it did not come back.\n\nThen Noah was commanded to leave the ark, so God he offered a sacrifice of thanksgiving to God for having saved him from the waters of the great flood.\n\nGod promised Noah that He would never again destroy the earth by water and He said: \"As a sign of My promise I shall set my bow in the heavens and when I shall cover the sky with clouds and send the rain upon the earth, My rainbow shall appear and I shall see it, and remember My covenant to save you and your children and their children for all time.\"\n\nAfter many years the human race grew larger and larger. Some of them built a large city and a tower of bricks. The tower grew taller from day to day; God saw what was in the hearts of these people, and he doomed them for their pride. Little by little the language of each family became different from that of another, and they could no longer work together; they ceased to build the city and the tower. God scattered these people from that place, called BABYLON, into all lands.\n\nThe sons of Noah were Sem, Japhet and Cham. The five sons of Sem settled in Persia, Asshria, Syr, Chaldea and Mesopotamia. The seven sons of Japhet settled in Greece, Scythia, Thrace; while the four sons of Cham went to Chanan, Ethiopia and Egypt.\n\nEgypt was a fertile country along the banks of the river Nile; eventually the kingdom of Egypt was established at a Pharaoh. The land of Babylon was populated by the Assyrians, whose greatest king was Hamurabi. The Canaanites, who came after the Hittites dwelt; they inhabited Palestine, and later, were called Chanaanites. The human race had now begun to spread all over the face of the earth.\n\n(To be continued).\n\n\"INDIANS' TREK TO MINERAL FIND?\"\n\nFLIN FLON, Man.\u2014Another nickel-copper rush is on at Lynn lake.\n\nThe rush started when some 20 to 40 Indian residents of Sioux Indian lake, 250 miles northeast of The Pas, suddenly began applying for prospectors' licences at the recorder's office. There are promising claims between Sioux Indian Lake and Granville lake, the eastern extension of the Lynn lake exploration area.\n\nClaims staked by the members of the native prospectors are reported carried by the Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting company and International Nickel of Canada Limited.\n\nAlthough many mineral finds in the north have been recorded at the recent discovery of copper smelting rocks, this rush is unusual in that it is the first prospecting rush spearheaded by the native finders themselves.\n\nINTERNATIONAL NICKEL OF CANADA LIMITED\n\nThe burial, presided over by Fr.

The trilling of birds, the honking and trumpeting of the water-fowl, the gurgling of the running brooks, the softly sighing breeze, everything animate and inanimate sang the new birth of nature.\n\nAs Daniel Little was busying himself with the morning chores, he resolved to have a heart-to-heart conversation he had had the previous evening with his grandfather.\n\nThe Sun-Dreamer had attempted in vain for the past few years to induce his grandson to marry. Often he had told him: \"You are a man now, in a short time you will be old before that time you must get yourself a woman and live in your own house and raise children... Look over the maidens among our people and make up your mind on one.\" But Daniel had always felt annoyed when his grandfather told him these things.\n\nThe previous day the patience of the Sun-Dreamer was nearly at an end because he had felt his end coming near... and he wanted security for his grandson. That is why Daniel thought he would have to go out to the ordering of presents to the Old-Wise-Stutterer as to win the hand of his daughter; the Doe-Maiden.\n\nBut Daniel did not want to be compelled into marriage, so he had refused although some notable people of his kin had done so before, by Ahlo-Hoksha and Woonikapi-anai.\n\nHe did not want to expose himself to the ridicule attached to such a practice. He was still young and confident, and why should he not wait a while and enjoy his freedom for a few more years?\n\nAfter a frugal breakfast Daniel left his grandfather, having made sure he needed nothing during the time he would be away. \"I will be back early in the next moon,\" he said.\n\nAs Daniel trotted along on his pony he was filled with joy, reverence and thankfulness at the beauty of nature. He listened with pleasure to the symphony of spring; the regular pounding of the horse's hoofs sounded like beating drums, and the jingling of the halter-chains was like merry bells.\n\nAs he went along the Willowbunch trail, his thoughts gradually returned to the Doe-Maiden, the daughter of the Stutterer. Her mother was a Lakota, and as such, she was of his own kind. Yet, when he met her face to face for the first time, quite accidentally, he had never dared raise his eyes upon her, and he had always been too bashful to speak to her, yet guiltily he thought. If he had been deliberately unmannerly and impolite, he thought, but then he excused himself: \"oh well, what do I mean to pay anyway?\"\n\nYet, today at the thought he would have to meet her, and that he would have to live at her house for several weeks, Daniel felt deep trouble rising within him. For a while he thought of turning back but the fact that he was practically penniless urged him on to his destination.\n\nAs a last compromise Daniel deliberately went out of his way to reach the ranch of LeBeque, and stopped a few hours at Scout Lake for his lunch. In the late afternoon he postponed another day, Daniel added his heavy pack, and headed back towards the ranch.\n\nLeBeque greeted him cordially: \"How Kola!\" (Hello Friend). Daniel immediately set to work until dusk.\n\nAs he came into the ranch house for supper LeBeque called out his dingy name: \"Marianne! Come to meet a stranger!\" The girl came into the kitchen where Daniel was washing, and her father added: \"Daughter, may I present to you our unknown sweetheart, Daniel Little, the grandson of the Sun-Dreamer...\"\n\nThe two young people were too stunned to realize what was happening. LeBeque was so earnest, or whether he was jesting as usual. They just stood there gazing at one another. They did not even touch hands.\n\nFor the first time Daniel had set his eyes upon the beautiful maiden, he was rapt in admiration. The Doe-Maiden was the fairest daughter of the Lakotas, with raven-black hair and braided in the shape of her roundish but delicate face. Her short but comely body was graceful and poised, her eyes sparkled with excitement and the whole face glowed with delight at the sight of Daniel, and she blushed deeply.\n\nFor a few moments she too was rapt in ecstasy at the sight of the tall and erect bronze hero of her dreams. LeBeque aroused them from their trance. \"Forget the introduction, Dan,\" he said, \"have a bottle of beer, while supper is being prepared.\"\n\nThe women bustled themselves at the table, as it was ready all of them ate in silence. The meal over Daniel and LeBeque went out again for a while, but there was nothing said to indicate that LeBeque was further interested in the meeting of the two young people.\n\nDuring the evening Daniel did not dare to look at Marianne, but he and LeBeque talked business the girl and her mother silently appraised him; they were full of silent admiration. Marianne felt ill at ease with everyone excepting her father and Daniel, and she wondered why his presence affected her so much. Daniel felt quite at home, yet there was a certain reserve in his demeanour that betrayed his innate self-consciousness.\n\nThe round up lasted two weeks. Daniel rode wide and under circuits to see every stock house. Sometimes he had to spend the night out on the range, or at some farm home, as the horses had strayed far away during the unguarded several nights.\n\nAt times Marianne worried over him, fearing some harm had come to him, and her joy at seeing him returning home after a few days absence was evident. She knew that he would not even admit to herself.\n\nWhile Daniel spent another two weeks at LeBeque's\u2014much to Marianne's regret\u2014not only did the young people show any sign of affection or even interest in one another. At night, sometimes, Daniel would hear Marianne and Marianne would sing the words softly\u2014and this set her dreaming but she never remained very long in his company.\n\nWhen the LeBeques went to nearby Scout Lake in the evening, Daniel always found some excuse to remain at the ranch, then he would go alone on horseback and come back early before the family returned home.\n\nOne day Daniel asked LeBeque for his pay; the rancher wanted to keep him for the seeding of his crop, but Daniel went his way.\n\nHe visited his grandfather whom he had not seen for nearly a month, and nothing could prevent him from returning home when he had the urge.\n\nWhen he left the house he did not say goodbye to Marianne, but she knew he was leaving. She went up to her room, watched him ride out of sight, and then she threw herself on her bed, crying bitterly.\n\nAs Daniel returned home in the early evening his heart was heavy. He realized he loved Marianne deeply. He realized the width of the gulf that separated them. She was the daughter of a well to do white man; she had been raised in comfort and luxury, and although her mother was a Lakota, she had the ideals, the culture and the customs of the white people. She was very popular among them, and many a young man had set his heart on her.\n\nDaniel considered his own poverty and the uncertainty of his future and compared it to the steadfastness and prosperity of the white. Rightly the Lakotas called him the Washicu (Spirit-man)\u2014because he had learned the secret of the powers of nature and had mastered them. Marianne was of a progressive race, and what could he offer to her the security and the luxuries she would expect from a husband?\n\n\"No, the Doe-Maiden will never know how much I love her,\" Daniel vowed to himself, \"I am not worthy of her. I will go on my lone trail, the old trail of the Lakotas.\"\n\nThe following day Daniel went to Wood Lake and there he wrote a letter for her friend from Scout Lake. He offered her his hand in marriage.\n\n\"Dear Mr. Daniel,\n\nCould you please make a saddle for me, report style, with square skirts, stamped with flowers throughout, I would like the following initials inscribed on it: D & M. I guess you could use any other letters. They may mean the maker and the owner of the saddle, for one thing... How soon can you fill my order?\n\nYours truly, Marianne LeBeque.\n\nDaniel was astonished. This letter had been written while he was at her place; why then did she not ask him verbally? What did she really mean when she wrote those one thing... What was the other meaning?\n\nThen it dawned upon Daniel that perhaps she too loved him, and that aside the material things of life, there were the nobler aspirations of the heart and soul which directed the actions of men.\nLET US CARRY ON THE WORK OF THE CATHOLIC PRESS FOR THE INDIANS OF CANADA.

These sows were raised by boys belonging to the Swine Club.\n\nOne of the main features of the fair took place on Friday afternoon when Claire Wallace, who knew nothing about Indians, did her broadcast from the Fair Grounds. She commented on the exhibits and prize winners. Heard on her broadcast were Lt. Col. E. P. Randle, Superintendent of the Six Nations, Enos Maracle, Chief Councillor. During the broadcast, Princess Waiting By The Village (Mrs. George Green), asked Claire Wallace if she thought she could accept an Indian name.

As far as is known she is the first woman to be engaged in such research on this reserve.\n\nMrs. Huot has been living at No. 11 School with her ten-year-old daughter, Jennifer, and eight-year-old son, Jonathan. A grant from the Viking Fund for research in social sciences enables her to do her work. At present she is striving to receive her Ph.D. degree from Columbia University. In previous years she has done research in other Indian languages.\n\nConcerning the Mohawk language Mrs. Huot states that it has changed a lot in the last hundred years. She says that the language, the way it is spoken today, compares quite differently with the first published works in the tongue. Pointing out that language and music are the two living parts of a culture, Mrs. Huot observed that the Iroquoian language and music have survived the influence of the white man admirably.\n\nClean Farm Competition\n\nThe results of the Clean Farm competition sponsored by the Agricultural Society, are: Richard E.

The Iroquois tribe lived in the United States at the Mohawk Valley what is now New York State, south of Lake Ontario. The famous Iroquois had found British officials trustworthy.\n\nIn the time of the Seven Years' War Europe, England tried to tax the American colonies. The colonies revolted and declared themselves independent of Great Britain.\n\nWhen the American colonies talked of celebrating the Iroquois tribe under the Mohawk Chief Joseph Brant, remained loyal to the British Crown. During that time, Captain Joseph Brant, the leader of the Iroquois tribe, came to the aid of the Loyalists. In 1775 he met King George III, the ministers of State, and many other distinguished people. He sailed homeward in the autumn of 1776. With his people he fought gallantly on the side of the Loyalists.\n\nIn the years that followed a guerrilla warfare was waged in New York between the Loyalists and the Revolutionists. It was a bitter struggle but in 1778 the Americans won the war and declared their independence from Britain.\n\nWhen the war was over the whole territory of the Iroquois passed to the United States. The Iroquois tribe rather than remain under the Americans set up new homes in British territory.\n\nIn 1784 Brant went to see Sir Frederick Haldimand, the Governor of Canada in order to receive a grant of land for the Six Nations. After some agreement with the British government, Brant obtained a grant of land six miles wide on each side of the Grand River from its mouth to its source.\n\nBrant sold most of the land which belonged to the Indians\u2014claiming that it was a gift from God and they could not part with it as they wished. The land which is now left on the Six Nations Reserve, is about 100 square miles, the population is 5,500 people.\n\nThe majority of the people is mixed farming, the soil is very rich. There are schools, churches and a hospital for the people. Their houses are very comfortable. The people on the reserve will live and enjoy this land forever.\n\nFor a number of years it has been the custom of the Women's Literary Club of St. Catharines to present a prize of Mrs. J. G. Currie's book \"Canadian Reminiscences\" to the pupil of the public schools writing the best essay on an historical subject. This year the prize was won by Orma General of No. 2 school and was presented at a garden tea given by the Club on Saturday September 18th at the home of Mr. Edwin Secondy St. Catharines. Accompanied by her teacher, Miss Julia L. Jamieson, Orma General attended the tea to receive her prize.\n\nAutomobile Accident\n\nTwo cars were badly damaged in an accident on the 2nd Concession near S.S. No. 9 school. The drivers of the cars were Richard Jones and Andrew Jones. The only other occupant in the Johnston car was Hilton Sherry. All received minor injuries and were treated at the Lady Willingdon Hospital.\n\nTROPHY DISPLAY AT INDIAN FAIR\n\nAn interesting exhibit at the Ohsweken Fair was a display of the trophies won by the Ohsweken Archery Club. A large shield in the centre of the exhibit was the Canadian Indoor Match Championship 1946-47, won by the Six Nations Archery Club. A large silver cup was the International Target Championship Canadian National Exhibition 1947, won by Ernie Obediah who also won the Canadian Target Championship, a smaller cup. Another cup was that of the Canadian Ladies Target Championship C.N.E. 1947, won by Mrs. Mary Obediah. Mrs. Mary Mary Obediah also won the Ladies and Men's Championship cups at the Dundas Centennial 1947. A wood carving of a totem pole with an Indian beside it was the trophy of the annual John VanEvery Memorial Tournament 1947 won by Ernie Obediah. Another trophy, a silver figure on a dark wooden base, was the Ladies John VanEvery Memorial Trophy won by Mary Obediah. Also displayed was a Target Prize Canadian National Exhibition 1947 won by Reg. W. Hill.\n\nSOUR SPRINGS W.I.\n\nThe Sour Springs Women's Institute held their September meeting at the home of Mrs. Joseph Martin. The meeting opened with the usual proceeding. In answer to the roll call, each member gave five cents for each letter of their Christian names. The Fall Fair exhibit was discussed and plans were made. Mrs. W. F. Powles gave very timely hints on the growing of flowers. An interesting feature of the meeting was the judging of housegrown bouquets arranged by some of the members. The contest was won by Mrs. R. Williams. Second prize went to Mrs. W. F. Powles and third prize to Mrs. J. Smith. The meeting closed with the National Anthem and the hostess served dainty refreshments.\nSocial Happenings\n\nDr. and Mrs. Elmer Jamieson and family, Toronto, spent last week-end at their home on the Reserve.\n\nMrs. George Jamieson and daughter Eleanor visited friends in Wallace Island and Detroit recently.\n\nMiss Eleanor Jamieson, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. George Jamieson, Ohsweken, is working in the office of the Canadian Order of Foresters, Toronto, and attending evening classes at Shaw's Business College.\n\nMrs. Doris Holmes, sister of Minnie McDonald, Hagersville, and wife of a former resident doctor on the Reserve, attended the wedding of Paul with his sister Dr. and Mrs. Holmes are now living in the West.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Fred J.

One, Mistletoe, kept shouting, \"Get up, poor man, take a rest,\" but nobody paid any attention. Then the agonized voice of the Irishman rose above the din: \"Will the lot of ye hould yer tongues and let Maggie Riley speak?\"\n\nWomen can keep a secret just as well as men but it takes more of them to do it.\n\nAbout the time you're important enough to take two hours for lunch the doctor limits you to a glass of milk.\n\nSix Nations' Fair\n\nContinued from page one\n\nMiss Wallace was accompanied in the Fair by an assistant Florence Craig and her son Wally Balfry.\n\nOn Friday evening a concert was held in the Community Hall presented by Mr. David Mitson and the Ohsweken Band.

When completed this building will be our new Community Hall. This building was a gift from the Six Nations' Council.\n\nA meeting of the Women's Institute was held at the Council House on September 16. Sorry we can't tell what went on behind closed doors.\n\nPerhaps with the grain in the farmers' barns in the elevators, we may try to assess the 1947 crop locally. The spring grain crop could be summed up as quite light because of the small acreage put in. Surprisingly enough wheat was harvested in reasonably good quality. The wheat crop was fair, although there were not the yields of 1944 or 1946. After a two month drought pastures are in good condition.\n\nHave you tried to sell a fat stocker recently? The prices offered and the prices asked for on the counter makes one wonder what is going on.\n\nWe are not authorities on farm problems but we can't help thinking or wondering why farmers couldn't sell all their livestock directly to consumers. If this would bring into line the present participants in our meat strike.\n\nThe New Credit School has been equipped with a radio. We can't tell yet what will be the results.\nBIRTHS\n\nHILL\u2014Born at the Brantford General Hospital on August 11th, to Mr. and Mrs. Josiah Hill, a daughter, Arlene Sharon.\n\nGENERAL\u2014Born at the Lady Willington Hospital on August 28th, to Mr. and Mrs. Arthur General, a daughter, Phyllis.\n\nJACOBS\u2014Born at the Lady Willington Hospital on August 8th, to Mr. and Mrs. Oliver Jacobs, a daughter, Sylvia Ruth.\n\nJOHNSON\u2014Born at the Lady Willington Hospital on August 26th to Mr. and Mrs. Henry Johnson and a son, Donald Dale.\n\nMONTOUR\u2014Born at the Lady Willington Hospital on August 31st to Mr. and Mrs. Albert Ernest Montour, a daughter, Sandra Irene.\n\nWILLIAMS\u2014Born at the Lady Willington Hospital on August 11th, to Mr. and Mrs. Cecil Williams, a son, Vernon.\n\nHUGHES\u2014Born at the Grace Hospital, Detroit, Michigan, on August 19th, to Mr. and Mrs. Charles L.

They should make laws for the Great Peace whose purpose shall be to abolish war and robbery between brothers and bring peace and quietness.\n\nThey now composed their peace song which had the power to make straight the path of Adadahro if it stood without error.\n\nThe emblems of the chieftainship titles are deer antlers which should be worn upon the heads of the confederate chiefs.\n\nThe two men then told the Mohawk Council of their plan for a council and the building of a house of peace. He Degannahwide, told them that all the chiefs must be very virtuous, patient men. These shall wear deer horns because emblem of their position because their strength comes from the meat of the deer. It was necessary to know the Mohawk Council's opinion and have its consent before they could proceed.\n\nThe two men talked about in the council and the Mohawk speaker said that they, the Mohawks, would hold to the Tree of Peace and would talk strongly for peace. Their hearts were happy at the thought of coming together.\n\nMessengers were sent to the Oneidas (People of The Stone) to ask them if they would consider the plan.\n\nAfter considering the plan for one year, Gaius Beaver (Olatshodeh), head chief of the Oneidas, said \"We will join the Confederation\".\n\nTwo messengers were sent toward the setting sun. They carried wampum strings and the invitation to join the Confederacy. They arrived in the country of the People of the Muckland, or Great Pipe People (Cayugas). They built their fire as was the custom and recited their message. One year from that date, the Cayugas sent word, \"We do agree with Degannahwide and Hiawatha. We will hold fast to the Tree of Peace\".\n\nA runner was sent to the People of the Great Hill (Senecas). They lived toward the rising sun (west).\n\nThey were divided in their opinions. One large band lived west of the Genesee River. They were allied with the Erie Nation who were against the League. The second who resided near the Great Mountain near Canandaigua Lake, were for the League. Messengers built their smoke fires near both bands and they were both invited to join.\n\nThe People of the Great Hill were divided and would not agree because there had been trouble between their war chiefs. They asked the messengers of Degannahwide to return the next year.\n\nBut consultation finally and considered the proposals. After a year had passed, they sent messengers to say that they had agreed to enter into the Confederacy, that they would grasp the Tree of Peace.\n\nThe Onondagas Nation and the Five Hills had been approached before. The people wanted to enter the Confederacy, but had hesitated to agree officially because of their fear of Adadahro. When a messenger approached them, however, they also had agreed to enter the Confederacy.\n\nDegannahwide requested the Mohawks to again call a council and at this council all of the people were present. At this Mohawk council the two men then reported all that had been done during the five successive years. \"We have obtained the consent of the Five Nations. They are the Mohawks, the Oneidas, Cayugas, Senecas. Our desire is to form a compact for the union of our nations\", he said.\n\n\"Our next step is to seek out the fire of Adadahro; it is he who always sets at naught our plans for a peace league\", he said.\n\nContinued in next issue\nSocial Happenings\n\nMiss Patricia Lett, resident nurse at the Lady Willington Hospital, spent her three weeks' vacation at her home in Ottawa.\n\nMiss Anne McKenzie has returned to the Lady Willington Hospital after spending a year at a hospital on the West Coast.\n\nMrs. J.

Not only did they win the efficiency award for \"E\" Group, but also that highly-sought award, the Challenge Cup, emblematic of top Cadet Corps in the Province for the year. Congratulations! It is a well-known fact that competition for this honour is keen, and this year was no exception, Yorkton and Star City tied for runner-up, and were not far behind the winners in points.\n\nAn outstanding feature is the fact that the Hugonard Corps has only been in operation for four years, and therefore makes the award most deserving. The Corps was organized in 1942 with Lieut. M. Bedard as Instructor, and an enrolment of 31 Cadets. They got down to business right away; and came first in their group, in the Annual Inspection that year.\n\nIn 1945, Mr. F. Verreault joined the staff to assist Lieut. Bedard, as the strength of the Corps had increased to 49. A very fine showing was made that year also. Lieut. Ed. Doll took over as Instructor in 1946, and under his guidance the Corps has made tremendous strides, hitting a peak performance this year.\n\nAt camp this year, these lads gave a good account of themselves. Remember that thrilling mile race won by Pat Fourhorns, and Pat had to be coaxed to run too.\n\nNot content with all this, the Corps has gone on to add new laurels to its crown, competing successfully in various other events. To quote some of them:\n\nThe Baseball League Trophy, donated by the Principal of the school, Father Piche, O.M.I., was won by these lads. Teams that comprised the league were Balcarres, Lebret, Fort Qu'Appelle, and Lebret Indian School. During the hockey season these lads lost only one game. Nice going. At the annual Track and Field Meet, held at Fort Qu'Appelle in May, further honours were won. The Intermediate and Grand Aggregate Cups, and they tied with the Fort for the Senior and Junior Cups. Right in there pitching eh?\n\nTo prove that they also have talent in other directions, several members of the Band participated in the Lebret Musical Festival. All made good marks, and the Cadet Gordon John had the distinction of winning not only a silver medal, but a scholarship as well. Nice going Gord.\n\nIn Dramatics, notable success was achieved by winning the local and the Regina Festivals. This placed them in the finals for South Saskatchewan at Moose-Jaw, where they came only one point behind the winners. It is the considered opinion of many that the Indian School play was by far the superior, but the judges decisions were final. Lieut. Ed. Doll, Instructor is also the Sports and Dramatic Coach, and in no small way has contributed to these various successes. His lads think him pretty swell. Lieut. Doll is planning to have his hockey team compete with the one at St. Joseph's School in Regina, this fall. Capt. Kartusch, Instructor there, assures him of stiff competition. This inter-Cadet Corps competition is a grand idea, and it would certainly assist in many ways if carried out more extensively. How about getting together and exchanging a few games here and there?\nAll in all it seems that the Indian lads are set to go places, and other Corps will certainly have to hustle if they want to catch up and surpass them next year. After being in operation only four years, it is all the more credit to these lads for their fine Cadet achievement.\n\nWe are very proud that Cadets can enter into other fields of competition, and emerge with such distinction. Hugonard has set an example. Let's all \"dig in\" and produce that \"little bit extra\" this year, and \"may the best Corps win\".\n\nA/I Hasting.\n\nA SPORTSMAN.\n\n1.

Tutthill\nTHE SUPERINTENDENT'S FOREWORD\n\nIt is indeed a privilege to speak to all the members of our fellowship at the beginning of a new school year. Fully one-third are new workers who have answered our call from every part of Canada. We welcome them and wish them well, while we are thankful that so many veterans have been willing to carry on for another year.\n\nThe flowing tide in Indian Affairs The longebb has ended and the tide is flowing strongly. National interest is growing through the work of the Parliamentary Committee, through many articles in the press, and through new activity in the Indian Affairs branch. Among Indians there is a real revival and provincial organizations are gaining strength. It has meant very much that at last opportunity has been given for public expression of grievance and desire. In the Church there is also an awakening and the recent Conference of Indian Workers at Saskatoon gives evidence of this. As a result there will soon be a new S.C.C. ready to concentrate upon Indian work and to find and train recruits for it. For every quarter emphasis seems to be laid upon education as the essential basis for the advancement of our Native Canadians and it is encouraging to know that we are in the main stream of this effort.\n\nThe end for which we strive The full development of thousands of Indian and Eskimo boys and girls, in body, mind and spirit is our goal. For formative years many of them are placed in our care at a sacrifice to their parents. Many a home lacks childish laughter and high spirits for ten months of the year. How glad is our trust to them it has been said - \"Take this child and nurse it for Me.\"\n\nThe means we must use We shall best attain our end as we respond all our works done for love of our Saviour and Lord. Realising and responding to His love we shall see each child as dear to Him and shall still be patient and kind even when childish mischief and perversity must try him. The recognition that all is done for Him and must be done in His spirit is the necessary motive and means to our high end.\n\nAlong practical lines we are confident that marked advances are being made. Our pupils are being better fed and the general level of health is undoubtedly higher today than in the front line of the war against T.B. and other scourges and the fight is being won. The transition from too much work and too little play is gradually being made, though some older workers find it hard\n\n(concluded on next page)\nOur New Primate\n\nWe desire to share in the general satisfaction at the election of the Right Rev. G. F. Kingston as Primate of All Canada. In this office his Grace will also be the head of the Missionary Society and it is an encouragement to know that in him our Indian schools will have a true friend. As Bishop of Algoma, the Primate showed a keen interest in the work of the Shingwauk school and he and Mrs. Kingston were always ready to attend its functions and give every assistance in their power.\n\nnew official at hq\n\nIt is with great pleasure that we announce the appointment of Major-General G.R. Turner to the staff of the Administration. He will have general charge of the business end of our work and brings to the office very wide experience in the Canadian Army. For his military service he received the honours of D.C.M., M.C. and C.B. The following particulars of General Turner's record may be of interest.\n\nGeneral Turner was born and educated in New Brunswick and was engaged in railway construction engineering until August, 1914, when he enlisted in the ranks and proceeded overseas with the Engineers of the First Canadian Contingent, serving overseas throughout the First World War and reaching the rank of Major. He was appointed to the Permanent Force (R.C.E.) in 1917. General Turner served as Engineer Officer in a number of large Canadian centres (including construction work for the R.C.A.F. in northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan), as Assistant Director of Engineer Services at N.D.H.Q., Ottawa and as Instructor at the Royal Military College, Kingston. He was also on the General Staff at Ottawa and Victoria. He spent about five years in all at various military schools and colleges in England and India.\n\nIn 1939, General Turner proceeded overseas as Senior General Staff Officer, 1st Canadian Division and held various senior appointments with the Canadian Corps and the First Canadian Army. He returned to Canada in 1944 and in 1945 was Inspector General (Army) Western Canada with headquarters at Calgary. He retired in 1946, having reached the age limit for the post-war Army.\n\nGeneral Turner is an active member of Christ Church Cathedral parish in Ottawa, president of the Red Chevron Club of Ottawa and chairman of the Ottawa Branch, Engineering Institute of Canada.\n\nO#O#O\n\nSuperintendent's Foreword - conclusion\n\nto adapt themselves to new ways and the scrubbing brush is still a fetish in some quarters. More time is being spent in classrooms and in practical training, and ambition is being aroused in a larger number of our pupils to fit themselves for the leadership of their people in the New Day opening before them. For all, it is our aim that their years at school may be truly happy and that our influence shall aid them to find God and establish the foundations of Christlike character.\n\n\"Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know your labour is not in vain in the Lord.\"\nOn Parliament Hill\n\nThe illness of the Hon. J. A. Glen, minister of Mines and Resources, has continued but it is hoped that he may be able to resume his duties in the fall. In the meantime, the Deputy Minister, Dr. Hugh Keenleyside, has spent the greater part of the summer in visiting Indian work across the Dominion. His travels have taken him to the Pacific Coast and also as far north as Arctic.\n\nDr. Paul Martin, Minister of National Health & Welfare, has also been travelling and spent some time at Moose Factory in connection with the new Sanatorium to be constructed there.\n\nThe Parliamentary Committee considering Indian Affairs presented an interim report at the end of the Session. We append some of the more important recommendations.\n\n5. That the matter of enfranchisement of Indians be left for further consideration when the Indian Act is under revision.\n\n8. That the whole matter of the education of Indians be left over for further consideration. In the meantime, however, it is recommended that all educational matters, including the selection and appointment of teachers in Indian Schools be placed under the direct and sole responsibility of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\n9. That the administration of all aspects of Indian Affairs should be under one ministerial head.\n\n10. The Director of the Indian Affairs Branch should be given the status, if not the rank, of deputy minister to permit him to have direct approach to his and other departmental heads; or, he should be named a Commissioner who shall rank as Deputy Minister and who shall have at least two Assistant Commissioners of whom one should be a Canadian of Indian descent.\n\n11. That Indians who are qualified for any position in the administration of Indian Affairs, at any level, be given a preference for appointment to such positions within that administration for which they qualify or are suited.\n\n15. That in view of the fact that Indian reserves are widely scattered across Canada, and in view of the diversity of the problems confronting those charged with the administration of Indian Affairs, the Indian Affairs Branch should be decentralized and regional directors be appointed to look after and to determine such matters as appropriately fall within their particular regional jurisdiction.\n\n25. That the project of building a central governmental hospital in northern Indian agencies, with nursing stations in far outlying districts, be proceeded with at once.\n\n26. That some statutory provision be made for the adequate care of aged, infirm or blind Indians; and that in the meantime rations given to Indians should be sufficient in quantity and quality.\nWe regret that the resignation of Mr. J.C.H. Forward has necessitated a change in the headquarters staff of our Administration. Mr. Forward has spent just over two years with us since his discharge from the Army and in this time has become well-known throughout the schools. He is now returning to Winnipeg to assume new duties.\n\n---\n\nPRINCIPALS\n\nArchdeacon Cook is continuing as principal at Moose Factory for the present with the assistance of Mr. H. E. Taylor as Vice-principal. The Rev. J. W. Ellis has taken over the reins at Carcross and the Rev. A. Brown Christie is the new chief at St. John's, Wabasca.\n\nMr. Taylor served in the Army and has occupied a government position since his return. He has, however, been anxious to undertake missionary service and we are glad to enlist him as a member of our staff. Mrs. Taylor is a qualified teacher who also served in the Armed Forces and will now take charge of one of the classrooms at Moose Factory. Mr. Ellis served for some years as missionary and day school teacher at Old Crow and is therefore not a newcomer to the Yukon. Mr. Christie came to this country from England a year ago though he claims Scotland as the land of his birth. He has had considerable school experience in England and for the past year has given assistance in an Ottawa parish. We are glad to have the services of these keen young men in the difficult northern posts to which they have gone.\n\n---\n\nYELLS!\n\nDan Cupid has been busy the last few months. We have heard of four workers who have taken the matrimonial plunge lately. Miss Annabelle Stranger and Mr. Douglas Whittingham were married at the end of July at Moose Factory. They have since travelled to Fort George to serve on the staff there. Over on the West Coast, we find another pair of newlyweds in Mr. & Mrs. Rex Benson, she being the former Miss Iuriel Barford. They are both continuing on the staff at Alert Bay. Early August saw the marriage of Miss Margaret Armitage and Mr. William Sprague who had both served on the staff at Chapleau. Congratulations and best wishes to you all!\n\nMiss Ada Watton of the Shingwauk staff leaves at the end of this month to be married. She will be missed very much and we wish her every happiness.\n\n---\n\nYELLS! We rejoice with the Rev. A.L. and Mrs. Davies on the recent arrival into the world of Derwyn Trevor, with Mr. & Mrs. Victor Whittingham on the addition to their family and with Mr. & Mrs. Eric Calrow on the birth of a son.\n\n---\n\nA recent visitor to the office has been Miss Helena Sowden who will return to England in October and will endeavour to obtain some volunteers for our work there.\nHave you a good idea to share with others? Does your school do things a little differently? Let us know about it so that we may pass it along.\n\nAt CHAPEL, hymns for morning and evening prayer are chosen by the boys and girls alternately.\n\nWhy not sing grace at mealtimes occasionally? There are several short and simple ones that the children can learn without difficulty. If you care to obtain any of these, just send a request to the office, 102 Bank Street, Ottawa.\n\nHaving difficulty getting the children to read aloud? Miss C. Hauver at Prince Albert uses the following method to overcome the children's hesitancy. She asks a child to read from his text-book (e.g., John said, \"Mary, give me your book\") and then has him address the request, statement or question he has just read to a classmate, who would respond with the appropriate action or reply. In addition to this, Miss Hauver has the children enact Nursery Rhymes, while she herself is narrator. A big box at one end of the classroom contains costumes and props of a very simple nature and from this the children get hats, aprons, pie plates or whatever is required to put them 'in character'. The actors speak the dialogue and Miss Hauver reads the descriptive portions. The children apparently enjoy this way of learning their lessons and it certainly helps to develop their self-confidence.\n\nAt ELKHORN, the teachers take extra duty (e.g., dining room supervision) during the weekdays in order to have the weekend free. This plan was also being tried at Prince Albert towards the end of last term so that the teachers there might have weekends off in rotation.\n\nThe Kitchen Matron at a certain school presented her graduating students with copies of the Pocketbook Cook Book, which they had learned to follow during the year.\n\nWELCOME! We are happy to welcome Miss May Titley back to work after her sojourn in His Majesty's Forces and, later, in the hospital. We are thankful that her health has improved sufficiently to allow her to join the teaching staff at Sioux Lookout.\nFood for Thought\n\nOpportunities for Service in our Residential Schools\n\nThis is a very important part of our missionary work because in each school there are from 80 to 250 children in residence for almost nine years. If properly staffed with real missionaries and efficiently administered they act as the \"Leaven that leavens the whole lump\". In some places where schools are on Reserves, with their people all round them, they have been the means of regenerating whole tribes both socially and spiritually. They are the greatest tool at present in the hands of the Church for the propagation of that gospel of Christ, \"I am come that they might have life and have it to the full\". By some freak of circumstance, the Church has lost sight of their real significance and for a number of years has failed to give them the attention they deserve.\n\nRev. J.W. House, Old Sun School\n\nThe authorities of the residential schools are alive to the dangers of regimentation. They are trying to combat these by means of free play and games, leadership training in Guides and Scouts, etc. Besides shortness of staffs, a great handicap is lack of space in the school buildings. The older boys and girls need rooms where they can pursue their hobbies and relax away from a dingy playroom in which there are sixty to eighty other children including all the younger ones who want to play group games, skip, etc. The older boys might be encouraged to fix up for themselves a room which they could call their own, with a good big table for games, a work-bench, books and other things. The older girls would enjoy planning a sitting room where they could spend their leisure with books and magazines, games, a radio, sewing and knitting. Such a plan, if it were carefully handled, would help to give more of a home atmosphere and a sense of maturity. It could also be used to help to develop a sense of responsibility which needs to be and can be taught.\n\nMiss W. Hinchliffe.\n\nWith regard to religious instruction in the schools, I may say that when I was in charge of the Manitoba department of Education and Welfare we brought up from Chicago university a man who was the head of the faculty of education and we had a rather heated discussion that afternoon about religious instruction in the schools and how it should be provided. And this was a distinguished educationist, a Cambridge graduate and head of the department at Chicago University, and this is what he said: Ladies and gentlemen, if you have the proper character at the head of your school, a man or a woman of exemplary character, a certain spiritual quality, one who is interested in the advancement of his or her pupils, religion is taught in that school from ten o'clock in the morning until four o'clock in the afternoon; it is taught in mathematics, it is taught in history, it is taught in accuracy in writing; but if you have at the head of that school a selfish individual, a man or woman whose moral integrity is in doubt, then religion is not taught in that school at any time, even though you make creeds and the Bible your only text books.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey, Minutes of Evidence, Parl. C'tee Enquiry.\nIt was a holiday voyage up the Huron, witnessing the most magnificent sunset I have ever beheld as the clouds banked almost from the horizon amidst a profusion of color. One felt even more than among beautiful flowers that one was looking into God's Garden. Through the Soo locks the next day into vast Superior with its sea breezes and chill evenings; visiting Port Arthur and Duluth, surveying their scenic beauties; then returning again across the lake to Sault Ste. Marie for a visit to Shingwauk School, the deepest experience of all.\n\nTo be privileged to spend a few days sharing the life of those who \"live their service\" is something one feels rather than tells. Interested in their work for many years, this was my first actual visit to a school. The summer brought other visitors to the Soo and I was permitted to listen in on the reminiscences of earlier Shingwauk and old Mackay School. There is a comradeship which grows deep in those who have struggled for the cause with singleness of intent.\n\nShingwauk has the special privilege of being not only set amid beautiful surroundings but convenient to the city where graduates go to attend High School. School had not yet re-opened but nearly forty children of all ages were on hand providing a special interest with their curious, intont gaze and shy ways, yet withal lovable. What nobler task in this land than to bring children like these to a true knowledge of the living Christ and instil it into their lives to such extent and on such numbers that eventually they will prove a leaven for their whole people. It presents a challenge to us who try to help in some small way and a test to the quality and quantity of that 'Life' which radiates from us.\n\nBright in learning, many of the older pupils have a deep desire to develop music and art, which drives them, on their own, to the available instrument or paints to express that which is within them. Reminding us that under red skin, so called, and white alike lie hidden talents. Our own children now have these privileges within their daily curriculum; should not those of other color in this Dominion be granted a like privilege under some sponsorship?\n\nAs in other schools, the playroom for the children is lacking in equipment or toys. This also offers a further scope through which associations other than those already burdened with the upkeep and clothing might help on the work.\n\nAmong the sadder aspects was a visit to the little graveyard in the rear of the school, which tells the story of faithful workers and converts who served nobly in their day. Also, through the kindness of friends, I was permitted to visit the old Indian cemetery among the pines on the Garden River Reserve. Over the graves of many years still stand wooden houses, the length of the grave with gable roof and a small opening in the end, through which food and essentials for the welfare of the spirit could be placed from time to time.\n\n(continued next page)\nIn the little church at Garden River by the evening lamplight, one felt the presence of enquiring minds and that indescribable something that brought a hush - an atmosphere which has no doubt grown out of efforts of the earlier years (since 1832) even e'er the building took form.\n\nEach day in the school one was deeply impressed by the attention of the children at morning and evening prayers in the auditorium. Then on Sunday morning we attended the early celebration in the little chapel in the school and, later, morning service in the little stone church almost hidden in the cluster of trees near the roadway. The vestibule is entered through gates preparatory to passing the doors into the church proper, where one beholds different memorials, including the sentences carved in wood to the memory of early workers. Truly a sacred spot.\n\nOne hated to leave this place of continued endeavour and the family of workers but other duties called and we said farewell with fond hopes that we would meet again someday.\n\nI am sure just as interesting pictures can be drawn of residential schools across Canada - let others tell their tales.\n\n....... Inez E. Hopewell.\n\nHome for the Summer\n\nHome-going is commonly a very happy event for our pupils and the manner of it varies according to local conditions. It was our privilege this summer to see prairie children going home with their parents in wagons and to see the fleet of motor boats at Alert Bay waiting to take the children to various fishing villages along the Coast. At Chapleau, we saw the principal preparing to take a large group of the children by train on the first part of their long journey to the Mistissini district of Northern Quebec. They were to be met by their parents at the most northerly point on the railway and to complete the journey by canoe. From Moose Factory and Sioux Lookout various children were taken by plane to their homes and from Elkhorn some would have to travel fully 900 miles to their homes. In the latter case, it is hoped that a school may be built in Northern Manitoba to make this long journey unnecessary.\n\n-006-\n\nThe Ottawas had several curious old legends and traditions, very similar generally to those of Ojibways. Nanabozhoo, they say, became a man and he had for his hunting dog a great black wolf. His brother was a monster with a body made of flint. Nanahbozhooh was enraged with the flinty brother because he had killed their mother, so he pursued him all over the earth and kept striking at him with his war club; and every time he struck him a piece of flint was chipped off, and that accounts for the flint stones being found scattered about everywhere.\n\n(Our Forest Children)\nSMOKE SIGNALS\n\nThe Gordon's School was not in a position to open its doors at the beginning of the term due to extensive work being necessary on the heating and water systems. The Indian Department authorized the closing of the school until such time as the work can be completed and it is hoped that the building will be ready for occupancy by January, 1948. Meanwhile, the members of the staff have been transferred to other schools, with the exception of those necessary to care for the building and for workmen engaged on repairs.\n\nSUMMER SCHOOLS Efforts were made this year to have our needs presented to summer schools and conferences across the country and we are happy to say that we had representation at a large number of them. Those who addressed gatherings were Miss W. Hinchliffe, Miss H. Twigg, Rev. J.W. House, Rev. A.E. Thain and Canon A. J. Vale, in addition to the Superintendent and Miss Webster from the Ottawa office. The schools covered were in the Dioceses of Algoma, Fredericton, Huron, Niagara, New Westminster, British Columbia, Rupert's Land, Ontario, Ottawa and Quebec. Printed material was distributed to others for which we were unable to obtain speakers. We were also able to make an appeal to the young people gathered at Rothesay, N.B., for the Dominion Conference of the A.F.C. Generally speaking, we found that people knew little or nothing about the work and were interested in learning. A few offers of service were received and in these some appointments were made. We hope that this will open a field which has hitherto been more or less left untouched and that from it we will obtain support, especially in the matter of service by consecrated people.\n\nVISITS TO WABASCA AND POINTS NORTH In the early part of the summer, Mr. Forward travelled to four northern schools which he had not previously visited. There were urgent matters concerning property which called for immediate attention in each case. At Wabasca he conferred with the principal in regard to the new building which has now been made possible by a generous grant from the Government. At Whitefish Lake plans were made for the installation of a lighting plant which has also been made possible. At Aklavik the major matter calling for attention was the necessity of carrying out repairs to the school roof, which has caused a great deal of difficulty for a number of years. The completion of the joint powow house and laundry was also a matter for investigation. At Carcross, Mr. Forward was able to make many suggestions in preparation for the arrival of the new principal. Much of this journey had to be made by plane as otherwise the time involved would have been very great.\n\nMr. Noel Thomas, who served for almost ten years as farmer on the staffs at Moose Factory, Sault Ste. Marie and, latterly, Elkhorn, resigned this summer to undertake the duties of an Indian mission in the Diocese of Brandon.\nNorthern News\n\nJune 23rd brought the school year to a close and it was with a great sense of thankfulness we realised the 102 pupils under our care had passed through its months in safety and had made progress.\n\nThe arrival in our midst of Mr. Forward from the Ottawa Office gave rise to much speculation at the breakfast table early one July morning as to how and when? One of the members then recalled hearing and seeing a small plane leaving the air strip in front of the mission property at 2 a.m., under the rays of the Midnight Sun. Upon enquiry this probable theory became a fact - Mr. Forward had flown over in a one passenger plane from Fairbanks to Aklavit at a time when we were asleep (or should have been). A stranger, with no one to meet him, he was taken care of by the Police! (R.C.M.P.) who, finding him interested in All Saints', escorted him to the Residential School.\n\nHis visit amongst us was very much enjoyed, for among other things he brought with him the needed solutions for several of our major repair jobs and in turn left us with a very definite understanding of our present and future needs.\n\nJuly saw the arrival of Miss Ruth Snuggs (Head Matron) from Brandon and Miss Ruby Law (Teacher) from Vancouver on the S.S. \"Mackenzie River\".\n\nFour of the staff members were able to visit the Eskimo people residing at Tuktoyuktuk and witness the erection of the new day school at the Arctic Coast, which will be under the care of Miss Dorothy Robinson - formerly of the Aklavit School staff. This trip gave the travellers a much enjoyed ten days' holiday during the children's vacation from classrooms. Little has been said as to whether \"Muktuk\" and \"Blubber Oil\" were part of their daily 'bill of fare'.\n\nSome of the older Eskimo pupils accompanied by Miss Eleanor Woodcock (Acting Supervisor for the group) were able during the summer vacation to take part in a new project launched at the government Reindeer Station. The boys were taught the technique of rounding up the reindeer, and details of herding and caring for these animals, with a view to their becoming useful herders at the close of their school course.\n\n.......H.E.S.\n\nCongratulations to the Rev. R.T. and Mrs. Gibson on the birth of Janet Irvine - date of arrival September 12th.\n\nMiss E. Williams, formerly of Lac la Ronge and Moose Factory, is now Head Matron at Sioux Lookout. Another Lac la Ronge staff member now at this school is Miss Phyllis Lawrence.\n\nMiss J.H.M. Park, who was at Sioux Lookout in the position of Matron, is at present on sick leave.\n\nMiss Dorothea Lucas left the position of Matron at Alert Bay for a year's leave of absence. The position will shortly be filled by Miss Katherine Oke who was at Chapleau last year.\nMiss Margaret Thomas, on the staff of our Elkhorn School, has an interesting story. She was born at York Factory in Northern Manitoba the daughter of Mr. John Thomas, was baptized by Archdeacon Farley and at the age of six started attending day school. She transferred to the Mackay school about a month before it burned down and then went to Elkhorn from which she graduated in 1942. Miss Thomas completed her high school education at the school in the town of Elkhorn, after which she travelled to the Shingwauk school for a two years' business course in Sault Ste. Marie. On completion of the business course there followed two years' training at the Deaconess House in Toronto and at the conclusion of this Miss Thomas returned to Elkhorn as Girls' Supervisor, having been at Sioux Lookout for three months' practical training. This summer she took the short Normal Course given by the Manitoba Department of Education and, having concluded it successfully, is teaching a class at Elkhorn.\n\nMiss Thomas is fond of sports and confided that she found it easier and more enjoyable to win ribbons in track and field competitions than to learn shorthand. She is leader of the school Brownie Patrol and sings in the Elkhorn church choir. Her record playing and records were a source of enjoyment to the Elkhorn pupils last term, especially at the dancing class on Wednesday evenings.\n\nMiss Thomas has expressed a desire to study nursing and, if she has not changed her mind, we trust that it may be fulfilled. Hers is a splendid record and one which should encourage present students to go forward.\n\nGIRL GUIDE PICNIC AT FORT GEORGE\n\nWe had a Girl Guide picnic. We put our bread in bags, tea, sweet milk, pail and the cups, sausages, sweet cookies, some candies. The other girls went to the Parish Hall to get the snow-shoes so we could go. Then we were all ready to go. There were fifteen girls and two ladies, Miss Quirt and Miss Adams. We all went together. We had the bags on our backs. We all wore snow-shoes but Miss Adams. We walk on the ice on the river. We walk as fast as we can go. Miss Quirt knows how to walk with snowshoes. We came nearer, nearer to the other bank. Then we went up the bank. We put the bags on the ground but we did not take off our snow-shoes. We went to the bush to get sticks to make a fire. The other girls went to the trees to get the branches to sit on. After that we make the fire and put snow in the peel. The snow melted. When it was boiling we made the tea. The other girls sat around the fire and cooked the sausages on sticks. After we had eaten our supper Miss Quirt took a picture of us. Oh, my, we had a jolly time that day. We put out the fire and came home when the sun was vanished. We walked on the ice. We put our snowshoes in the Parish Hall. We put our things in the kitchen. We didn't feel tired. We thanked Miss Quirt for the picnic. Then we went upstairs to bed. It was beginning spring when we had our picnic. Only the Girl Guides went to the picnic that day.\n\n(Nellie Herodier Gr. IV - From GOOSE FEATHERS)\nSIOUX LOOKOUT\nRev. D.C. Wickenden, Mr. S.

JUH, ONTARIO.\nJUNIOR DRAMATICS\n\nUnder the capable direction of Mr. Emmett McArt, Mr. Lorenzo Deschamps and Miss Virginia Laroque, the boys of Grades 1-5 staged a most enjoyable evening's entertainment, October 29th.\n\nThe first playlet was \"The Discontented Crow.\" Peter Chong narrated the story in a loud clearcut voice, while Bruce McComber, as the crow, and Rolland Matlowabi, as the happy robin, gave some acting. Peter Chong ... The little lads from Grade One gave a display of their progress in class in the form of a pantomime. Bruce McComber, both of whom recited nursery rhymes plus gestures and all.\n\nTwo songs and some selections by the Rhine Band from Grades Four and Five added a fine musical touch to the programme. The highlight of the evening was \"The Bank Strike\" by these same two Grades ... This play was done as part of their Social Studies work to tell the story of the discovery of the Indian Ocean. Wallace Belleau, as Abie the money lender, and Albert Bourneau, Balboa's part, were the main characters.\n\nCongratulations to the younger girls of the convent who presented that same evening in the Halloween programme. Their musical choruses were very well done and their playlets interesting and entertaining.\n\nThe Teachers of the various Grades deserve a special word of praise for the successful outcome of their patient, painstaking labours.\n\nWhy teachers get grey\u2014\n\n\"John Caneau ... how many slices of bread did you have for breakfast?\"\n\n\"Brother, I et three slices.\"\n\n\"Why, John, you should say 'ate'.\"\n\n\"Well may be it was eight that I et.\"\n\nBOXING\n\nOn October 17th the first Boxing Bout of the season was staged and it was a good show from the opening round to the final gong.\n\nThe boys were in there throwing punches and playing hard-fighting boxing no quarter was asked by anyone. Every round was exciting and the gym rang with cheers from an enthusiastic audience. It was evident that the boys had made excellent progress since Father Skillen took over the assignment as instructor last September.\n\nProbably the best bout of the evening was between Eli Commanda and Adam Roy. These lads at 120 pounds were really good and were a big attraction on any boxing card. Tall rangy lads, they have developed a fine range technique, have plenty of speed and a good punch.\n\nAnother outstanding bout in the 140 pound class between Henry Smith and Charlie Belcourt drew a good hand of applause from the crowd. Frankie Commanda, Clement Trudeau and Arnold Belleau showed plenty of class in their own divisions and much is expected of them.\n\nThere was not one of the boxers who didn't put up a good fight and they deserve great credit for their fine sportsmanship.\n\nFather Skillen handled the boys in the ring with the ease and grace of a professional. Judges for the evening were Mr. William McGrath and Mr. Joseph Sammon. Referees in the ring, Bob Syrett and Cecil Murray. Time Keepers ... Alvin Nashiwe and Julius Neganeigigig ... Alfie Cooper announced the bouts ...\n\n(Continued page 2, col. 2)\n## EXAMINATIONS\n\n### GRADE X\n\n| Name          | Lat | Fr. | Sc. | Lit. | Wr. | Art | Mat. | S.S. | R | Total |\n|---------------|-----|-----|-----|------|-----|-----|------|-----|---|-------|\n| Belleau Harold | 80  | 93  | 85  | 82   | 90  | 75  | 70   | 82  | 8 | 657   |\n| Commanda Francis | 85  | 80  | 67  | 75   | 85  | 70  | 90   | 75  | 9 | 627   |\n| Cooper Alphie  | 100 | 93  | 86  | 90   | 86  | 70  | 90   | 90  | 2 | 724   |\n| Jackson Divens  | 86  | 90  | 86  | 109  | 90  | 80  | 94   | 95  | 4 | 721   |\n| Johnston B.     | 86  | 90  | 86  | 109  | 90  | 80  | 94   | 95  | 4 | 721   |\n| McComber, D.    | 100 | 90  | 80  | 89   | 85  | 85  | 80   | 90  | 5 | 686   |\n| Neshkwa, A.     | 100 | 94  | 94  | 84   | 88  | 78  | 96   | 90  | 3 | 723   |\n| Neganegegie, J. | 85  | 90  | 76  | 70   | 80  | 95  | 84   | 95  | 7 | 675   |\n| Trudeau, A.     | 100 | 96  | 67  | 98   | 92  | 78  | 96   | 85  | 6 | 692   |\n\n### GRADE IX\n\n| Name          | Fr. | Sp. | Sc. | Lit. | Red. | Wv. | Art | Com. | S.S. | Mat. | R | Total |\n|---------------|-----|-----|-----|------|------|-----|-----|------|-----|------|---|-------|\n| Commanda, Adam | 82  | 66  | 86  | 75   | 77  | 72  | 70  | 64   | 55  | 64  | 15 | 711   |\n| Cooper, Peter  | 86  | 88  | 95  | 79   | 74  | 75  | 75  | 70   | 60  | 60  | 12 | 772   |\n| Daybutch, Bobby| 91  | 98  | 94  | 94   | 84  | 85  | 77  | 87   | 92  | 88  | 3  | 830   |\n| Deere, Albert   | 82  | 83  | 73  | 72   | 73  | 77  | 83  | 60   | 35  | 17 | 695   |\n| Deere, Henry    | 85  | 60  | 78  | 93   | 74  | 75  | 72  | 85   | 60  | 44  | 14 | 733   |\n| Jecko, R.       | 92  | 93  | 96  | 93   | 93  | 90  | 88  | 85   | 80  | 46  | 8  | 885   |\n| Greenfield, R.  | 86  | 60  | 67  | 75   | 74  | 70  | 64  | 60   | 90  | 10 | 784   |\n| King, Cecil     | 93  | 88  | 97  | 63   | 85  | 86  | 90  | 75   | 90  | 84  | 5  | 876   |\n| Peltier, Herman  | 82  | 76  | 85  | 67  | 73  | 75  | 75  | 62   | 45  | 60  | 16 | 702   |\n| Simon, Moxie    | 92  | 82  | 89  | 89   | 84  | 75  | 82  | 85  | 88  | 4  | 869   |\n| Jecko, R.       | 82  | 88  | 90  | 92  | 73  | 74  | 75  | 83  | 80  | 86 | 10 | 803   |\n| Trudeau, Joe    | 100 | 100 | 95  | 85  | 75  | 80  | 85  | 81  | 85  | 94  | 8  | 880   |\n| Trudeau, Clement | 70  | 82  | 75  | 73  | 73  | 85  | 78  | 85  | 84  | 11 | 763   |\n| Shawano, Alphonse| 95  | 88  | 97  | 93  | 78  | 86  | 90  | 92  | 95  | 90  | 2 | 904   |\n| Syrette, Bobby   | 86  | 88  | 89  | 90  | 84  | 72  | 70  | 70  | 65  | 40  | 13 | 760   |\n| Roy, Adam       | 96  | 92  | 92  | 92  | 74  | 74  | 74  | 78  | 80  | 90  | 7 | 852   |\n| Wenigwans, Jim  | 85  | 86  | 91  | 90  | 84  | 86  | 95  | 88  | 92  | 94  | 1 | 911   |\n| Solomon, Leo    | 90  | 96  | 89  | 86  | 74  | 80  | 78  | 85  | 85  | 86  | 8 | 849   |\n\n### GRADE VIII\n\n| Name          | Ar | S.S. | Sp. | R. | Lit. | C.C. | Wri. | Gram. | Totals |\n|---------------|----|------|-----|----|------|------|------|--------|--------|\n| Agone, Lawrence | 72 | 80   | 80  | 70 | 75   | 80  | 82  | 90     | 629    |\n| Commanda, Eli  | 78 | 75   | 60  | 66 | 72   | 78  | 70  | 70     | 569    |\n| Cameron, Joe   | 85 | 70   | 70  | 70 | 70   | 85  | 74  | 74     | 609    |\n| Beresford, Nancy | 80 | 65   | 70  | 73 | 75   | 70  | 74  | 52     | 571    |\n| Fox, Joseph    | 94 | 94   | 82  | 74 | 88   | 88  | 66  | 100    | 686    |\n| Fox, Eugene    | 85 | 88   | 82  | 76 | 85   | 85  | 79  | 79     | 655    |\n| King, Donald   | 84 | 84   | 85  | 76 | 70   | 80  | 70  | 75     | 645    |\n| King, Donald   | 60 | 50   | 78  | 65 | 72   | 70  | 75  | 75     | 545    |\n| Martin, Joseph | 78 | 80   | 82  | 72 | 90   | 86  | 75  | 95     | 660    |\n| Mississaugas, J | 86 | 89   | 80  | 85 | 83   | 85  | 82  | 90     | 689    |\n| Lewis, Frank   | 72 | 88   | 82  | 74 | 80   | 85  | 76  | 95     | 650    |\n| Manitowabi, Theo| 78 | 80   | 86  | 72 | 75   | 80  | 74  | 92     | 657    |\n| Peltier, Henry  | 74 | 82   | 82  | 67 | 70   | 70  | 65  | 40     | 548    |\n| Petawawaikwood, By | 90 | 80  | 74  | 70 | 75   | 75  | 80  | 80     | 575    |\n| Solomon, Isidore| 74 | 95   | 90  | 65 | 85   | 86  | 80  | 95     | 675    |\n| Bruce, Donald   | 60 | 65   | 54  | 72 | 75   | 70  | 70  | 85     | 555    |\n| Jacobs, Ronnie  | 92 | 73   | 94  | 70 | 80   | 85  | 75  | 85     | 652    |\n| Naganash, Wilmur| 98 | 88   | 86  | 75 | 85   | 87  | 75  | 100    | 694    |\n| Roy, Theodore   | 70 | 75   | 82  | 68 | 80   | 85  | 73  | 100    | 613    |\n| McComber, C.    | 64 | 85   | 80  | 75 | 82   | 86  | 75  | 100    | 689    |\n| Norton, James   | 94 | 87   | 100 | 75 | 87   | 90  | 68  | 85     | 696    |\nTHE CLUB STAR\n\nGarnier Residential School\nSpanish, Ontario.\n\nVol. II. No. 8\nMAY, 1947\n\nSENIOR PLAY A SUCCESS\n\nThe Senior Dramatic Club presented \"The Upper Room\" on April 3rd and 4th. It was the most successful production of the year. Each part was well interpreted by the actors. The simplicity and sincerity of the players impressed upon the audience the spirit of the passion. The choir of thirty voices, singing off-stage, provided a suitable background for the sacred theme. Particularly noteworthy was the singing of the lamentations during the scene depicting the death of Christ. The audience was requested before the play to remain silent between acts and to give no applause. This helped to bring home the sacredness of the play.\n\nSpecial praise should be given to the veteran actor, Dominic McComber for his performance as Samuel, the servant. At no time did he overdo his part. Throughout the play he was the key figure in every action. Joe Fox, mirror, as Our Lady, and Cornelius McComber, as Mary Magdalene, handled the female roles with skill.\n\nThe Cast\u2014Achaz, Harold Belleau; Samuel, Dominic McComber; Our Lady, Joe Fox; Mary Magdalene, Cornelius McComber; Judas, David Jocke; St. John, Alfred Cooper; St. Peter, Francis Commanda; Joseph of Arimathea, Julius Neganigig; Longinus, Joe Alec; Veronica, Clement Trudeau.\n\nMob Scenes\u2014Alvin Neshkwe, Rudy Rice, Eli Commanda, Adam Roy.\n\nCostumes\u2014Harold Belleau, Francis Commanda, Alphonse Trudeau, Alfred Cooper.\n\nSets\u2014Paddy Jocke, Maxie Mishibinijima, Adam Commanda.\n\nGrades Three and Four are nature students. Here are a few answers in their last examinations. A skunk is a little animal. It gives us a smell. If you tease it you are smelt.\n\nPlants grow in our fields and turn into food like oats.\n\nA queen bee lays eggs and flies away when they break.\nEASTER HOLIDAY\n\nThe sky was cloudy and the days dark with the threat of rain or snow yet we had a very enjoyable holiday.\n\nThe vacations, from April 4th to the 12th, passed like one day.\n\nThe seniors, engaged in hard work, basketball games every morning, in the afternoons we all went for a walk.\n\nThe seniors stretched their legs with a four or five mile jaunt. The juniors and seniors played Croquet and In-\n\ndian Clubs placed on top of the hill.\n\nEvery evening of the holidays was met with an enthusiastic reception. Great was the joy among the seniors when they were allowed to stay up to see the cow-\n\nboy movies. The special feature of the holidays was the Senior basketball games. The girls played their games first and then cheered the boys on to victory or defeat. The walls shook from the yells of the Green, Yellow, Red and Blue teams swept into action.\n\nThe name Club Star was suggested by Henry Deere. The Club is a special prerogative of the Senior boys. It is open nightly from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. There they can play bridge, checkers and other games; read the newspapers, listen to the radio and discuss the weighty papers of the world. The idea of the paper originated from the Club and the paper mainly records the activities of the Senior boys.\n\nThe hallowed name of St. Peter Claver has gone. Henceforth we shall be known as The Garnier Residential School. This name is more appropriate than St. Peter Claver. The bell in the school belfry is inscribed Garnier School and the intention of Superiors to change the name, St. Peter Claver, is buried in South American while St. Charles Garnier is none of our own Canadian Martyrs. Therefore it is more fitting that we should honour him and ask his protection. S.P.C. was known up and down the North Shore for hard fighting, clean sportsmanship. We hope that the same adjectives will be attri-\n\nbuted to the name Garnier.\n\nTHE CLUB STAR\n\nA Monthly Bulletin published by Garnier Residential School Spanish, Ont.\n\nEDITORIAL\n\nIn 1928 and 1929 the first school paper appeared in Spanish. It was called the Vigilante and had bi-weekly publication. In 1935 The Club Star made its appearance in mimeograph form. It continued with an enthusiastic reception and met with some activity. Great was the joy among the seniors when they were allowed to stay up to see the cowboy movies. The special feature of the holidays was the Senior basketball games. The girls played their games first and then cheered the boys on to victory or defeat. The walls shook from the yells of the Green, Yellow, Red and Blue teams swept into action.\n\nThe name Club Star was suggested by Henry Deere. The Club is a special prerogative of the Senior boys. It is open nightly from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. There they can play bridge, checkers and other games; read the newspapers, listen to the radio and discuss the weighty papers of the world. The idea of the paper originated from the Club and the paper mainly records the activities of the Senior boys.\n\nThe hallowed name of St. Peter Claver has gone. Henceforth we shall be known as The Garnier Residential School. This name is more appropriate than St. Peter Claver. The bell in the school belfry is inscribed Garnier School and the intention of Superiors to change the name, St. Peter Claver, is buried in South American while St. Charles Garnier is none of our own Canadian Martyrs. Therefore it is more fitting that we should honour him and ask his protection. S.P.C. was known up and down the North Shore for hard fighting, clean sportsmanship. We hope that the same adjectives will be attri-\n\nbuted to the name Garnier.\n\nTHE CLUB STAR\n\nDuring the months of May and June the Grade Niners will have special classes in practical electricity, auto mechanics and welding. They will follow the courses taught in the Ontario Vocational Schools. There will be lectures and field work under the direction of Brother Lafrenne and two assistants. Grade Nine completed its Health course and are almost finished their course in Vocational Guidance. Under the capable guidance of Mr. Sarmento, B.A., the entrance class of seventeen are in their final lap. Grade Seven are showing an unlimited capacity for work. It is almost necessary to throw them out of the Study Hill.\n\nGrade Five\n\nPaul Phasawanket 88%\nTheodore Manitowabi 85%\n\nGrade Four\n\nArthur Cocoon 83%\nManley Smith 79%\n\nGrade Three\n\nWallace Belleau\nAlbert Bonaparte\n\nGrade Two\n\nTeddy Jacobs\nBilly Shawans\n\nGrade One\n\nStanley Etsawanket\nClarence Kitchibeg\n\nSports\n\nRed Wings Win League.\n\nPlayoffs Start\u2014\n\nRed Wing Seniors are the league winners in their division. In the preliminary hockey they won seven hard fought games. In the Senior schedule, Maxx was shifted to guard, thus breaking up the best combination in the league, Maxx and Frankie.\nSPORTS (continued)\n\nThe playoffs started on April 21st. The lowly placed Maple Leafs knocked out the league leading Red Wings. The Black Hawks overcame a powerful Canadian squad. The Maple Leafs will play with the Hawks next week. The Leafs are a good play well in streaks but have a good passing combination. The Hawks are a strong guarding team but weak in passing and shooting. After the upsets in the playoffs it would be difficult to call a winner.\n\nThe Teams:\n\nRed Wings\u2014F. Commanda, M. Misshibinijima, A. Cooper, C. Trudeau, A. Roy, H. Deere, D. McComber, S. Johnston.\n\nCanadiens\u2014H. Belleau, P. Jocko, E. Commanda, H. Contin, P. Durette, C. Benedicti, R. Pitawanakat, J. Alec.\n\nBlack Hawks\u2014J. Neganigig, A. Neshkwe, A. Trudeau, E. Fox, J. Cameron, J. Fox, J. Phasant, D. Wassegigig.\n\nMaple Leafs\u2014J. Fox, A. Commanda, A. Trudeau, R. Ryce, L. Solomon, J. Wemigwans, M. Esquimaux, B. Osawamik.\n\nIntermediate Junior Playoffs have started. Black Hawks and Canadiens are the teams. Black Hawks won the first game 39-31.\n\nOur one and only Simon is puzzled. When you cross the field instead of taking the road, it is called a shortcut. He wants to know why the road route is not called a longcut.\n\nHIGH SCHOOL VIGNETTES\n\nBelleau, Harold\u2014Genial, good natured. He is the best goal keeper along the North Shore. Active in all sports and captain of the Senior Canadiens. Played the part of Achaz in the Easter play. A first class tailor and painter.\n\nCommanda Francis\u2014Quick, energetic, co-operative. Captain of the school hockey team. Captain of the Senior Red Wings. Member of Touch Rugby, Hockey, and Basketball leagues. Played the part of St. Peter in the Upper Room. Interested in Christian Island (or is it Golden Lake?)\n\nCooper Alfred\u2014Cool, calculating; leads his class, always managing to get over 90 in every examination. Played in the school hockey team, a member of Senior Red Wings. Took the part of St. John in the last play. First class tailor and painter. Other interests hard to define.\n\nJocko David\u2014Slow but sure, a very painstaking worker. Specializes in art and dramatics. Has played the roles of the Master of Ceremonies in A Christmas Carol and Judas in the Upper Room. It is reported that he is interested in Cape Croker.\n\nThe chickens went on strike in protest against that dictator, Harvey Contin. He was trying to make them lay two eggs a day. Harvey has been removed and when last seen was making flower beds.\n\nPerhaps Peter Deere needs some hard work. The uniform that he wore in last May's production of the Pinocchio is now five sizes too small.\nSIXTH EDITION\n\nCHARLES CAVSELL INDIAN HOSPITAL\nEDMONTON, ALTA.\n\nNOVEMBER 15, 1947.\n\nIn Flanders Fields\nJohn McCrae\n\nThe Indians and the War, 1939-1945.\n\nThe Indians and the War (Cont'd)\nSunday Services\n\nMy Trip South\nDr. E.

The men showed their loyalty by voluntarily enlisting in the armed forces and the women by generously donating to the Red Cross. They knit many socks, mufflers and other comforts for the men.\n\nThe following figures give the records for the three services:\n\n(a) Total number of volunteers 921,292\n(b) Total number of Fatal Battle Casualties 32,472\n(c) Total number Battle Casualties (Non-fatal) 138,166\n\nIn proportion to their population the number of enlistments among the Indians was exceptionally good. Indian girls enlisted in both the Army and Air Force. Some 46 Indians enlisted in the United States Armed Forces. This information is considered incomplete as many Indians may have enlisted away from the reserves without reporting to the Indian agents.\n\nMany brave Indians laid down their lives in the cause of freedom. Many won honor and distinction. George Badger, Pelly Agency, Saskatchewan, deceased, was taken Prisoner of War at Hong Kong in 1941. John Smallboy, Moose Factory Agency, Ontario, fought through the campaigns in Africa, Sicily and Italy. Private Frederick Webster, Seaforth Highlanders, Lytton Agency, British Columbia, won the Military Medal. Gunner Dick Patrick, Royal Canadian Artillery, Okanagan Agency, won the Military Medal for \"gallant and distinguished conduct in the field.\" Private Huron Eldon Brant, Tyendinaga Agency, Ontario, was awarded the Military Medal in the battle of Grammichelle in 1943. This gallant soldier was later killed in action in Italy. A wonderful record is held by an Indian family of Cape Croker Agency. John McLeod, the father, served in the last war and with the Veterans Guard in this war. His six sons and one daughter enlisted in the Armed Forces. Two sons were wounded in action and two others were killed.\n\nThe table on the next page gives the Indian (men and women) enlistments by provinces. It also gives the number of those who were killed or who died of wounds.\nProvince | Enlistments | No. Killed or died of wounds | No. of Indian women enlisted\n---|---|---|---\nBritish Columbia | 334 | 37 | 2\nAlberta | 144 | 10 | 2\nSaskatchewan | 443 | 27 | 22\nManitoba | 175 | 10 | 5\nYukon | 7 | 0 | 0\nNorthwest Territories | 0 | 0 | 0\nOntario | 1,323 | 102 | 32\nQuebec | 316 | 9 | 9\nNew Brunswick | 203 | 7 | 0\nNova Scotia | 117 | 8 | 0\nPrince Edward Island | 27 | 3 | 0\n\nTotal | 3,089 | 213 | 72\n\n93 Indians were wounded but the figures have not been broken down by provinces.\n\nDonations of money from Indian bands and from individual Indians are as follows:\n\nMarch 31, 1945.\n\nCanadian Red Cross | $11,742.50\nCanadian War Services | 1,787.45\nSalvation Army | 100.00\n\"War Effort\" | 2,732.51\nCatholic Refugee Children | 69.00\nBritish War Victims' Fund | 400.00\nLondon Orphanage Fund | 432.30\nBritish War Effort | 100.00\nQueen's Canadian Fund | 850.00\nCanadian Aid to Russia Fund | 610.84\nWings for Britain Fund | 2,427.51\n\nTotal | $21,252.21\n\nThis is only part of the contribution. A great deal of money was given directly to local organizations. Not only money, but gifts of furs, clothing and other articles were donated.\n\nThe Indians of Canada have every reason to be proud of the part they played in the last World War.\n\nSunday Services.\n\nNovember 16, United Church,\nRev.

We cannot repeat these words too often to make you realize how important it is!\n\nYou will have noticed that we have School Teachers and an Occupational Teacher who visit you and help you both to improve your education and to occupy some of your time which is not spent in absolute rest.\n\nThe time that you spend on your studies and other occupational work should not interfere with Rest Periods in any way. They are not meant to replace your rest, but are definitely to help you pass the many long hours which you have to spend in your bed.\n\nThe length of time that you are allowed to spend on your studies and other work is carefully worked out by consultation between the Doctors, Nurses and the Teachers. Some people have a lot of disease, and therefore, we feel that they should do little or no work and should spend all their time resting\u2014not only during Rest Periods but at all times during the day. As soon as we feel you are able to spend some or more time in studying and occupational therapy, we will make these adjustments. Under no circumstances do we want patients to do these extra things without being officially allowed to do them!\n\nYou must realize that we who comprise the staff are just as anxious as you are for you to get well and leave the hospital. The more you try to do by yourself, without permission and without supervision, the more likely you are to prolong your stay in the hospital. At times you may think we are unfair and mean to you because we do not give you extra privileges, but that is not so for we are thinking of your welfare at all times.\n\n(Cont'd)\nIn conclusion, today, I would like to impress upon you how helpful the teachers and the occupational worker can be to aid in your recovery, but you must co-operate with them and with the rest of the staff to the fullest degree to shorten your stay in the Hospital.\n\nH. Meltzer, M.D.\nMedical Director.\n\nRemembrance Day.\n\nNovember 11 was Remembrance Day. It is a day set aside to honour the veterans who gave their lives in the two World Wars.\n\nThis tribute generally takes the form of a parade and solemn services at a War Memorial. We must also remember the veterans who are living, those who are suffering and those who are in need. We can do this in a concrete way, by generously supporting the Poppy Day each year.\n\nOttawa Visitors.\n\nThe Charles Camsell Indian Hospital staff and patients were honored by a visit from the Hon. Paul Martin, Minister of National Health and Welfare, on October 27. On his inspection of the hospital he met all the patients, and each felt the impress of his buoyant personality. The Hon. Martin has promised that some time he would write something for the Arrow. We shall look forward with pleasure to receiving this message.\n\nDr. P.E. Moore, Director of Indian Health Services, was a member of the party, and visited the wards the same day.\nMY TRIP SOUTH.\n\nOur good dentist, Dr. McCaffery, is at the Blood Agency in the south, fixing the children's teeth at the two boarding schools. I took him there on Monday, November 3. It's a lovely thing to have a good dentist of our own. Some time before school closes next June Dr. McCaffery will visit every school in Alberta. He saves a lot of teeth and a lot of pain.\n\nFrom the Blood I went over to the Peigan Agency at Brockett. There was a little girl there with a hole in the top of her mouth. She is now here at the hospital and we hope that a small operation will make her talk better.\n\nComing up to Calgary I met the Hon. Mr. Martin and Dr. Moore. These are the two gentlemen who visited the hospital on October 27. We all know, of course, that Mr. Martin is the government Minister at Ottawa who directs all the health work done by the Government there. Family Allowances are part of his business. Dr. Moore is the officer who has to see that sick Indians, all over Canada, are looked after. He lives in Ottawa, too. They came out here to see what we are all doing and were very pleased with our hospital.\n\nMr. Martin, Dr. Moore and I visited at Morley and at the Blackfoot. Then they went away to Saskatchewan to see the Indians and their hospitals there.\n\nOn November 11, I met three patients at the railway station in Calgary and we drove to Edmonton. The road was slippery with ice but we arrived safely. One of them is our old friend, Emile Medicine Traveller.\n\nI have never seen the Indians in the south so well dressed and so well off in every way as they seem to be now. They have had a pretty good crop and are getting high prices for it. This is the time when it pays to farm.\n\nDr. E. L. Stone,\nRegional Director.\nOur New Doctor.\n\nIn a recent page of the \"World News in Pictures\" we were pleased to see a picture of Dr. Orford and his family. We wish we could print the picture\u2014it was such a splendid one\u2014but since we are not able to do so, we shall tell you what was written under the picture.\u2014\n\n\"Diphtheria quarantine Lifted In James Bay Area. An outbreak of diphtheria at Moose Factory, Ont., has resulted in quarantine, but did not stop the U.S. and Canadian hunters from arriving in droves for moose hunting. The quarantine has been lifted. Government physician for eight years at Moose Factory, Dr. T.J. Orford, shown above with his wife and children, Judy, nine and Elizabeth, six, left two days before quarantine, but offered to return, if needed, to help battle the dread outbreak which is abating.\"\n\nMrs. Orford Speaks For Her Husband.\n\nWhen the first X-Ray survey was made in James Bay our Indians flocked to have their plates taken. They were not so enthusiastic, however, when it came to persuading those found suffering from Tuberculosis to take treatment in a Sanatorium. The idea of leaving familiar things and faces and going on a long journey amongst strange people was a frightening one. There was no Indian hospital for them, nor was it always possible to secure even two beds in the same Sanatorium so that they might have the companionship of their own people during the long months of treatment. Nevertheless, eventually some of them faced the necessity of this move and when, after a period, they returned well and cured, the more timid ones were encouraged to try it too.\n\nSo it is with absorbing interest, since our arrival here, that we watch the life at Cassell and the whole beautifully organized effort of the doctors and staff directed towards making a sick Indian well. When we look back and think of the long lonely stretches put in by our James Bay Indians amongst people who neither spoke their language nor understood their background, we wish and hope that the future may hold for them the good fortune of the patients here\u2014a companionable place of rest and cure in their own Indian Hospital.\n\n\u2014Mena Orford.\nNOVEMBER\n\nNovember woods are bare and still;\nNovember days are clear and bright;\nEach noon burns up the morning's chill;\nThe fading's snow is gone by night;\nEach day's steps grow slow, grow light,\nAs though the woo's I reverent creep,\nWatching all things lie \"down to sleep.\"\n\nI never knew before what beds\nFragrant to smell, and soft to touch,\nThe forest sifts and shapes and spreads;\n\"I never knew before how much\nOf human sound there is in such\nLow tones as through the forest sweep\nWhen all wild things lie \"down to sleep.\"\n\nEach day I find new coverlids\nTucked in, and more sweet eyes shut tight;\nSometimes the viewless mother bids\nHer ferns kneel down, full in my sight;\nI hear their chime of \"good-night\";\nAnd half I smile and half I weep,\nListening while they lie \"down to sleep.\"\n\nNovember woods are bare and still;\nNovember days are bright and good;\nLife's noon burns up life's morning chill;\nLife's night rests feet which long have stood;\nSome warm soft bed in field or wood,\nThe mother will not fail to keep,\nWhere we can lay us \"down to sleep.\"\n\u2014 Helen Hunt Jackson.\n\nTHROUGH MY WINDOW PANE\n\nAll summer from the sun porch\nI've gazed out through the pane.\nI've loved the lovely sunsets,\nThe sunshine and the rain.\n\nThe garden full of beauty rare,\nThe asters and sweet peas\nAll looked so lovely as they waved\nIn the warm summer breeze.\n\nAnd then one night the frost came,\nAnd I could not be gay,\nFor all the pretty colors went,\nAnd everything turned gray.\n\nBut soon my heart was light again,\nAs I sat up in bed\nI saw the roofs of all the \"huts\"\nHad turned bright green and red.\n\nComposed by: Jean Coutureille,\nWard 1, Sun Porch.\nTHE O. T. Corner.\n\nSome of the girls in WARD I are wondering what Miss Oakden is doing giving out all the black canvas to be embroidered. Boys do seem to be as vain as little girls and we are having many requests for those attractive looking mukluks that can be bought \"down north\", with all the gay colors and the pretty tassels. So, this winter there will be plenty of boys and girls wearing them. You know it is always the fashion to wear at school whatever the others are wearing. So school days should be gay days, don't you think?\n\nWARD II are patiently waiting for some doll clothes that we hope to make. The truth is that the dolls are having a rest in the hospital, too. They need oil in their joints, some new hair dressing and, also, a little make-up. When they arrive we shall be busy planning their wardrobe. It will be almost like the wedding of the Princesses we will be so busy.\n\nWARD III is as active as ever, so many people want something to do. And all want something different! We have had some good work from this ward. They are just as busy as BEES. BUT, when they don't observe their rest period\u2014well\u2014we don't call them HONEY. In fact they are not sweet at all.\n\nA letter was received from Elizabeth Villeneuve saying \"hello\" to everybody in Ward III and telling all that she is fine and busy.\n\nAll sorts of things go on in WARD IV from bright afghans to baby things. Elise and Yvonne are doing good work on some colored cards.\n\nThe little \"fellas\" in WARD VIII have never, before, had so much fun with wool. Harvey, Gilbert, Simon, Ernest, Jimmie and Wallie have all done some good card weaving. We shall some day show them what it will be used for.\n\nBelts, albums and various things are being made in WARDS IX and X. These will make gifts to be proud of. Louis Henoult has everybody looking for the finest cowboy pictures. He should have the best looking album cover in the hospital.\n\nWonder what Buddy is doing to the Australian mail these days?\n\nD.O.\nCANDID COMMENTS.\n\nWARD VII.\n\nLouisa Lightning:\nI feel sure that Dr. Meltzer must have a good reason for moving us from Ward II to Ward VII because he is the most imminent, no, I guess I mean, eminent doctor in all Canada.\n\nMillie Crier:\nImagine those teachers expecting Dorothy news for the paper from us. Why, I have not even had time to unpack yet. I sure told them off! I bet they won't come bothering around here again for some time.\n\nBoo-hoo BOO-hoo!\nI don't like it here. I am so lonesome, I m-m-miss the m-m-milk-man's h-h-horses and the p-p-pigeons. You can't see s-t-t-thin' from these w-i-windows.\n\nJean Curry:\nThese new nurses may turn out all right when we get to know them but I sure miss Mrs. Taylor and Mrs. Hamilton.\n\nArlene Cardinal:\nImagine that Miss Zerembo asking me if I took Pablum. As if everybody doesn't know that I have been eating porridge for weeks.\n\nRobert Bullbear:\nJust don't ask me what I think of the move. I am so mad I could just chew nails.\n\nJacqueline Auger:\nThey say there have been just as drastic moves all over the hospital, but no one can tell me that any of adults have been as much --as such inconvinced as we babies.\n\nVictory Twin:\nIt's bad enough to be moved but why they had to separate Dorothy Callingbull and me, I'll NEVER understand!\n\nJohnson Rain:\nI certainly think there is something wrong with the nurses down here. You know, I am supposed to go home and I have dressed myself- all by myself- THREE mornings now, and I am not home yet!\n\nRose Halcrow:\nImagine being stuck away down here! Why we don't know ONE thing that's going on in the hospital, now.\n\nJean Marie:\nI wonder if this Change of Address will delay my Baby Bonus cheque for November. No doubt it will! For those people down in those Ottawa offices are so dreadfully slow!\n\nJanet Littlechild:\nDo YOU know, I thought that I heard a fly buzzing around here this morning. Believe me, if ever I saw a FLY there would be something doing. Mrs. Hamilton knows I just can't tolerate flies.\nTHE STAFF.\n\nWELCOME TO OUR NEW STAFF MEMBERS:\n\nDr. T.J. Orford and Dr. V.

Word\nhas been received that she is now out of the hospital, and is re-\ncuperating at the home of her sister in the city.\n\nEvery one will regret very much to hear that Mrs. Kerans is\nabsent on an extended sick leave. We send our best wishes for a\nspeedy recovery and may she return to us soon.\n\nBORN - to Mr. and Mrs. Morris Savard, a son. Mrs. Savard\nwas formerly Miss Frances McPherson of our Ward Aid staff.\n\nRuth Lightning, a former patient in Ward III, has recently\njoined the staff as an Aid.\n\nThe C.C.L.H.

Gay streamers of orange and black, witches on broomsticks and great orange moons were the attractive decorations used while the bright costumes of the couriers, gypsies, witches and cowboys present added greatly to the color of the scene.\n\nAn enjoyable program of dances was provided by the orchestra, and old-time dances were called by Master of Ceremonies, Mr. D.F. Scott. Prizes for the most original costumes were won by Miss Betty Bartman and Mr. J.J. Sevell while the novelty number dance was won by Mr. Charles Stone. Congratulations to all the members of the committee in charge.\n\nWARD NEWS\n\nWard IV E\n\nOn November 6 Florence Auger was taken downstairs. To her surprise she was put in a cast. Poor Florence! She is suffering from a disease quite common amongst some of the patients. It is called CAN'T STAY IN BED ITIS.\n\nOn Hallowe'en night Margaret Kindo was as excited as a child. But after the fun was over her face was long and sad. When asked what was the matter Margaret replied, \"I didn't get no APPLE!\"\n\nMary Murphy recently had a cast put on her left arm. However, she is not down-hearted. She told Sophie that she would have to learn to work with her feet.\n\nWard IV Sun Porch.\n\nMargaret Eaglechild was very happy to have her mother stay with her for a few days.\n\nMarie was doing her \"Daily Dozen\" exercises one night. As she looked towards the boys' ward she saw the boys waving back. Joke on the boys, eh?\n\nWho has seen the new patient\u2014the most popular one in the hospital? Her name is Minnie Mouse. For particulars\u2014write Ward IV C.\nWard 1.\n\nMrs. Scanie and Flore Janvier have been lucky enough to have visitors lately.\n\nOn Hallowe'en night some of the staff dressed up and came around the wards playing pranks. It was fun while it lasted but we were still not quite ready to settle down. Ruby Gutknife and Margaret Ward dressed as witches in their bedspreads. Ruby guarded the door and just as the night nurse appeared Margaret waved a brush and cried, \"Hallowe'en Apples!\"\n\nBut instead of an apple so round and red,\nMargaret was sent, quite promptly, to bed!\n\nMargaret Ward has been taking pneumothorax treatment since October 15. Josephine Davis, of Koberly, B.C., is our latest patient. We welcome her to our ward.\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between a railroad man and a teacher?\n\nAnswer: One minds the train and the other trains the mind.\n\nWard II\n\nThree of our little girls, Doreen Calihoo, Helen Lightning and Mary Deschamps have been moved to Ward VIII. We miss you, girls.\n\nHallowe'en plays pranks on us all. Lily Papin thought that the paper pumpkin in the window was real and did not discover her mistake until she was almost choked with a great big bite. Next time, Lily, take a smaller bite till you are sure.\n\nPoor Agnes Augibelle spent all one evening getting ready for a show. But, alas, there was no show! Never mind, Agnes, we enjoyed seeing you all dolled up.\n\nDelia Cardinal was taking the shopping list around one day. She came to Lily Papin's bed and asked her what she wanted. Without looking up, Lily said, \"I want my sister to come and see me.\" Wouldn't it be grand if we could all order guests on the shopping list!\n\nRuth was writing a letter home for Lily. Lily wanted her to ask them to send her a hundred dollars and a hair net. When finished, (Cont'd)\nit read, \"one hundred dollars and a hair nest\". I wonder what kind of a store keeps hair nests?\n\nOctober was a fortunate month for us. We had three wonderful shows and the educational film.\n\nThey say Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.\nBut 'twas Adeline Jackson who had the great fall.\nShe reached for her blanket, and oh, such a sprawl!\nHead over heels she went. Blanket and all!\n\nDelia Cardinal says she would like to broadcast in Cree and Eskimo. She cannot speak a word of Eskimo. Here is a good chance for Sarah, Ada or Doris to do some tutoring.\n\nDoris Beaulieu has tried twenty times to make a paper guitar, but they always end in the waste-paper basket. Don't give up, Doris, \"if at first you don't succeed, try, try again\".\n\nAgnes Augibelle had a visit from her parents and uncle recently, and Delia Cardinal was pleased to have her brother call on her the other day.\n\nOn November 4, the nurse found Alice Donald packing to go home. Sorry, but Alice was a little previous as the doctor has not yet given her permission to go.\n\nIf Claire Moses must talk in her sleep we wish that she would talk so that we could understand all she says. It is so aggravating to just hear part of such an interesting story.\n\nWard III C.\n\nWe were sorry to lose Nellie Little Light and Marie Blackrider. We shall miss them very much but are glad that they are able to go home.\n\nMargaret Eaglechild had her operation in October and has since been in a private ward. Don't forget to come back, Margaret, for we miss you very much.\n\nWe hope the show on November 10 is as good as the one we had at the end of October. That one was well worth seeing and we wish to thank those who bring these entertainments to us.\n\nOur chief story tellers are Mary Jane Boucher and Elise Laboucon. Recently they told us all about their life before coming to the hospital. Mary Jane loves her dogs. And as she told us about them we loved them, too. Meeksap is the favorite. Meeksap cannot eat anything but bannock and lard.\n\n(Cont'd)\nIf there had been a prize for the best decorated ward for Hallowe'en we feel sure we would have won it. We had orange and black streamers, bats, owls, cats and witches. That night, when the lights went out, the witches began riding their broomsticks, the cats started meowing, the bats started flying and the owls started hooting.\n\nWhat about the patients? Oh, well, we will leave that to your imagination!\n\nOur next decorations will be for Christmas. How many more days?\n\nCongratulations to Jean Coutoreille for her poem in the October issue of the Arrow. Do it again, Jean.\n\nWard IV E.\n\nOne day Miss Oakden was leaving the ward and suddenly missed her bag. Such a commotion! No one had her bag. She looked under the beds and under the sheets. Finally Miss Oakden had to give up and leave without her bag. A few days later we asked her if she had found her bag. She hung her head and said very humbly, \"Yes, I found it. It was in the office.\"\n\nVictoria Emile was advised by Victoria Sanscouteau to put her four one-cent stamps on each corner of the envelope. Victoria thought it looked very nice until a nurse came in and said, \"Oh, so you are writing to the King!\" This was too much for Victoria. She was not writing to the king. So she took all the stamps off but she learned that stamps go on easier than they come off.\n\nVictoria Emile got quite sentimental as she watched the first fall of snow and the children playing ball outside. It almost caused the first fall of tears.\n\nWe all helped to get Ruth Wings ready for home on November 12. She had just half an hour and the whole ward was in a turmoil. Everybody was in a dither but we finally got her started for Cardston with her own pyjamas\u2014\u2014\u2014 we hope!\n\nElise Grandjambe misses her sister Lillian who has been moved to Ward VII. She enjoys having Yvonne Tibbett opposite her, though. Yvonne has been moved from Ward III.\n\nAlice Black Rabbit\u2014(to Bertha Chief Body, who is combing her hair)\n\n\"Which way are you combing your hair this morning?\"\n\nBertha\u2014\"Oh, I think I'll comb it west, this morning.\"\nWard IV C.\n\nLeo Swan wants to tell the whole world that he is feeling fine and that he has been walking around for the past ten days.\n\nErnie Horseman and Jim Johnson have had rib operations. Ernie had his on October 27 and Jim on November 1. They are both fine.\n\nThe Third Floor patients are expecting some music now. They hear that Ernie Horseman has had his violin bow repaired.\n\nWard IV Sun Porch.\n\nOn Remembrance Day we three were awakened by the Ward III girls bursting into our room at eleven o'clock in the morning announcing that they were going down to church service. Kathleen Twiggs was out of bed in a minute and wanted the girls to wait for her. However, when she learned that only Routine 6 were allowed down she dived back into bed like a fish into water.\n\nWard X A.\n\nRoy Hunter has been moved back to Ward IX A from the private. It will seem quite natural for Roy to be here. However, when Roy was in this ward before he was one of the oldest in the ward. Now he will be one of the youngest.\n\nEdward Elanak has been moved to the private off IXA after his recent appendectomy\u2014don't be alarmed\u2014that is just a big word for an appendicitis operation. Edward is bright and happy again.\n\nWard IX B.\n\nMaurice Buffalo is very proud of his new guitar, a gift brought to him recently, by his father. He is learning to play it.\n\nPat Mandville, a former Ward IX B patient, has been moved to Ward X A. Ward IX B say, \"Good riddance!\" (Just a joke, Pat.)\n\nWe welcome our new patient, Emile M. Traveller, who arrived late this week.\n\nSuch a time as we have been having during the house cleaning. We were moved to Ward IX A during the process. Roy Hunter was the only one there to welcome us. It is good to be home after the few nights' holiday.\n\nBen Adam is busy signing autographs, as usual.\n\nSimon Jacko and Maurice Buffalo have been getting all the \"Local\" lately.\nWard IX C.\n\nLawrence Laroque and Harry Bull Lightning almost came to blows in an argument over the hockey match the other night.\n\nAloysius Good Rider went home to Cardston on November 12.\n\nHOW CAN WE WRITE ANY NEWS\nWHEN HOUSE CLEANING IS UNDER WAY?\nWE'LL WRITE OUR PIT FOR THE ARROW,\nWHEN WE GET BACK HOME TO STAY.\n\n\"Come on,\" said Harry Nedlin, as he saw the first snow of the winter, \"We're going for our traps!\" But Fred Laferty answered, \"Can't go yet. My things are not ready.\" Speedy recovery, boys, and good trapping again, soon!\n\nHow about helping with the house cleaning down in this unit. Everybody welcome!\n\nWard X E.\n\nWe are sorry to hear that Mrs. Kerans will not be with us for some time and hope that it will not be too long till she is back.\n\nNovember 11 was Remembrance Day. We were a little sad because we did not get any poppies. All the same we remembered the boys who had fought in both wars and especially those in the last war. We boys knew well, ten boys who had lost their lives. These were loud from home and we thought of them very reverently. Many were wounded and many came back safe. Veterans of the last War also served in the Veterans Guards at the German prison camps. We hope that War will never come again.\n\nWe are all in the throes of house cleaning. We were moved to IX A. We felt very much out of place, especially with all the orders from \"Dr. H. Lightning.\" He was very strict with us boys from X B. We even had to phone back to Ward X for our meals. Our own Ward X doctor, \"Dr. Gireux\" was sick at the time and could not come to our aid.\n\nWinners in the Hockey Pool.\n\nOctober 18 .................. Harry Lightning.\nOctober 25 .................. Dr. Orford.\nNovember 1 .................. Harry Lightning.\nNovember 8 .................. Dan Eagle Child.\n\nWard XC We welcome a new patient, Stanley Isaac, from Ft. Simpson.\nMay the Love of the Virgin Mother and her Divine Babe Fill your Heart on Christmas Day and Every Day of the New Year\nDear friends:\n\nFor our friends that are close, we're sending our wishes by train.\n\nFor those that are far especially up north, we're sending our wishes by plane.\n\nThe pupils\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nGoded with good wish\nThe Dentist's Visit.\n\nThe Dentist came the other day and stayed for several hours. Most of the boys and girls had some of their teeth pulled out and some filled. The Doctor came too and also went to Onion Lake also. We were very glad to have them but it was a most unexpected visit.\n\nWilhemina Know Gr.V.\n\n---\n\nFather Care.\n\nYou know that Father Pascal went away and after a while he came and visited us. He brought us some balloons and we like them. They were all colours. We like to play with them. Everybody had a balloon to play with. We hope that he will come again.\n\nEdward Swan Gr. III\n\nAlex Little Wolfe\nA Bunco Party\n\nOn Nov. 23rd we had a bunco party in honor of Saint Cecilia's day but it was nice! All the girls and boys were there for joy and happiness. The employees invited to come. Our dear Superior and all the Sisters enjoyed the party with us.\n\nWe played for over an hour, during this time, names were drawn by a girl, the first one was our teacher, Sister Rose-Holden, she sang a nice song then Irene Cardinal played the mouth organ and danced with Mary Anne Enow. Sister Laurette-de-Marie also played the piano. Piano duets were played by Madeleine Whitestone and Cecilia Jimmy. Mrs Lavigne was the last but not the least on the programme. She recited a beautiful poem.\n\nThis over, we had a delicious lunch served by Madeleine, Cecilia, Louisa, Irene and Melanie. The prizes were then given out. The highest score should have been 21, but nobody was lucky enough to have it. I had only three, but still I was satisfied with my prize.\n\nWe bid everyone goodnight and said a hearty thank you. Away we went to our dreams. I will never forget this wonderful party we had.\n\nNovember 20th was a holiday, for everyone knows that it was the wedding of Princess Elizabeth, our future Queen.\n\nEveryone was happy because we were going down to the lake to skate that afternoon. It was the girls' first skating, can you imagine the fun we had? Down we went, flat on the ice, over and over again. Each girl has two helpers, but sometimes we pulled them down with us, but no one was hurt. We were quite satisfied with our afternoon, we had so hard to skate. We are grateful for a hearty thanks to our Sister la-de-dos-inges who is doing such good work. We want her to stay with us a long time.\n\nThe other night we played games. That was on the sixth of last month. Mary Anne Enow and Irene Cardinal danced a jig.\n\nEmma Jackknife and Cecilia Jimmy put a brown cow hide on their backs and wore men's socks. The most surprising is when they came dancing in. This was the funniest thing of all.\n\nThe medium sized girls played the musical chair. I was last with another girl. We both wanted to sit on a chair, but as it was too small we both sat on the floor. As a reward we each had an orange. There were quite a few other games but I can't mention them all, anyway we all had a wonderful time. We were tired and glad to jump into our beds.\n\nLAUREN\n\nThere was a boy in class who was not doing his duty, so the teacher looked up and said,\n\nTeacher: What are you doing there Don?\n\nDon: Doing what comes naturally.\n\n---\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nI was in the play too, and I tried to copy Jacinta, Lucy's cousin. Clarence Villeneuve acted as my brother Francisco and played on the flute. I danced and there was then lightning and we started to run for the sheep and we saw the Blessed Lady. She talked to us. I wish she would show herself to me for true.\n\nAgnes Chocan Gr. III\n\nWell I had a little part also in that play. I was a sick lady who brought a bunch of roses to the place where the Blessed Virgin appeared. I spoke at the end of the play. I said, \"I'm cured blessed be God, blessed be our Lady.\"\n\nby Mary Irene Villeneuve Gr. IV\n\nTHE MONTH OF THE HOLY ROSARY.\n\nAll the month of October, we had the great pleasure of reciting our rosary every night in our chapel. After every decade we sang a short hymn to the Blessed Virgin Mary. We have a great devotion to our Mother. We prayed her to intercede for us so that she may be with us at the hour of our death. We also had Benediction. We also remembered our family and our friends during these days. Our Blessed Mother will remember you all.\n\nby Ida Jackknife Gr. V.\n\nDo you want to know what is Christmas? Christmas is when Jesus was born for us in a stable. It was in the middle of the night, on December 25th. The shepherds came on that night to the stable, to see Jesus, they were glad to see Jesus.\n\nBruce Naistus Gr. IV.\nA great number of people came to our concert on December 8th. Some pupils mentioned their plays, I am going to tell you about the rest of the programme.\n\n1. **Rhythm Band** and a song, *Mary Had A Little Lamb* by Primary Classes.\n\n**Feminine Bravery**, This was a playlet in which Tom Wilson bet a pound of candy to the girls that he could scare the girls stiff inside of five minutes. They consented but didn't think he'd win. In a few minutes they were all jumping on chairs and table scared if a nonexistent mouse.\n\nCharacters:\n- Tom Wilson........ Holland Dufresne.\n- Jonnie ........ Emma Cardinal.\n- Emma ........ Genevieve Ennow.\n- Hester .......... Ida Jacknife.\n- Hell ........... Eliza Stanley.\n- Mary ............ Melanie Jacknife.\n\nMotion Song by six small girls.\n\n**A pink and blue Wreath Drill:**\n\nIrene Cardinal Alice Angus\nIda Jacknife Madeleine Whitstone\nMelanie Jacknife Cecilia Jimmy.\n\n**Contentment** song, The choir girls.\n\n**Address** to the Oblate Fathers read by Irene Cardinal.\n\nWe all tried our best to please our dear parents. After all was over the children went to see their parents at the parlor. Supper time soon came and we bid everybody good bye.\n\nby: Mary Anne Ennow Gr. VIII.\nCONCERT\n\nOn December 8th, we had a concert in honor of the Immaculate Conception. Many people came to see the concert; it was at 2:30 in the afternoon. It was finished at five. It was very nice.\n\nMary Paddy Gr. IV\n\nIn our play, I was the speaker of the story of Fatima. I said what had happened thirty years ago in a little town of Portugal. From May 13, 1917 to Oct. 13, 1917, Our Lady appeared to three children and told them to tell the people to change their lives and to say the rosary.\n\nEdmond Waskowitch Gr. IV\n\nIn the play of Our Lady of Fatima, I had the honor to represent Our Lady. I stood over a little oak tree all decorated with oak leaves, and I spoke to three little children. I told them to say the rosary everyday that it pleased me very much. Then I told the children they would suffer very much to save souls. Our Lord was very much offended by their sins.\n\nAgnes Naistus Gr. IV\n\nI was glad to be Lucy in our play. I was the first scene I was dressed as a shepherdess with Jacinta and Francisco. Lucy spoke to the blessed Virgin, she said: \"Who are you? And why do you come here?\" In the last scene I was dressed in white like the day of my first communion.\n\nRosalie Choan Gr. IV\n\nOur little play of Fatima was very nice. I was acting as the role of Lucy on the day of the miracle. I said, \"Such a crowd and in this too. Are you sure that this Lady of yours will come? The people won't they are disappointed.\" Then further I said, \"Make sure don't make a mistake now.\" It last I said, \"Look my clothes are all clean and spots are gone.\"\n\nMary Elizabeth Patches\nA CHANGE OF STAFF.\n\nWhen we came back to school in September many changes had taken place. The Fathers, most of the Sisters and the employees are changed too.\n\nOur Principal is Reverend Father St. Pierre and he is still working as missionary at Union Lake; Reverend Father Lucien who was at Cochin took Reverend Father Pascal's place. The latter had been our kind Principal for the past ten years.\n\nReverend Sister Lucie-des-Anges is the girls' new directoress. Reverend Sister Saint Theophila and Marie-Vital who were here several years ago are back. Sister Madeleine Sophie took the boys' sewing room. Sister H\u00e9l\u00e8ne-de-Rome is the boys' directoress now. Oh! I forgot to mention our new musician, Rev. Sister Laurette-de-Marie who was here about six years ago. We certainly miss our kind Principal and the Sisters who were with us for so many years. Rev. Sister Saint Honore is Superior at Walla Walla. Rev. Sisters St. Salom\u00e9 and Sr. St. Paul-de-Dumas are in Delmas. Sister Saint Luc l'Evang\u00e9liste is in Biggar and Sr. Marie No\u00eblla is in Lacorner.\n\nOur new employees are: Mr. Lord and his son from Bonnyville. Mr. & Mrs. Lavigne with their two children from Denholme. He came last spring to take Mr. Deveyrac's place. Mr. & Mrs. Fortier and their two children from Battleford.\n\nWe started our school year with happy smiling faces. We are ready to do everything with good will among our new friends.\n\nMadeline Dub\u00e9\n\nVISITORS FROM THE EAST.\n\nIt is the 30th day of September and it is the first day of our Reverend Mother Saint Cantal\u00e9on's visit, her assistant is Reverend Mother Marie-Ange. It is very pleasant to see them; it shows that they are glad to be in our midst. So are we, especially the Sisters, because it is one of the greatest visits they can have during the year.\n\nOct 3rd... The fourth day of Reverend Mother's visit, our teacher, Sister Rose-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne had to go to Lloydminster for some business with Mr. & Mrs. Lavigne. Now, as there is no Sister to take her place, we have the honor and luck to have Reverend Mother Marie-Ange for our teacher. The time went by very quickly.\n\nTonight we have our first house party in honor of Reverend Mothers; we all had a grand time. As usual a lunch was served and prizes given out.\n\nOct 6th... Now the week has passed and already our Visitors are leaving for Bonnyville; we are sorry to see them go so soon. We hope that they will come back before long.\n\nCecilia Young\nFather Pascal, our kind principal, departed from us to work as a missionary at Cochin, on September 4th. In his face we could see that he was sad to leave us and so were we. We missed him very much and we do hope that he will come back with us someday.\n\nWe were glad to see him on Nov. 7th; of course he never forgets his children, so he brought us presents. What do you think it was? Balloons! With whistles at the end, he enjoyed them and had great fun.\n\nFather said he liked it at Cochin though he misses our dear old school. We wish he will have all the happiness over there as he had here. We are anxious for his next visit.\n\nANOTHER FEAST\n\nNovember 16th was Sister Superior's Feast. We had a concert, though not very long it was very nice. Everybody took part in it even the Sisters, they sang 'Ave Maria'. The address was read by Madeleine Whitstone.\n\nEverybody was happy but I think our dear Sister Superior was the happiest of all. She is so kind and good to us, that we hope to have her among us many more years.\n\nA KIND VISITOR\n\nMr. Bowers, the Superintendent of Schools, came for his annual visit here on the sixteenth and seventeenth of October. Of course he didn't tell us when he was coming. The first thing we knew he was at our door.\n\nOn the sixteenth he went to the primary classes. The next morning he went to the intermediates and senior classes. In the afternoon just before he left, we had a fire drill.\n\nThe boys then asked him if we could have the remaining time free. He gave his consent and told them to ask the Principal first. Of course Father St. Pierre couldn't refuse. We had a baseball game during that time.\n\nWe certainly are glad and grateful to have a good and kind Inspector like Mr. Bowers is. The children are never shy to speak him when he asks them a question. I hope that he was pleased with his visit here.\n\nI will keep chickens to have eggs. Therese Edwards.\nOn the Feast of the Immaculate Conception we made a little play. Our little play was about Vitamins. To get Vitamins from meat, eggs, milk, sunshine, cod-liver-oil, vegetables and fruit.\n\nWe all had a nice poster. Each child made his own poster.\n\nThe Grade One Pupils.\n\nMade by Julia Petchigan\n\nWhen I am big I will make a garden to have fresh vegetables.\n\nMargaret Lewis\nGrade V\n\nIn grade five we have a mate who likes to giggle all the time,\nFlorence Swan from Cold Lake is the best worker one can find.\n\nQuite fat but not very tall,\nWilhelmina Ennow is the one\nShe is loved by all\nBecause her work is always done.\n\nOur smiling Caroline Angus is in\nGrade five,\nIn many ways she is quite smart,\nShe loves to be last wherever she goes,\nWhere Caroline is, we don't always know.\n\nHelanie Jackknife is the one you'd wish\nFor a friend you'll find in her lovely smile\nThat go miles and miles\nAs she washes dish after dish.\n\nShe takes fun in roasting,\nBut does a lot of laughing,\nShe's very good at arithmetic,\nYou all know little Yvonne Janvier.\n\nOur little friend Eliza Stanley,\nIs always full of joy,\nThough sometimes she may feel cranky\nIt doesn't show, and she makes everyone happy.\n\nIda Jackknife you all know\nIs very slim and tall,\nHer hair are black and her eyes are too\nAnd she always follows the rules.\n\n---\n\nThere was once a boy who went up to a sister and told her that he had a boil on his neck. It happened that another boy heard him, he said, \"So you have a boil on your neck, what's his name? Without smiling the other answered, 'His name is pus'.\"\n\n---\n\nVISITS TO THE HOSPITAL.\n\nIt was Oct. 20th when Caroline Angus, Mary Elizabeth Patchegan and I went to the hospital to have our tonsils out. It was a nice long trip even though we had to go with the mail man in his truck. We had to cross the ferry at Frenchman's Butte because the river was too low at other places. We stayed there five days. We felt lonely, but after all time went by and how glad we were to see Reverend Father St. Pierre come to take us back to school.\n\nWe are not allowed to sing for some time until our throats are completely healed. That is my biggest tonsil trial.\n\n---\n\nMartha Fox's Death.\n\nThis little seven year old girl was at the hospital sometime in August, and she came back to school only in October. After a while her health failed again and she was put in the infirmary. Later on she was taken to the Paradise Hill Hospital. As she was getting worse she was taken by aeroplane to a Saskatoon Hospital. She died there after several days. She received the Last Sacraments.\n\nMartha was buried at Saskatoon. She must be in heaven because she was a quiet little girl and a good little girl too.\n\n---\n\nPoor Copy\naren't we glad to receive a crate of books from Ottawa in October, such a large book shelf at the back of our classroom where so many interesting books are placed. Then we have a few spare minutes we take them to read. Emma Cardinal reads the book of 'Evangelina', and one can always see Hall and Bufflehead digesting 'The Fur Trimmers of the Old West'. Now we have Constance D'Arcy in grade V & VI favourite. Genevieve Simon likes the book about Transportation.\n\nThese and many others are very good books and help us in our studies. I can't mention them all but wouldn't you like to be here and take a peek at 'Sparks From A Thousand Campfires'.\n\nA hearty thank you is extended to the Department of Indian Affairs who take so much interest in the education of our Indian Children.\n\nMary Anne Simon\n\nGrades three and four received story books from the Department. We are very glad.\n\nThis year grade four did not change rooms. Grade two is now in the Junior Room. The Baby Class is taught by Sister Saint Colette in the girls' recreation room. They are 15 small ones.\n\nMy brother Edward is in grade three. We are both in the same room. We like our class room.\n\nWe sometimes play Arithmetic Bingo.\n\nMary Anne Simon\n\nFEAST OF CHRIST OUR KING.\n\nOn this Feast, Oct. 20th, we had a little concert in our class-room.\n\nWe had a playlet called, 'The Last Judgement'.\n\nThe other classes had their parts too.\n\nThe sacrifices were burning while the girls read the consecration to Christ the king.\n\nThe three Fathers spoke to us. Reverend Father Allard told us stories about his missionary work at Meadow Lake. He had come to bring back three girls from Thunderchild.\nOUR SCHOOL\n\nWhat is a School? A school is a place where we learn to love one another sincerely, we learn how to work as Christians should do so and how to suffer generously.\n\nIt is the most important place where we can form ourselves to become worthwhile Canadian men and women.\n\nThe school is a place where we find the means to build our future life and to make the others progress.\n\nFor this we must live in unity while we are altogether in our school. We must not think of ourselves as individuals, by this I mean not to be alone by ourselves (in our own corner). That is, we must not be selfish; we must cooperate with each one and everyone of our schoolmates and teachers.\n\nWe must share our joys, and try to make a companion happy when we see that she or he feels sorry. Let us let others take part in our own happiness.\n\nThe happiest student is the one who shares with his fellow-students. This gives to the entire group a wonderful strength known only to a fraternal co-operation which is capable of overcoming all difficulties.\n\nThe Reverend Fathers and our Teachers have tried their utmost to teach us to become real men and women. It is up to us to behave if we want our school to have a good name and if we want happiness. If we wish we can make our school the finest by studying hard and as I said before by sharing our joys and works with each other.\n\nSt. Paul, speaking of the Mystical Body of Christ, explains the way we get together to be like one. \"The eyes cannot say to the hand, 'I don't need you,' and not more the head say to the feet, 'I don't need your help'.\" On the contrary, the members which seem the most unnecessary are the most useful etc. Therefore a student cannot say to a fellow-student, \"I don't need you\" nor to his professor, \"I don't need your help. I know how etc.\" The School must become a family where we enrich ones knowledge, share we profit of many talents belonging to others, where we direct our spirits towards a common ideal of life, a way of leading all the members towards the same good.\n\nBy staying in this school, it has made us love God. Let us thank Him for giving us this opportunity to learn many things and also the chance to get acquainted with other ideas. We shouldn't waste this important time of our life. If we spend it well, we shall live well with our fellow citizens and this will prepare us to live happily with God in heaven.\n\nCecilia Gouin\nGARNIER RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nSPANISH ONTARIO\n\nCALENDAR\n1947 - 1948\nSEPTEMBER 1947\n\n1 Mon.

The purpose of Mr. Martin's visit was to see at first hand the work being done by the Indian Health Services division of the Department of National Health and Welfare and to confer with the officials of the Family Allowances offices in each province.\n\nMr. Martin's trip carried him as far north as Le Pas to the Clearwater Lake Indian Hospital and as far west as Nanaimo, B.C. In all the Minister of National Health and Welfare visited more than twenty Indian Hospitals, nursing stations, Indian reserves and residential schools in the four western provinces. Earlier in the year Mr. Martin made a trip to Moose Factory on James Bay, to Norway House and to the Indian agencies around Nipigon and Long Lac. Recently Mr. Martin also inspected Indian Health Services in the Maritimes. Since becoming Minister responsible for the administration of Indian Health Services less than a year ago, Mr. Martin has now visited the majority of the hospitals operated by his department.\n\nDuring his visits to the various hospitals and reservations, Mr. Martin found much to impress him with the work being done to stamp out tuberculosis amongst the Indians. \"Primarily our Indian hospitals are being used for the treatment of tuberculosis. This disease is by long odds the main cause of death among the Indian population. The rate per 100 thousand population is about 700 as against 40 per 100 thousand among the white population. At the present time about one per cent of Indians and Eskimos in our population contribute about 12 per cent of tuberculosis deaths in Canada.\"\n\nMr. Martin said that his Department is increasing its Indian Health Services staff along the lines set out in 1946 before the special joint committee of the Senate and the House of Commons appointed to examine the Indian Act. The total staff of the Indian\nHealth Services division including field workers and administrative personnel is between 800 and 900. About fifty of these are permanent civil servants, the remainder being temporary employees.\n\nAt the present time the Department of National Health and Welfare has some twenty hospitals across Canada for the treatment of Indians. In addition, the Department contributes to the support of twenty-one mission hospitals and uses the services of more than 400 conveniently located public hospitals.\n\nMr. Martin also said that the Department has an $300,000 construction program under way for building of new hospitals and nursing stations as well as extending existing installations to relieve overcrowded conditions. In the remote areas the Department is using two-way radio telephone to keep nurses and doctors in touch with treatment centres.\n\nMr. Martin paid a tribute to the work being done by the mission hospitals of all religious denominations. \"From earliest times the churches have been active in this field and no praise is too much for the great work they have done.\"\n\nAt Edmonton, Mr. Martin visited the 350-bed Charles Camsell Indian Hospital, recently taken over from the American Army, and which is the largest single addition to the chain now being operated by the Department. Mr. Martin was also at Wetaskiwin to the Hobbema Reserve where he announced that the Department had under consideration a plan to construct a new hospital. The proposed addition would be used mainly for maternity cases with major surgical cases being transported to the Camsell hospital at Edmonton.\n\nAlso in Alberta, Mr. Martin visited the Saracee hospital at Morley and the Blackfoot hospital at Gleichen. Particularly Mr. Martin was impressed by the quality of work being done by officials in these places. This year to date more than 7,000 Indians in Alberta have been X-rayed for tuberculosis.\n\nIn British Columbia Mr. Martin visited the 185-bed Indian Hospital near Chilliwack and the 200-bed Nanaimo Hospital which was formerly a military hospital. At Miller Bay near Prince Rupert there are 150 tubercular Indians who are receiving treatment at the former RCAF hospital.\nAfter leaving Regina Mr. Martin drove more than 400 miles to visit Indian Reserves, hospitals and residential schools in Saskatchewan. At Fort Qu'Appelle he inspected the modern 70-bed Indian Hospital there. Mr. Martin paid tribute to the assistance and cooperation given to the Department by the Saskatchewan Anti-Tuberculosis League which has played a major part in reducing the incidence of tuberculosis in Saskatchewan. A new powerhouse will be added to the Fort Qu'Appelle hospital as well as a 50-bed extension to the present accommodation.\n\nOn the Crooked Lakes Indian Agency near Broadview, Saskatchewan, Mr. Martin inspected the nursing station and visited patients in the general hospital at Broadview. Mr. Martin stopped over in Elkhorn, Manitoba and Griswold to visit the Indian agencies and confer with the medical staff.\n\nAt Brandon, Manitoba Mr. Martin visited the 200-bed former military hospital which has been taken over by the Department of National Health and Welfare and which is rapidly reaching capacity in the treatment of tuberculous Indians. From Brandon, Mr. Martin flew north to the Clearwater Lake Hospital above Le Pas. He was accompanied on the trip to Le Pas by Ralph Maybank, M.P. for Winnipeg South, newly appointed parliamentary assistant to Mr. Martin and the Honourable Ivan Schultz, Manitoba Minister of Health. Dr. F.E. Moore, Director of Indian Health Services, who has been with Mr. Martin throughout the whole tour of inspection was also a member of the party.\n\nMr. Martin was highly appreciative of the work being done by the Sanatorium Board of Manitoba which operates the Brandon and the Clearwater Lake hospital on behalf of the Department of Health and Welfare. He said that plans are being considered for a $40,000 addition to the Clearwater Hospital to increase the capacity to 185 beds and to supply a fireproof centre block for the institution.\n\nMr. Martin said that he had been greatly impressed by the beneficial effect of extending Family Allowances to the Indians. \"In areas where hunting and trapping have been poor,\" Mr. Martin said, \"Family Allowances have proved to be a lifesaver for many Indian families. The Indians realize that the allowances are for...\"\ntheir children and are using them for the purchase of better clothing and better foods.\"\n\nSumming up the work of his Department amongst the Indians, Mr. Martin said, \"We have a moral obligation to do everything possible to provide better health conditions among the Indians and to help them maintain themselves by improving their standard of living. Good health and better living conditions are the goals which the Indian Health Services division of the Department of National Health and Welfare keeps constantly in mind.\"\n\nExecutive Assistant to the Minister of National Health and Welfare.\n\nA CHRISTMAS MESSAGE FROM DR. CHARLES CAMSELL\n\nTO THE PATIENTS AND STAFF OF THE CHARLES CAMSELL INDIAN HOSPITAL.\n\nSome time ago I was asked to contribute to the interesting new publication with which you are all familiar, \"THE CAMSELL ARROW.\"\n\nI have delayed my response to that invitation, but the approach of the Christmas Season affords me an opportunity to send my good wishes which I do not wish to forego.\n\nFirst, I must congratulate those who planned for, and established, the \"ARROW\" for it is a most effective means of drawing together in common interest all those whose life centers in the hospital for such a great part of their time. I have read each issue published so far, and am convinced that \"THE ARROW\" is reaching its mark \u2014 and hitting the bullseye \u2014 to a gratifying degree.\n\nAll of the 43 years that I have spent in the Public Service of Canada have been devoted to the search for, and the development of, those material resources of our country which would open greater opportunities within the Dominion, strengthen its economic fabric, increase its prestige before the world and, most important, raise the standard of living of its citizens by making available for their benefit the products of this vast land. All of these things\nare essential to our wellbeing, but they serve only our material interests.\n\nThe hospital of which you are a part has a much more personal and beneficent purpose. The building had already a long record of humanitarian service, both as a Church institution and as a medical centre for the men of the United States Army, before it was taken over by the Federal Government for its present uses. During my term of office as Deputy Minister of the Department of Mines and Resources and Commissioner of the Northwest Territories, I was charged with the welfare of the Indian and Esquimaux peoples of Canada. Later, that responsibility was assumed by the Department of National Health and Welfare.\n\nWhen the then Minister of the Department of National Health and Welfare intimated that he would like to use my name for the newly acquired hospital, I felt deeply honoured. I was naturally very much gratified to have my name used in this connection. But my gratification was deeper than this small vanity. This is an institution devoted to a purpose more vital to Canada than the development of its material riches. It is working to restore and strengthen our human resources, potentially the most valuable asset a nation may possess. Especially is it vital work when it brings health and wellbeing to our citizens in the North Country, where exacting conditions demand unusual reserves of fitness and fortitude.\n\nI know, from experience, how difficult that northern life can be, but as this Festive Season approaches, even in a year when much of the world is gravely troubled, I remember the cheery lines which Sir Walter Scott wrote in his poem \"Marmion\" -\n\nHeap on more wood! The wind is chill,\nBut let it whistle as it will,\nWe'll keep our Christmas merry still.\"\n\nI hope that all those within the walls of The Charles Gamsell Indian Hospital, upon the anniversary of the birth of The Prince of Peace, may find it possible to keep their Christmas merry - and to find before them a year of health and happiness.\nAnd Mary brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.\n\nAnd there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flocks by night.\n\nAnd, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them; and they were sore afraid.\n\nAnd the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.\n\nFor unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour which is Christ the Lord.\n\nSt. Luke, Chap. 2.\nVerses 7-11.\n\nCHRISTMAS CHURCH SERVICES\n\nUnited Church\nSunday, Dec. 21,\n9 A.M.\nRev. Woodsworth\n\nRoman Catholic\nChristmas Day,\nMass,\n8.15 A.M.\nFather Langevin\n\nChurch of England\nChristmas Day,\nHoly Communion,\n11.00 A.M.\nCanon Clough\nA CHRISTMAS MESSAGE TO THE PATIENTS OF\nTHE CHARLES CANSELL HOSPITAL,\nEDMONTON, ALTA.\n\nShall we join with Tiny Tim in\nhis little prayer for all who share the\nChristmas Spirit \"God Bless us every\none\". Tiny Tim, of Dickens' Christmas\nCarol, was a little cripple on crutches,\nwho, in spite of suffering and poverty,\nbrought sunshine and joy into his home\nand into the somber life of his father,\nBob. At this time of the year it is not only our opportunity but our\nduty to give joy and gladness to everyone within range of our influence.\n\nIn the Bible account of the birth of Jesus we read that the\nAngel Choir sang, \"Glory to God in the Highest and on Earth, Peace\nto Men of Good Will\". Without \"good will\" it is impossible to have\npeace in our world, so this \"good will\" is needed in the hearts and\nminds of all peoples, not merely those of one nation; and, also, in\nthe lives of boys and girls and men and women right in our Hospital.\nAs one of your Chaplains I have been much impressed by the cheerfulness\nof the patients and I trust that this \"good will\" may be diffused\nin spheres far beyond our Hospital walls.\n\nIt should also be remembered that the Christmas message\ncame not to the great and rich but to the humble shepherds\nwatching their flocks on the hill of Judaea. They were the first to\nwelcome the Christ Child, and to-day, the humble, the pure in heart,\nand the peace makers are the most devout worshippers of the\n\"Prince of Peace\".\n\nI wish you all a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.\n\n12131-96 St. J.F. Woodsworth\n(Rev. Dr. J.F. Woodsworth)\nA MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL!\n\nEvery year we are so happy to recall the blessed event of the coming of the Saviour amongst us. The world, at the time, was in need of a Redeemer. The nations, the families and the individuals, nineteen hundred years ago, did not realize, as we do today, that the coming of the little babe at Bethlehem, would be the solution to all the problems of the human heart. \"Glory be to God in the Highest! Peace be to all men of Good Will,\" the angels sang. And, true enough, the Infant Jesus brought to our earth the only peace and joy of any value.\n\nThis event is nineteen centuries away. But its effect is still with us. For Christ is still amongst us with His graces, His benedictions, and His peace. Every Christmas, and this December in particular, sees a renewal of all these benedictions in every man of Good Will. May you all enjoy a Merry Christmas with all possible consolations. This is my wish and my prayer for you all.\n\nAnd may I take this opportunity to thank each and every one of the staff for the kindness, charity and devotion, which our dear patients have been so fortunate in receiving from you all. May the Saviour on this Christmas night enkindle in our hearts true love for humanity and the courage to imitate all his virtues.\n\nGod bless you all!\n\nMerry Christmas!\n\nJ.E. Pratt\n(Rev. Father Pratt, O.M.I.)\n\nF. Gamache\n(Rev. Father Gamache, O.M.I.)\n\"A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year and God Bless every one of us.\"\n\nDid you ever stop to think why everything is so different at Christmas? People are more generous to each other; not only is this shown by the exchange of gifts, but it is marked in the attitude of person to person. There are more smiles, more big and little deeds of kindness. The usually bad-tempered are better tempered; young and old, rich and poor. All are possessed of the desire to be happy.\n\nWhy is this? The fact is that on this day we think of God's gift to the world - the gift of His Son. We see in that Holy Family at Bethlehem something that inspires us. There we see Peace on Earth amongst men of Good Will, and catching the spirit of it, we exclaim, \"This is what the world needs.\" If ever there were a time when the ancient prophecy were true that \"A little child shall lead them\", it is at this Christmas season.\n\nMay we all, like the shepherds of old, \"Even now go on to Bethlehem and see what the Lord hath wrought for man.\" And, there, catching some of the spirit of God's love let us carry it through the year in our daily lives.\n\nTo the Medical Director, Staff and Patients, I wish the Blessings of Christmas and a Happy New Year.\n\nC.F.A. Clough\n(Canon Clough)\nTHE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS\n\nwas the night before Christmas when all through the house,\nNot a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.\nThe stockings were hung by the chimney with care,\nIn hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.\n\nThe children were nestled all snug in their beds,\nWhile visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads,\nAnd Mamma in her kerchief and I in my cap,\nHad just settled down for a long winter's nap.\n\nWhen out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,\nI sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.\nAway to the window I flew like a flash,\nTore open the shutters and threw up the sash.\nThe moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow,\nGave a luster of midday to objects below.\n\nWhen what to my wondering eyes should appear,\nBut a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer;\nWith a little old driver, so lively and quick,\nI knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.\n\nMore rapid than eagles his coursers they came,\nAnd he whistled and shouted, and called them by name:\n\"Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen!\nOn, Comet! On, Cupid! On, Donder and Blitzen!\nTo the top of the porch, to the top of the wall!\nNow, dash away, dash away, dash away all!\"\n\nAs dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,\nWhen they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky,\nSo up to the house-top the coursers they flew,\nWith a sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas, too.\nAnd then in a twinkling, I heard on the roof\nThe prancing and pawing of each little hoof.\nAs I drew in my head, and was turning around,\nDown the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.\n\nHe was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot,\nAnd his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;\nBundle of toys he had flung on his back,\nAnd he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.\n\nHis eyes how they twinkled! His dimples how merry!\nHis cheeks were like roses! His nose like a cherry!\nHis droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,\nAnd the beard on his chin was as white as the snow.\n\nThe stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,\nAnd the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.\nHe had a broad face and a little round belly\nThat shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.\n\nHe was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,\nAnd I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.\nA wink of his eye and a twist of his head,\nSoon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.\n\nHe spoke not a word but went straight to his work\nAnd filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,\nAnd laying his finger aside of his nose,\nAnd giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.\n\nHe sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,\nAnd away they all flew like the down on a thistle.\nBut I heard him exclaim ere he drove out of sight:\n\"HAPPY CHRISTMAS TO ALL AND TO ALL A GOOD-NIGHT!\"\n\n-Clement C. Moore\nAnd then in a twinkling, I heard on the roof\nThe prancing and pawing of each little hoof.\nAs I drew in my head, and was turning around,\nDown the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.\n\nHe was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot,\nAnd his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;\nA bundle of toys he had flung on his back,\nAnd he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.\n\nHis eyes how they twinkled! His dimples how merry!\nHis cheeks were like roses! His nose like a cherry!\nHis droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,\nAnd the beard on his chin was as white as the snow.\n\nThe stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,\nAnd the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.\nHe had a broad face and a little round belly\nThat shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.\n\nHe was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,\nAnd I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.\nA wink of his eye and a twist of his head,\nSoon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.\n\nHe spoke not a word but went straight to his work\nAnd filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,\nAnd laying his finger aside of his nose,\nAnd giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.\n\nHe sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,\nAnd away they all flew like the down on a thistle.\nBut I heard him exclaim ere he drove out of sight:\n\"HAPPY CHRISTMAS TO ALL AND TO ALL A GOOD-NIGHT!\"\n\n-Clement C. Moore\nA TALE OF CHRISTMAS EVE\n\n(Told by a Christmas stocking)\n\nIt was long past midnight and the stocking was angry\u2014very angry.\n\n\"To be taken out of a nice comfortable drawer on a winter's night,\" he grumbled, \"and to be strung up here to a bed post like a common thing. For my word, it's too bad. I wonder what it is all about?\"\n\nA little girl lay fast asleep in bed. Her clothes were neatly folded on the chair, her stockings were hanging over the back and her two little red shoes were snoring together on the floor.\n\n\"I miss my mate,\" said the stocking, \"It's downright monstrous to take one stocking from a drawer and leave its mate behind.\"\n\nJust as it was finished speaking there was a noise in the chimney and the stocking was amazed to see a white-bearded gentleman in a red cloak descending to the hearth. It was none other than Santa Claus!\n\nOld Santa let a big bag of toys slide to the floor.\n\n\"Ha,\" he said cheerfully, \"How she has grown, to be sure! Last year I could have put her in my waistcoat pocket. What a tidy child she is! Clothes neatly folded, no broken toys about, last year's doll safely tucked into its cradle. The Teddy Bear hasn't lost an eye and the grey rabbit is still full of saw-dust. I shall give her lots of good things.\"\n\nHe put his hand on the stocking, \"Well, my grumbling friend, what is the matter with you to-night?\"\n\n\"Oh, I am lonely,\" answered the stocking, \"They took me out of my nice warm drawer and hung me up here alone in the dark and away in the cold. I am lonesome for my stocking mate and I cannot understand it all.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll warm you quick enough,\" laughed old Santa. Diving into his sack he began to cram the stocking right to the top with toys and goodies.\n\n\"Look out!\" cried the stocking. \"You'll split me if you are not careful. What do you think I am? I am a stocking\u2014not a barrel! Hi, what are you up to now? I can't stand any more! You are stretching me out of shape. Just look at my toe! What a shape I am now! You'll burst me!\"\n\nIn the morning bright and early the little girl awoke. She emptied the stocking of all the toys. The poor stocking fell forgotten to the floor. How forlorn it felt! It could have cried!\n\nThe little girl's mother put the stocking back in the drawer.\n\n\"Well,\" said its mate, \"and where have you been all night? You ought to be ashamed of yourself, keeping me awake all night waiting for you.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" said the stocking, \"I've never worked so hard before or had so much fun. Humans are queer folk! But permit me to wish you a merry Christmas and a happy New Year,\" and snuggling down in his drawer, he went to sleep.\nCHRISTMAS\n\nChristmas is a merry time,\nJoy for young and old,\nEveryone is buying gifts.\nThough it may be cold.\nOh, what jolly fun it is\nTo decorate the tree\nAnd do the other things that fill\nKiddies' hearts with glee.\nSo, real happiness is found,\nNot in selfish living,\nBut when hearts, both bright and gay\nJoin in joyous giving.\n\nComposed by; Jean Coutoreille,\nWard 1, Sun Porch.\n\nLETTERS TO SANTA CLAUS FROM THE GIRLS IN WARD II.\n\nDear Santa,\n\nHere I am again on my way writing just a few lines to say\nHello and how are you?

Castitis is caused directly from Cantstayinbeditis\u2014a fever which seems to develop in almost anybody who doesn't realize how serious a disease Tuberculosis is and how necessary bed rest is for cure.\n\nCantstayinbeditis usually comes on in one person at first but spreads fairly rapidly to others in the same ward and actually it should be listed as a communicable disease. Oddly enough, once it reaches the stage of Castitis in one case, the outbreak in any designated ward seems to rapidly subside. This quiescence is of varying length of time.\n\nThe onset of Castitis is usually insidious. As Cantstayinbeditis becomes more acute the case is reported to the Doctor. If symptoms continue despite friendly and then more severe administrations of the medical staff, the patient develops hard, white, stiff, thick casements with cross bars between, on both legs below the knees. As a rule this condition enforces full bed rest although cases have been known in which crusting breaks\u2014by design or otherwise. When this occurs the only known treatment is removal, whereupon, a harder, stronger cast usually is seen to appear which sometimes spreads even to the chest. The disease is then, of course, in a very advanced and serious stage.\n\nThe usual treatment for a person with Castitis is rest and cooperation. The condition seems to improve those cases of tuberculosis which do not voluntarily accept recommended routine. After varying periods of time when the victim is convinced of the necessity for cooperation in the cure of his disease, tuberculosis, the cast suddenly and completely disappears and in the majority of cases does not recur.\n\nThe best way to avoid the disease is to keep clear of any symptoms of Cantstayinbeditis. Of course, it is to be hoped that the recent epidemic of Castitis is now completely under control.\n\nContributed - T.J.O.\n\nPLEASE NOTE\n\nCanon Clough would like to draw your attention to the fact that the Holy Communion Service of the Church of England on Christmas Day has been changed from 11 o'clock to 8.30 A.M.\nDecember 4, 1947\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nMrs. Grantham has asked me to write a story about our clinic's recent trip to the Indian Agencies in \"The Land Beyond the Peace\", as the country north of the Dawson Creek is so romantically called. I am writing from Toronto where I am enjoying a very pleasant holiday just now. We are having very mild weather with no snow and the north country seems very far away.\n\nDr. Smith and I left Edmonton on October 22 in the old laundry truck, to visit the Indians of the Fort St. John Agency. The Cree and Beaver bands of Moberley Lake had been suffering from an epidemic of whooping cough, and many of the children were very ill with it. We spent one night at Driftpile, enjoying the hospitality of Miss Jean Burgess, our Public Health Nurse there. The second day we arrived at Dawson Creek, where we stayed overnight at the Mile Zero Hotel. The next day we took the trail to Moberley Lake \u2014 and what a trail! For 23 miles we ploughed through mud, crawled up steep hills, and carefully wormed our way down mountainsides on a road never designed for motor transport. However, we eventually arrived at our destination, only having been stuck twice, which was something of an accomplishment. We lived in cabins at Moberley, I being the cook these days \u2014 and we both survived! We met Miss Margaret Lattimer, the British Columbia Public Health Nurse from Fort St. John, who had very kindly and most effectively gone to the aid of the Indians while we were not available. She had done a grand job of looking after all the sick people there and with her help, we were able to make sure that everyone was well on the road to recovery while we were there. Dr. Smyth held a dental clinic in the Post Office, very kindly opened to us by Mr. Harry Garbitt, and many people were relieved of their aching and decayed teeth. Mr. Galibois, the Indian Agent, joined us, and was most helpful in our work. We left Moberley in a convoy of four vehicles and were fortunate in reaching Fort St. John without incident.\n\nWe proceeded north with Mr. Galibois in his very comfortable and well-equipped truck and visited Indians at Doig River, Beaton River, Prophet River and Fort Nelson. We immunized all the children against whooping cough, diphtheria and small pox, examined all chests, and\nextracted nearly all the bad teeth in this section of the Alaska Highway. We visited day schools at Prophet River and Fort Nelson, and did physical examinations of all children. The scenery along the highway is very beautiful, \u2014 snow-capped mountains and lakes all the way. North of Fort Nelson we visited the family of the famous Alaska Highway character, Charlie MacDonald,\u2014 we examined all ten children and gave them toxoid. At Muncho Lake we had a day's rest on Sunday. Dr. Smyth climbed a mountain and Mr. Galibois and I went to the hot springs. It was very cold, so we decided not to swim, but the water was as hot as a really hot bath and smelled very strongly of sulphur.\n\nOn Monday we proceeded north again seeing Indians at various places. We spent the night at Rancheria in the Yukon, and then on to Whitehorse. We saw Mr. Meek, the Indian Agent and Miss Hackett, Public Health Nurse, and with them visited the Indian schools in Whitehorse and Carcross and the hospital in Whitehorse. We also, saw the Indians at Champagne and Burwash. The Yukon is a very lovely country \u2014 mountainous and snow-covered at present, but still most fascinating. After an interesting and enjoyable visit Dr. Smyth and I set forth on the long journey home. At Fort Nelson his time was running short and he was obliged to take the plane back to Edmonton, so I completed the drive by truck alone. I had a very pleasant visit in Fort St. John and set out for Edmonton in the old Dodge, arriving Sunday, November 16, very much relieved to see the city lights again after nearly four weeks in the north.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to wish to all the readers of THE ARROW a very merry Christmas and all the best of good luck and good health in the new year.\n\nLouise M. Parr,\n(Louise M. Parr, Regn. N.)\n(Northern Mobile Clinic.)\n\n\"The dear old days, the good old times,\nCome rushing back with the Christmas Chimes,\nAnd dear old friends, tho' far away,\nAre close in the heart on Christmas Day.\"\nDear Girls and Boys:\n\nI cannot let this copy of \"Island Breezes\" go to press without expressing my sincere and heartfelt wishes for the New Year and without drawing your attention to the fact that you can easily find happiness in the everyday things of life. Happy New Year! Good Health to You All! You know how lonely you feel when you are sick in bed, so my first wish is that you be healthy. Happy also means cheerful. A kind child is what pleases me most. To be kind is to be polite. Jesus taught us true kindness and politeness. A truly Christian girl and boy is polite. St. Phillip of Neri, known as the lovable saint because of his politeness, never ordered anyone to do what he desired. He always said: \"Please, or would you mind doing this?\" It was a sort of prayer. It was a good life and a sad face do not go together. The better the children are, the happier they are because our Lord Jesus loves them and they love Him too, and they have every reason to be happy. Not long ago there lived a young lady who was so cheerful that when she was too busy to meet her friends they would say: \"Where will be no laughing today.\" Sister Theresa is not with us. St. Theresa of the Child Jesus was so tenderly kind that everyone felt at ease with her.\n\nBe polite, be cheerful and your days will be filled with happiness and it will go out to those around you. Make this little verse your very own for 1948:\n\n\"The kindest thing in the kindest way.\"\n\nThere are the wishes of your Father whose one great desire is that you be HAPPY. Father Remy, O.M.I.\nMANY SANTA CLAUS'S HERE\n\nBefore Christmas, Reverend Father Remy brought us some very nice presents and told Sister who serve us dinner, \"Sister who serve us didn't understand why we didn't eat\u2014can you?\" \u2014Freddy Ramsay (V)\n\nCHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS\n\nDec. 23rd was the last day of school\u2014a pleasant one to remember. The toys and other gifts which Father Remy had brought to each class during the holydays were distributed. We had a lovely party for the morning; the tree in our room was filled with gifts from Sr. Gauche and beneath it we found a gramophone from Sr. Superior.\n\nThree times, during the holydays Father Superior brought candy for all. On Epiphany, myself and Catherine Petit received more gifts from Sr. Superior.\n\nWe sincerely thank Father Remy, Sister Superior and all the sisters who made our Xmas holidays so pleasant.\n\nSCHOOL COMMITTEE RE-ELECTED\n\nOn Jan. 6th, a meeting was held in the parish hall to elect the school officials for 1948. Last year's committee was maintained in office.\n\nChairmen: Mr. M. Marion\nCouncillors: Dr. P. Laviole\nSec.-Treasurer: Rev. G. Remy\n\nMany parents were present and all were satisfied with the treatment both in and out of school. They expressed their appreciation of the teachers' devotedness; of their children's progress and the many advantages which the latter are enjoying.\n\nTHANK YOU\n\nI thank Father Remy for the toys he gave us because we were good boys and girls. I was glad to have one of the toys. \u2014Jeanne Morin (II)\n\nACTIVITIES OF THE SPECIAL CLASS\n\nWhen school re-opened on January 7th, the girls were given a lesson in cutting out dresses using patterns. Marie Rose Adalium (15 yrs.) made the first dress, cutting it alone and sewing it on the machine given by Mr. Piercy, our school superintendent.\n\nMadeleine Guilloumeau, 11, made the second dress. Jeanne d'Arc Bekkia, 12, is now in the class will each have their turn.\n\nOUR CHRISTMAS PARTY\n\nOn Dec. 23rd, we had a little party in the senior hall. First us the games; toys and nice prizes Father Superior had brought. Then we played Bingo. The winner did not know what he was choosing because everything was wrapped up. All the packages were opened at the same time. Luckily we could exchange gifts because some boys didn't know what to do with flashy barrettes.\n\nThe grade 8 and 9 girls had a good holiday at home. I played a lot of cards so glad to see my little sister. We all tried to be good and help each other. \u2014Clarice O'Driscoll (III)\nIt's a two year old tradition now! The big Christmas concert was held on Dec. 21, in the parish hall gaily decorated with green, red and silver hangings and shimmering bells\u2014a surprise from Rev. Father Remy to his teachers.\n\nThe seniors opened the program with the well known song: \"It Is Christmas Everywhere\" whilst Sheila Ahenakew extended a warm welcome to the Rev. Fathers, Sisters, parents and friends.\n\nThe little ones then sang \"Santa Claus is Coming Here\" Jolly old Saint Nick couldn't have been very far away for he put in an appearance in the next playlet, \"Santa's Toyshop featuring three helpers, Leon McCallum, Alfred Petit, George Raymond and six live mechanical dolls impersonated by Sister Belley's beginners: Armand Bouvier, a Jack-in-the-box; Archie Daigleault, the clown; Kenneth Petit, the Indian doll; Margaret McCallum the French doll; Amable Morin Black Sambo, and Jimmy Durocher, the King of the Cowboys. After being \"cranked\" they were put through their tricks to the delight of all.\n\nA group of seven little \"Wooden Soldiers\" from Miss Smetka's class then gave us their action song. Each wore a shiny sword which they had whittled themselves from old apple boxes.\n\nSr. Brady's pupils then amused us with their playlet \"Bravery\". Williamina Ramsay, Delia Jacobson, Florence Beilanger, Therese Raymond, who had boasted of their bravery were soon standing on chairs in fear of the imaginary mouse used by Thomas Hanson to make them show their true color\u2014a bit yellow the boys thought.\n\nThe seniors then played Jingle Bells on their tom-toms and sang the new version which substitutes \"The little jeep at 50 per for the one-horse open sleigh of grandma's day.\"\n\nSr. Levesque's class staged \"The Christmas Story Books\" spoken by Claire Maurice, Delphine Durocher and Gabriel McCallum. The choir in red cassocks and white surplices sang the Christmas Carols illustrated on the screen with the help of the school opaque projector.\n\nThe Seniors finally put on a 3 act play, Dickens' \"Christmas Carol\" starring miserly Scrooge (Raymond Ayotte), Marley's ghost in a realistic skeleton attire (Ed. Desjarlais), the Christmas Spirit (Ant. Roy), cheerful Bob Cratchit (Louis Ayotte), efficient Mrs. Cratchit (Lena Ahenakew) their children; Peter (Alex. McCallum) Martha, (Annie Durocher) Belinda, (Mary Mispouanas) Sammy, (Leon McCallum) Sue, (Clarisse Caiss\u00e9, gr. III) and Tiny Tim, little Marcel Laliert\u00e9 from grade II.\n\nBetween the acts a group from Sr. Brady's class performed a Star Drill; another from Miss Smetka's sang \"The Little Town of Bethlehem\" whilst a third from Sr. Levesque's recited \"The Christmas Pudding\". The Happy-Go-Lucky Club rendered a Christmas Hymn and \"Dreaming of a white Xmas.\"\n\nA Christmas Concert is not complete without a tableau of the Nativity. Christine Jacobsen impersonated the Virgin, and Victor Desjarlais, Saint Joseph. Angels, shepherds and kings took part in the final pageant; appropriate hymns were sung off-stage and all the colors of the rainbow were flashed on this impressive scene.\n\nRev. Father Superior addressed encouraging words to the children whose progress he was pleased to note; words of thanks to all the sisters who have at heart the children's welfare and a Merry Christmas to parents and friends who had come to applaud the children's success.\n\nMary Tunstead was announcer and Florence Ahenakew collected at the door.\n\nMEN CAN BE USEFUL\n\nDecorating the parish hall is a man-size job thought Brother LEFEBVRE. So he spent his only free afternoon reaching for the ceiling and sucking pins instead of his pipe. \"And Brother, would you have a look at the curtains\u2014they refuse to slide back and forth.\" A pair of pincers, a man's hand and skill\u2014and a set of rings replaces the awkward safety pins.\n\nThen, who made the framework for the grotto, rang the midnight gong, tended to beards and mustaches\u2014Brother Lefebvre, the handy-man to whom we say a well deserved \"Thank you.\"\n\nPHOTO FLASHED\n\nAnother surprise from Rev. Father Superior. The photo-flash bulbs he had ordered came just in time to be tried out on the costumed actors of the Christmas concert.\n\nTheir pictures, taken right on the stage by Father Remy will appear on first page of the new school album donated by the Ahenakew girls. Marley's ghost is so natural that we can almost hear him moan: \"Ooooooh! Woe is me!\"\n### December Meet\n\nOn December 15, a regular meeting of the club was held around the bigIPvcityInitiated tree. faster butterfly played \"White Christmas\": Rev. Winchester awakened all alumni \u2014 the recreation of all song The Superiors taped-waiterals appearance for the boys who had gone straight-hand club members.

This is how they did it.\n\nThe men had killed a moose\u2014a rare event these past years\u2014and brought the hide home to their women who immediately soaked it in a tub of water so that it would not harden before they worked on it. The men also made a frame with four poles\u2014and their task was ended.\n\nThe women punched holes around the hide to tie it to the frame which they stood upright against 2 trees. With a sharp bone, they scraped off the fur on one side, the flesh from underneath and let it stand for a night.\n\nThe next day they removed the hide from the frame and rubbed it on both sides with the brains of the moose which the men had saved. This takes the place of oil, I was told. It was then left to dry in the sun for a few days.\n\nWhen it was dry, they soaked it again in water to soften it. They took the hide to the bush, hung it over a strong branch, and wrung it with a stick, turning it over and over until not a drop of water could be squeezed out of it. While the skin was drying, the women scraped it and beat it with covers of pails to make it fuzzy and soft on both sides. It was now ready to be tanned.\n\nThey sewed the skin together lengthwise, leaving both ends open. With three sticks they built a tepee and made a fire with rotten wood directly beneath it. The smoke which curled in and out of the roll of skin, tanned it to a golden color.\n\nFinally they cut out the mocassins according to a simple pattern of their own. Some sewed on the colored beads, scarce and expensive since the war, while others embroidered the floral designs which they had traced on the skin with a little stick dipped in a red solution made with a piece of crepe paper.\n\nWhat patient labour it required\u2014definitely a woman's work! Florence Ahenakew (IX)\n\nSASKATOON PLAYS SANTA\n\nThe Carter Trucks replaced the reindeer sleigh and Sr. A. Lachance, superior of St Paul Hospital, Saskatoon, substituted for Santa.\n\nGuess what? She sent a Beatty electric washing machine to replace the wooden one that ran with \"elbow grease\" and plenty of it.\n\nThe machine was filled with gifts for the boys in residence\u2014the best one being an electric clipper. The older boys who had the task of keeping 62 heads in shape, will now find it a pleasure to be barber. Sincere thanks to Sr. Superior Lachance.\n\n\"To get the best of an argument, keep out of it.\"\n\n---\n\nTO ALL BORN IN FEBRUARY\n\nEugene Kenny ...

Our dresses won't be dragging around now. We also have a new table in the sewing room. For our Christmas present, Sr. Superior Boisvert gave us a new gramophone. We like it and played it from morning till night during the holidays. Thanks to Sr. Superior and Brother Boisvert.\n\nElise Daigneault (V)\n\nDECORATIONS TAKEN DOWN\n\nOn Jan. 9, our teacher asked Alexandre McCallum to take down the class decorations. First he took the table, then put a chair on it and on top of that, he put a stool. He was shaking when he climbed up to get the centre bells.\n\nLeon McCallum was Alexandre's slave and had to do whatever his boss asked. I think Alexandre was acting a little smart to make us laugh. That is what I call a little dope. George Raymond (V)\nFOR THE MUSEUM\n\nIt would be worthwhile starting one to preserve this RARITY for future generations\u2014this is no fossil we are talking about, but a cheque from the Provincial FISHING BOARD forwarded to Francis Bouvier, Ile a la Crosse, in a closed envelope, bearing a four cent stamp.\n\nAmount of cheque:\nONE CENT ONLY. It's worth a Trame along with Geordy Belanger's cheque for 8 cents only and George Murray's for 12 cents only\u2014all from the same source.\n\nIT PAYS TO FISH-----\nBUT WHO??? That's the #64 question in the North. One fact we can't deny: The Board is HONEST to the last cent!\n\nTHE NEXT BINGO\n\nRetain the date; on Shrove Tuesday, Feb. 10, the next bingo will be held at the mission in the Parish Hall.

If one breaks one's arm, the doctor puts it into a cast in order to put the arm at rest. In the same way pneumothorax, pneumoperitoneum and Thoracoplasty, as well as bed rest, help to put the lung at rest.\n\nEvery patient in this hospital is placed on a routine that is best and safest for the amount of disease that he or she may have. So you can readily see how wise and important it is for everyone to stick to the routine ordered if they wish to get well as soon as possible. You must not think that it is enough to take just the regular rest periods. It is dangerous to take more exercise than is allowed by your routine. Do not forget that sitting or standing is work. So, also, is excitement or games.\n\nThe doctors and nurses are worried when they see the patients disregarding their advice and breaking routine. They know how much disease you have and what is best for you. That is why they are so anxious for you to stick to your routine. As you get better you will be allowed more and more exercise.\n\nDon't forget the more rest you take the more healing occurs. The sooner you recover your health the sooner you will be able to go home to your loved ones and families.\n\nM. Matas, M.D.\n\nA book is like a magic box\u2014\nBrimful of lovely treasure;\nOne quaint, old-fashioned key unlocks\nGood gifts in generous measure,\nGay songs, and words like jewels old,\nTales carved from ancient times,\nAnd shining legends set in gold,\nAnd chains of silver rhymes.\nPatients in hospital suffering from Tuberculosis often feel as though their stay in bed is time wasted. This is definitely the wrong idea to have. Remember there are no insurmountable bars to at least some measure of success. Genius often comes from the most unexpected places.\n\nOne of the most beneficial effects on any person's life comes from the books they read. Whenever and wherever it is possible, each one of us should read good books and magazines and read them constantly.\n\nMany of you are not on a high enough routine to do the things in which you are most interested. However, if you take the cure intelligently, that means keeping the rest periods faithfully each and every day, and if you maintain a happy outlook your recovery will be more rapid.\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson (who suffered from Tuberculosis) once wrote, \"To travel hopeful is a better thing than to arrive, and the true success is to labour.\"\n\nL.A.

We miss her very much and hope she will be back some day.\n\nThe high routine patients in our ward enjoyed an excursion to the Edmonton City Bakery as part of our car ride on August 27. We saw the making of bread from the sponge to the wrapped loaf. When we had finished our tour, the man gave us each a gift of cookies.\n\nDelphine and Louise Burnstick decided to spend the afternoon playing checkers. Louise defeated Delphine in the first game and suddenly the checkers ended on the floor. No further games were played that afternoon.\n\nMargaret Ward has joined the Fashion Parade with a lovely new house coat.\n\nWARD II.\n\nOn Thursday, September 4, five of us went for a car ride. We went through the grounds of the Parliament Buildings. The flowers were in full bloom and were beautiful. We had some snapshots taken. We had a lovely afternoon.\n\nWe miss Yvonne Tibbet and Glenna Mykoose who were moved to a private ward as they have been quite sick lately.\n\nOne night Lily Papin, already having two blankets, asked for a third. We went to the window thinking it must surely be winter, but found the grass was still green and it was only a chilly night.\n\nOne day during rest period, Eliza Whitehead was coloring and dropped her crayons. In trying to reach for them, she toppled out on the floor with a great thud. At first we were afraid it was thunder, but no, it was just Eliza! Moral: Don't color during the rest period.\n\nOn canteen order day, Doris bought 3 revels, 2 packages of life-savers, 2 chocolate bars and 2 bottles of pop. The order was delivered just before\n\n(Cont'd)\nrest period. Later we went to see her and all that was left were two empty bottles. What a rest Doris must have had!\n\nDoris learned by bitter experience that a finger goes into a bottle more easily than it comes out.\n\nWhenever Adeline hears music she starts to dance. Delia does her dancing in her dreams.\n\nWARD III.\n\nOne evening we were talking about the contest that Bert Pearl and the Happy Gang were giving. Mary Jane Boucher and Margaret Eaglechild decided to enter the contest. We asked Maggie Royal if she were going to enter and she answered, \"No, I am going to give the rest a chance to win first prize.\"\n\nOn Tuesday we were entertained by the show, \"Roughly Speaking\", starring Jack Carson and Rosalind Russell. We enjoyed it very much.\n\nLittle Marie Black Rider cannot speak nor understand English. But nevertheless when we tell funny stories she always joins our laughter. One day she was watching us play Bingo. After Marie had heard us call \"Bingo\" a few times, she called out \"Finger\".\n\nIn our ward Elise Laboucan is the entertainer. Whenever music comes on she is on her toes dancing.\n\nNellie Littlelight became tired of waiting for the ward aide to come for her after her X-Ray. She smelled something good and thinking it was chicken she hurried upstairs by herself. To her surprise it was only STEW for dinner.\n\nThe joke was on Angeline Willier. She hurriedly picked up the mail from the desk. Imagine her surprise when she started to sort it, to find that one was a letter she had put there to be mailed two hours ago.\n\nWARD III D.\n\nJennie Cardinal is very cheerful lately as she gets visitors almost every visiting period. The other day her sister brought her a watermelon. We are all very fond of watermelon so we decided to be extra nice to Jennie that day. It worked for we all got a piece.\n\nLeona Chalifoux gets rather upset when the nurse sends her back to bed after catching her taking exercise. So now she has decided that it is better to stick to routine and stay in bed and make puzzles. Not a bad idea, Leona!\nWARD IV.\n\nOn Wednesday, August 27, we had a grand car ride. We visited the Edmonton City Bakery. A man showed us around and explained how bread was made, baked and wrapped. He showed us, also, the cake room where the cakes were made. We watched a decorator making fancy pink icing for a birthday cake. As we were leaving we were each given a box of cookies, and one for Ada whom we had to leave in the car.\n\nA few days ago Ada and Doris received a letter from Aklavik in Eskimo. Apparently, the person who wrote it did not know much about the language, so they did not get much out of the letter. However, they had a good laugh and intend to answer it.\n\nCan there be a ghost around? Sarah Koptana's things are always disappearing. She has lost practically everything but her locker, and is beginning to be a little irked about it.\n\nOn the night of August the ninth three patients from Cardston were admitted to our ward. Irene went into the washroom and, by mistake, went out the door leading into the hall. She tried door after door and finally found herself on the first floor. Here the night nurse rescued her and guided her back to her ward. She said, when she got into bed, \"I have never seen a place with so many doors!\"\n\nMargaret Kend\u00f6 is always laughing but no one seems to be able to find out what the joke is. If we ask her the only answer we get is, \"That's what I would like to know!\"\n\nArabella Fox and Irene have a ball game almost every day. It is a funny game for the ball is made of rags and the catcher never knows when the pitcher is going to throw the ball.\n\nAlthough we had no news last month our ward is still very much alive. What with music by guitar, gramophone and radio there is never a dull moment!\n\nSister Laura Marie, of Fort Vermilion, visited Elise and Lillian Grandejambe a few days ago.\n\nThere is life alone in duty done,\nAnd rest alone in striving.\nPICTURE SHOW SCHEDULE.\n\nWe take pleasure in providing this means of relaxation for the patients. The films, generally, are received with pleasure and appreciation. We wish to thank the staff for their co-operation. We hope that the patients will work with us, too, so that it will not be necessary to cancel scheduled shows for misbehaviour.\n\nL.

We drove around the city and saw street cars, bicycles, trucks and cars. We went over the High Level bridge.\n\nFred Bruno went home two weeks ago. We hope he has a good time.\n\nErnie can read quite well now and is getting a new Reader next week. Wallace and Gilbert are also ready for new Readers.\n\nWe like to watch the cars and trucks go by along the highway.\n\nSister Laura Marie, of Fort Vermilion, visited Simon Kolay and Jimmy Inlaye a few days ago.\n\nWARD IX A.\n\nTHE LITTLE ELF.\n\nI met a little Elf-man, once,\nDown where the lilies blow,\nI asked him why he was so small\nAnd why he didn't grow.\n\nHe slightly frowned, and with his eye\nHe looked me through and through.\n\"I'm quite as big for me,\" said he,\n\"As you are big for you.\"\n\n- John Kendrick Bangs.\n\nWe are pleased to see Roy Hunter feeling so much better.\n\nTwo little boys, who moved here from Ward VIII C, had been praised by the nurses for always eating everything on their trays. Imagine the surprise of the nurses when they found in the cupboard, one day, a box filled with meat, potatoes, bread and pudding.\n\nWARD IX B.\n\nPat Mandeville bought himself a guitar recently and is really enjoying himself these days.\n\nFred Willier is learning to play the violin and is doing very well.\n\nFrancis Poitras must use a great deal of ink for his fountain pen is always on the go.\n\n(Cont'd)\nBilly Mosquito is a new patient in our ward. He says he doesn't mind being in the hospital for Tuberculosis keeps him company.\n\nSimon, Louis and Ben spend most of their time reading.\n\nJohn Pascal and Alphonse spend their evenings playing music.\n\nLast Saturday we were pleased to see Dolphus Chibley who came to visit us.\n\nWe are all doing well and are happy. We hope the other patients are the same.\n\nWARD IX C.\n\nGreetings everyone! I appreciate and enjoy my treatment in this hospital. Time passes very quickly so I am never lonesome. I think of the future with pleasure and satisfaction. In July I had an operation on my toe. For a while I thought I had lost it but that afternoon when I counted I found I still had five toes.\n\n- Sam Williams.\n\nOne day Jim Johnson surprised James Eagle in the wash-room. Suddenly James, with fire in his eye, wheeled about and started to remove his shirt. He grabbed Jim and pushed him against the wall. Jim, tremblingly, talked kindly to him and tried to bring about a reconciliation. Suddenly James' face broke into smiles and all was forgotten.\n\nHarry Bull Lightning is still the cabbage champion. He skunks the rest of us most of the time.\n\nGlad to report that Harry and James are getting over their colds and are able to sit up and take nourishment.\n\nHOMEWORK!\nA TALL TALE (WARD X A)\n\nWe, in this ward, are very interested in all wild animals. One day, in discussing them, we all agreed that the smartest animal was the beaver until we heard Harry Nedlin's story about the wolverine that stole the snowshoes and the pack sack.\n\nThe wolverine is a small animal something like a wolf or coyote. One day, a hunter left his snow shoes and pack sack to follow a moose across a lake. After killing the moose he returned for his gear only to find it had disappeared. He could see the snowshoe tracks in the snow, and wondered who could be the thief. He was hurriedly following the tracks when he heard, \"Hello!\" Looking up, there he saw an animal with the snowshoes on his feet and the pack sack on his back waving to him. It was a wolverine. Did you ever see a beaver do anything as smart as that?\n\nWe know the price of hair cuts has gone up, but Tommy Goose is the first person to take matters in his own hands and cut his own hair. Before you try it, you had better see Tom, for, confidentially he told us that it was not such a bright idea.\n\nOn August 20, John Martell was admitted to our ward, but soon after was moved into a private. Hope you come back soon, John.\n\nOn August 23, Fred Lafferty, from Yellowknife, joined us and shortly after Harry Nedlin was admitted. Welcome to you both.\n\nWard X B.\n\nErnest Horseman was moved to Ward IV to be prepared for his operation. We were pleased to hear that he had it on September 3, and that he is doing well. We miss Ernie very much for he is quite an entertainer with his violin.\n\nA dance will be held in X B on Friday at 8:30 P.M. Since Professor Horseman is not with us, Mary Jane and her orchestra will provide the music. Lunch will be served. Everybody is welcome.\n\nOn August 19, Eddie Lafleur and John Giroux were admitted as patients. They are very nice boys and we welcome them.\n\nJohn Lepine had a sick spell and was moved into the private ward formerly occupied by Dolphus Akinash, who has come back with us. We hope Lepine will feel better soon and be with us again.\n\n(Cont'd)\nLeo seems to be very lucky these days as far as visitors are concerned. His uncle, whom he had not seen for two years, surprised him the other day, also the district nurse from Canyon Creek.\n\nWhen the Radar section is looking for new recruits we will have to recommend Leo and Robert. They have worked out a system of code of numbers by means of which they send secret messages to one another. It seems now that the code is not so secret for Jack Royal has been able to decipher it.\n\nTwo Years in the Hospital.\n\nSaturday, September 6 is the second anniversary of my being hospitalized. I spent the first four and a half months in the General Hospital, after which time I was transferred here. I wish to thank the doctors in this hospital for their efforts on my behalf. I have tried my best to cooperate and keep to my routine. I feel much stronger, have gained weight and have a better complexion, but I hope that I will not have to stay another two years.\n\n- Leo Sowan.\n\nWARD X C.\n\nAndy Shade went home on the first of September. Good luck, Andy! There are just four of us left in this ward. Aloysius was moved to a private ward. It pays to be good, Aloysius, for now Dan, being all alone, feels he is being punished too. The three boys in our ward, Louizon, Modeste and Danny Norris are in one end near the windows. They can see the highway and have fun watching the traffic. They also listen to their favorite programs on Danny's radio. Sometimes they play checkers.\n\n--------\n\nTeacher: \"Al, what is the plural of man?\"\nAl: \"Men.\"\n\nTeacher: \"What is the plural of child?\"\nAl: \"Twins.\"\n\n--------\n\nPupil: \"Can I be blamed for something I didn't do?\"\nTeacher: \"No, what is it?\"\nPupil: \"My homework.\"\nNO FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE TO BE PLACED ON THIS FILE\nSEE CURRENT VOLUME\n150-62 VOL. 2 CLOSED\n\nAPR 46\n\n15 SEP 47\n\nPUBLICATIONS OF RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS\n\nCLOSED APR 48\n\nSEE VOL. 3\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6034)\n\nFile 150-62, part 1\nHeadquarters - Publications of Residential Schools - Yearbooks - Magazines - etc.\n1937-1946\n\nFile 150-62, part 2\nHeadquarters - Publications of Residential Schools - Yearbooks - Magazines - etc.\n1946-1947\n\nFile 150-62, part 3\nHeadquarters - Publications of Residential Schools - Yearbooks - Magazines - etc.\n1947-1949\nWith\nBest\nWishes\nfor a happy, holy\nand prosperous year\nto all our readers.\n\nOur Mission School\nA Special Holiday.\n\nOn November 20th we had a holiday in honor of the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten. We had a special show in the afternoon and at 5 o'clock we listened to the rebroadcast of the wedding on the radio. Each province of Canada sent a gift to the Princess. Albert Twin, Gr. 5.\n\nA Distinguished Visitor.\n\nWhat a glad surprise for the children of the Yukon when His Excellency Bishop Cou\u00ebt came to visit us on November 23rd! We went to see him in his room. He gave us some candy and some beads. We were very happy to hear about our dear ones so far away. Bishop promised that when he went back to the Yukon he would see our parents and tell them all about us. Isaac Johnston, Gr. 4.\n\nOn December 8th eight sisters and some fathers from the various missions of the vicariate left in two trucks for the distant mission of Wabasca to help celebrate the Golden Jubilee of that mission. On their way back the truck broke down and the sisters had to come back by plane.\n\nAt Slave Lake they took the train to come back here. Mother Provincial came with them and spent three days with us. We were glad to see her. We were also glad to have the sisters back.\n\nLouise Whitehead and Walter Twin, Gr. 5.\n\nFeast of the Immaculate Conception.\n\nOn December 8th we celebrated the beautiful feast of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The church was decorated with vigil lights and flowers. We sang the high Mass in honor of the Blessed Virgin. It was a good time to ask for the favors we want. She will grant them if they are good for us, for she is the Mother of God and He cannot refuse her anything.\n\nFrieda Shott, Grade 6.\nA New Skating Rink for All.\n\nOn December 7th Father joyed it as we tried to do our best. I was Campagna came to replace in the star drill and rhythm band. We all Father Sauv\u00e9. On the 9th dressed nicely but had different costumes he had us help him make for the plays we had to do for the visitors. a skating rink. It took lots of time and hard work but we made it anyway. I think it is a good thing to have a skating rink. We have lots of fun. It is much better than going down to the lake to skate. We thank Father for his kindness in giving us this means of entertainment.\n\nFrancis Johnston. Gr.5.\n\nChristmas Concert.\n\nOn December 19th we had the last day of school before Christmas. So our concert took place on that evening at 7:30. There were quite a few plays and songs. It opened with a welcome song. Then came the plays and other songs. Some of the plays were \"The Three Kittens\", \"Sam's Toothache\", \"Old Mr. Particular\", \"The Truth Telling Machine\"; other novelties were the Crouard Stampede, Santa Claus Is Coming To Town, some acrobatics and rhythm band selections. Last of all was the Tableau of the Christmas Story which was very nice.\n\nMany people came for the concert. Some sisters came from High Prairie and Joussard. We all hope that everyone who came enjoyed it very much.\n\nBertha Twin. Gr.8.\n\nWe had our concert on Dec. 19th. Many people came. Even the Sisters of Joussard and High Prairie came. We hope they all enjoyed it as we tried to do our best. I was Campagna came to replace in the star drill and rhythm band. We all Father Sauv\u00e9. On the 9th dressed nicely but had different costumes he had us help him make for the plays we had to do for the visitors. a skating rink. It took lots of time and hard work but we made it anyway.

Gr.5.\n\nChristmas Holidays at Home.\n\nBoy, the children were excited on the morning of the 20th., for some of them were able to go home for their holidays. The Whitefish Lake children were the first to go, by truck. Father Tessier, Brother Ross\u00e9 and I met each other. Some of us slept on the way. Father Tessier told us two long stories to pass the time. We got there at four o'clock in the afternoon. We thank Father Tessier for letting us go home.\n\nRussel Grey. Gr.5.\n\nWhen we went for our holidays we saw our parents. They were glad to see us. On Christmas we went to Midnight Mass. We sang hymns to Baby Jesus.\n\nSylvia Grey. Gr.3\n\nWe were glad to go home for our holidays. Father Floch gave us our Christmas presents. This was a glad surprise that Sr. Superior thought of for us. Thank you, Sr. Superior. We were happy and so were our parents.\n\nAlice Thunder. Gr.4.\nOur Christmas Tree.\n\nHow happy we were on Christmas Day when the time came for our Christmas Tree. It was at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. How pleased we were to receive such lovely gifts! There were two nice accordions, two guitars, a banjo and a radio, wrist watches for boys and girls, pen and pencil sets, sleds and toboggans, and even a tricycle for the smaller girls. We were indeed all very pleased. All this came from the kindness of good Mr. Hill. We thank him ever so much for these lovely gifts which we all like and enjoy using. May God send his blessing upon him always and keep him in his care.\n\nI was also pleased to receive lovely gifts from my father and thank him ever so much for them. We are all sure that everyone spent a merry, merry Christmas.\n\nMae Wong. Gr.7.\n\nMidnight Mass.\n\nOh, how anxious everyone was for Midnight Mass! We went to bed earlier than usual that night so that we wouldn't be so sleepy. We were suddenly awakened by beautiful singing that sounded like angels. We dressed up in a hurry so as to be on time for Midnight Mass. The singing was very nice and many people came for Mass. As for me I think that Midnight Mass is the best part of Christmas. Don't you think so?\n\nLena Shott. Gr.8.\n\nAll the boys and girls went to Midnight Mass. I put some candy in the crib for Baby Jesus. My Mother came to Mass.\n\nFreddy Stevenson. Gr.11.\n\nOn Christmas we went to Midnight Mass. We sang Silent Night, Glory to God, and some hymns in Cree. On Christmas Day we went to the boys' hall to get our presents.\n\nMary Eskagon. Gr.111.\n\nI had lots of presents on Christmas Eve. After Midnight Mass I grabbed my presents. Jean and Mae Wong came for a visit. We had lots of fun.\n\nRuby Beauchamp. Gr.111.\n\nGift Exchange.\n\nWe had a Christmas tree in our classroom. Baby Jesus also had His place near the tree. All the children in our class wanted to have a gift exchange so it came off on the 19th of December. I had a nice barrett and some cookies. I was very glad because it was nearly dinner time, and so I had a lunch as well as a gift. We all enjoyed our gifts even though they were very small.\n\nLucienne Bellarose.\nChristmas Mail in Grouard\n\nHow happy we were to see the mail coming in because we knew that our presents were here. We helped to unload the boxes. There were many bags on the sleigh. All over there were many boxes marked from the U.S.A. Thanks a million to all our generous friends over there who helped to make our Christmas such a pleasant one.\n\nGeorge Gray. Gr.4.\n\nNews Items.\n\nOne night Sister Superior was sick. They had to take her to the hospital. She was there for five days. Sister Theresa replaced her when she was gone. Sister Superior came back Wednesday evening before New Years'. How glad we were to see her back again! Please keep well, Sister Superior!\n\nFrieda Shott. Gr.6.\n\nTwo children left for the hospital in Edmonton, during the holidays. They were Florence Johnston and Perry Frank. We were sorry to see them go but we know it is for the best. We hope that they will soon return to us in good health.\n\nLena Shott.\n\nWe were very sorry to see Sister Gabrielle leave us for Madrasore. We hope she will like her new office in Calgary and thank her for all she did for us here. She is replaced here by Sister Paul Bruno. Welcome to Grouard, Sister. We hope you will like it here.\n\nLOUISA WHITEHEAD. Gr.5.\n\nI got back to the mission at 7 O'clock in the morning while the boys were all at Mass. I went to the hall but did not turn on the lights, so the boys wouldn't know that I was here. When they came in and saw me they were surprised and glad.\n\nKenneth Letourneau. Gr.6.\nHolidays in Grouard\n\nThere were only 36 boys left when those who had the privilege of going home had gone. But we, the children of Grouard, had another privilege. We had Father Sauv\u00e9 here to give us fun of all kinds, such as skating, bingo games, and socials; he even ate with us at our table for dinner and supper, several times. He sometimes spent the whole day with us in the hall, and in the evening he would tell us stories about his missionary days in Wabasso. On other days we would all go down the hill to ski, or play hockey on the rink.\n\nLeo Cardinal, Gr.7.\n\nI think the Christmas holidays were enjoyed by the children of Grouard. Father Sauv\u00e9 came to spend his holidays with us. He amused us with all kinds of games which the children enjoyed heartily. Those who didn't go outside played in the house with games they had received for their Christmas gifts.\n\nSpecial thanks go to Father Sauv\u00e9 who devotedly helped to make the Christmas holidays a happy time for all the children.\n\nLena Shott, Gr.8.\n\nI liked my holidays very much. We played bingo in the boys' hall. We went down to slide on the big hill every day, and also skated. I had a sled for my Christmas present.\n\nDonald George, Gr.2.\n\nI had lots of fun with a tricycle inside of the house at home.\n\nPeter Cardinal.\n\nWe had lots of fun for Christmas. In the afternoon we went to the boys' hall to get our presents. Sister Superior and Father Tessier called out the presents which we all liked very much. Most of us then went to skate. The next day Father Sauv\u00e9 came from Joussard to spend his holidays with us. He surely made every day a happy one. We had oodles of fun, bags of candy, loads of laughter. Who would not envy us! What wonderful holidays we had! A thousand thanks, Father, we would be the happiest boys and girls to have you for the next holiday.\n\nJoyceline Gray, Gr.4.\n\nWe had a joyful Christmas. A big thank you to all who made it such a happy time for us!\n\nBella Nanotch, Gr.4.\n\nSister: What is a beet?\n\nLouise: A red turnip.\nFIRE!! FIRE!!\n\nFire broke out on Wednesday morning, December 31st at 9:30. While we were cleaning the skating rink and some others were cleaning the church steps, George Grey and Peter Andrews spotted a fire in front of the power house. Fathers and Brothers ran to help while the boys ran for fire extinguishers. Girls and boys carried pails of water, and we all finally succeeded in getting the fire out. It was not an ordinary house that burnt; it was our electric plant.\n\nFor a week we had to use candles and lamps to light the mission. A big thank you goes to Sturgeon Lake Mission which so kindly sent us many gas and oil lamps to help brighten our homes. At present we have electricity for a few hours in the morning and a few hours at night. We surely appreciate it now.\n\nLawrence Layle, Edward Dion, and Cecil Grey.\n\nNew Year Party.\n\nDue to the accident above mentioned, our New Year Party turned out to be quite a novelty. Candles proved both practical and decorative in their effect. Placed behind red paper in all the windows and on the pillars, they gave a very attractive and inviting appearance to the room as the children trooped in. Even all the games arranged for the evening were candle games, skill games in either lighting or extinguishing candles. As on other occasions, the group winning the highest number of points received prizes. I think that \"Candle Night\" will be remembered a long time in Grouard, and we might be tempted to call for another next year, even though we have no intention of tampering with the electric plant to fulfill our desire.\n\nReturn of Vacationists.\n\nBefore we went home we were told to come back on the 4th. We came by bus, and Brother was there to meet us. We enjoyed our holidays very much and hope that we will be able to go again next year.\n\nWalter P. Twin, Gr.5.\nTraining School\n\nRoll Call at the Home Centre\n\nElsie Andrews of Grouard.\nLouise Swain \" Edmonton.\nElizabeth Loyie \" Slave Lake.\nHelen Big Charles \" High Prairie.\nAlice Bellerose \" Grouard.\nFlorence McDonald \" Edmonton.\nHazel Thunder \" Whitefish.\nAlbina Kidney \" Fort Vermillion.\nAlbina Adekat \" Fort Vermillion.\nTherese Nanotah \" Wabasees.\n\nDirectress: Sister Norbert. Assistant: Sister Ann Theresa.\n\nComing to The Training School.\n\nOn January 8th Albina Kidney and I came to Grouard for the Training School. From Fort Vermillion we came by plane to Peace River. Then we came up to Emilda by train where Brother Paquet met us with the car from Grouard. We surely enjoyed our trip, especially the plane ride, since it was our first.\n\nWe hope to do our best here at the Training School. We will be learning how to cook and sew, to do house work and many other things, which we didn't know before we came here. Grouard is a good place too. Sister Norbert and Sister Ann Theresa are keeping us. They are good to us. So we will do our very best in everything we do at the Home Centre.\n\nAlbina Adekat.\n\nThis is my first year at the Training School. I learned how to sew on the machine, and made a boy's coat and a girl's dress. This year my Christmas present was a nice big bicycle from Mr. Hill. I am so glad he sent it to me. He also sent a nice wrist watch to one of the girls. During the Christmas holidays we went skating and sliding.\n\nAlice Bellerose.\n\nI was glad to come to the Training School. I came with my little brother and sister on the 11th of January. Mr. Landry came to get us on Sunday afternoon at our place. I think I am going to enjoy myself here doing this work. We are ten girls here now. I like it here because the girls are good to me.\n\nTherese Nanotah.\nAnother Change In Ground.\n\nOn January 17th the news came to us that Brother Paquet was leaving that night for Wabasso. We were all very sorry to see him go because he has always been so good to us. It was he who trained the altar boys so well; he gave the shows in the hall; he directed the singing; he was chauffeur; he did so much that it cannot be counted. Our heartiest thanks go to this good Brother for all his services and kindness to us. May God bless him and give him success in his new mission. \u2014But please, Brother, don't forget your old friends in Ground who will not forget you ever!\n\nBertha Twin and Lawrence Loyie.\n\nHow pleased we were on Sunday night when Sister told us that we girls were going to have a bingo. Many of us won. There were paper dolls, candies and things that we all liked. We surely had a good time. Many thanks, Sister Clare Eva, for making us so happy!\n\nMae Wong.\n\nWelcome, Father!\n\nIt is a pleasure for me to welcome to our midst Father Serrand, who so generously spends a part of his time in teaching catechism in the first and second classes. We hope that you enjoy teaching us as we enjoy having you. Thank you, Father, and be assured of our deep appreciation.\n\nLena Shott.\n\nA Special \"Thank You!\"\n\nMy grateful thanks go to Miss Lemieux who had the kindness and patience to teach me to print the journal. I hope that I make as good a pupil as she makes a teacher.\n\nLena Shott.\n\nwhile the class was studying about the Congo in Africa, the thermometer in the classroom registered 80 degrees. Sister said: \"It is very hot in Africa\". Gracie: \"This is Africa right here\".\nVOICE OF THE SILVERY LAKE\nVISITORS\n\nOne day a nurse came too, and we all had to be X-rayed. It took two days for we are many boys and girls and each went in their turn. Then they will know if our lungs are strong. They came all the way from Edmonton, but it was our own nurse who was with them. Miss Burgess is her name and we like her, she is kind to us when we are sick.\n\nVICTORIA BELCOURT.\n\nOnce I played the organ for Sunday Mass at Driftpole. I was a little shy the first time and nervous. Next time I will try to play better because I like music so much. Sister Rita allows me to practise on the organ. I am going to learn to play real well as there are not many girls who can play in the Church.\n\nJEAN LABOUCAN.\n\nOFF TO WABASCA.\n\nOne morning very early before we were awake, two big trucks covered like a little house, and a car, started away up the Highway to go to Wabasca. The Bishops and Mr. Landry were there, many Oblate Fathers and Brothers. Mother Catherine of Bologne and seven Sisters. One Sister who stays here. This was Sister Michael of Jesus who is at the dairy went with them. It was the Golden Jubilee of St. Martin's Mission. 50 years since the Fathers opened the Mission. Our teacher was there once and told us about it. I would like to see it, but it is very hard to travel there.\n\nNELLIE JANE COLLINS.\n\nWhen Father Serrand was here, we asked him to come in our classroom and tell us all about his trip to Wabasca. He did come and we enjoyed his talk. It was so interesting. It made us wish to see Wabasca. So we hope Father Habay will send us in the big truck some day.\n\nELSIE CHALIFOUX.\n\nVISITORS\n\nMany Fathers and Sisters came here one night. They all slept here too. The next day when it was still dark they got in the trucks. They were going to Wabasca. Father Sauve went too. He was so glad, the girls made some drawings of the trucks it was good.\n\nHENRY BADGER. Gr. II\n\nGOOD NEWS\n\nAll the children were glad when Father told us the good news. \"For the first time we can go home for our Christmas holidays.\" I sure was happy. I went home by bus to Kinuso. We had lots of fun.\n\nKATHLEEN DAVIES.\n\nBIG THANK YOU.\n\nAll thanks to good Fr. Giroux who is charge of the chickens. We often have eggs for our meals, and we want him to know how good they taste. Three cheers for Father Giroux, and we are ready to help you with the hens any time you need a boy.\n\nRENE WILLIER.\nTRAPPING\n\nDuring the Christmas holidays I went trapping. I caught two weasels and five squirrels. I skinned them and sold the fur to trap. It is fun to shoot squirrels in the trees. My father taught me how to set the traps. I will draw a picture to show how it is done. Some day I hope to be a trapper.\n\nFRANK CALLEO.\n\nTRAINING.\n\nThis school year we have training several times in the week. Father Sauve takes the boys and Sister Guy the girls. This helps us to be strong and to stand straight too, but it is fun and we shall be able to make some fine drills.\n\nDOROTHY BELLEROSE.\n\nWORK SHOP\n\nVery soon we boys will go to the work shop with Father Sauve. There we shall learn how to make tables, benches, and perhaps other things. We are to go on Mondays. I sure am glad I will feel like a real Carpenter like St. Joseph\u2014What do you think of that.\n\nJIMMY ISIDORE.\n\nA BIG SURPRISE.\n\nIt was a big surprise for me when I heard that Sister Paul-Bruno was in Grouard. All the people were so glad too. Sister Paul-Bruno is my cousin. I am so glad she came to stay close to us. We wish to see her soon.\n\nDORIS BELLEROSE Gr.11\n\nFUN CHANGED INTO SORROW.\n\nI was having fun sliding down the hill, with boy friends, when Mrs. Callion from Canyon Creek gave me sad news. She said that my Grandfather had just died at the Hospital in High Prairie. He had been there three weeks. He was 72 years old. I have been staying with my Grandfather since I was 2 years old. He took good care of me and I loved him very much. I felt very sad.\n\nOn January 4th, they brought the body to the new Church in Kinuso. The next day was the funeral.\n\nFather Sauve, Sister Superior Sr. Michael of Jesus and Sister Alicia came from Jousseard. There were many people in the church for the funeral service.\n\nIt was a very sad day for everybody. I shall never forget my dear Grandfather. I will pray for him.\n\nBILL GIROUX.\nOn the last Sunday before Christmas we played games in the big hall like last month. I think we enjoyed it better than ever. All the girls and boys like this. It is kind of the Fathers to spend this evening with us, the Sisters too. Some of the games are clever, we have to be quick to learn to play them, but in time we shall do them even better. We won a prize. We thank good Father Sauve who does this for us, he takes much trouble to get it all ready. We thank the Sisters for coming and hope they enjoyed it as much as we girls and boys. So here is good success to all the games of 1945.\n\nYVETTE BADGER.\n\nCHRISTMAS\n\nWe had such a nice Christmas and this year we were allowed to go to our home. The Midnight Mass was splendid, we had practised the singing and the girls and boys sang ever so well. Father Sauve directs our choir and the singing was in parts. After the Midnight Mass we had nice hot cocoa and doughnuts. Some went home after that with their parents, but most of us waited till the High Mass next day. It was a grand vacation and we are grateful to those who let us go to be with our parents for the New Year too.\n\nEDWARD WILLIER.\n\nWe all went home for Christmas. I rode on a sleigh. When we got home my little brothers were sleeping, we wake them and all hung our stockings. The next morning they were not filled. But when we came back to school we had many nice toys and candies.\n\nANGELINE OKIMAW.\n\nA BIG THANK YOU TO ALL\n\nGrateful thanks to those good Benefactors who sent us so many nice things at Christmas. We enjoyed them all, and we won't forget to pray for them. So Happy New Year kind friends who were so generous to St. Bruno.\n\nROBERT WARD.\nHIP-hip HURRAH!\n\nEverybody is here, not one missing. We were supposed to be back at the Mission for supper on Jan. 8th, and here we are every single one.\n\nThe Fathers said that we were very smart to be back on time. I suppose that we will have permission to go home again for the Christmas holidays next year.\n\nANGELINE ISIDORE.\n\nBACK TO SCHOOL\n\nI had very nice holidays at home but I was glad to go back to school. My brother and sister like to go to school too. I told my father that we wanted to be first ones to return to the Mission.\n\nOn Jan. 8th; after breakfast Dad hitched the horses to the sleigh and off we went. It's a long ride from Driftpile to Joussard.\u2014 When we arrived at the Mission, I jumped out of the sleigh and ran into the house to see if we were really the first ones here. Yes, no one else had yet returned. But it was not long before sleighs full of children began to arrive. By supper time everybody was back at the Mission.\n\nThe boys tell me that I will not be first next time. We'll wait and see.\n\nCHARLIE NO HAT.\nMORE CHRISTMAS GIFTS\n\nThe evening we arrived at the Mission we had lovely Christmas gifts and plenty of fun.\n\nNice gifts had been prepared by our good friends at the school.\n\nWhen we went into the hall, I was so glad and excited that I could hardly wait to find out what my gifts would be. We sang a Christmas song. Then Father Sauve gave us a short talk. He said that he was greatly pleased to see everyone present.\n\nFather Sabay, assisted by other Fathers, then distributed the gifts. It was like a second Xmas. There were all kinds of toys, puzzles, for work, candies, nuts, oranges and apples.\n\nI was glad indeed to be back on time and so were all the boys and girls.\n\nWe all want to say a big thank you to the good Fathers and Sisters for the joyous welcome they gave us on our return to school.\n\nJULIENNE AVENOSE.\n\nMY PRESENTS\n\nFor my present, I got an embroidery set. I had a skipping rope some Jacks and ball too, some candies and peanuts. Thank you very much Father Sauve and Sister Superior and all our kind friends.\n\nEDNA GIROUX Gr.11\n\nTHE BEST CHRISTMAS\n\nI won't forget this Christmas No, never. We had holidays at home for the first time. My parents gave me candies and Christmas presents. They bought me new clothes. I went hunting, rode horses, and had sleigh rides.\n\nWhen I returned to School I had an evening of fun with more Christmas gifts, candies and other good things to eat.\n\nI think it was the best Xmas I have ever had. I hope we will have holidays at home again next year.\n\nROGER WILLIER.\n\nGOING TO SCHOOL AGAIN.\n\nI was glad to go back to school after Christmas. I came early only a few girls beat me to school. I was happy Father told us to be on time and come back on the eight of January.\n\nALVINA WALKER\nMARY NO HAT. Gr.1\n\nA CHANGE\n\nWhen I came back after Xmas, there was a new Sister at the boys, and Sister Jean-Calixte had come back. The new Sister's name is Sister Paul of Charity. We bid her Welcome.\n\nI did not say goodbye to Sister Synclotique because she went away during the holidays. Thank you Sister for what you did for us. We shall not forget you.\n\nRENE WILLIER.\nVISITOR\n\nSister Superior had a nice visit from her cousin Sister Aloide-Marie who came to see her before going to Fort Vermillion. Our Superior was glad to see her cousin. Sister Aloide-Marie travelled to Fort Vermillion in a plane from Peace River. We hope she had a good trip and arrived safe. It only takes about an hour to travel that way.\n\nNOELLA WALKER.\n\nHEARD DURING THE XMAS VACATION.\n\nIt appears that during vacation, Frank Awenose asked his father every day if it was not time to go back to school.\n\nEvidently he is a boy that is anxious to learn.\n\nDANNY CALLEO.\n\nNEWS\n\nI received a nice card from my friend Fred Wm. Willier who is sick at Camseil Hospital. I was glad. Sr. Superior sent Fred Wm. a nice box of candy, handkerchief, comb etc. I hope Fred Wm. will write again.\n\nROBERT WARD.\n\nMESSAGE\n\nHello Sister Paul-Bruno. I love you.\n\nPAULINE AWENOSE Gr.1\n\nTOYS\n\nFather Sauve gave us some toys. Sister Superior too. I had a train and a top, some candy too. I am glad. I like to play with my toys.\n\nGEORGE FR.GIROUX. GR.1\n\nGIFTS.\n\nFather Sauve received many nice gifts from Miss Paula Gougeon for us. We all wrote to Miss Gougeon to thank her. I hope she will come and see us some day.\n\nHELEN LABOUCAN.\n\nWALK.\n\nYesterday we went for a nice walk with Sister Pauline Madeleine and Sister Rita. We had lots of fun. We also went to the store.\n\nFLORA OKIMAW.\n\nMY PRESENTS.\n\nWhen I came home on Christmas there was a nice Xmas tree at home. I ran to see what there was for me. Guess... A nice guitar. I was so happy.\n\nMARCEL LABOUCAN. Gr.11\n\nWHAT DID AT HOME DURING VACATION.\n\nWhen I was at home, I gave my mother a rest. I told her that I would work and she will rest. I did the washing, cooking and mended some clothes. I like many things, but what I like best in the world is my dear MOTHER.\n\nVICTORIA BELCOURT.\n\nMy name is Gerty. I like school. I like Father Habay and Sr. Superior.\n\nGERTE CHALIFOUX. Gr.1\n\nWISHES.\n\nI wanted to be the very last one to wish you all a \"HAPPY NEW YEAR\". May 1948 be a year of health, joy and happiness to all. I hope God will give you many blessings, and give you good success in your work.\n\nDOROTHY BELLEROSE.\nWe had fun on the night of Nov. 1st. We could not have it on Hallowe'en night because it was like Saturday night. We played games, jokes and tricks. We had a peanut race, some little boys went first, then some little girls. We picked peanuts with one hand with spoons and put them in little bowls. When we were finished we ate the peanuts. A boy and girl played seeing the moon through a sleeve. The boy lay on the floor and the girl asked him if he saw the moon. The boy said \"Yes\". Then the girls threw some water in the sleeve. The boy yelled. We had a biscuit race too. Some biscuits were tied to strings, as we tried to bite them they would swing. After a while we caught them with our mouths. We had a very nice evening and I hope we will have some more games like that again.\n\nLouise Ann Kiyawasew - IV.\n\nI was in the Chinese prayer, and the dishpan race. There were lots of tricks. My sister was to make the ceiling bleed. She got up on a step-ladder. Then she dropped the knife on purpose and told a boy to pick it up. When he did, she poured some water on him. We had lots of fun!\n\nLloyd Cunningham - IV.\n\nOn the 20th of Nov., we had a holiday. It was a nice day to take it for it was Princess Elizabeth's wedding day. It was the feast of St. Elizabeth the day before. We went in the boys' hall for our dinner. The girls made some sandwiches and they put them in a bag. Each one had a bag and a bottle of soft drink.\n\nThere was a nice big piece of cake also. I was very glad on that day. After we had taken our dinner, we had a programme. We sang songs and recited some pieces. Some of the smaller boys and girls recited some very nice ones. I like \"Many Lands are Fine\". Some little boys said a very nice piece about what they would like to be a hundred years ago. Reno and Nora sang \"When I was a Cowboy\". Then at the end, one big girl came in with a long dress. She was taking the part of St. Elizabeth. She brought a box of apples, and gave us each one. All the boys and girls were very glad. We liked it all very much. After that we played outside until suppertime.\n\nI hope Princess Elizabeth will live for A LONG LONG TIME!\n\nCecilo Manitos - IV.\nOne day Father Roue came to the boys' hall and told us that some day he was going to make a slide for the boys. We were all excited when we heard that. And we asked him whom. Not long after, he came to take four boys to go to work with him. They bought many things. It took them two days, and at last it was finished. We put some snow and some water on it that evening. But when we came to play the next morning, the snow was not frozen. The weather was not cold enough. We waited another day and the snow was melting all over. But now there is lots of snow and we hope it will stay.\n\nMarcel Kiyawasew - V.\n\nThank you, very much Father, for making such a nice slide for us.\n\nAll the Boys.\n\nThe new root cellar roof is made of dirt. It is right at the back of our yard. We have a nice yard now because the old chicken house and yard is gone. We use the roof for a slide and it makes a very good one. We are very glad to have it, and sometimes we go sliding on the boys' slide when they are not there. It is nice to play out in the snow.\n\nMary Moses - V.\n\nREVEREND FATHER ROUE'S\n-----FEAST--DAY------\n\nHis feast came on a Saturday, so on Friday evening everybody went to the hall to wish him a Happy Feast. We sang two songs for him and George Goodswinner gave the address. He thanked Father for all he was doing for us, and for the nice slides. He told Father that we were going to keep on being good.\n\nWe had very much fun that day. We went sliding down the hill too. We all came back for supper. After supper we played Bingo. Everybody was there. Denise Sunshine was the first one to say \"Bingo\". After we had played for a while, they passed some apples to us. Then Father began to throw apples to us and we caught them. Father also threw some pennies and nickels and everybody scrambled for them. We had a fine time. Again Happy Feast Father.\n\nGenevieve Mitchell - IV.\nPREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS\n\nI am preparing my heart for Christmas. I will ask Jesus to help me to be good. And I am going to say a prayer every day to keep my heart nice and good for Christmas. I am going to do little acts just to please Jesus on Christmas Day when He comes into my heart.\n\nMary Desjarlais - IV.\n\nIn the beginning of December, each teacher gave her pupils some cards to colour or paint. On one card was a snow man on a hill, and the other had two little brownies on it. They were holding candles. When we finished the colouring we had to write a letter inside to our parents or to those who take care of us. Two boys painted a nice picture, one for Rev. Fr. Roux, and the other one is for Sr. Superior. Then all the pupils in the classes had to write their names on pieces of paper. They will give them on Christmas. We wish them a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.\n\nViolette Savard - V.\n\nThe classrooms were decorated too. In the Baby Class, Sister put some stencils on the board and her pupils coloured them. They did it very nice too. The boards are all full with them. They look nice. She put some things, flowers and cut-outs in her windows too.\n\nIn the second class Sister put bells in the windows and some little red and silver flowers, and that looks nice. On the board they put many drawings. The children coloured them too. I like to see the different rooms decorated for Christmas. In the halls too are very nice decorations. I like to see the Crib and the Christmas tree there too. In the big class we have some Baby Jesus' on the board for a border and some lanterns. The children added them also the bells on the windows. They are hanging on red strips of paper. I am so glad Christmas will soon be here.\n\nHermine Manitos - V.\n\nChristmas is coming! We go to practise on the stage every afternoon. It is in the boys' hall. Everyone is excited because they know that Christmas is coming soon. We are going home for our Christmas holidays this year but we are going to come back on the 5th of Jan. We are going to have our concert on the 22nd of Dec. There are pieces, band selections, songs and little recitations. There are two funny pieces. One is called the \"Rat in the Basket\". The Sleepy Town Express is a song, and it is very nice. We hope they will enjoy our programme.\n\nFlorestine Badger - VI.\n\n\"HURRY, PLEASE!\"\nALL ABOUT OUR CONCERT\n\nWe had our concert on Dec. 22nd. I was in a song. My parents were there. There were many people too. My sister was in a piece. She was a Christmas Candle. I decorated the classroom and Annie Badger helped me. We put trees and a Santa Claus all around the classroom. In the boys' hall it was very nice.\n\nMargaret Hamelin - III.\n\nAll our people came to see the concert. I was in the \"Sleepy-Town Express\". I liked it. We had pillows under our arms. Some of the girls had dolls and lanterns. Some had candles in their hands. There were over fifteen girls in that piece. I was in the band too.\n\nLillian Tchowis - IV.\n\nAll the children went into the first classroom. That is where we stayed in between pieces. We dressed in the second class. The one I liked best was \"The Rat in the Basket\", because it was funny. The rat was only a potato. \"Two in One\" was funny too. The little boy had two legs in one leg of his pants!\n\nThere were fourteen pieces in all. I was in a piece called \"The Little Pink Flower\". I tried my best to do it well, and I think I did.\n\nFlorestine Tchowis - V.\n\nI liked the twins best in our concert because they were the same.\n\nDouglas Harvey - I.\n\nI liked the Candles best because I was in it.\n\nMartha McLean - Prim.\n\nWe were happy as happy can be on that day. At the concert my father, my mother, my little sister and brother were there. The people were glad to see us in the plays. They laughed and had fun on that day. The children were having fun too. They were glad to see their parents. We were glad to go home for Christmas.\n\nMary Stoney - III.\n\nMy mother and father came for the concert. We were happy when the people came. I played \"Dear Santa\" on the stage. We decorated the windows and the blackboards.\n\nAlbert Awasis - II.\n\nTO ALL OUT READERS:\n\nWe wish you a very Merry Christmas and a Happy, a very happy New Year!\n\nFrom all the pupils of Sturgeon Lake....\nANXIOUS FOR CHRISTMAS\n\nWe put up the Christmas decorations in our class. We made some pictures to bring home. They did in the other classes too. We prepared for the Midnight Mass by making little sacrifices. We made little Christmas trees, little balls, little elephant, little ducks, little Jack-in-the-box on the window sills and a big Santa with toys too. We made the windows look nice. Our parents were at the Christmas concert. We were glad to see them.\n\nLucy Martineau - III.\n\nSILENT NIGHT\n\nWe were all glad to go to Midnight Mass because we were anxious to receive Jesus in our hearts. The decoration was so pretty. After the 10:00 o'clock High Mass all the children went home except nine of us. O were we ever glad when the Christmas holidays came! As soon as the others went home, of course, we turned on the radio. In the afternoon, we went to the farm to play games and have a lunch. Every day we would race to dress ourselves. Then we would run down stairs to turn on the radio. We were laughing, shouting or having fun all the time. When it was dark, we would scare each other. I liked to make the others scream! There were big visitors who came too. They came from Jousard, Grouard and High Prairie; the Sisters enjoyed them very much. Mr. and Mrs. Landry, the Indian Agent, and their little baby came too. Another visitor was Rev. Fr. H. Thomas, O.M.I. Some of the Sisters knew him well. He stayed here for a few hours, but he walked around. He knew Violet, because he had seen her in Grouard. We certainly enjoyed the holidays.\n\nGeorgina Cunningham - VI.\n\nA FINE GIFT\n\nElsie and me got a new baby sister for Christmas. We are glad because we have just six brothers.\n\nMarie Moctus - I.\n\nHER CHRISTMAS DAY\n\nWe had a good dinner before we went home. We had a good time at home. When we went home, we said good-bye to the Sisters. Sister gave us some peanuts before we went. I had a happy Christmas day. We cleaned the house every day. I washed dishes when we ate. I came to Mass on Sunday. I am glad to come back to school.\n\nDenise Sunshine - III.\n\nCHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS AT THE MISSION\n\nI stayed at the Mission for the holidays. We had fun. I had a sleigh ride. I helped to wash and wipe the dishes. I had a sleigh for Christmas, some clothes and a red purse too.\n\nBetty Cunningham - II.\nHow glad I was when I went home for eleven days, and I enjoyed it very much. I helped my mother to do the work every day. I was happy to see my father and mother at home. We went to Fish Creek on New Year's. My mother's birthday is on New Year's. My father gave her a birthday present. I would like to go to Fish Creek again for it is nice to go up there.\n\nHermine Manitos - V.\n\nWhen I was at home I caught one squirrel with a snare.\n\nFelix Tchowis - I.\n\nI saw two rabbits in the bush but I did not get any. My father got lots of squirrels.\n\nLouisanne Moses - I.\n\nI tried out my new skis but I am not able to stand up, so I sit down.\n\nPaul Desjarlais - I.\n\nMy grandfather gave me a new sleigh. I use it on the slide. It's sure good.\n\nVictor Mitchell - I.\n\nThe day after we had gone, we went in a taxi to our home where they are cutting pulpwood. The next morning two trucks came to haul the pulpwood. Although only men went to cut down spruce trees, I went to help. Then I sawed wood with Gabriel. Early in the morning, I went to feed the horses. How I enjoyed going home for my Christmas holidays! But I am glad to be back again at school to go on with my schoolwork.\n\nHoward Capot - VI.\n\nThen we came back to the Mission we went to the Crib. Many of us put something by Baby Jesus. We had some candy, apples or some pennies. We will buy these things from Sister, and she will put the money together to buy a pagan baby.\n\nMary Jane Soos - IV.\n\nOn Jan. 6th, it was Kings' Day. We had lots of fun that day. At dinner, Lucy Martineau got the bean. She was Queen and Lloyd Cunningham was the King. We liked the cake very much because it was good. On top of the cake were some white things. After supper, Sister dressed Elizabeth Cunningham as the flower girl. Then we went to the boys' hall and played Bingo. We like to play that. We had a very good time and we went to bed happy.\n\nSaverna Standing Ribbon - IV.\n\nSAD NEWS\n\nWhen we came back to school, Sister told us about the fire that burned down the electric plant at Grouard. We felt very sorry for all the people there.\n\nYour friends of Sturgeon Lake.\nBEAN PARTY.\n\nOn November 1st we had a bean party at Hutchison's Hall. All boys under school age were invited. We were 84 boys altogether. We were to bring a stick just as high as ourself for the bonfires, our own cup, plate and spoon. When we arrived at the meeting place there were men who acted as judges. They were to see that the stick was as high as the boy. Some of the boys had to take off their caps to make sure. After the judging was over we piled our sticks up together, and circled around the biggest bonfire. We had eight bonfires outside. But there was one big special one at which Mr. Foster, the policeman, told us what to do. We were to run a race and when we came back we were to run to one of the seven bonfires, and remain there until there was a group of twelve boys at each. Then the judges came to each of the groups. They gave us instructions how to play games. The winners received points for their patrol. We played until it was time for supper. The ladies served us as we passed by the counter with our plate. My, how delicious the beans were! We also had buns, doughnuts and cocoa. When supper was finished we played more games. At nine o'clock all was at an end. We then sang God Save The King. Before leaving we were treated with peanuts and apples. We thank Mr. Foster and all those who helped to make this evening an enjoyable one.\n\nJos. Courtoiselle, Grade 8.\nVISITORS\n\nOn November 10th Mr. Gooderham, Inspector of all Indian Agencies in Alberta and N.W.T., and Mr. Patterson came to visit our Mission. They visited the mission buildings. They also came to our classrooms to see how well we worked. We sang a song for them and then Mr. Patterson gave the grade 3 pupils some Arithmetic and Spelling on the blackboard. I had a good laugh at them. Didn't know that Mr. Patterson would come on us next. He gave us a problem on selling furs. I got all my numbers mixed up. Next time I won't laugh at the others. It isn't so easy to work in front of visitors. Then Mr. Gooderham spoke to us. He told us that we did wonderful exhibition work and he encouraged us to keep on. Before leaving he said it was a holiday. He said we are not to take it until we have no more pop left in us. Sister said that if we wait for that day we will never see our holiday. Mr. Gooderham and Mr. Patterson left by plane on the 13th. Mr. Gooderham told us to watch for Mr. Patterson next spring. He will be coming in his 2\u00bd ton car. We are sure going to watch for him. We still wonder if he will ever get here safely.\n\nHelen Attillon, Grade 7\n\nAN ANGEL\n\nA baby girl was born to Mr. and Mrs. M. Fournier from Eleckie Reserve on November 15th in St-Therese Hospital. There was much rejoicing at home when the mother arrived home with the baby. A few days later God came to take this little angel to His Heavenly home. We offer our sympathy to the chief and his wife. God bless them and help them to bear their sorrow.\n\nAlbina Adekat, Grade 7\n\nA SURPRISE\n\nOn October 1st there was much excitement around the house. I was downstairs and I wondered what was going on. As I was coming up the stairs the girls told me that there was a new Sister named Sister Olier. There was much talking and laughing. Everybody seemed glad to see her. It was surely a long time for Sister for the bakery. God answered our prayers. We are glad to have Sister here and we hope she will like it here.\n\nPaul Tall Cree Grade 5\n\nBAD LUCK\n\nOne evening the girls brought a weasel caught in one of their traps. The next day we decided to make some traps for ourselves. We wanted to catch a weasel too. That evening we went to the bush to set them. Everyday after school we went to see them. One day we noticed that there had been weasels in some of our traps. We thought that someone had taken them. So we set our traps across the river where they couldn't get away to say we didn't catch any weasels. Just a little mouse.\n\nJohn Fournier, Grade 6\nAN ACCIDENT\n\nOne evening while the girls were watering the slide Marina Flett wanted to have a slide. The girls told her not to slide until there they were finished. Marina did not listen. As she was going up the steps she tripped and rolled down the slide and broke her arm. Sister Celine took her to the hospital. The doctor put her arm in a cast.\n\nMary Ekle, Grade 6\n\nOur SLIDE\n\nWhat fun we have on our slide! The working men put big blocks of ice on it so that we can have better slides. Some of us slide all day and we never get tired. Brother Belcourt made us many sleighs this year. We sure make use of them.\n\nGeorge Alock, Grade 6\n\nBIRTHDAY CAKE\n\nDecember 10th was a happy day for little Emma Marcelet Flett. It was her birthday. Emma is now four years old. One of the kitchen girls made her a little cake and put four little candles on it. That morning while we were having breakfast Sister Bustacho brought the cake to Emma. Little Emma didn't know what to do. She had fun blowing out her four candles. When it was time to eat the cake Emma didn't forget to give some to her three sisters and her friends.\n\nEvelyn Robert, Grade 6\n\nARRIVAL OF MISSIONARIES\n\nThe feast of the Immaculate Conception is a great feast for the Oblates Fathers and Brothers. On the 8th of December Father Jal and Brother Le Blanc came from Hay Lake to join in the feast. We were all glad to see them again. Brother Le Blanc did not stay with us very long. He went with Father Hommeur to Paddle Prairie for a week. Father Jal went back to Hay River for Christmas. Father Mariman went to help him. They are back now to stay for a short while.\n\nAlbina Kidney, Grade 5\n\nA GIFT\n\nOne day Father Jal asked Sister Jean Leon to make him some flowers for his church at Hay Lake. That same day we also got busy to make him some. Some of us made two minute flowers and some others made roses. When we were finished we gave them to Father as a Christmas gift. He was very pleased. We were glad to work for his poor mission.\n\nGrace Auger, Grade 5\n\nHOME AGAIN\n\nEverybody was glad to see Peter Courtoireille come back from the Camell hospital. Peter is lame. His father brought him to the doctors to see if they could do something for him. They kept him in the hospital for three years. Now he is back with us again. Peter is not much better. How glad his parents were to see him.\n\nWalter Cassoncy, Grade 6\nHAPPY NEW YEAR\n\nEven though many children were in bed for Christmas we all enjoyed the day very much. We were not more than 20 children at midnight Mass. Everybody said we sang well. We sang the B.M.Mass. Father Jan taught some of the boys to sing the prayer of the mass. We were quite at first but two of the best singers got sick. I was one of them that sang; I was sure nervous. There were many people in church. Some of the children sang solos. The people said that they liked that the best.\n\nWe were very disappointed not to have our Christmas tree this year. Santa didn't forget us even though many were sick. Then we came to breakfast we had all our gifts at our places. How glad we were! Santa went to visit the sick upstairs. I don't think they enjoyed their toys very much, for they were too sick.\n\nPaul Tall Cree, Grade 5\n\nPICTURE SHOW\n\nWe had the best picture on the 4th of January. The name of it was \"Jeep Hunters.\" There was much trouble at Mr. Martin's ranch so his son sent a telegram to his soldiers' friends for help. They came with their jeeps and in no time they captured the wicked men who were causing all the trouble. It was very funny at times. We sure had many laughs. It was all in technicolor. It was the first time we had one like that. We like it so much that Father let us see it again on Epiphany.\n\nEvelyn Robert, Grade 6\n\n\"A VISIT\"\n\nDoctor Stone paid us a short visit on January 6th by plane. He came in the afternoon to see us. He examined our eyes and teeth. After he went through he said he had no complaints to make about us. Instead he gave us a good compliment. He said we were healthy and good looking. I hope he meant it. We all thanked him for the compliment and we hope we will always be healthy and good looking.\n\nDoctor Stone left by plane on Thursday 2nd.\n\nRachel Cardinal\n\nCHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS\n\nI had a long Christmas holiday this year. My little sister had the measles on the 10th of December so my two brothers and I had to stay home. I got the measles too, but I was not very sick.\n\nWe started school on the 12th. I was glad to come back again. It seemed a long time I didn't come.\n\nWilliam Ourtereille\nGrade 4\nCHRISTMAS CRIB\n\nWhen Sister Margaret Martha asked Fred and I to help her to make the crib in the church we were very glad. She said we were tall and strong enough to do the climbing and the running. Did we ever run! The crib looked very nice when it was finished. I like the scene at the back of the crib. We also helped Sister to make the decorations on the altar and around the church.\n\nLouis Fournier, Grade 5\n\nA JOLLY SLEIGH RIDE\n\nOn January 6th we went for a long sleigh ride. We went to the airport. We sang songs on the way and had lots of fun. Brother and Blankie sang songs for us. We surely enjoyed the ride.\n\nWhen we came home Sister gave us a treat of peanuts and candies.\n\nIda Cassoney, Grade 4\n\nRETURN OF FATHER ARBET\n\nWe were glad to welcome Father Arbet back from France. Father enjoyed dinner. He said he was glad his visit home but he said he was glad to come back to his home at Hay Lakes. He also said that times are hard in France, and that we should be grateful for what we get here in Canada.\n\nWelcome Home Father! We hope you can stay with us for some time.\n\nFred Eklo, Grade 7\n\nCHRISTMAS TREE\n\nAfter dinner on Christmas day we had our gifts. They were placed around the tree. We were excited when Sister told us Father was coming to give us our gift. Everybody had nice gifts. I had a game of Freddy Frog. I enjoyed playing with it.\n\nGeorge Alock, Grade 6\n\nA pretty little wedding took place in our chapel on January 7th. The couple were Florence Gayton from Peace River and Clifford Smith from Stoney Point.\n\nThe bride wore a floor length gown of blue nylon. She carried a bouquet of roses.\n\nWe sang hymns during the mass. When they were leaving the chapel, Sister played a march. They then went back to Stoney Point for the wedding dinner.\n\nWe wish the newly weds a long and happy life.\n\nGrace Auger, Grade 5\n\nDEPARTURE\n\nOn January 10th two of our school mates went to the Training School at Grouard. I was sorry to see them go for they were my best friends. They left by plane just before noon by plane just before noon. Some of the girls went to the airport to see them off. We hope they enjoy their trip. It was their first ride in the plane and also in the train. I always longed to ride in a plane and train. I hope that time will come someday.\n\nI wish good luck to you girls and hope you will like it there. We know you will come back real smart. We miss you already.\n\nHelen Attilon Grade 7\nA NEW SISTER\n\nOur Nurse, Sister Laura Marie is sick at Christmas Holidays, leaving us for Cranbrook, B.C. We are very sorry she is going. She was very nighty good to the sick.\n\nGood Luck to you, Sister! Sister Alcide Marie came to take Sister's place. We hope she will like it here. Santa Claus did not forget me.\n\nShe arrived by plane on the 12th. He brought me a nice game.\n\nSister Gertrude Eugenia and Sister Eustache went to meet the plane in a caboose. They wanted to give Sister Our school was very nice for Christmas first ride, but they were too late.\n\nWhen they got there Mr. Low from the Experimental Farm was seeing driving out the gate. He offered to take Sister to the mission. So the Sisters had to come home without her. I think they went just for the ride.\n\nNorman Yotenawatam, Grade 6\n\nGERMAIN COBERT, Grade 2\n\nRosalie Grandjambe, Grade 1\n\nTherese Auger, Grade 2\n\nMoise Makwayan, Grade 2\n\nWe heard during the holidays that our Inspector Mr. Wilson was changed.

I think they are very lucky to have him at?\n\nGeorge Alock, Grade 6\n\nSAD NEWS\n\nWe are glad to see James Inlaye back with us. He came back by the plane. He was at the General Hospital.

IV\n\nMIDNIGHT MASS\n\nOn Christmas Eve there were many people who came for Mass and received Holy Communion, for it was our dear Saviour's Birth. It was nice to see the chapel full. How Jesus must have been glad to see a great number of people. Some of them it was the first time they came for Mass for a long time. They wore in the bush trapping. There was a nice sermon by Father Guimont. During the Credo Bro. Gaucher passed around with a plate for those who would like to give some money to the Baby Jesus.

We had a wonderful time.\n\nEliza Augor Gr.VI\n\nTHE FIRST LINN ARRIVES IN WABASCA\n\nA large, large truck arrived here Jan. 1st, 1948. The man brought 7 tons of freight, some for the Mission and some for the H.B.C. The Linn weighs 11 tons and can carry much more freight. It is the first time that we see a truck made like that here. The Linn is about as large as a big truck but it is much more powerful. Half of it looks like a truck but instead of brick wheels it has a caterpillar under it. There was a two-wheeled cart behind it full of freight, also.\n\nThe Linn is owned by Mr. MacIntosh of Calling Lake, who is a Fish Contractor. He has two plans to carry fish also. The Linn has a diesel engine. I hope to have a ride in it some day.\n\nPatrick Young Gr.VII\nGabriel Augor Gr.VII.\n\nDEPARTURE FROM WABASCA\nBY LINN TO SLAVE LAKE\n\nWhen the Linn returned to Slave Lake Bro.

Now we will be warm in our class and the girls' hall.\n\nThank you Brothers and Mr. Gullion for your quick work?\n\nLouise Auger Gr.VI\n\nTHE CHRISTMAS CRIB\n\nEach year we have a beautiful Crib in the Chapel. It is always fixed by our good Sister Superior and the Sister in charge of the Chapel. Before they fix the Crib they put colored cellophane paper, some green, red, orange and purple in the window beside the Crib. It is so nice when the sun is shining, we can see the beautiful colors on the Crib. Behind the Crib is a scene nicely painted. On it is the star, a little town and some sheep. It was painted by Bartholomew Gladu. We are always anxious to see the little Jesus at Midnight Mass. The statues are very nice for the Crib. We hope to have one every year.\n\nHilda Auger Gr.VII\n(POINT ST. CHARLES)\n\nTHE FEAST OF SAINT CHARLES NOV. 4\n\nOn the day before the Feast of Saint Charles, our teacher told us that there would be no school the next day. We were very glad to have a holiday.

How glad we were to see His Excellency.... We were not so shy as we thought we would be... At first we made our pledge to the Cross and the flag and then sang \"O Canada\" in Cree. We also gave a short play called \"OUR CREE\". Little Mary Rose gave a hearty Welcome to His Excellency tho' it was very short. It was the first time that Mary Rose spoke a piece... His Excellency took the trouble to bless each and every one of all the 34 pupils present. He also gave us a Jubilee Souvenir card of Kateri Tekakwitha. Father Vandersteene then showed our Catechism Books with sketches and Cree Character. And we showed all our copy books of school work. His Excellency did not fail to question us in Religion. Before leaving us, we sang a song with our kazoos. His Excellency encouraged us to come to Mass and Communion often, then he bade us all good-bye.... We were sorry to see Him go.....\n\nMabel McLeod, Grade VI.\n\nVISITORS.... BUT WE DID NOT SEE THEM???\n\nWe were very sorry to hear that Mother Provincial and her companion came to visit our school while we were at home. They visited our school on Sunday after High Mass....

They then left by plane... We hope that we will not miss our visitors next time..... On another day all the Fathers\ncame to our school but we had just gone home...

Grantham\n(Teachers)\nAs we start a New Year, it is customary for us to try to live a better life than we did the year before. We usually call these efforts \"New Year's Resolutions.\"\n\nYou have probably made several resolutions, but one I want to suggest to you is to \"CHASE THE CURE\" even better than you did in 1947.\n\nNow you ask, \"How can I chase the cure better?\"\n\nFirstly, observe your rest periods completely, using every moment of the specified period for complete physical and mental rest.\n\nSecondly, apart from the official rest periods, spend as much time as you can in bed, and avoid using up extra energy.\n\nThirdly, closely adhere to the routine allotted to you by the medical staff.\n\nFourthly, co-operate fully with the nursing and other staff in their efforts to help you get well.\n\nFifthly, try to be cheerful at all times, and encourage your neighbors.\n\nLet us all go forward \u2014 both patients and staff \u2014 to make this a year full of achievement and good cheer. Let us all hope and pray for peace in this troublous world of today.\n\n(H. Meltzer, M.D.,\nMedical Director.)\nChristmas is over! But what a wonderful time everyone had! The fat old Santa Claus found the Hospital and everyone was remembered. There were shows and parties and treats and presents, and staff and patients, alike, had a happy time. The whole city of Edmonton seemed interested in our hospital. Many organizations remembered us. There were gifts of money, toys, books, Christmas trees, games, magazines, radio, nursery table, etc. Members of some organizations came to the hospital and helped decorate the wards and the trees. Others put on entertainments in the Recreation Hall. Carol singers sang their carols in the wards.\n\nThose who remembered the hospital were:\n\nI.O.D.E., Elks, Kinettes\nGyrettes, Kinsman Club, Rotary Club\nLions Club, Kiwanis Club, Y's Men\nC.W.L. (Seniors), Red Cross, Legion\nKnights of Columbus, Air Force Mothers, Eastern Star\nCanadian Daughters, Ukrainian Benevolent Society\nSt. Andrew's School, Daughters of the Midnight Sun\n20th Company Edmonton Girl Guides, Avonmore United Church\nErskine United Church, Ladies' Auxiliary (Wainwright)\nLadies of the Moose, Junior Red Cross, McKay Avenue School, Grade IV\nRene Flower Shop, Women's Institute, Hobbema\nNut House, Salvation Army\nEdmonton Municipal, I.O.D.E., Fort Edmonton Chapter, I.O.D.E.\nEdmonton Civic Employees, Navy Band Concert\nHudson's Bay Choir, Veterans Hospital Recreation Council (Mrs. Arnold Taylor and Mr. Harold Wright)\n\nRev. Schrage, Ex-Wrens\n\nA NEWS CLIPPING FROM THE EDMONTON BULLETIN\n\nEditor, Bulletin - We wish to take this opportunity of publicly thanking all those organizations and individuals who gave so generously of their time and energy to assist us in making Christmas more enjoyable for our Indian, Eskimo and D.V.A. patients.\n\nIt was most gratifying to see the spirit with which they entered into the various undertakings - decorating Christmas trees, entertaining the patients, wrapping gifts, and last but not least, giving presents and treats to all. Words cannot express the gratitude felt by both the patients and the staffs of this hospital.\n\nWe want to mention particularly the following organizations who gave gifts or cash donations: I.O.D.E., Elks, Red Cross, Kinettes, Gyrettes, Kinsman, Rotary, Kiwanis, Lions, Y's Men, Knights of Columbus, C.W.L., Legion, Veterans Hospital Recreation Council, and many others too numerous to mention.\n\nH. Meltzer, M.D.,\nMedical Director.\nCharles Camsell Indian Hospital, Edmonton.\nMiss Mary McNutt, R.N., formerly at Fort Norman, now taking her Public Health at McGill University, has expressed sincere thanks for the Arrow. She asks about Dora Gully, in her letter and would appreciate a note from Dora. Her address - 12 Richelieu Place, Montreal, Que.\n\nMiss Kay Dier, R.N., now in Honolulu, wishes to be remembered to nurses and patients. On her arrival she had three leis placed around her neck and said she felt like a horse winning the Kentucky Derby.\n\nA cousin of Dr. Woodworth, who is a patient in the Gravenhurst Sanatorium, tells him in a recent letter about their hospital paper, the San Sun. For some time Miss Woodworth has been in charge of the linoleum cuts for the paper. However, having taken on duties in the library she has had to hand over her other work to an Indian boy who is a patient in the hospital. She tells what a splendid job this boy is doing. There are quite a few Indian patients in this Sanatorium.\n\nWe hope to have a copy of the San Sun as an exchange paper and also the Munsey Wampum, an Indian magazine.\n\nThe following sent Christmas Greetings to the hospital staff:\n\nMiss Kautz, Calgary\nMrs. Norman Umbach (Miss McDiarmid), Camrose\nDr. S.

In Edmonton, the Charles Camsell Indian hospital has inaugurated a handicraft program that serves two useful purposes. Miss D. Oakden, supervisor of the project, is interviewed by Enid Nemy of The Canadian Press.\n\n(Continued)\nEnid: Miss Oakden, just what is the program, does it take in a few specific crafts or a number of them?\n\nD. Oakden: Well, actually the patients have their choice of all the usual handicrafts done in hospitals \u2014 but we try to get them interested in leather and bead work that will help preserve their ancient tribal crafts. The women do beautiful embroidery on mitts, mukluks and gloves. They work out their own designs and choose their own color schemes and, of course, they do their own cutting and shaping.\n\nEnid: Do you find the designs and color schemes follow the usual pattern or are they generally original?\n\nD. Oakden: They are quite original. Both Indian and Eskimo women have unusual taste in color and design. Often when they describe the colors they plan to use it sounds as if the finished article will be ruined but I'm always amazed\u2014 they can use almost unheard of color combinations and yet it seems just right when completed.\n\nEnid: How about the men \u2014 do they take part in the program or are they content to leave the crafts to the women?\n\nD. Oakden: No, they are just as enthusiastic as the women. They concentrate mainly on leather work which they can do well. They're exceptionally good on articles like belts and harnesses \u2014 they make some extremely smart ones and yet they are sturdy.\n\nEnid: What happens to the work once it is completed \u2014 do they keep the articles they make?\n\nD. Oakden: The work is sold to various people and business organizations and the money is divided among them in proportion to the amount of work done. Selling the completed articles makes the whole project self-supporting and also provides a great deal of incentive.\n\nEnid: Other than keeping the patient interested, do you find there is any result from the program?\n\nD. Oakden: Yes, most of them have done some sort of handicraft work before but working at it while they are ill and also allowing them full scope and giving them encouragement certainly helps to preserve their own crafts and native talent. Many patients ask to continue their work after\n\n(Continued)\ntheir discharge and once they find that only articles with good workmanship are saleable, they take pride in turning out the best work they can.\n\nEnid: Thank you, Miss Oakden. This is Enid Nemy reporting from Edmonton.\n\nWe are very pleased with our two new chapels. One of the former small staff dining rooms has been made into the Roman Catholic chapel and is most attractive. A small building was moved, renovated and decorated. Now, opening off one of the main corridors, it makes a pleasing Protestant chapel. The work on the chapels was all done by the maintenance men of the Hospital. They were very busy getting them finished by Christmas and have reason to be very proud of their work.\n\nSunday Services\n\nFebruary 1, Church of England,\nCanon Clough.\n\nFebruary 8, Roman Catholic,\nRev.

She was so bewildered. The next day she asked if she were in bush country or prairie. The women told her it was BUSH. Soon she heard a train whistle and asked if that were an animal in the bush and the women told her it was. Naturally the new patient believed it all. Soon the girls relented and told the new-comer the truth.\n\nWe have a new game. Louise Ann Burnstick is the grand champion. Mary Littlechild just missed a high straight flush by one card. She had a Jack of Spades instead of a Jack of Diamonds. That doesn't sound like cribbage, does it?\n\nRuby Cutknife-Harriet, when are you going to wrap your Christmas presents?\n\nHarriet - After Christmas.\n\nWe welcome Florence Johnson, a new patient, who arrived just after Christmas, from Grouard.\n\nWe welcome, also, the Ward II girls, who will be with us while their ward is being renovated.\n\nTeacher - Dorothy, read the following sentence, \"The children were playing in the snow.\"\n\nDorothy - The kids were playing in the snow.\n\nWARD II (Private)\n\nJosephine asked Lillian Frank to look at her tonsils. Then just as Lillian was about to look, Josephine said, \"I lost them.\"\n\nAgnes Augibelle has just been promoted to a higher routine. I guess that was what inspired Agnes to tell the girls the following story:\n\n(Continued)\nWARD II (Private) (Continued)\n\nAgnes\u2014\"One night just as I was dropping off to sleep I heard a tapping on the door. When I opened the door there stood a funny little brown man. At first I did not recognize him he looked so queer. When I looked more closely I saw that he was a little brown radio man. Our radio had come back to us. He was so glad to be back with us again that he started to sing. I was so glad to have him back that I started to dance to his music.\"\n\nThe doctor asked Mary Loonskin if she were eating any better. Mary thought he was asking her if she wanted anything more to eat, and so she said, \"No\". Mary, you must try to learn to understand English better and soon you will be able to give the right answers.\n\nPhilomene Deschamps, who has been on Routine 1 for sixteen months, is rejoicing over the fact that she has been promoted and can now get up. One morning when she was combing her hair in the bathroom, she got tired and sat down in the bath tub to finish her hair. What if someone had turned on the water, Philomene?\n\nIrene Round Nose asked for Porch eggs the other morning. Oh, I guess that is just Irene's nickname for poached eggs.\n\nOne day after New Year's our teacher, Mrs. Grantham, arrived at the door of Ward II with her arms full of books ready to give us lessons. All she found were piles of lumber and men at work. Her thirty pupils had disappeared. The ward was being turned into smaller rooms. Our teacher started off on what she called a \"treasure hunt\". We imagine there are days when she does not think we are such treasures.\n\nWhat is the difference between a donkey and a postage stamp? One you lick with a stick and the other you stick with a lick.\n\nWARD II (SunPorch)\n\n\"I was so glad to have a visit from my sister, Louise, the other night. It so happened that I was very lonesome that night and she soon chased the \"blues\" away.\" Delphine Burnstick.\n\nThe other night Delphine was wakened by spooks making a noise like the rattling of a paper bag. The next night the spooks came again and the same rattling noise was heard. This time Delphine was REALLY frightened. The nurse investigated and the spooks turned out to be a wee mouse. The nurse soon had the mouse by the TAIL and thus ends our TALE.\nWARD III\n\nWe have not much news for the Arrow this time as we have been shut off from the outside world lately, having been in quarantine. Poor Elise Laboucon has had the MEASLES!\n\nMary Jane Boucher spent a very pleasant New Year's Day. She was allowed to go out to visit with Mr. and Mrs. Guinette. Beatrice Calihoo was there, too. The girls had dinner at The Mandarin Gardens and saw Variety Girl at the Capitol.\n\nA letter from Mrs. Mary Frances:\n\nHello friends,\n\nDon't know what to write but I'll try. First I'll say thank you for the doctors and nurses and all the girls who work in the hospital. I sure thank God for them every day, because they try hard for the patients to better them. Ever since I got here I never do anything for myself. And another thing all the patients are good to me. I am very glad for all that. I have been in this Charles Camell Hospital for seventeen months. I am sure tired of it and lonesome for my children, because I have been away for a long, long time. My husband passed away before I came here, so I have no real home after I get better. Anyway, the people were good to me when my husband was sick and they will be good to me when I go back. And another thing I found to be thankful for in this hospital is that I have learned to write, although I can't write very well yet. Anyhow, I have learned lots of good things ever since I got here and I hope that I can remember them when I go back north and I will have lots of things to tell and show my friends.\n\nMary Frances.\n\nWARD IV A.\n\nI wonder if Leo ever learned who the Hallowe'en witch was \u2014 we mean the one he turned his water pistol on last Hallowe'en.\n\n\"When I had my first operation I thought I was going to die any minute. But the nurse cheered me up and said that it would take more than that to make me die. The second operation I felt almost as badly. But now I forget all about the pain and am just thankful to the doctors and nurses for the treatment. I am no longer afraid that I am going to \"kick the bucket\". This Edmonton weather is sure funny, having summer in winter. Quite different from the Yukon where they will be having real winter by now!\"\n\nSam Williams.\nWard IV.\n\nPoor Araball! You've lost your rag doll,\nAnd don't know where to find her.\nLeave her alone, and she'll come home,\nBut this time, you'll have to mind her.\n\nFlorence Auger was telling the Cree girls that her grandfather had\nto use a horse comb to comb his hair. That's a BIG comb and a BIG story.\n\nWe welcome Doris Beaulieu, Eliza Whitehead, Florence Twoyoungmen,\nIvy Lofthand Gelenna Mykoose to our ward from Ward II.\n\n\"When Ada was going home I almost cried but I did not for I\nknow that I shall be going home some day. God will help me get well, too.\nWe miss Ada very much. Good Luck, Ada!\" Sarah K.\n\nAda Nivingarluk left this month for her home in Coppermine. Ada,\nDoris and Sarah were the Three Musketeers in Ward IV and the two who\nare left are missing Ada very much.\n\nIn the dark, so the story said, one of the girls sat on the bed,\nshe slipped and fell and bumped her head. Then there came a dreadful\nyell. Everyone laughed, but strange to tell\u2014Madeline didn't\u2014'twas\nshe who fell.\n\nMrs. Grantham was putting up the Christmas decorations. She chose\na nice Christmas scene and a nice shiny window on which to paste it.\nSuddenly we saw Mrs. Grantham, scene and all, going right through the\nwindow. How we laughed! Mrs. Grantham joined in the laughter because\nshe felt no PAIN at all. Yes, that's right, there was no PANE there\nat all.\n\nWe miss our visits from Mrs. Korans and hope that she will soon\nbe able to take up her work again.\n\nWe are all trying to gain weight. One day we saw Adeline slipping\nthe salt shaker into her pocket. When Victoria Emile asked her what\nshe was doing, she said, \"Oh, I am just trying to find out how much\nthis salt shaker weighs.\"\n\nSTRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL \u2014 A little boy was saying his prayers in a\nvery low voice. \"I cannot hear you, dear,\" his mother whispered.\n\n\"Wasn't talking to you,\" the small voice answered firmly.\n\nEast, West, Home is best.\nWARD IV (Continued)\n\nOne day we had sardines for supper. The nurse came around and asked if we wanted more sardines. Adeline said, \"No, thank you, but I would like some more of those little fishes, if there are any left.\"\n\nVictoria Sans Couteau and Adeline were playing cards. Adeline put down a hand with three hearts. \"Oh,\" said Victoria, \"you have three hearts.\" \"Yes,\" answered Adeline, \"I have three hearts and I'm still one person.\"\n\nWARD IV (Sun Porch)\n\nHello to everybody. We are fine. There are just three of us here but we do have fun. We read, sew and do school work. We have our own orchestra made up of a guitar, a harmonica and combs. You can see from this that we are a cheerful \"bunch\". Kathleen is particularly happy right now for she has been promoted to Routine IV. She is learning to play \"Oh Suzanna\" on her banjo.\n\nWARD VII\n\nJoc Redcalf has been moved to Ward VIII. We miss you Joe and your nice smile.\n\nJohn Bastien and Clarence Tallow are leaving soon for home.\n\nPeter Many Moons will have an operation soon. Best wishes for a speedy recovery, Peter.\n\nJoc Germaine is, so far, the \"champion\" cribbage player. He would like to challenge anyone in the hospital, (including the doctors and the nurses).\n\nWilliam Nelson is looking forward to the time when he can get out of bed and start his studies.\n\nWe were fortunate in having two shows last month. We would like, if possible, to have an F.B.I., a detective or a western show next time.\n\nWARD IX A\n\nLouis Henault has been moved into this ward from IX B. He was in IX B for about a year and is enjoying the change. Louis says \"Hello\" to all the boys in his former ward. He wants to know if they miss their former \"entertainers\"?\nWARD IX B.\n\nFirst of all we hope every one had a Happy New Year!\n\nThere have been a great many changes in our ward since the last Camsell Arrow \u2014 Louis Henault was transferred to IX A.\n\nFrances Poitras was transferred to a private ward after a sick spell.\n\nJames Eagle went back to Ward IX C after being with us for a few weeks during the Christmas season.\n\nThe new-comers in our ward are \u2014\u2014 George Tecomba, Fred Achla, Wilfred Cardinal and Perry Frank.\n\n\"I wish to thank the doctors and nurses for putting me well on the road to recovery. Take my advice, boys and girls, it pays to be a good patient.\" \u2014 Ben Adams.\n\nSimon J. seems to be very interested in learning to play the violin these days.\n\nFred Willier, Bill Mosquito and Alphonse Thomas are having a race to see which one can handle the most C.C. of air. So far it is a tie with 1200 for the three.\n\nWe have not had much to do with Ward X for the past few weeks. After all who wants the MEASLES? Ask Harry K.\n\nWARD IX C.\n\nLeo Sowan has been transferred to our ward.

It is a WHISKER CONTEST between Dave Hammond and Maurise B. Plume. We are all betting on Dave as he is one year older than Maurise. Both boys have their shaving kit in readiness and have an equal start with not ONE whisker showing yet.\n\n(Continued)\nDave Hammond asked the doctor if it would be all right if he bought some shaving lotion. Even with the aid of a flash-light, the doctor could not see that such a purchase was necessary. We will keep you posted on the results of this Contest next month.\n\nThere have been many changes in our ward lately -\n\nJohn Pascal moved in early in December and seems to be doing fine.\n\nEmil M. Traveller has not been feeling so well, so he has been moved to a private. Try your best Emil. We miss you very much.\n\nJohn Seeseequan was moved into Emil's place. As he was not feeling so well has been moved back to a private. Take courage, John.\n\nFred Laferty has been moved into our ward. He is very good company and we have barrels of fun, with Fred playing his violin in the midst of us.\n\nWe would like to wish every one of the patients in the Charles Camsell Hospital our best regards and a fast recovery -- from the boys of Ward X B. We wish to send \"millions\" of thanks to the doctors, nurses, ward aids and orderlies for taking such good care of us here.\n\nGUIDES FOR MAKING INTRODUCTIONS CORRECTLY.\n\n1. To introduce a boy to a girl, say the girl's name first; as,\n   \"Nancy, may I introduce John?\"\n\n2. To introduce a younger person to an older person, say the older person's name first; as,\" Mrs. Williams, may I present Bob?\"\n\n3. To introduce a man to a woman, say the woman's name first; as,\n   \"Miss Walter may I introduce Mr. Taylor?\"\n\n4. To introduce a very distinguished person either to a man or to a woman, say the name of the distinguished person first; as,\n   \"Mr. Justice Browne, may I present Mr. Robertson?\"\n\n5. To make conversation easy for people you have introduced, mention some common topic of interest; as,\n   \"Miss Brown, this is John Cain. John likes to make models of historic boats. Since you like ship pictures, I thought you would enjoy discussing his models.\"\nChristmas Greetings\n\nthe Grotto\n\nST.

They were Irene Miller of St. Mary's School, Adeline Thomas of Kuper Island School, Dolly Thomas and Audrey Paul of North Vancouver. When they reached Nanaimo, they were greeted by Doris James of Kuper Island School, who has been with the Sisters at Anaham for two years and Teresa Edwards of St. Mary's School. Martha Smith of Christie School joined them several weeks later.\n\nOn the evening before Irene's departure, the girls of the Student Guidance Club gave a little party for her, which she enjoyed very much. Some weeks later our principal, Father Flory, went up to visit them. When Father finally returned he told us how well they were getting along and how happy they were. On December 8th, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, the girls were made postulants under the title of Sisters of Mary Immaculate. This was a wonderful day for them. Sister Irene Miller wrote: \"I was never so happy in all my life. At first when I put on my postulant's habit, I felt a little shy as I thought that everyone was staring at me on my way to the Church. We had a lovely Mass with a nice sermon by Father Sutherland. We had a turkey dinner, went for ride in the afternoon and put on a little concert in the evening. It was a most happy day for all of us.\" We wish these girls success in their vocation and trust that many more will follow in their footsteps.\n\nJune Silver.\n\nARCHBISHOP DUE\n\nOne of our important visitors was Archbishop Duke who came here with Father Brown and three Sister of Charity of St. John.

Although written for children some adults may be able to understand it.\n\nTHE STORY OF JOHNNY T.B\n\nOne summer day I was strolling down the street of our Indian village. I was thinking how lucky I was to be strong and healthy, able to work and able to play on a day like that. I paused for a moment to enjoy the cool shade of one of the houses before continuing my walk when I thought I heard someone calling faintly. I looked around but saw no one near enough to know I was there. Again I heard a faint call, this time seeming to come from near my feet. I bent down and the sound was louder\u2014loud enough for me to be sure it was actually someone who wanted to talk to me. Although I couldn't see anyone I said, \"Who is it? Who called me? And where are you?\"\n\nThe voice answered, \"It's me, Johnny T.B., and I'm down here beside the stone. I was lonesome and I wanted to talk to someone.\" I thought it strange to hear a voice coming from a dirty spot on the ground by this stone, but I was interested. Looking around I found there were no villagers in sight just then who might think I was queer if I appeared to be talking to myself. Then I sat down on an old box which was handy and I said, \"Well, it seems strange not to be able to see you Johnny, but I can stay here for a few minutes. If you want to talk, go ahead. What did you say your last name was?\"\n\nJohnny replied, \"Really my last name is Tuberculosis, but everybody calls me 'T.B.' for short. Lots of people have nicknames,\"\nJohnny TB (Continued)\n\nand that's mine. Boy, oh boy, I'm glad to see you. I was getting tired of being alone here, and someone nearly stepped on me, and I'm cold and I had a narrow escape yesterday and I wish I knew what was going to happen to me.\" I could see he was so anxious to talk his words were just tumbling out so I said, \"I'll listen to your story Johnny T.B. and you can explain what happened.\"\n\nJohnny said, \"Thanks a lot. Some of the things I will tell you may be new to you so don't be surprised. You know, I'm a germ. I'm so very small it's no wonder you can't see me. There are lots of different germs in this world, but we Tuberculosis germs are among the toughest of the lot. We can live a long time unless we have some hard luck - and I guess my hard luck started yesterday. All of my brothers and sisters and a lot of my cousins and other relatives have been living in the lungs of your friend Peter. It was nice and warm there and we've been having a wonderful time. Of course, Peter didn't know we were there. And do you know why he felt too tired to go fishing this week? It wasn't just the 'cold' he thought he had. It was because some of my cousins became angry with him because he said he was going to get more rest. They started to work on him some time ago and have done a lot of damage to his lungs. That's what made him start coughing. That's what has made him tired and weak and get thinner and that's why he didn't go fishing.\n\n\"Peter was walking by this house yesterday and he was coughing and spitting. I was careless and got in the way and he coughed me out of his lungs. I landed here in the shade luckily - if I'd been around on the sunny side of the house I'd be dead by now. We T.B. germs can't stand sunlight at all.\n\n\"I had another close call yesterday. While I was resting after the bump I got when I splashed on the ground, your sister Mary came running along and nearly stepped on me. I don't mind being a bit dirty here on the ground (we germs seem healthier when we're dirty), but if Mary had stepped on me I might have been pushed deeper into the earth and perhaps I'd have had to stay there a long time. As it is now, once I get dried up a bit maybe the wind will blow me someplace where I can find a new home in some other...\"\nJohnny TB (Continued)\n\nIndian's lung.\n\n\"If that happens I'll be safe again. Hope it's somebody who is healthy. It's more fun picking on someone who thinks he is as Samson.\"\n\nJohnny paused for a moment, and I said - \"What's going to happen to Peter if your cousins are still in his lungs?\" Johnny replied, \"Well, that's up to him I guess. If he's foolish, and keeps on working hard, and staying up late at night, he'll just get thinner and weaker, and die just like his father did three years ago. My father and mother and some of my uncles and aunts used to live in the old man's lungs, but they managed to get into Peter's lungs when he was caring for the old man after he got sick. That's the way my folks get around - on dishes used by some person we have made sick or when he kisses some else, or coughs near him. We really don't care whose lungs we get into as long as we get there - that's the best place for us. And we don't care much what happens to them as long as they don't look after themselves. We have our own lives to live.\n\n\"But if Peter should decide to go to the doctor one of these days and the doctor finds out what is wrong with him maybe I'll be the lucky one and my cousins will be unlucky. Why? Because the doctor might send Peter to the hospital and he'd get well again.\n\n\"I've heard they do strange things in those hospitals. They look at your lungs with a machine called the X-ray, they do different kinds of tests to see whether we germs are getting stronger or weaker, and they do little operations sometimes that help the patient but certainly don't help us. The commonest thing they do is to put a patient in bed even though he may not feel very sick. And mind you, maybe the doctors get him to stay in bed for a long time. We tuberculosis germs don't like that at all. We're the ones that get weak then - many of us die and the rest get all tangled up in what the doctors call 'scar tissue', a sort of living death I guess, as far as we are concerned. Whoops! there goes my hat. Looks as if the wind is getting stronger. Hope it does. Maybe I'll get a break and get blown someplace where...\"\nJohnny TB (Continued)\n\nI can get a fresh start. Don't go yet, my friend. I've enjoyed telling you about \u2014 say, don't do that, it's not fair, you're hurting me, I can't breathe, you can't \u2014\".\n\nBut I could and did. I had listened to Johnny T.B. long enough. I was tired of his bragging. I knew he was dangerous even if I couldn't see him. I did know that he was somewhere in that dirty spot where Peter had spit so carelessly and I decided he should do no more harm. With a flat piece of iron I found nearby I had dug a hole and buried Johnny so the wind would never blow him into the lungs of any of my friends. As soon as I had finished I hurried off to find Peter. He was surprised when I told him I was sure he had T.B., but he was sensible about it and went to the doctor the very next day. And I'll know you'll be glad to hear that Peter did go to the hospital, that he stayed there till his lung trouble was better and that he's home again now, well and strong. After his next x-ray examination we believe the doctors will say he can go back to work again.\n\nMarch 7, Church of England, Canon Clough.\nMarch 14, Roman Catholic, Rev. Fr.

When we can be patient and help ourselves to recovery in this way, we are doing a great service to those in charge. This creative work has been greatly admired by all who have seen it. This had made possible our program of selling the articles we have made. This, too, had made it possible to give the patients some return for their work. We remember those sparkles in the eyes when the \"Pay Envelopes came around\" for work well done.\n\nIt should be possible to increase the scope of this work, keeping in mind the standard we have set, with the continued good work of those patients whose condition is such that they are allowed to be busy, together with all the support of the staff.\n\nIn conclusion I want to say \"Thank You\" sincerely to all the patients - men, women and children - for all that they have done. With all good wishes,\n\nD.M. Oakden,\nHandicraft Supervisor.\nIndian O.T. or Handicraft Section\n\nThis is the last time that I, as your Handicraft Supervisor, shall have the opportunity of putting a message in the Camsell Arrow.\n\nMost of the patients know, I think, that I shall be leaving this work at the end of February, to go to the United States. This section has grown so much, due to the splendid work of the patients and their co-operation. We have had our work on display at the Exhibitions in Montreal, Calgary and Edmonton. We have had orders from New York, Winnipeg, Oregon, Calgary, Banff and Vancouver. All our displays have been successful and our orders satisfactory.\n\nThe main object of this work at this hospital is to provide opportunity for our patients to have diversion so that they may be happier during their stay in the Hospital and during convalescence. \"Busy fingers doing creative work\" leave little room for those lonesome feelings, which come upon us when away from home.

It was the Saturday before Valentine Day. Betty liked to make valentines. She was glad that Mother and Daddy liked the kind she made, better than the ones at the store. It was fun to cut out red hearts and paste them on white paper. It was fun to paste lace paper around the edges of valentines and trace the printed verses with gold paint.\n\nShe would finish the valentine with the two red hearts, for Daddy. The one for Mother was to be the loveliest of all, white and gold with a wreath of forget-me-nots and the words, \"To One I Love.\"\n\nBetty finished Daddy's valentine and read over a list of names, checking the valentines that were finished. Suddenly she sighed.\n\n\"What is it, Betty?\" asked Mother, looking up from her work.\n\n\"Can I help you?\"\n\n\"I was just wishing, Mother,\" said Betty, \"that I had not spent all of my allowance. I would like to buy a pretty valentine for a little girl named Rosy. She has just come to our school. She is very shy. She does not have any money to spend, as her father is sick and her mother has to work. She said last night that she did not expect any valentines.\"\n\n\"Couldn't you make one for her?\" asked Mother.\n\n\"I haven't much time left, and I want her to have a real nice one.\"\n\n(Continued)\n\"I understand,\" said Mother, \"wait a minute.\"\n\nMother went out and returned with a white box, which she handed to Betty.\n\n\"I meant it for a surprise for you, dear,\" she said. \"I bought it when I was in the city last week, but you shall send it to Rosy if you like.\"\n\nBetty looked at the dainty valentine, a small white satin fan, trimmed with gold lace. She hesitated, but only for a moment.\n\n\"Oh, Mother,\" she said, \"It is beautiful. Rosy will be so glad.\"\n\nIt was a happy little Betty with shining eyes, who hurried home from school on Valentine Day, with her arms full of valentines from her little friends. \"Oh, Mother,\" she said, \"we had such a wonderful valentine box at school. Rosy was so happy and her valentine was the prettiest of all. Miss Alice had her come up and show it to the whole school and read the pretty verse. Rosy was so excited that she forgot to be shy and promised to go with me to the school picnic on Saturday. I know now what you mean when you say that it is more blessed to give than to receive.\"\n\n\"I am sure you do, Betty. It makes me very happy to know that my little girl thinks of others,\" said her mother. \"Now open the valentine that came for you this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mother,\" cried Betty, \"a valentine just like the one I sent to Rosy, only blue - my favorite color,\" and Betty gave Mother a very special valentine hug.\n\n**************\nWard I\n\nWe wish to welcome two new patients from the North. They are Mrs. Victoria Sepp and Mary Fat.\n\nMrs. Nora Young had a two days' visit from her husband. This is the first time she has seen him since she came to the hospital.\n\nWe wish to welcome, also, our new nurse, Miss O'Brien, who has just been in our ward since last week.\n\nOne morning everything went wrong with Mrs. Monuse from the very minute she awakened. As soon as she started her breakfast she started mumbling to herself. We all thought she had found a mouse in her coffee, at least. But, no, just the milk spilt on her tray! Next morning take a good look before you get up and do not get out of the wrong side of the bed!\n\nSometimes grown-ups as well as children get a good deal of fun out of a doll that says, \"MAIMA\", don't they, Flora?\n\nWe are all going to miss Miss Cakden very much and wish that she would change her mind and stay in a good country like Canada.\n\nWard I looks quite empty and deserted now that the visitors from Ward II have gone back to their newly decorated home.\n\nWard II\n\nThe Ward II girls are all happy to be home again after being in the different wards for four weeks. They wish to thank the other wards who took them in so kindly when they were looking for a place to sleep. Most of the girls are back again, as well as Margaret Ward from Ward I, Celine Pische from Ward I, Mary Jane Beaver from Ward III and Marion Njootli from Ward IV.\n\nThe big room, the original Ward II, has been divided into six smaller wards. They are painted nicely in pastel colors of blue,\n\n(Continued)\ngreen and yellow. There are four to six beds in each room. It is a wonderful change and everybody is so happy over it.\n\nMargaret Ward says that she left Ward 1 because nothing exciting ever happened there. Ruby Gutknife, Ward 1, says for Margaret to watch and see. I guess we shall all be watching the Ward 1 news!\n\nWHY?\n\nWhy did Dorothy McLean keep on talking to herself after Helen Old Pan fell asleep in the midst of the story she was telling?\n\nWhy has Eliza been moved to Ward 1, Private?\n\nWhy did Delia read the letter she had just written herself?\n\nWhy is Doris trying so hard to learn to play the guitar?\n\nWhy does Delia not charge us for entertaining the ward?\n\nWHAT?\n\n1. What did the pen say to the paper?\n   \"I got my I's on you!\"\n\n2. What did the hat say to the hat rack?\n   \"You stay here and I'll go on ahead!\"\n\nAgnes Augibelle told June that she was going to go on a diet or soon the song, \"I don't want her\" would be appropriate to her. Don't you care, Agnes, we all think you are looking very very well.\n\nClaire Moses was bemoaning the fact that her doll had a broken leg. Mrs. Rowell came to the rescue. The doll was taken to the doctor and returned with a real cast - just like the grown-ups. Now \"Mother\" has fun tending a sick dolly.\n\nMargaret Whitford who was discharged from the hospital about a year ago is a patient here again. She is from Good Fish Lake.\n\nOne day Helen Old Pan wanted to mention White Fish Lake. The name wouldn't come to her, so finally she said, \"You know the place I mean - White World.\"\n\nRosie Marcel was lonely one day while she was in Ward 1 and said she was going to ask the doctor to put her on a high routine just for a few minutes.\nElise Grandjambe and Marion Njootli, although happy now in Ward II, are often lonesome for their good friends back in Ward IV.\n\nREMEMBRANCE\n\nI send Valentines to those I love\nTo carry out my heart,\nTo let them know I don't forget,\nEven though we're far apart!\n\nComposed - Jean Courtoeille,\nWard II - Sun Porch.\n\nWard III (Private)\n\nAfter her operation Margaret Kendo looked in the mirror to see the change. BUT her hair had not turned gray and the same happy face was still smiling back at her.\n\nSaid Margaret to Adeline,\n\"Why have pneumos, can you say?\"\nSaid Adeline to Margaret,\n\"To chase T.B. germs away!\"\n\nWard III\n\nDon't think that we have all gone home because we did not have much news in the Arrow last month. IT WAS THE MEASLES! We are still here and happy with music goin' in full swing - and many other things!\n\nTwo days after Dr. McCaffery, the dentist, had gone North, Isabel Reid thought she had to see him badly. The answer came back, \"You will have to take the train to the North if you need immediate attention.\"\n\nLena Cardinal has moved to our ward - She used to be down in Ward Two - We're glad to have Lena, she's happy and bright - And never finds time to be \"blue\".\n\n(Continued)\nThere is a sign in an old restaurant that reads:\n\nWe go to work,\nTo earn the dough,\nTo buy the bread,\nTo gain the strength,\nTo go to work.\n\nThe sweater fell from the chair to the floor.\nSaid someone to Mavis - a voice from the door -\n\"A lady would stoop when the sweater she saw!\"\n\"I'm not a lady,\" I'm an Indian squaw!\"\n\nWard IV A\n\nWe have been very lonesome since Leo Sowan and Sam Williams were transferred to Ward IX C.\n\nErnest Horseman has moved to our ward after spending three weeks in a private.\n\nJohn Giroux had his second operation on January 27.\n\nWe have to thank Jim Johnson for always putting some news for us in the Arrow.\n\nWard IV E\n\nMrs. Marion Good Striler always gets into bed in SUCH a HURRY.\n\nOne night the girls made her an \"apple-pie\" bed. Marion climbed in, in a HURRY as usual! There she stuck, half in and half out. How funny she looked! One of the girls said, \"She looks just like a little calf at a Stampede, all tied up in a few minutes.\"\n\nI was very lonesome for a few days. But I soon found that the more lonesome I got, the more I got a pain in my chest. We only ruin ourselves when we are sad and lonely. So, boys and girls, cheer up, show your smiles to others and make them happy. Take everything to the Lord in prayer and remember to say a prayer for those who are trying to help us out from this old sickness we are having.\n\nMadeline,\n\nPoor Dinah Tallow was in the \"dog house\" for her birthday. \"If there had only been a puppy in the house to play with!\" says Dinah.\n\n(Continued)\nCard IV (Continued)\n\nOn February 5, we enjoyed \"King of the Wild Horse\". We enjoyed it very much - it reminded us of our home.\n\nWanted - Something to stop Esther Big Bull from talking in her sleep, before she tells us ALL her secrets.\n\nStanding in line in the dark in the X-ray room Bertha Chiefbody was heard to say, \"Stop staring at me, Vicky!\" Bertha must think Victoria Sanscouteau has cat's eyes.\n\nWard IX C\n\nHarry Lightning and James Eagle have found it very lonely here lately.\n\nJust a reminder that we would like a show. Has everybody forgotten all about us?\n\nI wonder when Abe Okpik will be able to play \"midnight boogie\".\n\nIs the Whisker Contest still on? We would like to enter one of our boys from Ward IX C. How about it Ward X?\n\nHere's a news item that caught the eye of one of our readers. It told how a dancer's hair came down while she was dancing on the stage. It's NEWS when anything comes down these days.\n\nWe did not appear in the Arrow last month. We are sorry but we had the MEASLES. Harry Kigiona was responsible for getting us all in quarantine over the Christmas and New Year's season. Do you call that the Christmas spirit, Harry?\n\nWe welcome Mr. Harry Martin from Yellow Knife.\n\nMr. Winter has at last found Edmonton and we have had a few cold nights. We do not mind them at all, so you can guess where most of us come from! - X A -\n\nLet's take a peek into Ward A1 and see how everyone is faring. Never a peep out of LABOUCAN, so we've got nothing on him. Tall, towering QUINN would appreciate it if someone would invent telescoping legs or longer beds. NEDLIN is happier these days, as the new arrival to our ward, Harry MARTIN talks his language. Their Indian lullabys are second to none. Now for a look at the (Continued)\noccupants of Eskimo Row. First there's Tom GOGSE bemoaning the fact that he hasn't fed his dogs for two years. Young ELANICK, Nature's answer to that false belief that there's no such thing as perpetual motion. \"Abe\" OKPIK, who comes from the Land of the Midnight Sun, from whence he brought his love for fun. Our one and only KIGICNA, jester and coiner of phrases. His latest one is, \"What are you guys smellebrating?\"\n\nWell that's all, folks, so until next time, it's \"UGG!\"\n\nFLATFOOT.\n\nTHE BOY AND THE WOLF\n\nArrange the following sentences in the proper order:\n\n1. But when the men found it was a joke, they made up their minds, that no matter how much the Boy called, \"Wolf, Wolf,\" they would not stir to help him.\n\n2. If boys often tell lies how can you know when they tell the truth?\n\n3. At last THE WOLF REALLY DID COME.\n\n4. A Boy, who kept a flock of sheep not far from the village, used to find fun in calling out from time to time, \"Wolf, Wolf!\"\n\n5. So the wolf killed all the sheep in the flock.\n\n6. Many times in this way he called the men in the fields from their work to help him.\n\n7. Then the Boy ran, calling, \"Wolf\" as loud as he could; but the men would not listen to him, for they thought he was only in fun, again.\n\nValentine\nTHE LADDER\n\n\"I won't\" will never start.\n\"I can't\" goes up one step.\n\"I don't know\" reaches for the second.\n\"I wish I could\" steps down again.\n\"I might\" reaches second.\n\"I will try\" climbs higher.\n\"I can\" is on his way.\n\"I will\" is going up fast.\n\"I did\" is now at the top.\n\nHOCKEY POOL WINNERS\n\nJanuary 31 - Joseph Hoof\nFebruary 7 - Jack Royal\n\nLife would be humdrum in our ward if it were not for our story teller, Jack Royal. He has a host of stories and he tells them well. It would be hard to beat the pair of them - John Pascal and Jack! What beats a pair of Jacks?\n\nWhat's the matter with the shows? We have only had three since August, - August 7, October 12 and November 4. We keep on HOPING that we shall have one soon. We would like one for George Cheekyass before he has his operation.\n\nOne morning two of the ward aids were planning their morning's work together.\n\nFirst Aid - I'll go upstairs now and do my work and then come back and help you with the other half.\n\nSecond Aid - Which half?\nJack (promptly) - Archie Half.\n\nOn February 6 Fred Laferty and Edwin Lafleur had an operation. We are glad to report to all that they are doing fine.\n\nThe rest of us are all fine and happy. We hope the rest of you are all improving and that we shall all soon be on the way to Home Sweet Home. Best wishes and best regards to you all,\n\nFrom all the boys\nThanks to Dr. Rev. Chamberlain and for the instruction he gave us, we are grateful enough to be able to rely on his guidance.\n\nHe served our community faithfully during the difficult times when we needed him most.\n\nOur good doctor is always faithful to his work, but shows great concern for others.\n\nThis year he visited the classrooms before lunch. The plane took him away too soon again.\n\nST. JOHN AMBULANCE AT 1:30 DOCTORS' VISIT\n\nOur doctors visited the twelve Scouts and Cubs on Friday. They tested the Scouts' knowledge of first aid for the St. John Ambulance. We wore our uniforms and came prepared to answer questions about fractures and first aid procedures.\n\nThen the ambulance arrived and we were encouraged to keep on studying and be able to give help in any accident. We are very glad to have passed our first test and thank all those who contributed to make our certification possible.\n\nRodriguez Thomas\n\nSISTER SUPERIOR: SISTER WAS STILL CAUGHT UP\n\nOn the eve of New Year's Day, she held a special service for the children. She spoke about the importance of prayer and how it helps us to be closer to God.\n\nShe often goes out of her way to help others, especially the sick and the elderly.\n\nHer kindness and compassion are evident in everything she does.\n\nWe are grateful for her selfless dedication to our community.\n\nDOCTOR CLINIC - OH! WHAT A GOOD DENTIST WAS THE KIND DOCTOR CLINIC!\n\nHe did not lose a minute at his job from Wednesday 5 p.m. until Friday 12 a.m. Everybody was jolly and everybody was quiet as quiet as can be.\n\nHe milled 67 patients, treated 120 little ones, and left us with a smile.\n\nOur teeth are now clean and healthy thanks to his excellent care.\n\nI went to the dentist yesterday. Does the tooth still ache?\n\nI don't know - he kept it.\n\nLITTLE MARIE: WE WERE GLAD TO SEE THERESE JEBB'S MOTHER FROM THE PAS VISITING HER CHILDREN HERE AT OUR CHRISTMAS PARTY. YET WE FEEL SORRY TO SEE HER LEAVE WITH HER LITTLE BABY BOY MIKE. WE WILL MISS HIM. HE WAS GETTING TO BE SUCH A CUTE BOY. HAVE YOU SEEN HIM CALLING ON US AT HOME? HE WAS SO FOND OF OUR DOG. HE DIDN'T SAY GOODBYE TO EVERYONE. HE'S GOING TO CALL \"POODLE.\" HE WOULD NOT FORGET HIS HAPPY LITTLE SMILE WHENEVER HE MET US. HE'S GOING TO BECOME A BIRTHDAY WHEN HE'S SIX. WE PLACED THE CARD IN THE BOX BEFORE HIM. WE STILL CAN SEE HIM BLOWING HIS TWO CANDLES LIKE A LITTLE MAN THEN SHOUTING \"THANKS!\"\nCLASS IN FULL SWING\n\nA few missionary Fathers here for their annual retreat were invited to visit the Primary Class. Oh! an excitement for the tiny tots\u2014the new comers. Happily they are not timid. They are only too pleased to receive visitors. Sr. Luke can tell you herself how her little ones tried their best.\n\n\"Back in The Room\" was a first item of a Speech Demonstration. Held in a queer costume beared out of the big box? Part came the \"ball game\" for drill in action work. Here the children were placed in two rows facing each other. One child tossed the ball, and said, \"Catch the ball.\" If the other answered whether he or she caught the ball, or not, \"I caught the ball,\" or \"I didn't catch the ball,\" then the word buy came up. Children of the group using such expressions as: \"I want to buy a cake,\" \"I bought a cake,\" etc., etc., made a real enterprise.\n\nThe eldest boys pull all the store while the girls purchase the goods. These cakes of red sand decorated with colored beads were a pretty show. There was kept on with some of our motion songs for the beginners. This also seemed just fine followed by reading class for the beginners. They read 28 pages from their Primer\u2014this is our home for their own missionary Fathers.\n\nThe whole ended when all the children joined in a ring and played their favorite singing game\u2014\"The Farmer In the Dell\". Thanks for the congratulations and encouragement received.\n\nRIDDLES. THAT FUN!\n\nHave you ever made acquaintance with Haggady?\n\nRiddle time had come in our class room.\n\n\"I have a leg above a root,\n\nYet I cannot run nor walk.\n\nAnd I fall if you let me go.\"\n\nGuesing and guessing again no one could find out the answer. Suddenly I thought: Girls sometimes call me Haggady Ann\u2014and where? Yes, when I can't start sit the signal. Here came the answer \"Haggady Ann.\"\n\nNeedless to tell you guess?... It was a burst out. That would you guess?... It was a stocking, our teacher meant.\n\nBella Bightotty.\n\nSTORY HOUR.\n\nI am always anxious for the story hour. This week our Sister S.J. Leopold is relating that of the Lily of the Mohawks. While hearing it, I am deeply touched.\n\nI can bear my name that means white, pure. A little Indian girl as white, pure. A little Indian girl who at the foot of a white cross she has made takes the resolution to keep her soul always pure and white. \"Try, yes, try, why wouldn't I also keep mine spotless? This I am sure, we all can do if we only say as Kateri did say:\n\n\"To Will\". Catherine Keresty.\nMRS. RECHNAGEL\n\nOUR BENEFACERS FROM THE UNITED STATES.\n\nWe're extremely pleased to introduce Mrs. Rechnagel to the readers of our School Magazine. This kind lady has been a faithful friend of ours since 1940. As a tourist then she had visited our school. At that time she met the children who were three little eagles. Thus she had met the children of the far north. Her sympathy well extended in a series of donations that enabled the good sisters to please do for us. Having just run short of cards Sr. St. Athanase answered that it would be very pleasant to receive Christmas cards again.\n\nTherese Jebb.\n\nTHE BEST OF MISSIONARY TURNS.\n\nIdolight coming in to help my classmates and say: HURRAH FOR MRS. RECHNAGEL! She played the best of missionary turns when she re-published that personal request of our Dear Sr. St. Athanase in: \"THE HERALD CITIZEN\" a catholic news paper. I think all the readers of this paper picked up the item and that among them some were Publishers.\n\nBAGFULS OF CARDS\n\nCAME IN\nTHE CLUB STAR\nGarnier Residential School\nSpanish, Ontario\n\nVol. III. No. 13\nDECEMBER, 1947\n\nThe Fathers, Brothers and Teachers of Garnier wish first of all to thank all the boys for their excellent co-operation during the past month. We take the opportunity, too, to wish every boy from the tallest to the tiniest a very happy Christmas, a day of rest in which every Garnier boy, regardless of opening or Christmas Day, will be happy heart and free of soul at Bethlehem with the Infant Jesus in his heart as his own special gift. For the greatest gift given to us on earth is the gift of salvation brought this joyful day, and the greatest gift we can give to Him in return is the gift of our love when we receive Him.\n\nIn our homes during the holidays we shall have many occasions to practice co-operation. Let us not be a bit selfish over what we have made sacrifices to get for ourselves this holiday but rather let us bring joy to their hearts by helping in a thousand little ways, for we know how much more pleasure there is in giving than receiving. This would be the grandest gift we could give\u2014true love.\n\nOur best gift to Garnier will be to return the school promptly on the last day of January determined to profit one hundred percent by every means the school offers for our advancement. We can make still better marks in our examinations, can do still better in the line of sports and prizes, will maintain the formation of a good character and frequent use of the Sacraments and the good counsel given us. The examination results seem very good this fall term. There were excellent marks anyhow who is not personally acquainted with our Grade Ten the marks seem out of the ordinary. The four teachers who have the pleasure of instructing this class agree heartily that it is an extraordinary outstanding in comparison with any other class taught before. However, we might remark that only four of the nine succeeded in taking first class honours in all subjects. We believe that they can and will do still better than these must depend entirely on the work for us in other schools next year. We know they will return after the holiday and take the leadership of the school in good order, study, sport and above all in their very outstanding spirit of co-operation.\n\nIn our First Higher succeed in taking first honours in every subject but the class average is high. This class promises to be an excellent one by the end of the year.\n\nOur entrance class has the matter for grade eight well in hand and promises to keep up the record of last year's class in which there was not a failure.\n\nThe juniors who delighted the school with their original Christmas Presentation, are very well settled now. A few have low marks which they are hoping Santa Claus will not notice and we do not believe he will because they say he found grade one was \"just awfully hard.\" And so in closing, from all of us, the staff, to the parents and our own fine boys of Garnier... Merry Christmas.\n### Grade Four\n\n| Name               | Arithmetic | Spelling | Soc.

After grammar school he would get apprenticed or learn a trade. There would be other boys in the same trade with not half the learning that he had and therefore he could get ahead faster than they.\n\nIn the old days, a boy with a very small amount of money and ambition could get a job as clerk in a store and handle it quite easily. He might rise to the job of manager. If it was a small store he might make it in a day but he had to lose a lot of money because he had no idea of bookkeeping and could not check his accounts or keep his things in order making a profit on. Try to get a job today in a store and unless you just want to work for nothing, the owner will ask you how far you went in school. If you take a commercial course you have a chance to finish your High School first because only once do you get the best jobs are those who have done both High School and commercial. They have a lot more training and a lot more training, and their spelling will not send their employer mad.\n\nFarmers of not many years back used to laugh at \"these young college fellers\" but they send their sons right through school and off to Agricultural College too. The farmers get a lot more from his land if he knows all about the care of crops. If he hasn't got the right kind of corn, if he hasn't got the right kind of beans, if he hasn't got the right kind of cattle, if before he starts on his own farm, he knows what type of cattle suit his land and climate, he is going to stand fewer losses.\n\nA mechanic apprentice who has already studied physics and chemistry in High School will certainly be far ahead of the boy who hasn't the vaguest notion of science.\n\nContinued on Page 4\n\nTHE PLAY'S THE THING\n\nBy Dominic McComber, Grade X\n\nThe time is coming when every one of us must leave school and take his place in the world of men. We will try to hold our position in whatever job we may choose. It is very difficult to hold your position if you are not sure of yourself. Some time you are sure of yourself but you do not make people think you are; you are lacking in manner, you are lacking shy and bashful. Suppose you join some club and are asked to make a little speech. You are finished High School and the crowd figures that you are the man who should be able to do it easily. You get stage fright and hang your head, feeling that you want to run away. Some of the bosses are present and this would show that you are lacking in certain qualities which they did not know of. You are in an awful state; you do not say anything clearly and you lose your audience. You forget what you were going to say; you try to get stopped and cannot find out to finish.\n\nHow you wish you had put more practice on your reading and on the practice here. Your voice seems to stick in your throat and though you practice for the staging of three plays would have given you the control of it so you could use it now. The words get out faster than you wish, but if you were in a rush to get through and the person speaking gets out of what you are saying. A man's practice would have helped you to overcome that. People like to hear a good speech. If you listen to the radio you can make a fast talk. Some man will be giving a speech on a most interesting subject and he will be very hard to listen to. He will give a long story of his adventures in Ethiopia or India. He could be thrilling. He is a very poor speaker. You go further and get a man advertising something and it takes a little while to catch on that it is a commercial. Now if you just had to listen to one or the other,\n\nContinued on Page 4\nHe'd Better Stay in School\n\nContinued from Page 1\n\nWe do not speak here of the professional or the regular occupations such as that of the doctor or lawyer, but we know of cases where people who wanted to get into these professions, who worked all their lives to go to school to finish off their High School subjects. We know of some who were not willing to see themselves left behind when they had a chance for High School and who tried to make it all up in night school afterwards, in order to better themselves.\n\nEven if a man intended to start learning for the rest of his life he would be better off if he started early because he would be able to enjoy himself reading. It is impossible to read even the newspapers without having an ordinary grammar school education. You can't enjoy the comics at all unless you have a good knowledge of physics. So this man who has the keen ambition of just eating, reading and sleeping for the rest of his life would be better to get prepared for it the right way.\n\n(To be Continued)\n\nThe Plays The Thing\n\nContinued from Page 1\n\nI say you went in fall and it was part of your punishment... make your choice. Now take this broadcastor who is advertised as promising and tell me the other man's story... even if he has never seen Ethiopia or India he could have been there for years. He got good training in some school in enunciation, and used tones in his voice which is expressive. I shall deal with them both in the Club Star. Anyone wishing to improve his diction immediately has only to ask Mr. Sammon for an assignment in elocution. Come early and avoid the rush.\n\n(To be Continued)\n\nPrefect's Delight \u2014 Even the most solemn moments of the day are not smile-proof. At Mass, if you listen carefully, you may hear some one really instructed by Thy saving prefects...\n\nWe don't live in Canada, says Jarvis; we live in Spanish.\n\nHOLIDAY SLEIGH-RIDE\n\nAmong the gay events of Christmas time was the sleigh-ride. It came off the second night after Christmas. On two team-drawn sleighs, the forty holiday boys climbed and squeezed. Winter clothes, blankets and straw helped the squatters keep feet and fingers warm. And so, with nothing but shining faces exposed to the full-faced moon, the holiday group went riding out on the country roads.\n\nChristmas was already a thing of the past, but not so the spirit of Christmas. Marionos and McCombers, Buckshoe and Bonaparte, Whiskers and Ottawa were joined with the rear-singing and hoisting and howling, and keeping the townsfolk awake. Santa Claus sounded Christmas carols whose yells from wide-open throats rang out to the beat of the horses' hoofs. Silent wings of the snow gave way to Jingle Bells on the downhill. Peace, the heavely peace of Christmas, seemed to abound everywhere; all the world seemed rapt in praise. Even very trees and lifeless rocks seemed to be thanking heaven as fervently as the loudest voices for the bliss of so wonderful an evening. The night was clear and calm; the moonlight might have been the crown of angels' wings. The soft glow from the snow-clad hills added the finishing touch to a think of beauty. Some wondered then that the church sang so lustily and that the Christmas spirit was so much alive.\n\nUp the hillsides through the village this happy party rode, and when at last they pulled up at the door, they found to their delight something to bring their ride to a happy close\u2014a hot snack.\n\nR.I.P.\u2014Silly Shawanis' baby brother died this month after a short illness.\n\nDuring January, classes were held as usual and the Monthly Tests were taken. The Drama Club will take place early in February. Because of illness there was no dramatic presentation last month, but the Junior classes are preparing \"Robin Hood\" and other skits to be staged towards the end of February.\nThe Man With The Hoe\n\nBowed by the weight of centuries he leans\nUpon his hoe and gleans on the ground,\nThe eminences of ages in his face,\nAnd on his back the burden of the world.\nWho made him deaf to rapture and despair,\nA thing that grieves and finds no rest?\nStolid and stunned, a brother to the ox?\nWho loosened and let down this brutal jaw?\nWhose was the hand that slanted back this brow?\nWhose breath blew out the light within this brain?\n\nIs this the Thing the Lord God made and gave\nTo have dominion over sea and land;\nTo trace the stars and search the heavens\nFor power;\nTo feel the passion of Eternity?\nIs this the dream He dreamed who shaped\nThe suns\nAnd marked their ways upon the ancient deep?\nDown all the caverns of Hell to their last gulf?\n\nThere is no shape more terrible than this--\nMore consumed with consume of the world's blind greed--\nMore filled with signs and portents for the soul--\nMore packed with danger to the universe.\n\nWhat gulfs between him and the seraphim!\nSlave of the wheel of labor, what to him\nAre Plato and the swing of Pleiades?\nWhat the long reaches of the peaks of song,\nThe rift of dawn, the reddening of the rose?\nThrough this dread shape the suffering ages look;\nTime's tragedy is in that aching stock;\nThrough this dread shape humanity betrayed,\nPlundered, profaned, and disinheritied,\nCries protest to the Judges of the World,\nA protest that is also prophecy.\n\nO master, lords and rulers in all lands,\nIs this the handwork you give to God,\nThis monstrous thing distorted and soul-\nquenched?\nHow will you ever straighten out this shape;\nTouch it again with immortality;\nGive back the upward looking and the light;\nRebuild in it the music and the dream;\nMake right the immemorial infamies,\nPerfidious wrongs, immeasurable woes?\n\nO masters, lords and rulers in all lands,\nHow will the future reckon with this man?\nHow answer his brute question in that hour\nWhen whirlwinds of rebellion shake all shores?\nHow will it be with kingdoms and with kings--\nWith those who shaped him to the thing\nThat shall be last?\nWhen this dumb terror shall rise to judge the world,\nAfter the silence of the centuries?\n\nGypsies\n\nI am a gypsy, and you are too,\nAs we follow our dreams when the day is through;\nAt one with the fiddle-sorted clan,\nWe own the world and owe no man;\nWhen twilight comes on silvery wings,\nWith shadowy forms and imaginings;\nAnd when on tiptoe comes gradual night,\nFrom out of the darkening infinite,\nWith bed of grass and pillow of clover,\nWe join the ranks of the \"lonely rover.\"\n\nOr -- gaily breathless, down wind-swept hill,\nTo the river's edge, we drink our fill;\nKneeling together in shady place,\nDripping and laughing face to face;\nWith the drift of the wind our cares unload,\nAs we heed the call of the open road.\n\nThere should be centuries to spare,\nFor this our world, that knows no care;\nBut only meagre hours have we,\nTo hold through all eternity.\n\nBatiste at the Bonspiel\n\nDe noder day a frien' of mine\nHe say \"Batiste\" to me.\n\"Why don' you go up on the rink\nFor see bonspieil?\" say he;\n\"Pere's plenty char for sit down,\nDe place she's nice and warm,\"\nAnd so at las' I think I go.\nBatiste at the Bonspiel (cont.)\n\nShe can't do me no harm.\n\"Wall, dat is de mos' foolish game\nI never yet did see,\nFor all de men was yell so loud,\nI tink de go erase;\nDey have de stone like big spittoon\nAnd shove it wit' der han',\nBut why dey go so much excite\nI can not understand.\nDe man com at de nodder en'\nEve pus his broom down--so,\nAn' den h' yel', \"Now tak dat ice.\"\nDat's foolish, f'k' you know;\nHe can not take de ice away,\nShots frozen down so hard,\nBut still he yell, \"Yes, tak her out,\nI do not want de gar.\"\nAn' see dem feller, sweep de broom\nFor why I can not tell,\nDere is no dirt upon de ice,\nAn' den some feller yell:\n\"Yes, hold her up\" -

E. Kerans\nMadge la F. Grantham\n(Teachers)\nThis month I want to try to explain to you why some of you have to come so very far away from your home and your family to be treated in this hospital. Most of you have been very good and don't complain, but we all realize that you miss your own people and would rather be with them.\n\nIf any of you have been in the small hospitals which are on, or close to some of the reserves, you will realize that there is a great difference between these and the Charles Camsell Hospital. In the small local hospitals there is only one doctor and sometimes he can only spend some of his time there and part of his time in another place. Here we have six working full time, and you know that they very often work many hours overtime. In the same way a small hospital has one or two nurses, here we have over thirty-and so on with all the staff in the laboratory, dispensary and x-ray department.\n\nApart from the much larger staff, think of the equipment we have here. You know those x-ray machines are very expensive and they need highly skilled people to run them. It would be far too costly to have such machines in the many small hospitals and to employ an equal number of skilled men to operate them.\n\nMany of you have been to the Operating Room. There, again, a great deal of very expensive equipment has had to be obtained\u2014the tables, the lights and the many instruments. We certainly couldn't afford to have such costly things in each small hospital.\n\nMany of you have had something wrong with your eyes, or perhaps a bone, a joint or some other particular part of your body.\n\"SPECIALIZED\" TREATMENT\n(Continued)\n\nIn such cases a \"special\" doctor has been called in and consulted. A \"special\" doctor is one who has studied very carefully one particular part of the body. He knows best how that particular part works, what might go wrong with it and how best to put it right.\n\nNow, I think you can all see that in a small group of people, say 1,000 or even 1,500, there wouldn't be enough people who had something wrong with their bones to keep one man busy specializing in diseases of the bone. The same thing with eyes, ears, heart and all the other special parts. So these \"specialists\" as they are called, all live in the big cities where there are more people for them to look after.\n\nThe white people who live in the country and in small towns have to come into a big city, like Edmonton when they need to see a \"specialist\". They don't like to leave their home any more than you, but they know that it is the best way to get good treatment and that means the best way to get well as quickly as possible.\n\nSo next time you feel lonesome and wish you could be at home among your own family, try to remember that you have come here to get \"specialized\" treatment so that you can be cured as quickly as possible and then go home a happy, healthy, useful person. When you've remembered that, I think you'll also remember the other thing I've said so often. You can make your stay in the hospital so much shorter if you really help by doing everything the doctors and nurses tell you to do, and above all \u2014 REST!!\n\nH. Meltzer, M.D.,\nMedical Director.\n\nTHE SHADOW OF A TREE\n\nThis I learned from the shadow of a tree,\nThat to and fro did sway upon the wall:\nOur shadow selves \u2014 our influence\u2014 may fall\nWhere we ourselves can never be.\n\n- Anne E. Hamilton\n(Tony's Scrap Book)\nTUBERCULOSIS AND PUBLIC HEALTH\n\nTuberculosis is a communicable disease spreading from person to person by contact. It is one of, if not the most important of all such types of disease, vitally important in any community because it is the greatest cause of death in the young vigorous section of the population between the ages of 15 to 50.\n\nFor certain communicable diseases we have very definite means of prevention. Smallpox and diphtheria can be and have been almost completely conquered in localities where a constant campaign of inoculation and isolation is carried out. Whooping cough, typhoid fever and certain other diseases are kept under control by similar preventive measures. It is now realized that Tuberculosis can also be greatly reduced where health authorities, working with the full co-operation of a community, are enabled to put into effect and to carry out those preventive and treatment measures which have been proven to stop the spread of the disease.\n\nTuberculosis is caused by a germ called the tubercle bacillus. This germ is one of the most difficult to kill. It can live for long periods of time in dust, cracks in the floor and unclean clothes and utensils. It can live without any food as long as it has oxygen. It is quickly killed by sunlight; hence, the need for clean bright airy rooms in every house.\n\nThese germs live best in the tissues of the human body where they can get all they need in order to survive and multiply. In taking their food from us they destroy our lungs or our bones or any part of our bodies and eventually cause us to die.\n\nAny person with this disease is a great danger to everyone who is near him. Every bit of air he breathes out is loaded with tubercle germs and every breath of that air you breathe in is taking the germs into your lungs where they can live and thrive and eventually kill you if you are not treated. Every cough shoots a fine spray of moisture for 20 to 30 feet. This spray is deadly as any bullet. Every drop of sputum is a storehouse of vicious Tuberculosis. If left on the floor, on the ground, in a handkerchief and not safely destroyed, that sputum is as dangerous as any time bomb. Every drop of pus from a tuberculosis sore is loaded with germs almost as dangerous to handle as dynamite.\nTUBERCULOSIS AND PUBLIC HEALTH\n\n(Continued)\n\nBecause it is so easy for us to get Tuberculosis from one who has the disease; because Tuberculosis is such a serious crippling and killing disease, it is, therefore, absolutely essential to have these patients in a hospital, where they are not a danger to their community and where they have the best chance of recovery.\n\nThe number of deaths from Tuberculosis can eventually be enormously reduced by isolating the active cases. If the person with Tuberculosis disease is left at home he will infect others before he dies. If he is removed from his home to a hospital where treatment is carried out, he is first removed as a source of danger and, besides in many cases can be cured. If this program is not carried out we can never hope to stop the spread of Tuberculosis and reduce the number of deaths. None of us wants to see one of our children sick with Tuberculosis but a great many of them are unnecessarily suffering and dying from the disease. Whenever any member of a community is so selfish that he refuses to go to hospital for treatment he is to blame for the future deaths of those of his own or his neighbor's children who die from Tuberculosis. It is essential that the interest of the community as a whole must take precedence over any individual patient.\n\nGeneral examinations and x-ray repeated at least once a year and preferably every six months is the most important means at our disposal, of finding tuberculosis in a community. In the early stages of the disease there are no symptoms but tuberculosis at this time can be recognized from the x-ray film. Indian Health Services are attempting to have regular X-ray surveys of every Indian in Canada. You, in Alberta, are fortunate in having the Charles Camsell Hospital where you can be treated and where, I can assure you, every method of active effective treatment is carried out. For the most part the hospital has enjoyed co-operation from those Indians found, by X-ray or examination, to have tuberculosis. There are still, however, some who do not recognize their duty to their families and their community and who refuse to be admitted to hospital. Such an attitude by a person with tuberculosis is as criminal an act as starving some other member of the family. Just as surely as starvation will cause death, so surely will some member of that unreasonable person's family later develop and probably die from tuberculosis.\nTUBERCULOSIS AND PUBLIC HEALTH\n(Continued)\n\nWe at the Camsell Hospital, in fact all members of Indian Health Services, stand ready to co-operate with you and every Indian in Canada to treat every case of active tuberculosis. You must, however, realize that such treatment means removal of these cases to a hospital where they must remain until they are no longer dangerous to others. Such treatment does not mean that the sick Indian can enter a small hospital which has not the proper facilities for his care. Nor does it mean that he is free to return home when he feels well. He must abide by the decision of the doctors treating him\u2014who understand his case and who know when he is safe to be discharged.\n\nFrom you, we request an understanding of the dangers of the disease and the realization that your community, your band, your race as a whole is more important than any individual with tuberculosis. If you will believe in our aim to eradicate tuberculosis, in as far as it is possible to do so, each one of you will give full co-operation when we advise you that you have the disease and require treatment in Sanatorium. If that measure of understanding and trust does not develop between you and your health services then those of us who are devoting our abilities to your people's health can never hope to arrive at the satisfactory day where you and we can say that tuberculosis is no longer the dread scourge that it is now to you and your children.\n\nDr. T.J.

ANDREW'S\n\nOne day a little boy, Jackie, and his sister, Jean, were busy on a vacant lot building a little snow-house. When it was finished they began gathering sticks and placing them upright, one at a time, out from the snow-house at different points until they had a circle of sticks. Then they went to work in the little house with some little boxes and sticks tied up with thread. What were they doing? They had built a radio station and were going to broadcast to their friends who lived in the homes under the aerials they had set up.\n\nNow, think how this is like the Camsell Hospital. From the hospital the doctors and nurses fly away hundreds and hundreds of miles to a place where boys and girls are very sick. They are growing weaker and no one can help them. The plane arrives. The children are given treatment. Supplies are left with them and the parents are told what to do. Some of them who are very sick will be sent down in planes to Camsell. The doctor and nurse will fly back with them. The little settlement will be happier and they will think about the good people in the hospital who saved their children. This will happen again to other places down north. The children who were taken to the hospital will get well and will return home. There will be many links between the settlements all over the big country and the hospital. It resembles Jackie's and Jean's radio network.\n\nIn the hospital, the Doctors and Nurses ask and beg the sick people to rest and be bright and be happy. To be happy when things are hard is difficult, but very important. For example: there was a soldier in Camsell who had had several major operations and the next day he was going up for another. When asked if it reminded him of going over the top, he said that when one went over the top he had a chance of coming out without a scratch; but, when one went up for an operation he was sure to get some kind of a wound. I won't tell you this man's name but it wasn't Mr. White. Now, he was laughing when he said this. That is what is meant by making the best of a bad case\u2014a sense of humour. The Arrow shows, each month, that there is a sense of humour at work in the wards.\n\nThe Arrow is helping to knit together the people in the hospital with the many settlements and homes all over the big country, especially those in the great Northland. The Arrow is mighty important in the wonderful work the Camsell Hospital is doing.\nTHE WILD WILD NORTH\n\nMy \"father\" was a polar bear,\nMy \"mother\", an iceberg on the sea,\nI do not know where I was born,\nBut I know the North is a part of me.\n\nI hate the bustle of city life,\nI feel the urge to roam,\nIf I could follow the bold North Star,\nI know I'd find my home.\n\nImagine the cold of a winter night,\nThe frosty tang of the air,\nA howl that's sent to the moon above,\nAnd fades like a whispered pray'r.\n\nWandering through mountains of icebergs,\nBy seal-holes that dazzle with snow,\nI could sit by my dogs and talk to myself,\nAnd none but God and I would know.\n\nImagine out on the frozen plains,\nThe last moments of a deer,\nPursued by a pack of hungry wolves,\nLet those grey living deaths draw near!\n\nRacing my yelping dogs to nowhere,\n'Neath the Northern Lights fluttering wild,\nThrough the dark, deep and endless ocean,\nGod, look after His wandering child.\n\nIt's sweet and dark and cold down North,\nThat scene to leave I'd dread,\nTo return once more to an alien clime,\nAnd be confined to bed.\n\nComposed by\u2014\nThomas Aneroluk,\nWard X A.\n\nSHAMROCK FOR IRELAND\n\nOn March 17 we wear a shamrock for Ireland's patron saint. When St. Patrick preached Christianity to the pagan Irish he could not make them understand that God was Three Persons in One. So he picked up a three-leafed clover to teach them this fact\u2014three parts but just one leaf.\n\nThere are many superstitions concerning the shamrock, such as:\n\nEaten like water cress, it is said to cure all fevers.\nWorn next the heart, it will ward off evil spirits.\nIf placed in a baby's cradle, the baby will be free of childish ills that trouble children.\nIf a maiden names a shamrock after a young man, buries the shamrock under a rosemary bush and prays to St. Patrick, all will be well in love.\nTHE INVALID\n\nDay in, day out, year after year, upon your bed you lie\u2014\nPain holds you in its grip, and yet you do not fret or cry\u2014With\ngrace and patience all the day you fill the laggard hours\u2014as\nhappily you stroll again through Memory's golden bowers.......\nYou switch your wireless on\u2014and so sweet music fills the room\u2014\nits magic weaves a spell of dreams, dispelling fear and gloom.....\nYou never grumble or complain\u2014you never voice despair\u2014You...\ncount your blessings every day and see good everywhere...........\nIf only every invalid had your philosophy\u2014the will to see the\nbest in life\u2014how sweet their days might be!\n\nNIGHT NURSE\n\nShe keeps her lonely vigil through the dark and dreary night\u2014\nAlert and silent, watching\u2014in the shaded candlelight\u2014Her\npresence is a blessing\u2014for she's ready to perform\u2014the little\ntasks that make the patient comfortable and warm............\nKind, sensible and capable\u2014and quiet as a mouse\u2014She brings\na sense of peace and comfort to the troubled house\u2014for we can\ngo to bed and sleep and know that she is there\u2014content to leave\nour loved ones to her wise and tender care........God be with\nthese good women as they watch the long night through\u2014and\nmay they be rewarded for the splendid work they do!\n\n\u2014Patience Strong\n\nEASTER\n\nEaster Sunday comes on March the twenty-eighth this year. Easter\nis kept in honour of Christ's rising from the dead. It is a holiday\nthat appeals to everyone. Coming in the spring of the year, the whole\nworld seems to suddenly burst into new beauty.\n\nWe make the egg a part of our Easter festivities. The coloring\nof eggs appears to be extremely ancient and was done in Persia, Italy\nand Spain. The rabbit's part seemed to come from an early superstition\nthat rabbits laid eggs on Easter Eve. In early England the people used to\nroll down Greenwich Hill. They gave this up and rolled the eggs down.\n\nWe \"dress up\" for Easter and wear our \"best\" just as the world\n\"dresses up\" in its new clothes of green leaves and colored flowers.\n\"But Mary stood without at the grave weeping; and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the grave.\n\nAnd seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.\n\nAnd they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.\n\nAnd when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.\n\nJesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.\n\nJesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.\n\nJesus saith unto her, Touch me not: for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father: and to my God and your God.\n\nMary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her.\n\nSt. Luke,\nChapter 20,\nVerses 11 to 18.\"\nPUSSY WILLOW\n\nLet me feel your soft grey fur,\nIf I stroke you, will you purr,\nPussy, Pussy Willow?\n\nAre you scared of passing dogs?\nCan you hear the waking frogs,\nPussy, Pussy Willow?\n\nHow I wonder what you'd think\nIf I brought you milk to drink!\nPussy, Pussy Willow.\n\n**********\n\nIn the spring, long before the last snow has disappeared, the \"pussies\" on the willow trees have burst from their purplish brown winter jackets and revealed their velvety grey buds. They are what is commonly known as pussy willows. Some of the grey pussies turn yellow, and bear the pollen. This pollen is carried by the wind and insects to the silvery green pussies, which remain after the leaves of the tree have unfolded. The seeds ripen with a cottony down and are carried away by the wind and planted in the soil. From these seeds willow trees will grow.\n\n**********\n\nAPRIL FOOLS' DAY\n\nIn nearly all parts of the world there is a day which corresponds to our April Fools' Day\u2014April the First. It is a day set aside for the playing of practical jokes on friends and sending them on fools' errands and tricking them into doing foolish things.\n\nIt was not until the end of the seventeenth century that \"April Fooling\" became a common custom. There is no doubt whatever, that the English copied it from the French.\nAN OLD ENGLISH LEGEND\nof\nTHE TULIPS\n\nA long time ago an old woman came to live by a fairy field, and she planted about her cottage a garden of tulips. The fairies became very fond of these gay flowers, and under their loving care the tulips became more fragrant than any rose or violet, and they blossomed all the year long.\n\nThe fairies used to carry their babies at night into the garden and put them in the tulips, and rock and sing them to sleep. They sang so sweetly that the old woman often sat up late to listen to their singing.\n\nBut, at last the old woman died. The new tenant was not fond of beauty. He did not love flowers. He uprooted all the lovely tulips and sowed cabbages in the garden. When the fairies saw the tulips dying, they were very sad. They cast a spell over the garden so that nothing would grow there again. Then they planted the tulips on the grave of the old woman who had loved them so, and there, it is said, the flowers still bloom.\n\nThe tulip belongs to the lily family. There are many varieties of tulips. Most of them have descended from three wild tulips found in South Europe, Siberia and Asia Minor. Holland is noted for the great variety of beautiful tulips grown there. The farmers grow acres and acres of them in the rich land back of the canals. Dutch bulbs are famous all over the world.\nEASTER GREETINGS\n\nA ducky lived in Easterland\nBut very sad was he\nHe hadn't any Easter clothes\nBecause they were not free\nHe talked to all the Bunny tribe -\nThey promised they would see\nTheir Uncle Pete, the tailor, for\nThe Easter Company.\n\nAll the chicks and hens felt badly\nAnd the best they could do\nWas to ask Old Man Rooster\nTo give a tall hat, too.\n\nThen the tailor gladly promised\nHe'd do his very best\nAnd to quickly fill the order\nFor the Duck's coat and vest.\n\nNow the Lilies were all sorry\nSo sweetly offered to\nSupply him with a pair of spats\nTo cover up his shoe,\nAll the Hyacinths and Daffies\nThen not to be outdone\nBought him a new umbrella blue\nTo keep off rain or sun.\n\nThe Robin trilled a song of joy\nAnd said he'd get a tie,\nThe Bluebird bought a new white shirt\n'Twas all that he could buy.\nThe Violets so modest\nWere hiding in the grass\nBut craned their necks in\nhopes to see\nYoung Ducky when he passed\n\nHe surely was a gay young bird\nAs he strutted down the way\nWishing to all the FOLKS he met\nA Happy Easter Day!\n\nMrs. Downie Duck's Easter Bonnet\n\nEvery year at Easter time, Mrs. Downie Duck declared she was going to get herself a new Easter bonnet. Something always came up to prevent it. Mrs. Duck always saw somebody who needed money. If it wasn't her own three ducklings - Fluff, Duff and Muff - it was some of her forty-seven-eleven other relatives who needed assistance.\n\nAs Easter approached this year, Fluff, Duff and Muff decided that their mother was going to have a new bonnet this time. Every bit of money they earned went into the yellow teapot which they called, \"Mother's Easter Bonnet Fund.\"\n\nOn the Saturday before Easter Sunday, Fluff, Duff and Muff eagerly counted over the money. When they told Mother Duck about it, she thought of a hundred and one places for the money to go rather than to buy herself a new Easter bonnet.\n\n\"Fifty-six, fifty seven...\" counted Fluff.\n\n\"I really should get my glasses changed,\" Mrs. Downie Duck began to murmur.\n\n\"Fifty-eight, fifty-nine, sixty!\" chanted Fluff.\n\n\"And you children need new shoes,\" Mrs. Duck persisted.\n\n\"Sixty-one, sixty-two, sixty-three!\" sang Fluff.\n\n\"And Grandma needs new curtains for her windows,\" continued Mrs. Downie Duck.\nBut Fluff, Duff and Muff paid no attention. \"Goody, goody!\" they cried, dancing about the room. \"There's THREE dollars! That should buy you a nice bonnet with ribbons on it!\" they boasted.\n\nBut Mrs. Duck said, \"I can't bear the thought of spending so much money on myself.\"\n\nThe three ducklings were beginning to get worried. Then Fluff remarked slyly, \"A new bonnet will make you look years younger, Mother.\"\n\nThat settled the question right then and there, Mrs. Duck threw on her shawl and put her market basket over her arm. She kissed the children and set out on her shopping trip.\n\n\"I won't speak to a soul,\" she said to herself. \"If I do, I feel it in my bones that something will happen.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Downie Duck! Mrs. Downie Duck!\" called Mrs. Nanny Goat from across the street. Mrs. Downie Duck pretended she did not hear and walked faster than ever. She knew she was always out of money and would want something for her children. Mrs. Downie Duck had not gone far when she began to wonder if some of Nannie Goat's children were sick. She was just about to turn back when she caught sight of herself in a shop window.\n\n\"Gracious! Can this be I? I look old enough to be my grandmother. I certainly do need a new bonnet to smarten me up a bit.\"\n\nMother Duck hurried on, never looking to right or left until she came to a shop with a sign that read - SMART EASTER BONNETS FOR SALE.\n\nMrs. Owl came forward with a big smile. \"Something in a nice Easter hat? Yes, my dear. Take a seat and make yourself comfortable.\"\n\nMrs. Owl tried on quite a few hats, and then finally put a lovely pink one on Mother Duck's head. It was tied under the chin with a bow.\n\n\"It's beautiful on you, so stylish and has such YOUTHFUL lines!\" said Mrs. Owl quite overcome with admiration.\n\n\"I'll take it,\" said Mrs. Duck, quick as a flash. \"Never mind wrapping it up. I'll wear it. My, it does make me look young!\n\nIt certainly does do something for me!\"\nThen a strange change came over Mrs. Duck as soon as she put on the pretty bonnet. She tripped along the street almost as if she owned the whole town. She passed her friends with her head in the air. She walked haughtily into the grocery store and gave her order.\n\n\"Phew!\" whistled Mr. Crow as she went out. \"Somebody has gone HIGH-HAT and no mistake!\"\n\n\"I notice she has on a new Easter bonnet,\" remarked Slippery Seal. \"Like as not it's gone to her HEAD!\"\n\nMrs. Downie Duck was slipping past Mrs. White Rabbit's house without even calling in to ask about her rheumatism, when Mrs. Rabbit spied her and called her in.\n\n\"Mrs. Brown Hen has four baby chicks. She fell and hurt herself. I'm taking care of the children. Come and see them.\"\n\nThere, on the bare floor, under the stove were the wee chicks.\n\n\"Poor wee things!\" said Mrs. Duck. \"No mother to cuddle them!\"\n\n\"If I only had a basket to put them in, it would be a lot warmer.\" Suddenly her eyes lit on Mrs. Duck's bonnet. \"Even a hat would be better than the floor!\" she exclaimed.\n\nMrs. Duck hurried to the door. \"I really must be going at once!\"\n\nShe hurried along Sweet Clover Lane, clickety-clack, clickety-clack. She was so anxious to escape from Mrs. Rabbit and her queer ideas. All at once Mrs. Duck began to slow down. She thought of the baby chicks on the floor. She remembered how Mrs. Brown had come every day with broth and carrot juice when Fluff and Duff and Muff had been sick with colds. Finally, she could stand it no longer. Back she went to Mrs. Rabbit's house.\n\nAs she hurried up the steps, she snatched off her bonnet. She thrust it into Mrs. Rabbit's hands saying, cheerily, \"Here, take this and make a nice cozy little nest for the wee baby chicks.\"\n\nWhen she arrived home, Fluff, Duff and Muff ran to meet her. \"Where is your nice new Easter bonnet?\" they asked.\n\nMrs. Duck gathered them close and told them about the baby chicks. Soon, the three ducklings were crying as if their hearts would break.\n\n\"To think of the wee chicks on the cold, hard floor!\" said Fluff.\n\n\"Such tiny helpless babies!\" sobbed Duff.\n\n\"I'd give anything I had to keep them warm!\" sniffed Muff.\n\n\"Would you have given your new Easter bonnet?\" asked Mother.\n\n\"Indeed, we would!\" the three shouted together.\n\n\"That's exactly what I did!\" Mother Duck said. Then with a gay song she began to whisk up a carrot pudding for the family dinner.\n\n- Helen Boyd\nMiss Farr left on March 8 for Brockett where she will be nurse-in-charge at the Peigan Hospital.\n\nFarewell gifts were presented to Mrs. Bibaud and Miss Cooper at the coffee hour recently.

Marion Njcotli was Miss Hall. Raggedy Ann was the patient. A shoe-box was the operating table. A pencil was the instrument.

Yes, you are right. We Indians don't know how lucky we are to have this hospital. Also, we are especially lucky to have Dr. Meltzer for our doctor, and to have all the rest of the splendid doctors and nurses and staff, here at the Hospital, to look after us and make us well!\n\n- Jack Royal\n\n\"When one door closes another opens; but we often look so long and regretfully upon the closed door that we do not see the one which has opened for us.

Lacking such assistance, we would have been unable to meet our expenses. We appreciate the interest you have taken in the past and trust that you shall continue doing so, should circumstances permit the publication of our little journal in the fall.\n\nTo you, dear children of our Mission schools, Happy Holiday----and renewal of contact through the pages of \"OUR MISSION SCHOOLS\" in the fall.\n\n[Signature]\n\nGranard\nHIS EXCELLENCY LEAVES FOR ROME\n\nWe were all happy to see His Excellency, Bishop Routhier, leave for Eastern Canada on March 3rd. He was going to Rome! He was accompanied by Rev. Father Zinet of Jossard. They are going to Rome for the General Chapter of the Oblate Fathers. They are going to elect a new Superior General, for they haven't any just now. The Chapter will take place on May 1st.\n\nWe all hope that His Excellency will have a good trip and that no harm will come upon him during his journey\u2014such will be our prayer every day.\n\nWe will pray too that the Holy Ghost will enlighten the minds of all those who are to choose the new Superior so that they may choose one according to the Will of God.\n\nMay you soon return to us, dear Bishop!\n\nMandy Willier\nGrade 8\n\nENJOYABLE READING!\n\nEvery few weeks, Sister Bernice's sister, Sister Beatrice Ann in Tacoma, Wash., sends us different kinds of Catholic Magazines. We all enjoy them very much. They are very interesting. She also sent us two story books as a gift. We are all anxious to read them. We all wish to thank Sister Beatrice Ann for these magazines and especially the two books she sent.\n\nEvelyn Tallman, Gr. 5\n\nA VALIANT MISSIONARY!\n\nOn March 4th, Father Giguere left for his long trip to Whitefish and Prairie Lakes. We felt sorry to see him go because it is a long trip and it was cold, but we were glad too, because many people who had not seen a priest since last year would be glad to see him. On his way, he would stop to say Mass in some of the Indian houses and give the Sacraments.\n\nMy! weren't the children from White Fish happy to see Father Giguere return with Father Floc'h on March 17th! They were sure to get some news of \"Home\" and they soon crowded around the Fathers all of them talking at the same time and asking questions. Father Floc'h always gives them news of their parents so the children from there are happy when they see him arrive at the Mission. Come often, Father, for you are always welcome.\n\nBertha Twin\nGrade 7\n\nA VISIT TO THE SICK\n\nMarch 8th, Father Superior left for Edmonton to bring Father Giroux to the Hospital. While Father Tessier was there, he visited the sick girls there who are from this Mission. He brought them each a box of candies and cookies from Sr. Superior. The girls must have been glad to see him and hear him laugh and joke as he always does. We were glad when he came back to give us news of our friends. We hope you will all be better soon.\n\nLona Shott\nGrade 7\nCatholic Action Posters\n\nDuring March and April we were making posters to try to show the real meaning of Easter. Some of our posters show and say that Easter is not for new styles in clothes. It is not for a merry time only too, especially when our souls are in sin. Easter means resurrection of Christ so our souls should \"rise\" from sin. If God is not in our hearts and soul we did not spend a happy Easter. We made a large poster for each hall showing how nations, families, parishes, schools and ourselves are \"dead\" in sin and must rise. We are doing our best to show and help others to live as good people.\n\nMae Wong\nGrade 6\n\nGoing to the Shop\n\nMary Ward and I went to the shop to help Brother Nicol. When we went into the shop we said good-afternoon to Brother. He told us to go upstairs. We went up and Mary sat in a rocking chair and started to rock and rock. We like to go to the shop to work with Brother.\n\nLily George\nGrade 2\n\nSpring!\n\nI like to hear the robin singing in the spring. I like to play marbles too. Some boys and girls play even on the snow.\n\nJean Marie Leboucane\nGrade 2\n\nSpring!\n\nThe snow is melting. The birds are coming back to sing for us. When we went for a walk we saw some pussy willows. We brought some home for Sister Claire. I saw a crow. The green leaves are starting to come out on the trees.\n\nJane Smith\nGrade 2\n\nArtists!\n\nWe have some nice drawings in our class about spring. Some drew birds, and others rabbits or chicks or flowers. We all made up a verse about our spring drawing. I drew a bird house on a tree and some flowers on the ground around the tree. We had lots of fun looking at the drawings and reading the verses after Sister put them up.\n\nJohn Halubowich\nGrade 6\nGOOD FRIDAY\n\nBishop Coudert said the Mass of the Presanctified on Friday morning, with Fathers Tessier and Knapen as Deacon and Sub-deacon, as they were for all the Holy Week ceremonies. The Bishop unveiled the Cross and then after the people all went to kiss it.\n\nFathers Habay, Hugourotte and Bruckert sang the Gospel of the Passion. It was very nice to hear them.\n\nIn the afternoon at 3 o'clock, the Bishop made the Way of the Cross with Frs. Tessier and Knapen on each side of him.\n\nJohn Halubowich\u2014Gr.6\nRhoda Shott\u2014Gr.5\n\nHOLY SATURDAY\n\nThe ceremonies at the Church on this day were very long. Father blessed the Easter water, new fire, and the Paschal candle. The Bishop blessed the holy oils.\n\nAfter dinner, Father Superior went all around the Mission with Brother Bedard and blessed all the rooms with the new water blessed that morning.\n\nAlice Bellerose,\nGrade 5\n\nOn Holy Saturday afternoon two of the girls who had come from the Naskon last fall were received into our Catholic religion. They were Annie and Mary Jule. Bishop Coudert, their Bishop, baptised them. We were all wishing then that we had waited until this day to be baptised! How happy the two girls looked all dressed in white. Their souls were even whiter, we know. We all prayed for these two girls so God would give them the graces at this moment to lead good lives after they leave the Mission.\n\nMandy Willier\nGrade 8\n\nFIRST COMMUNION\n\nHow happy Mary and Annie were on Easter Sunday morning, after being baptised on Saturday before, to receive Jesus into their hearts for the first time. Father Tessier gave them prayer books and beads. They went to the chapel to say their beads. I'm sure their hearts were happy.\n\nAlice Bellerose\u2014Gr.5\nEaster Sunday was a bright day. We all went to the 7:00 o'clock Mass at the Church and received Holy Communion. We came back for our breakfast and went again to the Church for the 10:00 o'clock Pontifical High Mass sung by Bishop Coudert of Whitehorse. The Church was very beautifully decorated with lilies and roses and many lights. The Bishop began the High Mass, assisted by Fathers Tessier and Knapen and 18 altar boys in different colored cassocks. It looked nice to see them all. We sang the Royal Mass and the Proper in three parts. It sounded nice and many said after that we sang well. We sang \"Christ is Risen from the Dead\" at the Offertory.\n\nFather Bruckert gave a short sermon in Cree and then the Bishop spoke in English. It was very interesting.\n\nIn the afternoon at 2:30 we had a Solemn Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament. The choir sang a nice Benediction.\n\nI think everyone was happy on this day because they had prayed much.\n\nEvelyn Tallman\nGrade 5\n\nHow surprised we were when we came back from the 7:00 o'clock Mass at the Church on Easter Sunday morning for our breakfast to see the tables so nicely decorated with baskets and flowers and candies, cereals and a nicely colored hard-boiled egg at each place. In the corner of the refectory, on a table, was a large cake\u2014big enough for the 70 girls to have a good sized piece\u2014all decorated with frosting and an Easter egg stuck into it and a big \"Happy Easter\" written in the cake. We were so anxious to taste the cake. It did not take us long to taste all these good things. We thank Sr. Superior for we know she was the \"Bunny Rabbit\" for us.\n\nAfter breakfast we went to play outside and enjoyed ourselves much until it was time for the High Mass.\n\nAt supper time, the Training School girls came to eat with us at our table. We sat by our friends and liked that.\n\nAfter supper, we went to the hall for a good picture show on the war. We surely enjoyed it very much. After the show we were all satisfied and went to bed happy.\n\nLouisa Whitehead\nEvelyn Tallman\nGrade 5\nMOVING PICTURES\n\nEvery Sunday evening we have moving pictures; some are funny and some are sad. On April 27th we had the show \"Rose of Tralee\". It was very good. Father Bruckert went to show it in Joussard and in Sturgeon Lake. We saw it again when he came back and liked it as much as the first time.\n\nThat was our last show of the year. We were very sorry to hear that and want to thank Father Bruckert for the many hours of pleasure he gave us all year with the moving pictures. We look forward to the shows for next year, Father.\n\nBetty Stevenson\nGrade 5\n\nDAY PUPILS SERVE MASS\n\nThe day pupils are beginning to serve High Mass on Sundays now. Edward Beauchamp and I have started to serve and some other boys are learning. We are very glad that we extern boys can serve. Sister Dominic Mary is teaching us how to serve. She brings us to the Church each evening after school. The Fathers and Sisters said we served well and we are glad.\n\nDuring the summer holidays we are coming to serve Mass when the Mission boys are gone home. We also serve low Mass on First Friday of each month.\n\nJackie McDermott\nGrade 5\n\nOPENING OF MONTH OF MARY\n\nWe are all glad when the month of our Heavenly Mother arrives! We honor her and pray to her in many special ways especially during this month of May. In the Church, a very nice grotto has been made and we have Benediction each evening with the recitation of the Rosary. We sing a hymn to Mary before Benediction.\n\nIn our classroom, our statue of the Blessed Mother is beautifully decorated and each day before leaving the classroom, we have our own May devotions in honor of the Blessed Virgin. We sing a hymn and then say a Memorare and invocations to Our Lady. We have a small box marked \"Flowers for Mary\" in which we drop pieces of paper in after the devotions. These slips of paper have little sacrifices marked on them that we did during the day.\n\nWe hope Mary hears our prayers and asks her Divine Son to help us, for He never refuses her anything.\n\nMandy Willier\nGrade 8\nSISTER SUPERIOR'S FEAST\n\nMay 1st was Sister Superior's feast. We all went to Mass in the Sisters' Chapel and sang the Mass for her. We offered our prayers for her too. Shortly after breakfast, she came into our hall and asked us if we wanted a holiday. We all said \"Yes!\" She then gave us all permission to buy 5\u00a2 worth of candy from the store. We were all very pleased and anxious to choose something we liked.\n\nLater the older girls went to the store about 1\u00bd miles away. We went into the hotel and bought some balloons. We had not seen any for a couple of years. Brother Nicol took the small girls to the woods to get spruce gum. We were surprised when the older girls came in late to dinner to see Father Bruckert serving the girls' dinner.\n\nIn the afternoon, we had a big game of ball with the boys. We surely had a lot of fun. Father Bruckert again served the girls' supper so that the Sisters could be with the other Sisters. We played ball for a while after supper and had Benediction when we again prayed for Sister Superior. In the evening we enjoyed ourselves in the hall playing and dancing. We were up until 9:30.\n\nWe thank Sister Superior for the nice holiday and also thank Father Bruckert for keeping us all day.\n\nMargaret Laboucan\nGrade 5\n\nNEW SUPERIOR GENERAL\n\nLast week, May 2nd, we heard the good news that Father Daschatelets had been elected Superior General of the Oblate Fathers for the whole world. He will be staying in Rome. We rejoice with the Fathers in our Missions over the good news.\n\nWe ask God's blessing upon the new Superior General and shall pray for him.\n\nLena Shott\nGrade 7\n\nSPRING WORK HAS BEGUN!\n\nMonday Brother Nicol had his garden ploughed. We were surely glad because we had some work to do in the garden. We planted five rows the same day. I go and work every morning before school. I put the water on the rows while Brother makes the other rows. The shop boys seed the garden too. Almost everybody likes to work in the gardens and we see the Sisters and boys and girls all working in a garden somewhere.\n\nLawrence Loyie\u2014Gr.5\nCatholic Action.\n\nThe elections of the officers for Catholic Action took place on March 27th for the girls\u2014That of the boys on April 1st. Each pupil was free to choose their officer. It took place in the hall, Father Serrand, Sister Superior, and the Sisters in charge of the boys and girls departments were all present. We are glad, and it goes on very well. We sure like it. It teaches us to be good\u2014to give other girls good example.\n\nANGELINE CARDINAL.\n\nWe went for a nice walk with our Teacher. We had lots of fun. We stopped at the store to buy some good things to eat. When we came back we played games and sang songs. We are very happy at Jousard.\n\nELSIE CHALIFOUX.\n\nFather Serrand gave me a nice red necklace because I came first this month in my Grade. I was very glad.

Father Serrand gave us permission to spend all afternoon with our parents. Some went home in the wagons, and some went to Jousard to have a treat with our father and mother.\n\nBERTHA WILLIER GR. VI.\n\nWe have a picture show every week in our classroom. I like the picture show very much because we learn about Health and Nature Science. I like to see the film on Co-operative Living. We like the little stories at the end. Sometimes it is about Three little pigs, Little Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk. The last one was The little Princess and the Frog. They were very nice. We thank Sister for the picture show. We write about the picture show. Fr. Serrand read the paper to us. After he was finished reading them he asked us which one was the nicest, and gave a reward to the best one.\n\nYVETTE BADGER GR. IV.\nSPRING IS HERE.\n\nWe went for a walk it was Sisters feast day. The snow is melting. Winter is sorry to leave us. Sometimes we play ball in the yard. We have lots of fun. Sometimes we dance, we play games in our yard, and we jig. Other times we help Father Serrand to carry the wood. Father gave us a treat of gum.\n\nELSIE GIROUX GR.111.\n\nBINGO PARTY.\n\nOn Thursday evening of Easter week, we had a grand Bingo party in our classroom and just think who came to see us play and gave us lovely prizes of candy. Father Giroux and Sister Superior. We were sorry that Father Serrand was busy and could not come as he was suppose to preside. We had fun and fun. I hope we shall have some more Bingos.\n\nDOROTHY BELLEROSE GR.VII.\n\nWe had a nice visit. It was good Father Giroux. He gave us lots of candy. We read for him.\n\nGEOILE M.

He said it was good.\n\nGUY GIROUX GR. 11.\n\nOUR FRIENDS AT EASTER.\n\nBefore Easter we all sent a card and letter to Father Lachance, and to the boys who are sick in Edmonton. We were glad to see our parents at Mass. I saw my grandmother but not my father because he was sick. We had lots of fun with our parents. We went to bed happy that night.\n\nANGELINE ISIDORE. Gr.111.\n\nWe have 14 Vigil Lights. There were 8 boys and there were 6 girls that bought them. We made a sacrifice.\n\nALICE OKIMAW GR.11.\nPICTURE SHOW.\n\nOn the same day that Father Giroux came back, we had a Picture Show in the afternoon. It lasted till nearly five o'clock, but we thought it was a short time, because we were so interested. The last picture was about the soldier who learned to come down in a parachute; it was thrilling.\n\nALICE WILLIER GR.VI.\n\nHOLY COMMUNION.\n\nI made my first communion on Easter day.

He went under the stone.\n\nROGER WILLIER GR.II.\n\nLET'S LAUGH.\n\nFather Serrand during the election asked: Little Girtie Chalifoux: Who do you want for a Leader?\n\nLittle Girtie: MY MOTHER.\n\nDuring Catechism Father asked: Why is there only one God.\n\nChild: Because there is enough of one...\n\nTeacher: What is the plural of goose?\n\nPupil: gooses.\n\nLittle boy, Sister, I saw a germ-carrier this morning.\n\nSister (not understanding) A germ-carrier- a fly- I hope you killed it.\n\nBoy: Oh no, we do not play during mass.\n\nToday Sister asked little Lena what size she takes for her shoes.\n\nLittle Lena said: One mile shoes.\n\nSister asked one boy what Nurse Burgess used the scale for and one boy said \"TO POUND US\".\n\nSister asked Robert Ward. Who is your father?\n\nRobert: It's not me.\n\nJackie John told a boy he had a headache on his little finger. The boy said: You cannot have a headache there, and Jackie said little bit yes, and little bit no.\n\nFather said to a girl at dinner time. Where are you going?\n\nlittle girl: N'dawi kasakiyan.\nTHE MONTH OF MAY\n\nWe are getting ready for the month of May. We are putting up an altar in our classroom. We bought some vigil lights for our Mother in heaven. We gave each child a cent to sister. We are 30 children in our classroom. With the 30 cents we bought three vigil lights. We are decorating the altar and the classroom too. We took off the Easter decorations and put up the May decorations. May is her month. Sister will light the vigil lights when we will sing our hymn. She will give us some graces and help us always. I think the altar will be nice. The Blessed Virgin will be pleased to see the altar. The nicest month is May because it is the month of our Mother. We will have a nice class in May.\n\nMARCEL WILLIER GR. IV.\n\nFather bought us some hum a tinas. He bought 12 of them. We thank Father. We played a band for Father. He said it was good, and he gave us 30 packages of gum.\n\nLEONARD PRINCE GR. II\n\nBINGO and REWARDS.\n\nWe had a bingo one Friday afternoon. It was on Sisters feast. Before we play we sang some songs, then we started to play BINGO. When we were playing Father Giroux came in with a treat of candy. He put a gladd of candies when three of the boys had Bingo. Then Father Giroux had to give three glasses of candies instead of one. Father Serrand could not come because he was busy. Sister Superior came for a few minutes to see us. I had bingo only once but Father Serrand gave us Easter eggs because we had gold stars. Sister George Wilfred and two girls from our class made some pop-corn balls. It was so good. We thank Sister George.\n\nCHARLES EDWARD GIROUX GR. IV.\n\nI am glad to be the last one to wish all our friends a HAPPY VACATION. Yes, June will come soon. We will be going home. Hip hip Hurrah....Happy Vacation to all.\n\nCECILE WILLIER GR. V.\nVISITORS FROM H.Y. LAKES\n\nFather Jal and Brother came to visit us from Hay Lakes. We were all very glad to see them. They came after our supper. The boys were all playing outside when they came. All at once the boys began to say, \"Father Jal! Father Jal!\" Then we ran to see them. Father Jal was glad to see us too. We talked to them and then ran to the attic's house to talk to them again. They stayed with us for two or three days then they made ready for the journey back to Hay Lakes. We were a bit sorry to see them go.\n\nNorman Yotemawatam Gr.V\n\nEASTER\n\nOn Easter morning we went to Church for Low Mass at 7 o'clock. Never before did we see so many people at church. It was really edifying and impressive. Large number, too, received Holy Communion. Our Risen Lord must have been very pleased to see so many people at Mass. All the boys and girls who were downstairs had to come up in the choir. It was quite packed. We sang beautiful Easter Hymns. The following day, Easter Monday we did not go to school.\n\nAlbina Adeckit Grade VI\n\nVISITING ACROSS THE RIVER\n\nOn Easter Monday Father Jean went to visit a few families across the river. Sisters Emma Marguerite and Celina went too. Also two girls. They brought their dinner with them and had dinner at Saint Gabriel's mission. From there they went on to visit some of the families. They did not visit many as the population is far apart. I am sure that the sisters and the girls enjoyed the whole day as they looked very happy when they came back. The girls enjoyed the trip very much too.\n\nAlbina Kidney Grade V\n\nPRIZE MONEY\n\nWhen we made drawings for the HEALTH CONTEST I was the lucky third winner. So I got $2.00 for my drawing. After we had signed our checks we gave them to Father and he gave us our money. Then we made out an order for Eaton's. I bought a nice belt and a mouth organ. Peter had first prize and he sent for a baseball and a camera. Joche Fournier had second so he sent for lovely braces and a nice bit. We were very glad when our parcel came.\n\nFred Ekie Gr. VI\nOUR NEW CUPBOARD\n\nWe have a new cupboard in the cellar. It very large. On one side we put all the costumes for the Entertainments. On the other side we put our tool chest and all our Woodwork. We think that it is very nice and handy too. We are very grateful to Father for all his kindness to us.\n\nFrank Casson Grade VI\n\nSisters go to St. Louis\n\nOn the second Sunday after Easter Father Jean was at His post at St. Louis Mission. It was the Easter Mass for the people on the other side of the river. Sisters Edward of Jesus, Jean Leon and Henriette went early on Sunday morning. They sang the Mass and had dinner at St. Louis. They came back in the late afternoon.\n\nGeorge Alok Grade V\n\nFATHER JEAN LEAVES FOR ST. LOUIS\n\nFather Jean left our mission to go to St. Louis across the river. He will stay there until the ice is broken. He will help the people in their spiritual needs as no one can come across the river now as it is too dangerous. Here we are on the 26th of April and the ice has not bridged at all in front of the mission. The ice is still very solid for a number of miles from here. Though the ice is not broken yet the ice has risen and very high. Many people fear a flood like the year 1932. We hope that there will not be a flood as that means much damage for all the people in the district.\n\nMary Ekie Grade V\n\nOUR CLASS\n\nIn our class, we have much more room now, as all our woodwork has been taken down with other things such as our Rhythm Band and tool box in a nice big cupboard that has been made for that purpose in the cellar. We have some new framed pictures too. Our certificate for the prize winners for the HEALTH CONTEST is also framed. We have some framed mottoes and two framed scenes with the names of the pupils who did them. We like our classroom.\n\nEVELYN ROBERT GRADE V\nOUR NEW PYROGRAPH\n\nAt last we received our long-desired pyrograph. We received it from a very generous benefactor. We are very grateful to have this electric pencil. Already we have made some very fine samples of this work. We mean to make special pieces for our Kind Principal and Superior, Rev. Father Rainville who was so kind as to get us such lovely wood to work with and work on. Sister said we would all have a try on the pyrograph.\n\nPeter Martel Gr. VI\n\nBLESSED OF THE STATUE\n\nOne day Sister Elaine received a beautiful statue of St. Theresa. It is a large statue and will be put in our hall. On April 23rd, Rev. Father Rainville, Superior was to bless the statue in the Girl's hall. The statue was a table nicely decorated with roses around the statue. Father blessed the statue. Then Father delivered a little talk about the LIFE OF ST. THERESE. It was very interesting. We listened very attentively. Then Father had finished speaking the same hymn to Saint Theresa. I think that Father loves the FLOWER OF JESUS very much too.\n\nHelen Attion Gr. de Vl\n\nOFF TO MONTREAL\n\nIn June we will be losing our dear Sisters Eustache of Rome and Joseph Napolcon. They will be going to visit their parents whom they have not seen for many years. It will be 19 years for Sister Joseph and 21 years for Sister Eustache of Rome. They really deserve a nice trip don't you after all these years of service in the Master's Vineyard. We wish them a real nice journey and hope that they will come back again to Fort Vermilion.\n\nCelestine Siowepokaham Grade V\n\nOUR LITTLE PUP\n\nOnce we had a little pup. My grandpa gave it to us when we were living up town. When we moved back to our summer home, the little pup could not come home. We took it home and tied it with a rope. But the puppy bit the rope and got away again. The little puppy went back to where we were living before.... When my Dad came home from the woods, my mother told him about the pup. So we went with my Dad in a dog sleigh to get the little dog. It was with Barbara Ann Love. We took it home in the Dog-Sled.\n\nRuth Courtereille GR V\nMONTH OF OUR LADY\n\nOn April 30th we will begin the devotions of the Month of the blessed Mother. We will go to the church every evening for Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament. We will honor our Blessed Mother by our little sacrifices and prayers said more fervently.\n\nIn the month of May we celebrate Mother's Day. We honor our earthly mother on the second Sunday. We honor them because they have made so many sacrifices for our sakes. In class we will read stories and poems and sing songs to honor our MOTHER. We will not forget to offer our Mass and Communion on that day in gratitude for what they have done for us. God loves Mothers for HE took one HIMSELF. God bless our MOTHERS.\n\nAlbin Adekat Grade VI\n\nOUR MOTHER\n\nDear Mother of God and Mother of men,\nWhat gift we received\nIn receiving You when\nThy Son on the cross,\nThou to us didst give,\nThat we may through Thee,\nForever live.\n\nThou lovest us more\nThan the world can know,\nDear Mother of God,\nGrant our love we may show\nTo THEE Who bestowest\nAll Thy tender care.\nAh! Thou keepest the promise\nThou madest HIM there.\n\nDear MOTHER of GOD, and\nMOTHER of men,\nWhat gift we received,\nIn receiving You then,\nAll His gifts to us\nThou' art bestow,\nThou art powerful Mother,\nTo Thee we must go.\n\nDear Mother of God,\nLoving Mother of men,\nBe Thou at our side\nThru' death and do thou,\nTake us to heaven,\nThere forever to be,\nWith JESUS and JOSEPH,\nAnd DEAR MOTHER with THEE.\n\nS.E.M.\nWe were very glad to hear that Father Superior bought a new gramophone for the girls. We sure enjoy it because we had an old one which was bought two or three years ago. But only one girl is named to play it and her name is Miss Loonskin. We have some nice records to play, and some girls brought some from their homes. We gave the old one to the older girls who work at the Mission. We thank our kind Father for nice gramophone he bought for us.\n\nBelle Nanotch\n\nFirst Margaret Bevill died in March. She was 75 years old. It was a very sad day for the people in the Reserve because many were related to her. She had five sons living and two daughters.\n\nWe had a Requiem Mass for her and Mr. Joseph Bigstone. They were buried on the same day so we had a double funeral service. But they did not die on the same day. They died one day after the other. After the Mass we went in the graveyard where they were buried.\n\nBefore she died, old Margaret talked to her children. Some of her sons made promises to her. She was a very good woman. She used to come to Mass on Sunday when she was able to walk. She used to come to Holy Communion every First Friday. She was a very good woman here on earth. I am sure that she is well rewarded in Heaven, May she rest in peace and pray for us.\n\nElsie Yellowknife\n\nOn the 1st of March Rev. Father Superior, Sr. Superior, Sr. Helen and Sr. Leurent left by team with Geo. Gullion. We went to the Fathers' House to say good-bye to them. Before they went Father received a telegram that Sr. Helen's mother was very ill. We felt very sad for Sister. We hope they had a good trip, and that Sister got there in time to see her mother.\n\nSister superior goes to visit her relatives also but Sister Leurent stops at Athabasca.\n\nFather Superior went to Athabasca business then by way of the bus to Athabasca and Calling Lake to visit his Mission.\n\nBelle Nanotch\n\nWINGS OF MERCY\n\nOur Post Master, Mr. Geo. Arnold was very sick in the Hospital here so they asked for a plane to take him to Edmonton. Rose Gullion had been sick a long time too so the Nurse, Miss Hannah took them both out. We were sorry to see them go. But I hope they will come back well. We all wish them good luck.\n\nRita Beauregard.\n\nMore logs for our New Church and still 200 more to be hauled across the lake.\nOLD AND NEW ARRIVALS IN NABASCA\n\nOn March 9th, we were happy to welcome back Sr. Luke back to Nabasca. She had been away to visit her mother who was very sick. She is very glad to be back again and to work among the Indians. She helps Sister Denis at the hospital.\n\nIt was on Sunday afternoon that Sister Luke arrived with Sr. Alfred-Leon. She said she is glad to be here. She will be with us on the girls' side. We hope you will like Nabasca, Sister and will stay a long time.\n\nEliza Jager\n\nCHICKENS\n\nOn March 13th Miss Hannas R.N. returned by plane from Edmonton with 118 little chickens. We are very glad to have more chickens. They were only 1 day old. Sister Cassie, who is in charge of the chickens is working very hard every day in the chicken house. We eat more eggs every day. The next day we went to see the chickens. The door was locked so we looked through the window. They were running all over. Then we came back running too.\n\nMiss Therese Gladu\n\nNEW RADIO TRANSMITTER\n\nAfter ten years of use the Radio Broadcasting Set here was not reliable even obsolete. So it was decided to ask for a new machine.\n\nThe Government Telegraph Service agreed to the demand and in February we heard that we were to receive a new set. It arrived with Miss Hannas on Mar. 15th in an Associated Airways plane piloted by Mr. Spencer Adamson. He was in the office when the machine was installed and tuned it expertly.\n\nA call was made to Calling Lake where Father Guinmont, S.J., was on mission work and he had the pleasure to hear Father Sauv\u00e9 speaking, as well as Bro. Gaucher and Miss Hannas who were in the office. As this radio is our only daily contact with civilization for the benefit of all Nabasca people we are deeply grateful for it.\n\nBertholomay Gladu\n\nSince this article was written the pilot Mr. Adams and his plane and one passenger were reported lost in the North somewhere between Edmonton and Ft. McMurray. As he had made several trips to Nabasca, we deeply regret the untimely loss of this expert airman.\n\nCALLING LAKE VISITED\n\nFor the first time since I have been in Nabasca I started on the road towards Slave Lake to go to Calling Lake Mission.\n\nThe deep snow and bad roads made this a necessity so I made a business trip to Edmonton first, then travelled from there by bus to Nabasca. This trip in a jeep was my first experience. I travelled with Mr. MacIntosh to his home where I said Mass twice.\n\nWe went on by team to Island Lake. Here I baptized five children, said Mass and performed a marriage ceremony. After visiting the 36 families there I returned to Calling Lake. About 40 persons came to Mass. There were five baptisms and one funeral service. It was a short visit but greatly appreciated by the people, as they see the missionary once a year only.\n\nI returned by bus to Driftpile where I met the Indian Agent, Mr. Landry. He decided to return\nwith me to visit our school, we left by plane on Mar.14th in the afternoon and arrived at Athabasca 40 minutes later. The trip takes 4 days with horses.\n\nB.Guimont, O.M.I.\n\n???\n\nYES? WE HAVE TONSILS TODAY???\n\nOn Mar.19th, good Dr.Riopel and Miss Parr R.N. arrived by plane to visit the children here. There were quite a lot of tonsils to be removed from the children of the Point and from here. There 14 cases in all. Miss Parr treated the eyes of 40 children. Four girls, Louise Auger, Mary O'Connell, Alice Rabbit and little Harry got nose bleeds; how to get glasses only one boy amongst us, P trick Young has to have them.\n\nDr.Riopel had a lot of work to do. He had 28 tonsils to take out, as there were 8 boys and six girls.\n\nGeorge Auger\n\n\"HAPPY FEAST FATHER SUPERIOR\"\n\nOn Mar.21st, it was the Feast Day of our Principal, Father Guimont. On the eve we had a big Display in honor of St.Benedict, his holy Patron. There were four tableaux showing scenes from St.Benedict's life. The had a pretty Ribbon Drill. The P.T.Class did some of their Exercises. The band played and we sang some songs. It was a good Display, and Father Superior and Mr.Landry, were pleased with us.\n\nIn the morning at Mass the School sang. After breakfast we all played games in the yard.\n\nAfter dinner good Brother Dumas came with the picture machine and we had the movies. We always enjoy his pictures. This time the pupils from Pt.St.Cherubs School came to the show.\n\nAfter the movies a plane came to get Mr.Landry, when he told us good-bye he said he would return with the Toasty Party. He was very pleased with his visit here.\n\nIn the evening we had many games. We had a very nice day.\n\nWe thanked Father Superior, & good Father Sauv\u00e9 for planning and helping the Feast to go well, also the Sisters who did their big share.\n\nBella Nanotch\n\nMORE DEPARTURES\n\nAfter a busy week Dr.Riopel and Miss Parr left by plane on Mar.26 taking some people from here. They were Mary Dina Auger, Paul Rabbit, Geo.Beaver and his sister Marie Jane. They had to go to be treated, and when the plane came they were ready. The plane that came in brought Samuel Auger and Rose Bigstone. Poor Rose her mother died while she was in Edmonton. We hope the others will be better soon.\n\nPhilomene Young\n\nHOLY WEEK\n\nThe Holy Week ceremonies were carried out by Father Superior alone, as Father Sauv\u00e9 was called to replace Father Campagna at the Point. He came to the hospital on Good Friday, very ill, with La Grippe.\n\nWe had a very nice Feast on Easter Sunday. There were two classes. Many people came to receive Holy Communion at the 6:30 Mass. The singing was very well. The Chapel was crowded for the High Mass at 10 o'clock. How it...\nwould please God to see as many each Sunday, especially as the nice weather is here again, and there is plenty of room in the chapel.\n\nEaster Holidays\n\nWe were very glad when Father told us that we were going home on Easter Monday and Tuesday. We took the holiday Mr. Landry gave us when he was here on Tuesday. So we all enjoyed ourselves for two days with our parents. We came back Tuesday night, as next day was washing day. I hope Father will give us more holidays. Big Thank you, Father and Mr. Landry for our nice holidays.\n\nRita Beauregard\n\nPRIZE MONEY\n\nWe made some posters of food to send to Ottawa. They sent money for those who had prizes. I had the First Prize of $5.00, John Auger had $3 and John Cat Third Prize $2.00. We were very surprised and pleased to receive the money, because we did not expect it. Now I will buy something useful. We thank our Ottawa friends.\n\nFrancis Auger\n\nCATHECHISM LESSONS\n\nWe always have Catechism twice a week on Wednesday and Friday. Father Sauv\u00e9 is teaching us. Now we are learning the Seven Sacraments. Father asks us questions one by one. I like Catechism time because Father explains so well.\n\nOne day Father said to a boy \"How many Fathers are there here in the mission?\"\n\n\"The Father, The Son and The Holy Ghost,\" said the boy.\n\nClara Gladu\n\nOn April 14th, we had a requiem high mass for the repose of the soul of Cardinal Villeneuve. We hope God heard our prayers for this venerable prelate who did so much for the Church here in Canada, and may he pray for us.\n\nHilda Auger\n\n\"ON YOUR FEET UP, AND BRING OUT THE MATS\"\n\nOn April 17th at 4 o'clock we saw two boys carrying a big bundle with Fr. Sauv\u00e9 from the warehouse. We thought right away it was the tumbling mat for training. The boys brought the mat in the Boys' Hall and they all came in to see it. It is heavy and hard. It is about 6 ft by 4 ft. Father sent to Mr. Hutton for it and he sent to Montreal for it. That is why it took so long to come.\n\nGabriel Auger\n\nLast News Bits\n\nApril 25th. Mr. Adamson, Pilot and his companion found at Little Red River. How glad we are for that.\n\nSister Superior and Sister Helen are to leave Montreal May 4th. We are so anxious to see them again. That's ALL.\nEven though the weather was not very bright yet Easter was a great feast as always. Many people came to church, it was Easter Day and many received Holy Communion. On Easter Sunday Father Sauve sang Mass because Father Broussard had flu. Father Sauve gave us a good Sermon about a little girl who used to kiss her father every night before she went to bed. One night she didn't kiss him because her father never went to church; so one evening her asked, \"Why don't you come to kiss me any more, don't you like me anymore?\" The girl said, \"You never go to church,\" as the man told her, \"I do not have to go to church to prove God that I love him.\" A little girl said, \"I do not have to kiss you good night for you to know that I love you.\" Then the father understood and he used to go to church to show God he really loved Him. We enjoyed Father's short story. Father Compagnie is well and we hope that he will stay so.\n\nElsie Schroeder\n\nFirst Holy Communion\n\nThis is good news. Jack and Lillian Anger made their first Holy Communion on Easter Sunday. They were baptized on Good Friday. We are happy for them. Lillian had a white dress and a veil. Jack had a white ribbon on his arm. I am glad they are just like us now. Many other people were there too because they came to make their Easter duties. Only a few little ones in our school did not make it yet. I made mine when I was ten years old now I am fourteen.\n\nMary Cardinal\n\nOur New Phonograph\n\nAt last we have a new phonograph in our class room. We were wishing for one a long time. We have some new records too. We'll enjoy it because there are some nice songs. Sister wrote two songs that we learned. It will be nice when we cannot play outside on cold or rainy days. Many thanks to Sister Mary Bethanie and Sister Guy's mother. We are quite happy for this lovely gift.\n\nMable McLeod\n\nBingo\n\nLast month we played Bingo. There were many nice prizes and lots of sweet stuff too. We liked it very much. I won two times only, but some won most all the time. Father Superior from Stony Point gave us some peanuts, that was a good treat. We liked them very much. Thank You Father Superior.\n\nHelon Gladu\nSickness.\n\nThere are many that were sick here with the flu. But I have never been sick. One of my sisters have been sick too, one boy died. He used to go to school here. He was sick for quite a while and died today. We are sorry but we know he will go to heaven because he suffered much, and just made his First Holy Communion. So all will pray for him.\n\nPascaline No. Lood\n\nA child returned to school from his first trip to Slave Lake.\n\nTeacher: \"What did you like best in Slave Lake?\"\n\nPupil: \"The train!!!!!!\"\n\nTeacher: \"What did you think of the train? What is it like?\"\n\nPupil: \"Just like many little houses on wheels, one running after the other.\"\n\nPut her Up\n\nI'm so glad to be able to play ball again. It is such a good sport. As soon as there was enough dry ground to stand on, we started playing. Every recess we have fun. Sometimes we have to play scrub when we are not enough. But we like to play ball anyway.\n\nJack Auger.\n\nEat Right, George! All the posters and more posters all around our class on the wall. They remind us to eat the right kind of food so we will be healthy. They are in nice bright colors. Everyone that looks at them has to read them. I try my best to eat right so I shall be strong.\n\nHelen Claude.\nA BIG SURPRISE FOR ME\n\nOne day Sister said: \"Well boys and girls, you are asked to draw a picture of what you would like to eat in a day, how you get it, and how you would like to eat it. And here is a part of the one picture I drew. I like deer meat, eggs and soup. This is just a part of the drawings. We did not write about this in the last Journal because we did not know who the winners were.\n\nOne day when Father came for the reading of the notes, he asked who do you think has the prize? They named many boys, then he called me first. I had the first prize. John Edward was called next and the second last. We were so surprised and glad. I never had a five dollar cheque in my hands before! Father told us to put our name on the back of the cheque. Almost everybody laughed at me. I am funny and they sometimes call me FUZZY.\n\nJohn Baptiste - Gr. IV.\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY\n\nOn March 11th, my little cousins were 8 years old. They are twins. Their father and mother came in the parlor and they ate their dinner with them. At four o'clock, we were looking for them but they were not in the hall. They had gone to dress for supper. The girls went for supper, but Lucy and I ate with the twins. After supper they went to see the sisters and Sister Superior gave them pictures and each a medal.\n\nIrene Mustus - Gr. IV.\n\n----IT WAS JUST TOO LUCKY---!\n\nIn the last issue of our Journal, one boy said that \"he was glad he was not a girl\". The following was handed to the typist a few days ago.\n\nNOTES OF DISTINCTION\n100% Ironers: Julie Tchowis, Rachel Tchowis, Christine Tchowis, Florestine and Iva Tchowis.\n\nCan Sew Very Well: Julie, Rachel, Christine, Florestine and Iva.\n\nCan Mend Anything: Julie, Rachel, Christine, Iva and Florestine.\n\nReal Knitting Machines: Dorothy Kiyawmew, Gertrude Sunshine, Hermine Manitos, Mary Moses, Madeleine Goodswimmer.\n\nPolite Ladies: Denise Sunshine, Mary Moses, Irene Mustus, Hermine, Mary Minnie Tchowis.\n\nPerfect Order and Neatness: Mary Moses, Julie, Rachel and her sister Lillian, and Gertrude Sunshine.\n\n1st Class Cooks: Christine, Gertrude Rachel, Julie and Iva.\n\nThe Little Girls:\nPlay Well--- Eat Well---\nPlay Well--- Sleep Well---\n\nBest Singers: Madeleine Goodswimmer, Hermine, Victoria Kiyawmew, Christine.\n\nThose who Make Fun For the Others:\nVictoria, Mary Moses, Gertrude Nora Nabow and Iva Tchowis.\n\nWe also have some who are generous for all work, and some very good wash-women -----.

BUT you will want a very good wife!!------\n\nMAKE YOUR CHOICE\n\nRachel Tchowis-VII.\nA TRIP TO CROOKED CREEK\n\nOn Good Friday, Father took Sister and me to Crooked Creek. Three girls were supposed to go but the weather was too cold. There is a nice church there and now they have nice new pews too. Brother Mathis made them. He does very good work with wood. There is also a lovely liturgical altar too. The way of the Cross is up now; it is beautiful. Father heard Confessions and afterwards preached the sermon on the death of Jesus. We made the Stations of the Cross. Many people were in the church and again Father heard Confessions while Sister rehearsed the singing for Easter Sunday. Before we took supper, we decorated the altar for Easter. And after supper we came back to the mission. I enjoyed my trip very much.\n\nHermine Manitos - Gr. IV.\n\nOUR LENT\n\nThe night when the cords were given, we gave Father money for three handsome Sr. told the day-pupils to put money in the box. She said the one that put the most, she would give something. I put some in every week and I got the present. Then she told me to give the baby a name. I called him Eugene. The boys and girls in the halls each had enough to buy babies too. So we had money for three Japanese babies. We were glad to do something during Lent, to please Jesus.\n\nFlorestine Badger\nGr. IV.\n\nDISTINCTIONS\n\nSister had taught us a little song about our cords, and Father took our prayers in the classrooms too. On the Friday before Good Friday we all went to the girls' hall after Benediction. Many of us who had our red cord got the white one. And some others got the red one. Now I am working hard to get the blue one. I would like to have it by June.\n\nDorothy Kiyawasew - IV.\nEASTER MONDAY\n\nEaster Monday was a holiday. In the morning we played after the work was finished. When we came down to the refectory at dinner-time we found little paper cups filled with nuts and candy. We thank the girls from Sacred Heart Academy in Missoula for sending us letters and things to make Easter happier.\n\nAfter dinner we dressed up in our nice dresses that Sister and some of the big girls made. They made caps to match. Then Sister took our picture. She took the boys' picture too. After Benediction Father took our picture two times, and the boys too.\n\nFlorentine Tchowis-IV.\n\nThen we came into the girls' hall and played Bingo. Everybody was there. The prizes were on the table but not wrapped. Father always calls the numbers our nice and loud. I did not get anything at the Bingo. We played until about half-past four. We had a nice time.\n\nGenevieve Mitchell- IV.\n\nAfter the Bingo, we girls prepared the table for supper. When the boys came they were surprised. The table looked very nice. It was nice around each plate. There was an Easter egg, in an egg cup, our dessert, a glass of soft drink and a little paper cup filled with nuts and candies. I was shy a little bit because the boys were there, and they put me next to Father Roue. I ate just the same.\n\nJulie Tchowis- GR.V\n\nEASTER FROLIC\n\nOn Easter Sunday morning, we went to Holy Communion. Quite a few people came. We sang hymns in both Cree and English. They were nice Easter Hymns. At the High Mass the little boys and girls were down stairs, but many people were coming into the church. So at last it got full and the small ones had to come upstairs. Fr. Roue preached in two languages Cree and English, but I understood the Cree better.\n\nDavid Nabew - Gr. V.\n\nEASTER WEATHER\n\nThis year Easter was two weeks earlier than last year. It was colder too than last year. It snowed during Holy Week and on Easter Sunday it snowed again. So we didn't have much time to play outside. But now we are having good weather. It was almost \"Merry Christmas\" again!\n\nMax Papastisis-Gr.V\n\"What I thought about the supper\"\n\nWe five officers had our supper with Father in the girls' hall, with the girls. They prepared the tables. We had cold meat and mashed potatoes with tomatoes, peas, buns, Easter eggs, jam, apples, biscuits and paper cups filled with peanuts and candy. For dessert there was real gelatin eggs in golden gelatine. I was shy, but I knew where to put all these things!!!\n\nGabriel Kiyawasew - GR. VII\n\nI was the godfather for my little niece, my sister Mary's baby. They called her Eileen Dorothy. It was born on March 11th. That was the second time I was a godfather.\n\nVirginia Sotseau will be married to Modeste L'Hirondelle soon. They have been called off twice already in the church.\n\nFelix Harvey - VII.\n\nMy brother went home with Fr. Roue to have my little brother baptized. They called him Charles Edward. My mother was very sick. I prayed for her. My little brother died not long after he was baptized. I know he is in heaven. On April 8th, I went to the funeral and I am glad that my mother is getting better. I was so glad to see her when she came here.\n\nVictoria Kiyawasew - IV.\n\nMy father died on 24th of March. He had been sick for a long time and he could not hear very well. Since he was sick, Denise and I went to see him quite often. He was getting worse. About two weeks before he died, we went to see him again. Father took us and some other girls went too. He was buried just before Holy Week. I was glad I was able to give Father a Mass stipend for my dear father. I pray for him that he will go to heaven.\n\nGertrude Sunshine - GR. V\n\nI am a godmother too. About two weeks ago my little son was baptized. He was named Nelson Peter. I was glad that they let me be godmother.\n\nMary Moses - Gr. IV.\n\nA WELCOME PLACE\n\nFather Alice had been sick for a long time and after a while he said he would go to Edmonton to see a doctor. He was in the hospital for quite a long time. He is better now and is back here with us. We were glad when he came back. He is old but he does much work at the Mission. He knows lots about the engines. He always preaches to us in Cree, and we like that. I think he is glad to be back at Sturgeon Lake again and away from the hospital.\n\nMary Moses - Gr. IV.\n\nLONG LIVE OUR GOOD MISSIONARIES\n\nIN THE MINDS AND HEARTS OF ALL\nIN HOLLAND\n\nWe were studying about Holland in class. Sister read the book called \"The Silver Beatles\" to us. We enjoyed it very much and we were anxious to know who would win the race. We were glad that Gretel did. I didn't know before that the Netherlands are below the sea and that they grow bulbs such as daffodils, narcissi, and tulips there. That they also hang pin-cushions on the door when a baby is born, a red one for the boys and a blue one for the girls.\n\nWe also learned some memory work about the storks. The Dutch choose must look very queer. We liked that very much.\n\nHoward C. pot - V.\n\nWORK ... WORK\n\nWe work on Exhibition things while the boys are doing woodwork on Wednesday afternoons. We finished some of them already. I embroidered a pair of pillow cases and I knitted some stockings. Many girls have their badges for knitting, sewing and housekeeping. Some of us have our first year badge for cooking. I have the first and second year badges for housekeeping and sewing and a first year badge for cooking and knitting. I like to do those things better than going to school.\n\nIva Tchowis - Gr. VII.\n\n--- AND THE BOYS!\n\nWe do our woodwork in the class. I like to make something of wood. Five boys have finished their tables. My brother brought his table home. I am making a wash-stand for my home. Right now some of the boys are making small things because there is nearly no lumber left. Mr. Lindry said he was going to send some and now the ponds are dry, we hope it will come.\n\nGeorge Goodswimmer - VI.\n\nWhen the time is almost up and we are getting tired, we make little toy guns and swords, or something else how we want cannons. We use spoons, little rubber inside with a little stick to wind it. On the other side we put a round piece of hide and a short stick to wind it. It will go, very much, with it in my hand.\n\nMarcel Kiyawasew - IV.\nANOTHER ELEPHANT SURPRISE\n\nAt the end of April we were surprised to see four Fathers come here. One we were very glad to see was Fr. Bruckert from Grouard because he always runs the picture machine. So we had a show that night. I found one so funny. There was a man who had a fur skin from a real monkey and when he put it on he looked like a real one. After he got in the taxi he dressed up in this suit. He scared the man who was driving the car. He got so scared that he made a hole in the top of the car, and his head was sticking through! The car was going by itself in the street or on the sidewalk. I laughed very much. We were glad they came because it was a long time since we saw a show. Fr. got a big \"Thank You\" from us too.\n\nChristine Tchowmis - VI\n\nEXPECTING VISITORS\n\nWe are helping to wax and shine and now we know. They told us some Sisters are coming. They are Mother Provincial and Sr. Egbert and another Sister. I hope they will like it here.\n\nEvelyn Capot - GR. III\n\nIn the show was a horse. It did some funny things, but the man who bought it was funny too. After a while the owner wanted it to run in a race. I liked this part of the show the best of all. I like horses very much and it is easy for me to draw horses. This is the picture that I drew because I liked the race, it was exciting.\n\nPeter Tchowmis - VI\n\nThe Rev. Frs. Serreand, Tessier, and Bruckert took advantage while here of having a meeting with Fr. Roue and the Personnel of the Mission, touching on Catholic Action as being carried on in these three Mission.\nFRIEND SUBSCRIBERS\n\nEPISCOPAL CORPORATION ------------------ MOLENNAN\nREV. C.

Blind River, in the Massey Arena, the boys from the Garnier Residential School emerged victorious in a hard fought game. This victory brought the Juvenile Championship of the North Shore and the right to advance into the District playoffs.\n\nThe ice on the Massey rink was fast and the large crowd in attendance saw a good game. Both teams were in fine form for the final meeting. Previously in league games Garnier had beaten Blind River but in the playoffs both teams were eager to win or catch up. The first period was not long under way when Maxie took a neat pass from Frankie to score for Garnier. Half time rounded off the same period. Maxie again assisted by Frankie beat the Blind River goalie for another goal ending the first half 3-0 for Garnier. The Black and White first line completely dominated the period and only stellar defense work kept down the score.\n\nThe second period was much more eventful than the C.Y.O. having moved around the goal. The Blind River boys are a scrappy, determined little team. They scored two goals in this period. Then came the rest. The period after the first line had rested. Adam scored with one of his long hard shots and the period ended with a 5-2 lead for Garnier. The defense on both teams played brilliantly and stopped many goals.\n\nThe third period opened up with a tremendous burst of speed on the part of both teams. Frankie broke away on a clean run to put Garnier in the lead 5-2. The C.Y.O. went out and at least tie the score and only fast back check-\n\ning and steady goal-tending kept them out. Near the end of the period Blind River rolled the puck out of a scramble in front of the goal and hit the net to make it 5-3.\n\n(Continued on page 4)\nSOCIAL HI-LIGHTS\n\nSaturday, March 13, the 16teeners Club held its St. Patrick's dance and card party. The School Recreation Hall was tastefully decorated in green by veteran decorator Julius Neganigig, assisted by Cecil and Donald King. Twenty-five young ladies from St. Joseph's Residential School were the guests. One of the boys, John Buzzard, had said, \"Where do the girls find the time to fix up their hair in all those fancy hair-dos?\"\n\nWith a poise and a gracefulness that spoke of much practise some of the couples merrily tripped through the figures of the square dance. Others seemed slightly confused but followed the good rule of square dancing \"when in doubt, swing your partner.\" Henry Pelletier at the piano was the one man orchestra for the fox trots. A few of the boys seemed to have a little trouble with the fox trots and kept looking constantly at the floor to see where their feet were going. However, none of the girls seemed to be limping after the dancing.\n\nThe Wall-flowers and the Wallflowerettes played cards and darts. The games varying with the skill and the inclinations of the players. One charming guest after a dance sat down at a card table occupied by three boys, and asked them, \"What game are you playing?\" The answer shocked her for a minute. \"Spanish,\" she swallowed bravely and said, \"How do you play it?\" It was just another name for Crazy Eights. The rather offensive name of Studhro is an importation from Western Canada.\n\nLunch was served in the Boys' Refectory. Irishmen like O'Belleau, O'Connell, Mr. and Mrs. P. Peck and colleagues like Rita O'Chibbey and Violet Shannon O'Cooper agreed that it was one of the most enjoyable parties of the year. St. Patrick always seems to be ready to share the gaiety of the Irish on his feast day. Special guests were Miss M. S. Solomon, Mr. and Mrs. W. McGrath, Miss M. Whalen, Miss H. Lacey and Miss Dillon.\n\n(Continued from page 3)\n\nIN THE RING\n\nto see him fall flat on his back as he came out of a clinch in the first round. He rose to his feet at the count of seven. The cheering grew louder as he landed some heavy right to the body of head of Pascoza. It was evident however that he was not in condition to carry off the fight and was carrying on through sheer will power. Announcer Mr. Sammon wisely stopped the fight and said that there would be no decision.\n\nFather E. M. Skillen, the referee for the evening, announcer Mr. J. Sammon and the two judges, Mr. F. M. Bishop and Mr. M. Feick are to be complimented on the efficient handling of the bout. Credit also goes to promoters Jack Delerbo of the Soo, Father Mayhew of Batchawana, Father Theriault of Sudbury and Father Rushman of Garnier for a successful boxing card.\n\nGarnier Wins Regional Title\n\n(Continued from page 1)\n\nGarnier deserved their win as they have consistently beat Blind River and were the smoothest team. The only threat to first place lead by Franche Commanda deserved all the praise it has received all season. Mr. A. St. Denis of Spanish and Mr. R. Shamas of Blind River very capably handled the refereeing chores. Mr. W. McGrath and Mr. E. Lapointe were timekeepers.\n\nGarnier Residential School\u2014J. Neganigig, E. Fox, R. Ryce, C. Trudeau, F.

Piercy sent new science equipment to the senior class. Lena Ahern-Kew and Mary Tinsley put away our $90.00 gift in the new cupboard with glass doors made by Brother Lefebvre. The pupils are grateful for both gifts.\n\nUnluckily the doors are locked or I would try some experiments myself. I know quite a lot about magnets because I was a Nosy-Nose when Gr. VIII booked its needlework morning. Alfred Petit lost a square needle so he took the magnet to look for it. He picked up two thumb tacks but he did not find the needle because it was inside the skate he was bending. I'm going to keep my eyes and ears open when Sister shows the big ones what to do with all that equipment.\n\nOn Saturday, Mr. Piercy bought 10 bricks of Adereza cement and Mr. Yeo who were at the Ile aux Ormes H.S., Co-Op were extremely interested in the opaque projector used by Miss Gaynor for demonstration purposes. The group proceeded to visit the boys' north dance floor where they saw the grade II & III classrooms, the gymnasium hall, the boys' dormitory and their splendid playroom. Miss Gaynor and Mr. Yeo were shown the hospital ward, X-ray and sterilization rooms, the evening of 14 boys running from 8:30 to 10:30. Nobody missed school in February. There were 61 days. Sr. Albert while the others climbed aboard the S.N.Y. once more piloted by Lefty McLeod and Bill Horly who brought them safely to Buffalo Narrows the next stopover in their tour of the Northern Schools.\n\nSCHOOL INSPECTED\n\nJanuary 19 brought to Ile aux Ormes Mt. C.H. Piercy, adults sponsor of the Northern Education Branch, Mr. Wray, principal of the Ile aux Ormes Public School, Hesitation Hill, 10 o'clock in the morning. Mr. Piercy, Miss Gaynor and Mr. Yeo arrived with a camera, (the children are still working during which proceedings) visited the class rooms. The rest of the afternoon was spent in the Special Class where Miss Gaynor observed Brandy for the first year. The Basic English class was visited by Sr. Dr. P. Laviole put in appearance in the course of the pillar was pulling the two ends of the large driving. We brought some blankets along so that we could see a number of educational films. Boys were cold, some were brought by Mr. Alain with such topics as super stars of the Calgary Stampede, Claire Maurice, III Princess Elizabeth, and many others. Either the best of servants or the worse of masters.\"\n\n100% ATTENDANCE\n\nSr. Brady opened the classes of 14 boys running from 8:30 to 10:30. Sister Lapointe was glad because our class was so good. So was our teacher Sr. Levesque. -Irene Daigle, III.\n\nSLEIGH RIDE\n\nOn January 25, we went for a sleigh ride. Sr. P. Gau- dard and the girls and boys gathered there to watch the lesson come to conclusion that basic English was valuable in correcting grammatical errors and that it should be adapted to suit individual needs. Sr. P. Gaudard and Sr. L. Fortin with the boys. A cake was prepared for us. We had lots of fun. After the class, a large driving. We brought some blankets along so that we could see a number of educational films. Boys were cold, some were brought by Mr. Alain with such topics as super stars of the Calgary Stampede, Claire Maurice, III Princess Elizabeth, and many others. Either the best of servants or the worse of masters.\"\nISLANDERS UNBUSHED\n\nOn Jan 21, Mr. WATT, H.B.C. Manager, flew out in a chartered plane to Winnipeg, on business. During his 2 week's absence, Mary Ahenakew was substitute manager and her sister Savage (Mrs. L. Belanger) clerked in her place.\n\nMr. Watt must have made a good deal\u2014or mixed pleasure and profit in the right proportions\u2014judging by the broad smile he gave everyone on his return. Of course, back to the bush is a pleasant experience in itself, when it also means, back home!\n\nOn Jan. 31, Mr. M. MARION, M.L.A., and his wife, left by snowmobile for Meadowlake\u2014thence to Regina for the provincial session. Meanwhile Mr. A. Ahenakew is manager of the store, Mr. N. Mawson keeps the house and Tim, the dog. Pete Edson runs the snowmobile.\n\nOn Valentine's Day, Mr. Marion motored from Regina to Ile a la Crosse. Mr. Sanderson, bank Mgr. at Meadowlake accompanied him on this overnight visit. All the Islanders are keeping their radios tuned on for fear of missing their MEMBER when he goes on the air.\n\nThe mail plane of Feb. 6 unbushed three more of our Islanders: Mrs. O.B. McNEIL, needed dental care. She made a week of it in Prince Albert. Mrs. P. LAVOIE planned on getting glasses, talking to her heart's content to \"Wange\" Miss Russell, and visiting an elderly sister living out of town. It took two weeks to accomplish the threefold purpose. Baby Rodrigue, though left in the good care of Annie Bouvier, sorely missed his adopted \"Mummy\".\n\nMARY TUNSTEAD interrupted her classes to meet her dad in P.A. and take a trip to Victoria, B.C. with a stop-over in Edmonton, Alta., to visit relatives. She returned three weeks later with a new winter coat, a piano (on the way) and a hoard of new experiences which are an education in itself.\n\nCst. DON MAWER boarded the same plane with a prisoner three suitcases and high hopes of obtaining a holiday to go home to Medicine Hat. He did and is evidently stretching it to the limit\u2014or was he afraid of being \"catched\" on Feb. 29?\n\nFeb. 28, Mr. E. Benoit left for Yellowknife, on business. Till he returns, Mrs. Benoit, efficiency personified, is doing a man's work and a woman's besides, to keep the hotel open to all the truck drivers, plane passengers, and the Islanders who drop in for a cup of coffee or a meal. Mr. Pete Edson keeps the pool room and does the odd jobs. In her spare time, Mrs. Benoit embroiders\u2014you should see the beautiful bedspread she just made!\n\nBUSINESS UNUSUAL\n\nThe first months of the New Year brought its quota of inspectors who find a welcome as hearty as any other guest in Ile a la Crosse.\n\nJan. 15: Mr. W.J. COBE of Winnipeg, came with the Carter trucks and started a tour of inspection of the H.B.C. posts in the vicinity. After 2 days here, he left for Pachuanak by snowmobile. On the 18th, a chartered plane flew him North then back to the Narrows. On the 24th he alighted in Ile a la Crosse, stayed overnight then went on to Beauval, but not before sending his address, a greenback to Island Breezes with a request to be put on the mailing list.\n\nMr. BURGESS motored all the way from Prince Albert in a \"coupe\"\u2014a rarity on the island (the vehicle, not the passengers.) Mr. Burgess doles out Mothers' Allowances if investigations prove satisfactory.\n\nJan 29: Mrs. BACKUS, hairdresser from Meadowlake, after a stay at Buffalo N. was in with the mail plane to pretty up the girls of the Island at the rate of $7.50 for a permanent and $10.50 for a cold wave. The boys think that she did a fair job of the dark beauties.\n\nFinally, the R.C.M.P. plane brought in Asst. Commissioner C.E. REVETT-CARNAC, divisional C.O. for Sask. He came for ordinary inspection, put in a few social calls, then flew out with we know not what up his sleeve. Cst. Don is coming back and the Corporal is in high humor, since\u2014that's all we need to know.\n\nISLANDERS ON THE MOVE\n\nJan 12: Mrs. A. AHENAKEW accompanied by Mrs. McDonald went to the Narrows to visit relatives. The former returned 12 days later by plane. On the 29th she went to Pachuanak to visit her sons and daughters. Jean, Sheila and Lena Ahenakew also went to Pachuanak during February.\n\nJan. 21: Mrs. P. LAVOIE went to Deep River to visit Mrs. Walcer. Five days later, the guest became hostess, for Mrs. Walcer was in Ile a la Crosse for supplies and a \"break\" from the drudgery of the mink ranch.\n\nCont'd on p. 6\nTHE NURSES' SHARE\n\n\"What's that? three operations supervised the patient after, gave the intravenous wash and tidied up the mess in the running, well-staffed hospital\u2014while you outsiders in smoothly would have been inaccessible to the boarding school of 155 children and staff\u2014which is another of her responsibilities.\n\nOh yes! there are no terms, no student nurses, no nurses' aids, no hours, and very often NO DOCTOR who on Jan. 18th by the ambulance prevented the flight. So Doc was faced with an emergency which he handled as efficient as any top surgeon.\n\nThe first two months of 1948 registered nine (nine) births: 2 baby girls and 7 boys, including a set of twins.\n\nJulien and Emilia were born Jan. 10 (during Doctor's absence) to Mrs. J. PIMAPISKUS of Lance Lake.\n\nThe other newcomers are:\n\nIlle a la Croise: Rose, born Jan. 3, to Mrs. Charles Lari\u00e9re.\n\nChacoma: Marguerite, born Jan. 5 to Mrs. M.J. McCallum.\n\nBuffalo Harrows: Michel Lawrence born Jan. 23, to Mrs. Joseph Petit.\n\nCelestin, born Jan. 31, to Mr. George McKay.\n\nBeaulac of Buffalo Harrows, after being hospitalized here nearly two months, was flown out in the ambulance plane to Prince Albert. Later, he was removed to the Saskatoon clinic and finally transferred to St. Paul's Hospital.\n\nThe stork announced heavy bookings for March.\n\nOPERATIONS\n\nDr. P. Laviole performed 5 major operations in January. All were successful.\n\nNEW MEMBERS\n\nThe first two months of 1948 registered nine (nine) births: 2 baby girls and 7 boys, including a set of twins.\n\nJulien and Emilia were born Jan. 10 (during Doctor's absence) to Mrs. J.

At a few days interval in January, four school children had stitches or hooks on legs, hands or head. But don't forget, you are the ANESTHETIST, and there is plenty to keep you busy until the operation at 10 o'clock.\n\nOr had you been the lone day nurse, (Sr. G. Lapointe) you would have had to rush through the morning routine, prepare the patient for the badly cut in retrieving a falling butcher knife. Finally, Sr. Superior put in 3 stitches to sew Jonas Paver's hand.\n\nOr find a substitute to answer the bells and the out-patients during your absence as FLOOR-MAKER.\n\nOr would you rather have been ST.

Lavoie has been on the move as much as the police. On the 12th he was on call at Elie Lake. On the 24th he took the plane to North Battleford. Feb. 10 found him at Pine River and three days later he set out for North Battleford. Feb. 25, Doctor was on a sick call in Beauval, and on the 26th, he had retraced his steps and moved on to Burt- on. Mrs. Michel his steps and moved on to Bur- ton.

If you haven't, here it is:\n\nA little girl and her mother once lived in a small village and were very poor. One day while walking in the woods, they came across a kind old lady who gave them a magic pot which filled itself with sweet porridge. All that one had to do was to say \"Wook little pot, cook.\" When the pot was filled, the words \"Stop, little pot, stop,\" brought an end to the porridge making.\n\nOne day the little girl went to visit a friend in the village and her mother went with her. She said, \"Cook, little pot, cook,\" and the pot filled with porridge. But alas she could not think of the right words to stop it so porridge and more porridge. Soon the little cottage was filled with porridge it ran out the door and into the village. It ran in streams down the streets and into the houses. Finally it reached the house where the little girl was visiting. She hurried home and cried, \"Stop, stop, stop.\"\n\nIn Memoriam\n\nAntoinette Pavel, first came to school in September, 1942. She was 6 years old and very shy, quiet, lovely child. She had a mind of her own and from her teacher was taught to control a quick temper. A word glinted to quiet her and after that she used her little winning ways to make one forget what she had done.\n\nDuring the school year 1946-47, Antoinette seemed to be ailing. When the 150 school children were A-hayed, it was found that she entered the Prince Albert San. Last fall Mr. and Mrs. Pavel visited their daughter. They did not know it was to be the last time. On January 28, 1948, Sr. Weber, the nurse from Portage la Loche, visited Antoinette who was slowly dying. On January 23, a telegram from the San announced the sad news of her death.\n\nI learned about this tale through a friend of mine. I would mind looking through my telescope myself.\n\nGr. V.\nHundreds of years back when the earth was very young, \"Wissakitchak\" suddenly made up his mind to put into existence the first man of the earth. It was a serious decision. True, he had made the trees and the plants and the animals in the woods. However, this was different, a completely strange process. But Wissakitchak was wise and full of hope. Then again, he had been by himself so long. The earth seemed so sad. So Wissakitchak said, \"I will make man.\"\n\nHe was slow at first in getting about it. And long after he had put together all the necessary materials,\u2014an oven, fire and a great mass of sticky substance like powder. Still, he was at a loss as to what to do. It may be that at this point he was turning over in his mind the happy thought of making man seem physically like himself. Would it be for the good? Or would it be a foolish act for which he would have regrets in the future?\n\nIn the end, he made his decision. Man was going to be like him. He gave the substance, the form of his body, the same look on the face, the same eyes, and nose, and ears. Then he put the thing into the oven. And he said, \"Now I will see what comes out of this.\"\n\nBecause he had no experience at all about such things, he did not get the thing out of the oven quick enough. When he did so, he saw much to his disgust that it was completely burned. It was black like coal. This was the first black man.\n\nWas this his reward for all the trouble he had gone through? But Wissakitchak's purpose was strong; he was slow to give up.\n\nSo he made another attempt and he said, \"I will not overdoo it this time.\"\n\nHe went through the same process again, taking care that the fire was low. This time, though, the waiting was too short. He did not give time enough before taking the substance from the oven. Missakitchak took one look at the thing before him, and he saw that it was again the sort of thing he did not have in mind. This was a poor picture of him, a form white as paste, altogether underdone. This was the first white man.\n\nThe second error seemed to give Wissakitchak more hope than doubt. Now he had the very thing he did not have before\u2014experience. Knowledge had come to him the hard way. Now more than ever, he had a great desire to make another attempt.\n\n\"There will be no error this time,\" he said seriously.\n\nHe went about the process again with great care. He saw to it that the fire was not very high. He made certain that he took the form out of the oven at the right time. All these things he did.\n\nHe took one look at the completed form and a smile came on his face like sunlight. This was his idea of man, not very white, not so black, but with the color of a warm shade of brown. This was the first brown man. For him Wissakitchak had a smile and a feeling of love.\n\n\"Don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today\u2014By tomorrow there may be a law against it.\"\nELEVENTH EDITION\n\nCHARLES CAMSELL\nINDIAN HOSPITAL\nEDMONTON, ALTA.\n\nAPRIL 15\n1948\nPAGE\n\nPassing the Good Word\nH.

You know that the Nurses and people who look after you wear masks and gowns to protect them when they are working near you. Even these precautions are not enough if you are careless.\n\nYou have learned, too, that the Tuberculosis germs do not like to live where it is clean and bright; they much prefer to get into some dark dirty corner where they won't be disturbed and can grow and multiply rapidly. Do you remember the story about \"Johnny T.B.\" in the February \"Arrow\"? He said that he just couldn't stand sunlight\u2014which is very true.\n\nThe most important thing that you have learned though, is that if you are given proper care, good food, lots of rest and good treatment, Tuberculosis can be stopped, and you can be made well to go home and live a normal, happy life.\n\nNow I want you to do something\u2014not for yourselves this time, but for those you love\u2014your relatives and friends. They haven't had the chance to learn all the things you have learned about Tuberculosis. You can teach them. You can tell them how to protect themselves from getting the disease. You can tell them how they can find out whether they have any disease\u2014by having X-rays taken even when they feel quite well. You can tell them how much easier it is to cure someone who has only a little disease than it is to help someone who has waited until he is really sick before he asks for help. You can tell them what can be done, and what is being done to stamp out this awful disease which kills about 2,000 Indians every year.\nPassing on the Good Word\n\nWhilst you have been in this hospital, you have learned many things - partly from these and other short letters that have been written for you, and partly from the Doctors and Nurses who look after you, and from just being here.\n\nYou have been told how Tuberculosis is spread from one person to another, and how if the person with the disease is careless about how he coughs and how he disposes of his sputum, the danger of giving his disease to someone else is great.

The fewer the people who get the disease the fewer there are to pass it on to others, and some day we shall beat \"Johnny T.B.\"\n\nPass on the good word, then \u2014 to your families and friends. Write a letter to them and send them your \"Arrow\". In every way you can think of, do your part to stop this terrible disease from spreading.\n\nH.

Porth\n\nAs most of you here know, I spent the month of February at the Coqualeetza Indian Hospital. It was a very interesting month to me, seeing new places and making new friends. Perhaps I can give you a few of my impressions gained during that month.\n\nCoqualeetza is a beautiful name and from the time I first heard it several years ago I have always wanted to see this, as it were, \"Garden of Eden\". Although the time of the year was perhaps a little unfortunate, February can be cold even on the Pacific Coast, nevertheless all the beauty was there to be seen.\n\nThe Coqualeetza Indian Hospital is located at Sardis, B.C., a few miles from Chilliwack and only sixty miles from that great metropolis, Vancouver. It lies in the Fraser River Valley and a more beautiful spot would be hard to find. There are snow-capped mountains all around, not too close and not too far. There are evergreens everywhere and flowers, too, even in February. As Indian lore will have it, long before the white man stepped on this continent the inland Pacific Indians trekked yearly to the seas and one of their stopping places was Coqualeetza. It was their \"place of cleansing\" and resting place before the final lap to the seas.\n\nThere is a large park in front of the Hospital - grass, trees and flowers. The grass, too, at this time of year is green, which is unusual to prairie eyes. The building is of brick, three stories high with climbers all over the front. The driveway makes a long graceful arc through this sea of green.\n\nDoctor W.S. Barclay, who met me at the station, is the Medical Superintendent of the Coqualeetza Indian Hospital. Perhaps you will remember him if I tell you he wrote the little story about Peter, a little Indian boy, and the germ that causes Tuberculosis. If you haven't read it I would strongly advise you to do so. It was published in the February issue of the Arrow. Doctor Barclay is a tall and kindly man but nevertheless strict when it comes to Tuberculosis.\n\nAs I should have perhaps mentioned sooner, the Coqualeetza Indian Hospital, like the Charles Camsell, is a treatment centre for Tuberculosis. Here, Indian boys and girls from the southern parts of British Columbia are brought to be treated for that dread disease.\nTHE COQUALEETZA INDIAN HOSPITAL\n(Continued)\n\nLike here, the mainstay of all treatment is rest, rest and more rest. It is surprising what a simple thing like rest can do to a tough customer like the Tubercle Bacillus. He just doesn't like it and pines away and gradually dies in spite of himself.\n\nBesides bed rest, pneumothorax and pneumoperitoneum treatment is carried on at the Coqualeetza. Rest periods are insisted on and are much similar to the ones here at the Camsell. A great deal of Vocational Training is carried on and I was fortunate to bring away several small totem poles, made by the patients, as souvenirs of my stay at the Coqualeetza. These will always remind me of a very pleasant month spent at the Coqualeetza Indian Hospital and of the many friends I made and of many pleasant memories.\n\nBLACKFOOT INDIAN HOCKEY TEAM\n\nThe Blackfoot Indian Hockey Team consisting of all Indians played in a Hockey League composed of local teams: Arrowood, Carceland, Gleichen and Blackfoot Indian. The Blackfoot team did not lose a single game and the following are the results of the games played:\n\nBlackfoot vs Arrowood 8-3  Blackfoot vs Bassano 8-3\nBlackfoot vs Carceland 4-3  Blackfoot vs Gleichen 6-4\nBlackfoot vs Carceland 7-4  (Overtime)\nBlackfoot vs Gleichen 4-4  Blackfoot vs Gleichen 6-2\nBlackfoot vs Arrowood 11-5  Blackfoot vs Gleichen 3-2\n\nThe Blackfoot Hockey Team consisted of the following players:\n\nMoses Maguire  Mark Wolfleg  James Young\nJames Waterchief  Cecil Crowfoot  Frances Big Tobacco\nPhil Backfat  Charles McMaster  Levitt McMaster\nWeyman McMaster  Percy Yellowfly  Ernie Yellowfly\n\nThe team was managed and master-minded by Howard McMaster and Teddy Yellowfly. The local interest between Gleichen Town Team and the Blackfoot developed into real rivalry but good sporting spirit predominated all the games. To win eight games out of nine hockey games and tie the other one is an exceptionally good record. It is hoped that the team will be together for next season and that our worthy manager, Howard McMaster is out of the Camsell Hospital and back on his job and looking after the Blackfoot Hockey Team.\n\nW.P.B. Pugh, Supt.,\nBlackfoot Indian Ag.,\nGleichen, Alta.\nLast fall during the visit of the Hon. Paul Martin, Minister of National Health and Welfare and Dr. P. E. Moore, Director of Indian Health Services, it was arranged that a separate Protestant chapel should be provided in the Charles Camsell Indian Hospital. This generous gesture on the part of the federal government has been greatly appreciated by the chaplains, the members of the staff and the patients in the hospital. The accommodation being provided, the Protestant adherents were given the responsibility of furnishing the chapel. This was done largely by appeals to the friends of the hospital and others interested. The following gifts give some indication of the interest created in furnishing the chapel. Other donations have been promised for specific purposes. Our sincere thanks and appreciation are due all those who have assisted in creating a beautiful little chapel and thus enhancing the worshipful atmosphere which is necessary in our services.\n\nThe following donations so far have been received:\n\n- Mr. A.

Pauline Johnson (Tekahionwake)\n\nE. Pauline Johnson (Tekahionwake) was the youngest child born to G.H.M. Johnson, Head Chief of the Six Nations Indians, and his wife, Emily S. Howells, a lady of pure English parentage.\n\nChief Johnson was a descendant of one of the fifty noble families which composed the first historical Confederation. This was known at that time as the Brotherhood of the Five Nations. Since early times these Indians had been famed for their loyalty to the British Crown and for this fealty had been given the magnificent lands bordering on the Grand River in the County of Brant, Ontario, and on which the tribes still live. It was here, on her father's estate, \"Chiefswood\" that Pauline was born.\n\nThis little Indian girl had an intense love of poetry, and even before she could write composed many childish jingles about her pet dogs and cats. One time when she was just four a friend of her father's was going to the city. When he asked her what he could bring her for a present she said, \"Verses, please.\" Her education was not extensive\u2014a governess for two years at home, three years in an Indian school half a mile from home and two years in a school in Brantford.\n\nIn 1892 she became famous overnight after reciting \"A Cry from an Indian Wife\" at an evening of Canadian Authors in Toronto. Two weeks later Frank Yeigh arranged for her to give an evening of her poems. For this she composed the poem by which she is best known, \"The Song My Paddle Sings\". That evening, because she was nervous and because she had had scarcely time to memorize her new poem, she forgot her lines. But she did not lose her self-control and smilingly gave another poem.\n\nThen a series of recitals were arranged for her across Canada in order that she might make enough money to go to England to have her poems published. This she was able to do just two years later. Here she made many good friends and was asked to give recitals in the drawing rooms of many diplomats, critics and nobility.\n\nShe had a very full and interesting life. She made other professional trips to England. She went to Newfoundland and the United States. She crossed the Rocky Mountains nineteen times and appeared as a public entertainer in every city and town between Halifax and Vancouver. Then she decided to settle down and devote her life to literature. However, shortly after she settled in Vancouver her health completely broke down.\nPauline Johnson, during her sixteen years of travelling, had many interesting experiences. She had driven up the old Battleford trail before the railroad went through, and across into British Columbia in the romantic days of the early pioneers, and once she took an 850-mile drive up the Cariboo trail to the gold-fields. She was an ardent canoeist and ran many strange rivers, crossed many a lonely lake, and camped in many an unfrequented place. These venturesome trips she took from her inherent love of nature and of adventure.\n\nShe died on March 7, 1913, and her ashes were scattered, as she had requested, from Siwash Rock in Stanley Park, the spot she loved so well. Canada will cherish her memory more and more as the years go by for of all Canadian poets she was the most distinctly a daughter of the soil.\n\n\"CANADIAN BORN\"\n\nWe first saw light in Canada, the land beloved of God;\nWe are the pulse of Canada, its marrow and its blood:\nAnd we, the men of Canada, can face the world and brag\nThat we were born in Canada beneath the British flag.\n\nFew of us have the blood of kings, few are of courtly birth,\nBut few are vagabonds or rogues of doubtful name and worth;\nAnd all have one credential that entitles us to brag -\nThat we were born in Canada beneath the British flag.\n\nWe've yet to make our money, we've yet to make our fame,\nBut we have gold and glory in our clean colonial name;\nAnd every man's a millionaire if he can only brag\nThat he was born in Canada beneath the British flag.\n\nNo title and no coronet is half so proudly worn\nAs that which we inherited as men Canadian born.\nWe count no man so noble as the one who makes the brag\nThat he was born in Canada beneath the British flag.\n\nThe Dutch may have their Holland, the Spaniard have his Spain,\nThe Yankee to the south of us must south of us remain;\nFor not a man dare lift a hand against the men who brag\nThat they were born in Canada beneath the British flag.\n\n- E. Pauline Johnson\nTHE SONG MY PADDLE SINGS\n\nAugust is laughing across the sky,\nLaughing while paddle, canoe and I,\nDrift, drift,\nWhere the hills uplift\nOn either side of the current swift.\n\nAnd oh, the river runs swifter now;\nThe eddies circle about my bow.\nSwirl, swirl!\nHow the ripples curl\nIn many a dangerous pool awhirl!\n\nAnd forward far the rapids roar,\nFretting their margin forever more.\nDash, dash,\nWith a mighty crash,\nThey seethe, and boil, and bound, and splash.\n\nBe strong, O paddle! be brave, canoe!\nThe reckless waves you must plunge into.\nReel, reel.\nOn your trembling keel,\nBut never a fear my craft will feel.\n\nWe've raced the rapid, we're far ahead!\nThe river slips through its silent bed.\nSway, sway,\nAs the bubbles spray\nAnd fall in tinkling tunes away.\n\nAnd up on the hills against the sky,\nA fir tree rocking its lullaby,\nSwings, swings,\nIts emerald wings,\nSwelling the song that my paddle sings.\n\n- E. Pauline Johnson\nDawn Marie Winslow and the Six Nations\n\n- by Miss Minnie Hackett, P.H.N.,\nWhite Horse, Yukon.\n\nDawn Marie Winslow - Bernice D.W. Loft before her marriage, was born near Ohsweken, the centre of the Six Nations Reserve, sixteen miles from Brantford, Ontario.\n\nIn 1939, she married Arthur Winslow, and later, went to Whitman, Massachusetts, U.S.A., where she has since resided, near the place his ancestors probably settled when they came in the \"Mayflower\".\n\nBefore her marriage she addressed groups of students at Queen's, McMaster, Toronto, and other Universities, interpreting the works of Pauline Johnson, the Indian poetess, and giving the history and the folk lore of the Six Nations.\n\nThe history of the Six Nations is colourful. Refusing to live under any other flag than the Union Jack or any other government than that of the British, when the rebels in America seceded the Six Nations forfeited their lands. They left the land where they had roamed as free men for many generations, and taking with them any possessions they could carry they trekked north after 1783. Among these possessions were their sacred Communion vessels given them by Queen Anne. These they buried under a large tree and did not remove until many years later, when they thought it safe to do so.\n\nLanding on the north shore of Lake Ontario, near where Kingston now stands, they knelt and gave thanks to God for a safe journey. Here, the party divided. Col. Johnson, as leader of one group, remained to settle near where Toronto is today. The other group, under Joseph Brant, a Mohawk, continued to Lake Erie following the east side, and finally forded to the arable plains of the west bank. Brantford takes its name from that crossing. This land had been familiar to them and to their ancestors for hunting and as a resting place when they made raids on the white settlements to the south a century before.\n\nJoseph Brant guided his people wisely. He was scholarly and cultured. Visiting England, he was received at Court by Queen Victoria, who was impressed by his grace and courteous manner.\n\nThe Six Nations claim the first Confederacy - the Confederacy of the Five Nations, Mohawks, Senecas, Oneidas, Cayugas and Onondagas - the sixth nation, the Tuscaroras, being taken in at a later date.\n\nIt is with this Mohawk background, that Dawn Marie Winslow writes of her ancestors, and tells spellbound audiences of their prowess.\nTo Oh-wen-Ji-yoh - \"The Good Earth\"\n\n- by Dawn Marie Winslow\n  (To her small daughter)\n\n\"Little Chief\" your grandfather called you,\nYour \"Gampa\", a chief of the Mohawks,\nCalled you that, as he watched your\nBaby steps toddle and fall, and\nTodle again. Straight as an arrow\nLoosed to its mark you went.\n\n\"I loved, him, mother, why did he call\nMe that, when he knew I was a girl?\"\n\nLittle Earth Child, because he knew\nThe race of Chiefs was drawing to a close,\nAnd his heart grieved for his people,\nThere would be none to follow him now,\nAnd he wanted you to think as a Chief -\nA woman Chief, with Nature's own\nNobility, and dignity, and beauty.\nThat is why he taught you to know\nAnd feel the bark of Ga-lilt-donh,\nThe Red Oak, and to look up at its\nHeight and beauty, to know its\nHeart was strong and tried and true.\nHe wanted you to learn\nThe beautiful stories trees tell,\nAnd to heed their lessons well.\nTrees are Earth world's true guides,\nAnd they can be a guide to your\nMind and soul, too, if you will\nSit at their feet and listen.\nGampa Chief knew you would\nLook up and beyond the trees\nTo the sky above. The blue\nOf your baby eyes held this sky\nColour and the blue of your\nGrandmother Winslow's eyes...\"\nHer gift to you at birth. She\nBelonged to that great white race,\nMy little one, whose people braved\nUnchartered seas to hold fast\nIdeals of truth and justice and freedom.\nThe Indians welcomed them there\nWhen they landed on the shores\nOf New England's bays -\nBut the trees will tell you all this -\nThey hear and know much.\nYour Grandma gave you courage,\nAnd faith, hope, endurance, too.\n\n\"But the Indians and Gampa Chief\nGave me another name, Oh-wen-ji-yoh,\nMother, why did they name me so?\"\n\nLittle Good Earth, because your Gampa\nKnew the gold of your hair would\nTurn to earth brown, and your\nEyes would hold the deep brown\nSoftness of our good Mother Earth,\nThe deep brown, too, of leaves\nEnriching the land, when\nThey have left the Mother trees,\nAfter the Moon of Falling Leaves.\nOne must live in tune with the Earth\nTo know the heights the trees would climb\nAnd the depths, greater than the blue\nYour grandmother's race crossed.\nThink well, my little brown-eyed one,\nFor in you runs the blood of two\nGreat races, the red and the white,\nWeigh well the good of both -\nOf Gampa Chief and Grandmother Blue Eyes\nAnd love will teach you the rest.\nDr. and Mrs. Meltzer spent a pleasant week-end in Calgary - the first week-end in April.\n\nDr. Matas has returned from holidays in California. While absent he visited several Sanatoria.\n\nMisses M. C. Stewart, K. McKenzie and M. Mason spent a weekend at Banff early in April.\n\nMiss Pat Parr, Brocket, paid a couple of short visits to the Cassell hospital during the month.\n\nMiss Minnie Hackett, P.H.N., White Horse, Y.T., spent a few days with us. She leaves soon for the west coast and will visit, also, in the east before returning down north.\n\nWe were pleased to receive a letter from Audrey Code, subscribing for the Arrow and sending best wishes to all. She had an enjoyable trip north and is looking for spring there, too. Her address is:\nMrs. John S. Code, General Delivery, White Horse, Yukon. (Air Mail-7\u00bd)\n\nMr. A.J. Anderson and Mr. Jack Miner spent ten days, side by side in the University Hospital. We are glad to see Jack back at work and to learn that Andy has been discharged and is spending a recuperation period at his home in Calgary. His mother, Mrs. Burns, was his guest for a few days at the time he went into the hospital.\n\nMiss Esther Glaser and Mr. Johnnie Sewell will be married May the first. They will take up residence in the new suite in Unit 111A.\n\nThe staff took advantage of the tea hour Wednesday afternoon, April 28, to bid farewell to three members of the staff, Miss Mina Cargill, Miss Margaret Zarembo and Mrs. Clara Gellatly. Miss Zarembo will be married and Miss Cargill is leaving for Nanaimo. Miss Taylor presented each with a little gift.\n\nSPRING BEAUTY\n\nby Jean Courtoeille\nWard 1 - Sunporch\n\nOh, what gorgeous beauty\nOne can see in spring!\nGreen leaves and pretty birds\nSpring's a wondrous thing.\n\nAt eventide when all is still\nThe moon across the sky\nSeems playing tag with fleecy clouds\nAs they go racing by.\n\nIn the lovely evening breeze\nHear the robins sing\nThe meadow lark and other birds\nOh!

It starts with an M!\n\nWARD III\n\nOne day we were reading the Bulletin where it told that Billy Taylor was out of hockey for life. Lena, in her excitement, called, \"Say, girls, did you see this? Billy Taylor is out of life for good!\"\n\nOne afternoon Lena was combing and arranging her hair. Mary Jane finally asked her what she was doing. Said Lena, \"I'm playing 'Over the Waves' with my comb, can't you see?\"\n\nWe have a little girl in our ward called Mary Not So Useful. One night she was suffering from a toothache. She rang the bell and the nurse answered, thinking, perhaps that she wanted the dentist \u2014 BUT\u2014\nWARD III (Continued)\n\nNO INDEED - she had pulled her own tooth!

Just then I heard a big storm coming so I tried to hide under a tree. Before I got there the big storm caught me and took me, canoe and all, up into the air about fifteen feet. I was surely scared after I came down! That was the biggest storm I had ever seen in all my life.\n\n- Jimmie Klokapzee\n\nWe welcome Harry Nedlin, John Tammery and Jim Klokapzee - also Frances Poitras who has been spending some time in a private.

We would like to thank all the doctors and nurses and staff for all the works they do for us and especially for their kindness towards us.\n\n\u2014From the boys of Ward X B.\n\nDO YOU KNOW YOUR KINGS?\n\nThe laziest king... Skin-King\nThe thirstiest king... Drink-King\nThe most powerful king... Wor-King\nThe shiest king... Win-King\nThe wittiest king... Jo-King\nThe noisiest king... Tail-King\nThe quietest king... Thin-King\nGREETINGS!\n\nWe regret very much that we have been so busy with many activities that we have been unable until now to compile a copy of our school magazine. We know that the parents and friends look forward to reading the Western Echo so we have made a special effort to get the magazine in the mails to you at last.\n\nWhile the publication of the magazine has been delayed we have been busy with other work, and it all adds up to most successful year over a year to complete and which we are now occupying, have added much to the prestige of the school. The building comprises five classrooms, a manual training centre and a library. The primary room has been fitted with low tables and small chairs for the teacher and comfort of the children and we hope to institute a similar improvement in other classrooms for the better opportunity for study. Now that we are graduating pupils of this school who have the necessary qualifications and have the full support of their parents in the desire for higher education, from our grade nine to the public high schools, we have adopted the full public high school curriculum and more time must be spent by the pupil in studying. I am glad to say that our high school pupils in grades ten and eleven are doing well, and more than holding their own with other high school pupils.\n\nDuring what has been a hot winter for health reasons, staff or the school has been excellent, and the health of the pupils has been maintained. We have excepted with only minor complaints, although we have shown a steady gain in weight and height. Our new boy, who came to school in September without uniforms, has actually gained 28 lbs in five months.\n\nPromotions are already being made with the shipment. Complaints for the summer vacation, the parents will be advised in good time of the dates arranged.\n\nI must congratulate the parents on the behaviour of their children in the school. We have not had one major breach of discipline during the past year; indeed kindness reigns supreme.\n\nSince the New Year started, we, the Grade 8 and 9s, have gone on the tours. February 16th, first round trip to Pulp Mill on Thursday, after our tours we had to write essays on our interesting visits.\n\nOur essays on the pulp mill were put into booklet form. Two of these booklets were mailed, one to be sent to the pulp mill and one to be kept in the school.\n\nOUR VISITORS\n\nOur visitor during the year was Mr. Donaldson, Dominion Inspector of Indian schools. He gave us a very interesting talk about his experiences in India. He also gave us an interesting talk about the difficulties he faced when trying to give an education, for instance to become a master of doctor, where you can do a whole lot.\n\n(continued)\nThey both said they liked their visit here, which we liked to hear them say. Dr. George Dorsey of Toronto, and Col. T. W. S. Parsons, Commissioner of Boy Scouts, and Director of the Crippled Children's Hospital, also visited us.\n\nThe following pupils were promoted to a higher grade at Christmas:\n\nGrade 6 to 7\nHannah Little\nViolet Campbell\nNancy Joe\n\nGrade 7 to 8\nGertrude Atlee\nGerry Ryan\nEthel Jack\n\nTESTS\n\nTests, as you all know, are something that every child gets when she or he goes to school. These tests are to see whether or not you will be promoted to a higher grade. If you try very best you will find that you are doing just as well as your neighbour.\n\nIn our school-room here there are grades 6, 7, 8 and 9, and there were some pupils who did very well in their tests.\n\nThe following is a list of those who ranked 1st, 2nd, and 3rd in the Fall and Christmas tests:\n\nGrade VI\nFall Tests\nHannah Little\nViolet Campbell\nNancy Joe\n\nChristmas Tests\nViolet Campbell\nNancy Joe\nHannah Little\n\nGrade VII\nFall Tests\nGertrude Atlee\nHenry Underwood\nEthel Jack\n\nChristmas Tests\nGertrude Atlee\nGerry Ryan\nEthel Jack\n\nGrade VIII\nFall Tests\nEthel Jack\nTommy Humchitt\n\nChristmas Tests\nEthel Jack\nTommy Humchitt\n\nGrade IX\nFall Tests\nMinnie Joe\nWilson Bob\nAndrew Charles\n\nChristmas Tests\nMinnie Joe\nWilson Bob\nAndrew Charles\n\nWe all would like to congratulate these pupils and we hope you do just as well in your next tests.

We were very proud of it when we put it on our class period, when Mr. Meizo comes into lend us in singing songs so lustily and to teach us new ones. We spent time in the Senior Room and can hear us across the hall in the Junior Room. Our brains to think of new ideas for our posters, we hope our school will again get the cup for the best.\n\nNEWS\n\nJUNIOR ROOM\n\nSTORY CORNER\n\nA WALK THROUGH THE WOODS\n\nOne day I decided to go for a walk through the woods. I had walked a long way when I came upon a little clearing. I stopped to rest a while, then I walked a little closer still. Soon I began to see things that I could not have seen before. We did not know what they were until we came near them. They were strange but beautiful. When we came near them, we could see no more. We stopped and sat down some distance from them. A bird flew over our heads and we heard it. Then we heard a noise. It was a bird. I looked up and saw a rabbit. I looked up and saw it. Later we moved to find our way home. Bruce Johnson.\n\nSIMPLY HOPE YOU WILL BE PLEASED WITH OUR EFFORTS.\n\nWhen school commenced last fall we were all thrilled to enter our beautiful new classrooms. We hope we will be able to keep our new classrooms looking that way. We had a busy fall term. Some work was done by the students. Some members of the class enjoyed clay modeling with plasticine and some gold medals were turned out. Most of our work had at our facilities for a while. In the fall our room had a girls' softball team. We played a few games against the Intermediate team. We can't remember who won but it was great fun. All members of our class report good times at the Halloween, New Years and Valentine parties. Some of the girls made good fairies and performed well at the Christmas Concert.\n\nResults of the Fall tests for grade III proved Goddes Wilson to rank first, Clara Joseph second and Freda Barton third. In Grade IV Peggy August ranked first, Vera Harris second and Elma Robinson third.\n\nFirst, William Cecil second and Clara Joseph third. The Grade IV team Bob ranked first, Peggy August second and Marjorie Dennis third.\n\nAt the class election Peggy August was elected class representative for the school paper. Among the promising artists in our room are Tommy Tate, George Knighton, Russell Jones, Freda Barton, Bruce Johnson and Goddes Wilson. We hope to get some good work from them. Initially, we hope to get some good work from them. Finally, we hope to get some good work from them. Finally, we hope to get some good work from them.\n\nWe are pleased to report that we have had very few names on the sick list. Members of our class have gone on some nature study walks during the first period on Friday afternoons.\n\nEverybody is having to tell a story as part of the test. Language Test. To a few occasions we have dramatized short stories and poems. In classes most of us are looking forward to some more of these.

The first half of the Preliminaries was fought out in the last in the finals all bouts were fought out to the last. To any onlooker it was plain to see that the boys were keenly fit and prepared to give of their best. The Prize and Trophy were presented by Mr. Gilmore. The results of the Championships were as follows:\n\n| Weight | Champion |\n|--------|----------|\n| 65 lbs | Robert Jones |\n| 75 lbs | Arthur Moore |\n| 90 lbs | Teddy White |\n\nIn November, the Albert Athletic Association sponsored a Boxing Card in which Dan Tivoli represented the school in a bout which he lost on points to a very worthy opponent, Silvay Mack. Also present was the Exhibition bout and won favourable applause from the crowd present, were twenty-five boys and girls from the school attending this evening at the Albert Athletic Hall.\n\nOn the evening of March 14th Gerry Ryan, Harry Underwood and Ian Niski matched their skill against boxers from a Canadian Naval vessel at the Albert Athletic Hall. These boys all did well in furthering the good name of our school. Press reports prophesied a bright boxing future for Gerry Ryan.\n\nPoveshell's bright boxing future for Gerry Ryan.\n\nThese classes produced a very gifted corporal due to Ivy Underwood and Ruth Schoon, which later performed with Tomlin and his group of boy gymnasts at the Christmas concert. A Club Swinging team also gave a very fine display from the stage of the Auditorium.\n\nThe very wet weather and the heavy playing fields have not made for a very active football season so far, but we have had a few unexciting games with our old rivals, Albert High School, to hope to do more and better as the weather improves.\n\nOUR ARTISTS\nThe weekly basket-ball practices in the Alberni Athletic Hall are looked forward to, both boys and girls taking part on alternate Mondays. Coached by Mr. Maize the pupils are showing keenness and great improvement. We have been promised a place in League competition in the coming season.\n\nA girls Marching Team has been organized by Miss Bone, with the intent of putting on both marching and gymnastic displays when the weather permits. With uniform dress this team should be an attractive addition to the school activities on the Campus.\n\nAthletics among both the girls and the boys should be furthered by the addition of two new staff members, Miss Prestley and Mr. Haddock, both of whom are taking gym classes. Wrestling has also been introduced. The game of Volley Ball has taken hold on the girl's side and on fine days many are using the high net.\n\nIt is through the whole-hearted co-operation and willingness-to-do spirit of the pupils that the best results can be obtained. It is the Team Spirit that the school wishes to foster, rather than individual performance. Everyone has a chance to share equally in school activities. A good school gathers a glorious and proud tradition through the years. Let us keep our school foremost in endeavours and above all\u2014PLAY THE GAME!\n\nMr. Edward E. Peake\u2014Many old Boys of Coqualeetza and Alberni schools will join with the present pupils in regretting the retirement of Mr. Peake from the school staff. Mr. Peake served these schools for many years, coming back to Alberni after four years overseas service with the Canadian Army. His health suffered as a result of his war services, but he carried on until he found it completely necessary to take a rest. He left for his home in England in February.\n\nThe Old Boys of Coqualeetza and Alberni are noted for their good sportsmanship and gentlemanly behaviour and it is to the instruction, and individual interest of Mr. Peake that they owe this enviable reputation.\n\nThe high regard in which Mr. Peake is held is evidenced by the many visits to the school of Old Boys, coming especially to see him. We all wish him God Speed, a Long Life and Prosperity, and hope to see him again.\n\nACTIVITIES:\n\nC.G.I.T.\n\nEarly in the Fall the C.G.I.T. was reorganized with a membership of forty girls, under the leadership of Mrs. Silversides, as Department Superintendent. The girls were divided into three groups; the Clover Club, with Miss Bone as Leader and Pearl Russ President; the Cherokee Group, with Miss Swanson Leader and Ethel Jack President; and the Illita Group, with Miss Kennedy Leader and Nannie Joe, President.\n\nWe have been busy with handicraft activities, which include needlework, leather work, shellcraft, knitting and crocheting.\n\nWe have co-operated with the C.G.I.T. in Alberni having joined with them in a Candle Lighting Service at Christmas time, as well as meeting with them socially. We spent a very enjoyable evening with them in the Fall, and were pleased to extend an invitation to them to visit our school in February. They were interested in touring the school and particularly in a most entertaining lecture by our Principal, Mr. Caldwell, on Indian Lore.\n\nSo far, we have had one joint meeting with the Taxis Group, at which the Art Teacher from Alberni High School gave several readings. We expect to have another joint meeting in the near future.\n\nAt present we are bending every effort in preparation for the Kiwanis Hobby Show and the Exhibition of the Indian Arts and Crafts Society, both in Vancouver early in April.\n\nCHRISTMAS\u2014\n\nChristmas has come and gone but still the memories of that joyful time linger on. Our Concert was an outstanding success, according to the critics, with little Moses Dennis stealing the show as \"Dopey\" in Snow White.\n\nChristmas Day dawned bright\u2014and noisily, with No.5 Dormitories eagerly sampling the contents of their stockings. At the morning Service Mr. Arthur Grant sang the beautiful and well-loved \"Holy City\", after which we had a delicious Christmas dinner. The highlight of the day was the appearance of Santa Claus and the distribution of presents. There were many tired, but happy, children on Christmas night. It is good to feel that our school is \"A Home away from Home!\"\nPARTIES.\u2014Our parties this year have been a lot of fun and it would be hard to say which we enjoyed the most\u2014our Halloween Hop in the fall, our New Year's Masquerade, or our Valentine Party.\n\nWeekly Talking Picture shows on Saturday evenings, and Parties on Friday evenings have been enjoyed by the students throughout the term. Special Health, and T.B. Prevention Films have been shown.\n\nSUNDAY SERVICES:\n\nSunday evening Services have been conducted by Mr. Caldwell, assisted by a mixed choir trained by Mr. Walze. One Service was taken by the Young People's Group from Alberni Church and another by Mr. James Watt, Jr., a student minister, son of our school Principal. Mr. Jamieson, Principal of the Public Elementary School also gave a Sunday evening talk.\n\nThere are ten graded classes in our Sunday School as well as a large Bible Class, taught by the Principal.\n\nPRESENTATION:\n\nIn February the whole school joined in a presentation to Mr. Penke as a token of appreciation for his many years of service to the school and the students, on the occasion of his leaving for England. A beautiful dressing case was the gift of the pupils, and the staff presented a Parker Lifetime Pen Set.\n\nACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENTS.

A Challenge Cup for Relay Race was also won in inter-school sports.\n\nSPECIAL!!!\n\nWe send greetings to those of our school Chums who are in hospital, Coquihalla and Miller Bay Hospitals. This Magazine is going forward to you. We hear reports of your progress from time to time and are glad to hear nearly all of you are getting on so well. Don't worry, get lots of rest and sleep, obey your nurses....and you will soon be back with us enjoying all the good things of school life!\n\nWe wish to say \"thank you\" Dr. Ross, Dr. Barclay and Dr. Goldsmith for looking after our health so well....and also to Dr. Tennant, who was the means of operating on Emma Robinson's eyes and doing such a good job of making them straight.\n\nTo all our Parents and Friends at home....\n\n........... \"WE'LL BE SEEING YA SOON !!!\nOUR CONGRATULATIONS go out to Rev. Peter Kelly, now Dr. Peter Kelly, on whom a degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred by the United Church of Canada. We took great pride in opening the old Coqualeetza School Register at the year 1900, where we find Peter Kelly admitted to the school as number 132. His record through the years is noted in the Register, to which we added the latest honour conferred on him. This is a well-deserved recognition of the faithful and very valuable service Dr. Kelly has rendered to his people and to his Church, and is, furthermore, an indication of the outstanding place the Native work maintains in the sphere of the United Church of Canada.\n\nAUTOGRAPH S\nContents\n\nVOLUME II\nEDITION II\n\nCHARLES CAMSELL\nINDIAN HOSPITAL\nEDMONTON, ALTA.\n\nA Letter From Mrs. Meltzer,\nLondon, Ontario\n\nJames Bay Indians\nT.J.Orford, M.D.,\nStaff Doctor\n\nSlippers and Boots and Shoes - Poem\n\nNews From the Field\nMy Recent Trip North\nRev.

E. Kerans\nMadge la P. Grantham\n(Teachers)\nDear Camsellonians,\n\nIt is now just three weeks since the Dr. and I left Edmonton and although I am enjoying the trip tremendously I must admit that I am already beginning to feel that it will be grand to get back to see you all again.\n\nWe have travelled many miles since we last saw you; we have visited many interesting places and we have met many wonderful people. I wish I could describe everything to you but I'm afraid that would take too long.\n\nOur first stop was in Ottawa. As you may imagine Dr. Meltzer was very busy there discussing all sorts of hospital matters with the heads of the Indian Health Services Department. He tells me it was a most successful visit and that he has been able to arrange many things which will improve our hospital. We saw many of our old friends in the Department and made many new ones, both in the Health Services and in the Department of Indian affairs. As many as possible were gathered together to discuss ways of making things better for all the Indians across Canada. The last three days we were there Dr. Meltzer attended the meetings of the Canadian Tuberculosis Association where all the people who are working to stamp out Tuberculosis in the whole of Canada, met to compare notes and discuss the ways in which this great effort could be carried on.\n\nOttawa is a beautiful city. There are many impressive buildings. Perhaps many of you have seen pictures of the Parliament Buildings, but I think I was more impressed by the lovely trees and gardens which abound in the city. It is, of course, a much older city than Edmonton and it has had time to become more settled. The streets are all paved and the houses themselves look settled down in their surroundings \u2014 they look as if they really belonged in their own particular spot and intended to stay there for a long time to come.\n\nFrom Ottawa we travelled by car to Quebec City. It was a lovely drive and I think I enjoyed it so much more because the countryside reminded me of England. After the flatness of the\nA Letter From Mrs. Meltzer\n(Continued)\n\nprairies it was lovely to see the countryside broken by little hills, and the small farms nestling in hollows sheltered by trees. I must tell you about the shutters on the houses. They are rather like our Venetian blinds but they are on the outside, and instead of being pulled up or down they open outwards like little doors. Most of the houses are built of stone and many are painted white and they really do look pretty. Most of them have a very high pointed roof\u2014made of tin, which shines brilliantly in the sunshine.\n\nOur stay in Quebec City was all too short. There is so much to see and learn about this old fortress. There are many monuments to honour great men in Canadian History. They have a beautiful park called, \"The Plains of Abraham\". It is the place where Wolfe defeated the French and first made Canada an English Colony. Our country has grown a great deal since that time to become one of the leading nations of the world but it is good to remember how we started and to be thankful that we have learned to live peaceably together.\n\nWe had to leave Quebec City and move on to Montreal, which is a large city compared to the other cities in Canada. Like all big cities it is very easy to feel alone there. There are so many people and they are all so very busy, and they all seem to be in such a hurry to get somewhere. The stores were full of lovely things and I certainly wished that I had lots of money to spend\u2014but I just had to look. Montreal has some very beautiful buildings and churches. We took one tour of the city but the place is so big that to go and explore these places by yourself would not only take a very long time but I felt sure that I would get lost. Dr. Meltzer visited most of the hospitals there and saw what work they were doing.\n\nWe returned to Ottawa for two days and then went to London, Ontario. In this part of the world this city is referred to as \"The Forest City\" and they certainly have some beautiful trees. I certainly wish we had as many and such big ones in Edmonton. We spent a very happy week there, mainly, I think, because some of our relatives live there. There is a large Sanatorium there which the Dr. visited. He also visited the Westminster Hospital, which is a very big place. One place of special interest to some of you is the D.V.A. Lodge. I can't tell you much about it because\nA Letter From Mrs. Meltzer\n(Continued)\n\nunfortunately I was unable to accompany Dr. Meltzer on his visit there. It is quite a large area of ground where all the D.V.A. Health Services for this district are being centralized. It is a short distance outside the city and from just driving past it seems an excellent arrangement.\n\nOne day we drove out to Springbank\u2014which is quite a large park. Two things I saw I shall remember\u2014one was a family of baby swans and the other was a peacock, which was very obliging and spread his tail for us to see. It was absolutely beautiful. Naturally that was one time I didn't have the camera with me.\n\nNow we are in Toronto. Dr. Meltzer is visiting hospitals again this morning and I expect he'll be fairly busy all the time we are here, but it won't be very long now until we are on our way home.\n\nUntil we arrive, best wishes to you all and take good care of yourselves.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nD. Jean Meltzer.\n(Mrs. H. Meltzer)\n\n---\n\nJAMES BAY INDIANS\n\nStory II;\n- By Dr. T.J. Orford\n\nThere are four thousand Indians living around James Bay today. These people are descendants of the original Cree tribe found there three hundred years ago by the first white traders. They are organized into ten main bands whose boundaries are defined by the limits of their trapping grounds. These people were never of a very warlike nature but occasionally, in days gone by, had inter-band raids and battles. Today, however, they live together as neighbors.\n\nAbout forty years ago the Indian bands living in the Ontario section of James Bay began to sign Treaties with the Canadian and Ontario governments. Each member of every band receives five dollars a year paid in currency. Each band has a Reserve set aside upon which to reside and on which they have the timber and soil rights, but upon which they do not own mining rights. The trapping grounds are on Provincial Crown Lands and the Indians abide by the Ontario trapping and hunting regulations, subject to emergency needs, when they may\nJames Bay Indians\n(Continued)\n\ntake animals for food. White trappers used to take out licenses to trap on some of the Indian trapping areas, but now each Indian trapper holds a license so that he and his family can keep the traditional hunting section as long as the license is renewed each year.\n\nThe first Indian Agent arrived in James Bay only in 1929. He was also the Doctor for this area. This arrangement continued until 1947 when both a Doctor and an Indian Agent were sent in by the Government. These men have to travel great distances to visit people. At first it was done by canoe, boat and dog team but now most trips are made by aeroplane. The Doctor now has fine nurses to help him. These women work amongst the Indian homes mainly but they also have two small hospitals. There are also five small hospitals operated by the Roman Catholic and the Anglican churches who staff these places with their own nurses. The government has this year started to build a large hospital for the treatment of Tuberculosis which will care for the Indians and Eskimos as far north as Hudson Strait\u2014over one thousand miles distant.\n\nEducation is taken care of by a day school at each band centre and by four residential schools. All schools are run by the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches with government support. Because the Indians are trappers and must travel long distances with their families, many children do not receive much time at school but gradually they are all learning to speak English, and I am sure the day is not far off when some will continue on through high school and University for many are very clever boys and girls.\n\n---\n\nSLIPPERS and BOOTS and SHOES\n\nYou have slippers for a party, and sand-shoes for the sea,\nWalking shoes with laces when you're going out to tea,\nRubber boots for splashing in the puddles down the street\u2014\nJust think of all the different things you wear upon your feet!\n\nBut children far across the sea have clogs or moccasins,\nAnd some wear little sandals made from rushes or from skins,\nAnd Eskimos have knee-boots that are made from walrus hide\u2014\nThere ARE a lot of different things to put your feet inside!\n\n--- J.E. Mulliner\nI have just returned from a visit to Cold Lake, Keeheewin and Frog Lake Indian Reserves, having accompanied the Regional Supervisor of Indian Affairs, Mr. Cooderham, and the Saddle Lake Indian Agency party paying treaty annuities at those places.\n\nThe Cold Lake band numbers about 400, Keeheewin 200 and Frog Lake 200 \u2014 about 800 in all. They have recently come into the Saddle Lake Indian Agency and the Alberta jurisdiction, having formerly been a part of the Onion Lake Agency.\n\nWhen these bands wish to see a doctor or go to a hospital they travel to Cold Lake, Bonnyville and Elk Point. The doctors here, as elsewhere, do not make house-to-house visits to the Indians. At Cold Lake is the John Neal Hospital. It is not very large and not very elaborate but it is well operated. At Bonnyville and at Elk Point are found the usual effective 40-50 bed hospitals, which are found all over Alberta. Dr. Ayotte, at Bonnyville, a French Canadian, is a competent physician and surgeon. The Elk Point Clinic, under Dr. Miller, Dr. Ross and Dr. Weigerinck, is rather renowned in and outside its locality.\n\nHere we found the group of Indians rather more primitive than would be expected, considering the fact that they are living in a settled part of Alberta. Except for a few individuals they are doing little farming and stock raising. The Indians do a good deal of fishing and trapping. This is not a very good trapping country, and Cold Lake, the main fishing place of the district, is closed. One wonders just from where a source of income could be derived.\n\nThe children attend school at either St. Paul (Blue Quills), Onion Lake Residential or at the Day Schools at Keeheewin and Frog Lake.\n\nI visited Mr. Dion (pronounced Deen) at Keeheewin. He has been teacher there for many years and has been a good friend and counsellor to the Indians. Many Indians can look back to having learned to read and write under Mr. Dion. Mr. Hunt, a successful teacher, has been at Frog Lake for eight years. It was a pleasure to visit Mr. and Mrs. Hunt.\n\nTuberculosis is not unusually prevalent but the eye disease, Trachoma, is very common above the age of childhood. However, I hope that soon I shall be able to do something towards laying out a detailed program to combat this disease.\nOur recently completed X-Ray Survey was very interesting. It began with a 2\u00bd-hour train journey through regions of changing scenery from farm lands to muskeg, bush and lakes.\n\nAt Dawson Creek we were welcomed warmly by the B.C. provincial police and offered assistance in anyway. It proved later that Corporal Hall pinned our victim to the film holder while we took turns saying our famous pass-word: \"Skwah-ta-moa, mcheetamo\" (Take a deep breath and hold it).\n\nThe trip to Moberly Lake included interesting events. In some parts of the roads, the ditches were four feet higher than the road. Although there were no mountains yet nature provided hazards by piling small hills, one on top of the other.\n\nWe met relatives and friends of many patients in this hospital. At Wabasco we met Jean Beauregard whom all of us remember. We travelled over the Wabasco Trail for eight miles. This trail is noteworthy for its bumps. Where the Trail was smooth, pieces of wood were spaced about 3 feet apart. These, we were told, were for the horses to step on when the road was muddy.\n\nEverywhere we went we were met with true northern hospitality. The trip by air was especially novel. Our clinic visited such places as Calling Lake, Long Lake, Trout Lake, Whitefish Lake and Rose Prairie.\n\nPerhaps the most unforgettable aspect of the Journey was the mosquitoes. Folks tied the dogs and the children to keep the mosquitoes from carrying them away. Indeed we are sure that the mosquitoes or flies as they are known there, were so many that they worked in shifts and heaven help anyone caught in the rush when they changed\u2014usually around 7 p.m. and 8 a.m. At these times they doubled in numbers and viciousness.\n\nAll things considered the trip was an interesting and enjoyable experience.\nDear Camsell Arrow,\n\nEach month I look forward to that particular mail night when there will be a fat envelope for me with the Camsell Arrow inside. I wonder if other copies of the Arrow are as much read as my copy is. After the staff have finished looking over my shoulder to see the latest doings of any Saddle Lakers in Edmonton, the Arrow is pinned up on the bulletin board in the office. Here, it is perused at leisure, by all who come for medicines, etc. As each new copy is received, the old one is taken down and sent to Blue Quills School, where the staff and pupils may read about their friends. Now do not think that is the end of the trail, for when that paper reaches my hands again, I roll it up and mail it to my folks back East. Thus, your news is being spread far and wide. I do hope that you will all try to do your share in keeping your paper the lively and interesting one it is today, for it is only by working together and sharing the job that your paper can be a success.\n\nH. M. Lillie.\n\n(Public Health Nurse)\n\nPEACE AT EVENTIDE\n\nComposed by - Jean Courtoeille\n\nWhat peace we enjoy-\nThe sun sinks in the west,\nBusy sounds stand still,\nAs the day goes to rest.\n\nIn the evening breeze\nThe trees murmur low,\nAnd the leaves softly rustle\nAs they swing to and fro.\n\nThen in each home\nCome the lights, one by one,\nEverything's so peaceful,\nWhen the day's work is done.\n\nDraw a big red circle around July 20 on your calendar!\nIt's the P.P. Day. AND that doesn't stand for Past Principle, either-- it stands for PATIENTS' PICNIC. The doctors are going to give permission to every one they possibly can to attend. The staff will be there, too. A grand time will be had! But, boys and girls, do be GOOD! We did hear one of the doctors say that that might count.

CONGRATULATIONS!\nWARD NEWS\n\nWARD ONE\n\nOne night at quarter to two the girls rang for the ward aid to close the windows. Said Helen to Betsy, \"What time is it?\" Betsy Three Fingers answered sleepily, \"Fifteen minutes, half past two.\"\n\nWe have been trying to teach Susan Baptiste to say Margaret LAFFERTY but the nearest Susan can get to it is Margaret LAPPERTY. Susan will have to try to put a little more laugh in it!\n\nMy dear friends,\n\nI want to write something for the Arrow this time so think I shall tell you about my visit to my little baby in Ward VII. I took him some candy and when one of the little girls saw the candy she jumped up and down in her crib crying in Cree, \"Look, the baby doesn't give me any candy!\" One little girl told me that the other little girl had to be spanked. This made the little girl cry. Soon another little girl started to cry and soon all the kids in the ward were crying. I never heard such a noise! But I thought it was so cute!\n\nMrs. Victoria Sepp\n\n(Overheard by Louise)\n\nMargaret Kendo from her window, \"Say, Angeline, Panky's on the air.\" \"Where? I can't see him,\" said Angeline as she stretched her neck till she almost tumbled out of the window as she looked up skywards.\n\nWelcome to Emily Wesley, a new patient, from Morley!\n\nLouise Ann Burnstick says she is sorry to miss the Calgary Stampede again\u2014which she has never seen yet.\n\nHelen Simon insists that she has twenty toe nails. Explain it, Helen, we are anxious to know how to do that kind of arithmetic.\n\nOur fat Betsy is looking for a lady of about her avoirdupois to challenge to a boxing match. Applications to be in writing!\n\nWishing you all a speedy recovery, signed\u2014The Comic Family, Ward 1\n\nWARD TWO\n\nThis is the first time I have written for the Arrow. I have not much to say but am glad to admit that I am feeling a lot better now in the five months I have been here. So I give all my thanks to the doctors and nurses for being so kind in helping me get well. My gratitude also to the ward aids, for their share of help and kindness.\n\nWishing all in the hospital the best of luck \u2014 Susan Provost, 11B\nWard Two (Continued)\n\nThe other day Ivy was telling a story. It was something the other girls could not quite believe to be true. Philomene questioned, \"Are you positive, Ivy?\" Ivy answered, \"No, I'm negative.\"\n\nWe think Leonie's English,\nIs not so very \"hot\" \u2014\nShe said, \"Where is that Pop-corn,\nThat we're supposed to get?\"\n\nGalena was trying to copy a hair-do from the comic strip. She surely got it COMIC enough \u2014 it looked more like a hat than a hair-do.\n\nThe fight was on and most of us were listening intently, and thinking of Joe Louis. Margaret was looking at a movie magazine and suddenly remarked, \"What pretty legs!\" Said Jessie, in an abstracted voice, \"Whose? Joe Louis'?\"\n\nHelen Oldpan, when she wishes to say \"thank you\" says \"No, please.\"\n\nGrace Swampey's new song, during rest period goes like this:\n\nOne, one, you don't catch me,\nTwo, two, you don't catch me,\nThree, three, you don't catch me,\nFour, four, you don't\u2014 oh\u2014 ah\u2014 there's the NURSE!\n\nWARD THREE\n\nWe are glad to have Ruth Lightning back with us after her month in a private ward.\n\nOne day Margaret was combing her hair and down went her tail-comb on the floor. She asked the nurse to pick it up. The nurse said, \"Why there is no teeth in this tail-comb, just a tail\". It sounded so funny \u2014 a comb with no teeth \u2014 just a tail \u2014 how we all laughed!\n\nThe Woodpecker song has a great influence over us judging by our laughs.\n\nMary Listner was discharged a week ago. We all miss her but know that she will be glad to get home and be in the open again.\n\nWe were all very interested in the Joe Louis and the Joe \"Wild Cat\" fight, as Vicky called it.\n\nWe enjoyed a visit from Mrs. Desjarlais from Ward 1 the other night. She seemed very happy over the doctor's report on her health.\n\nMrs. Rubillard is always busy sewing and talking. She has some pin-ups on her wall and says she is going to be a pinup girl some day.\n\nWe want to thank all the doctors, especially our ward doctor, Dr. Porth, and all the nurses and aids, for all they are doing to help us. We also want to say hello to all the patients in all the other wards in the hospital, from the girls in Ward III.\nWARD FOUR A\n\nConsternation reigned in Ward IV A recently. Suddenly there was a crash of thunder. We all thought the end of the world had come. Bang it went again\u2014this time right on top of the hospital, it seemed. Annie Gotten jumped out of bed and ran out into the corridor with her rosary and her prayer-book in her hand. When the next crash came she ran back and tried to make a window blind out of her green housecoat. But at last the storm was over and we were settled down again. BUT next day we got the Venetian blind fixed and now all our worries are over\u2014at the first sign of a storm we pull down the blind.\n\nWARD FOUR C\n\nStill He loves to save the sinful,\nHeal the sick and lame,\nCheer the mourner, still the tempest,\nGlory to His name.\n\nHello everybody. We five are fine and happy in our private ward to which we were moved recently. The weather sure is hot these days. We five Eskimos no like em hot weather\u2014nearly get cooked. If this keeps on it will be:\n\nFive little Eskimos\nSitting in the sun,\nMelting, melting right away,\nMelting one by one!\n\nWhen you're feeling glum and blue,\nNothing here to anchor to\u2014\nOr to live for any more\u2014\nTill you reach the Heavenly shore\u2014\nThere is God to glorify\nAnd to live for till you die.\n\nWhen life's storms beat on your head,\nTill your hope is almost dead,\nAnd you want to quit or die\u2014\nFor no sunshine in your sky.\nThere is God to live for yet,\nDo not murmur, do not fret.\n\nHe's not dead, nor doth He sleep,\nBut His purpose doth He keep\u2014\nThat you glorify His name,\nDaily guarding it from shame.\nTo His purpose then be true\u2014\nHe has planned life's way for you\u2014\n\nand for me.\nDoris Kikpak, Ward IV C, Private\n\nWARD FOUR E\n\nWe were glad to have the Educational Film on Wednesday afternoon. One film was about the Salmon in British Columbia. It was good, but we enjoyed the other one, 'Puss in Boots', more, for it made us laugh.\n\nWe wish to say Hello to Harriet and Helen. We miss you both. We hope you are keeping fine.\nWard IV E (Continued)\n\nWe wish to welcome Maya Bab, from Whitehorse. She's our best cowgirl!\n\nWe were disappointed in not having our car ride the other day. We were ready but I guess the car went on strike. However, we all enjoyed a nice walk in the sun.\n\nWe all miss Dr. Melzer a lot and are looking forward to seeing him back soon. We hope we shall all be promoted to higher routines.\n\nFlorence White Quills has a new make of radio. It usually sings well but is sometimes slightly temperamental. It is just new on the market, ask your dealer to see the Alice B. Rabbit radio-television, too!\n\nWARD FOUR SUNPORCH\n\nAgnes and Margaret and also Kay,\nRead the Comics, every day,\nOr else they stitch and mend and sew\u2014\nAnd that's the way the days do go!\n\nWhat Kay would save if the Hospital took on fire: \"My photographs, my love letters, my beauty chest and my hot water bottle.\"\n\nBang went the thunder,\nBang went the floor,\nWe locked in Agnes' bed,\nBut she was there no more.\n\"Are you still alive?\"\nSaid Margaret in glee.\nBut\u2014\nAll that we could hear\u2014\nWas just \"TEE HEE, TEE HEE!\"\n\nWhat must be wrong with Adeline and Kay? Imagine having to go on a diet that sounds something like this: 20 squares of crackers and 4 slices of Crush!\n\nFrom Agnes, Kay, Ade and Margie.\n\nWARD VII B\n\nThe girls in Ward VII B are very proud of their doll house. They are enjoying it very much. The girls wish to thank the Girls' Auxiliary of the Holy Trinity Church for this lovely gift.\n\nWARD VII A\n\nWe wish to welcome to our ward Harrison Steinhauer, Philip Simon, Peter Donnie and Bernard Buffalo.\n\nWe regret that Gilbert Big Sorrel Horse fractured his ankle falling from a wheel chair. He will have to be in a cast for a time.\n\nJoe Germaine and Jack Labelle are now out of casts and walking around a good deal. They should soon be heading for home.\n\nWe miss Joe Roubillard, who has been moved upstairs for about four weeks. We hope that you will soon return to us in Ward VII A, Joe.\n\nA.A. Atcheynum.\nWARD NINE A\n\nA few nights ago the renowned artist, Percy Plains Woman, was called at the call of the south.\n\nA bat gained admission somehow to our ward and caused great commotion in the early hours of June 2. Genuine war whoops could be heard until the intruder was slaughtered.\n\nIsadore Michel, recently transferred to a Private, is undoubtedly the most fortunate of us all when it comes to raffles, etc. In three months he has won no less than \u2014 three hockey pools, two photograph albums, hair clippers (complete with scissors and comb), a bed lamp and a pair of beaded gloves.\n\nJohn Tammery, alias John Timbre, has been transferred to Ward IX B. His dry humour will be missed by all. Goodbye, Joe, it was nice knowing you!\n\nBelieve it or not\u2014 Louis Renault insists that he saw two T.B. germs without microscopic aid \u2014 one was red and healthy and the other gray and weak \u2014 but both had long horns like Texas Longhorn cattle.\n\nNew members to our United Nations are: Henry Nepoose, Samson's Band, Hobbema, late of Ward IX; Robert Wesley and Jim J. Moses, both of Stony Reserve, Morley, recently admitted; Archie Half, Goodfish Lake and late of Ward IX B. Archie, who likes music has proven he can handle his violin and has found much in common with our versatile Isadore Gladue.\n\nAlbert Wells continues to take the cure faithfully \u2014 a good example.\n\nJoe Hoof is most desirous of getting moved to Ward IV, even at the cost of a few ribs \u2014 no price is too high for him just to get within talking distance of the girls.\n\nAnd I, Howard McMaster, recently returned from a Private, appear very quiet as the opening day of the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede draws nigh.\n\nHoward McMaster.\n\nWARD IX C\n\nHello everyone! Nice weather we're having, sweet and pleasant! On June the first, I had my first car ride \u2014 that is hospital car ride. We had a lovely ride \u2014 Willie Rain, Abraham Okpik, Miles Calihoo, Stanley Isaac and I. It was nice to be out in the open and it gave us a thrill to see all the leaves and green world again. I am surely thankful to all the staff here. After my operation I thought I would just be a half man but I am getting well again. We enjoy the visits from Dr. Woodsworth. He always makes happy fellows out of us.\n\nSam Williams\nThere have been fascinating stories told about the great North country. Well, here is one that should go in the news:\n\nADVENTURES IN THE GREAT YUKON RIVER\n\nMr. David Hammond was going down this great river which they call the Yukon. He was going to the famous Dawson City from Whitehorse. He was not in need of food\u2014he had lots of it. One day while he was drifting down this mighty river, he saw a moose swimming across it. He rowed faster until he caught up to the moose. He did not want to kill it as he had no need of supplies, so he took the rope from the boat and tied it to the moose's horns. The moose kept on swimming down the river. David decided to let the moose do the work and he lay back and smoked and relaxed. Then a tragic thing happened. All he could remember was something hitting him in the back of the head. The moose had struck shallow water, and starting to run, had jerked the boat so hard that David had been knocked unconscious.\n\nDavid finally arrived at Dawson City. He told the people about his adventure and only then did he realize that he had been unconscious FOR A WEEK!\n\nDear friends,\n\nTime hurries on, doesn't it? Looking ahead two years seems a long time but looking back over it does not seem so long.\n\nIt has been quite a while since I left my pony, Sundown, waiting for me at the old home corral, lonely and weary, anxious to be on the trail again, rustling wild range horses and cattle. Many a lonely year Sundown has been a faithful pal to me. As you, my old friends, must know, an old saying is, \"A cowboy's best friend is his pony.\" That is true\u2014and I know you feel that way, if you are in the same boat as I am, man, and have left a faithful cowpony waiting for you at home. Don't make him wait too long, will you? When a cowpony gets used to his master it is mighty sad when they have to part.\n\nWe are missing all the shows, boys\u2014the rodeos that are being held now all over the province. Our friends are having a \"whale\" of a time travelling from one show to another. Some have already sent in their entry fees to the Calgary Stampede office for the big Round-up being held July 5 to 10. They are entering the different events, such as: barsback bronc riding, both North American and Canadian saddle bronc riding, wild Brahma bull riding,\ncalf roping, steer decorating, wild horse racing, wild cow milking, etc.\n\nHere we are, spending our time lying in bed, when we should be a contestant at the rodeo. Still, I feel, that soon we shall be better and able to do those things we enjoyed before we came to the hospital.\n\nThink back! Remember the thrill it was - back in the saddle on your old cowboy - drawing by lot, the steer which you were to decorate, or the bronco which you were to take out of the chute. These memories do thrill one! So hurry, Jackie Labelle over in Ward 7 A and Louie and Joe in 9 A and Maurice and Danny in IX C. Let's waste no time in getting well, so that soon we may be catching that stage coach and heading for our own home town.\n\nAdios,\nBuddy Onespott.\n\nThis is the first time that I have written for the Arrow. I have not much to say, except that I have learned to play the guitar in twenty months - I think that is good news, don't you?\n\nRoy Hunter\n\nHello friends, this time I am going to tell you about a dream I had a couple of years before I took sick. Two or three times I had the same old dream - always that I was going back to school again. It seemed so strange to me that I should be dreaming of school. The last time I had the dream I felt that it must be an omen that something was going to happen to me -- and it did! Sure enough my dream came true. I am doing school work again!\n\nI am glad that I have had my leg repaired lately and am expecting my other leg to be repaired soon. I shall always be grateful to the doctors for trying to fix my legs so that I shall be able to walk again. Good luck and thank!\n\nRobert Laboucon\n\nWARD TEN B\n\nHello, how are everybody? We are fine, as usual. We have collected a little news for the Arrow this month.\n\nLittle Jean Grandejambe was transferred from the Private to our ward lately.\n\nGeorge Tacomba and Fred Achla are both in the private now, transferred from ours. Fred has not been feeling very well.\nWARD X B (Continued)\n\nThe cement platform right outside our ward has been finished and now we can go outside and enjoy the afternoons. It is wonderful to get out in the sun after having been shut in for so many months. We appreciate all that is being done for our welfare and we want the whole staff to know that we do appreciate it. Best wishes to all!\n\nThe Boys in Ward X B\n\nWARD TEN C\n\nOn June 3 Modeste Mandeville came by plane from Fort Resolution to visit his son, Pat. Pat's father is staying in Edmonton and visiting his son daily, for a week. Pat is wearing a broad smile these days.\n\nPat Perry was fortunate too. He had a visit from his sister.\n\nThe patients in this ward are always getting their beds moved. Danny Eaglechild is the one exception. He is in the Private and has been in the same bed in the same place for over a year now. He hopes he will not have to leave this favorite spot till he leaves it to go home.\n\nSONG\n\nComposed by - Edwin Lafleur, X B.\n\nI'm only an ill T.B. patient,\nI lived in the North, far away,\nBut now they've got me in the city,\nTill I'm cured I am going to stay.\n\nI'm doing just fine at the present,\nAnd all of my friends feeling swell.\nWe sure have some wonderful doctors-\nNice nurses and aids, too, as well.\n\nSome day we shall get our discharges,\nAnd all of this treatment be done-\nSo till then, boys, be not discouraged-\nJust keep up the jokes and the fun.\n\nFor soon we'll be leaving the city,\nAnd back to the good North we'll stray\nHome to our loved ones we'll go, boys,\nTo stay there forever and aye.\n\nAnd now I must thank all the doctors,\nAnd most, Dr. Meltzer, 'tis true.\nAnd all of the nurses and ward aids\nFor all the good work that they do.\n\nNow this is the end of my story,\nSo, boys, take this lesson from me-\nJust follow the routine you're given,\nAnd soon you'll be cured of T.B.\n\n\"My hardest job always comes before breakfast.\"\n\"What is it?\"\n\"Getting up.\"\n\nThe only person one should ever try to \"get even\" with is the person who has done something good for us.\n\"TOWARD THE SUN RISING\"\n\nWe are fortunate that at St. George's we have a motto so easy to remember and yet so full of meaning. Far better its clear simple words than an obscure Latin quotation. For we know, each and every one of us, that although the sun may be hidden for a space by clouds, or the way be rough and difficult, that if we keep our thoughts turned upward, we shall go onward. Let us always remember the way of life which we have experienced at St. George's and let us keep our faces \"Toward the sun rising.\"\n\nReynold Smith's illustration of our motto is copied for us this year by Loretta Smith.\n\"A MESSAGE FROM THE PRINCIPAL\"\n\nMy dear Girls and Boys:\n\nThank you for inviting me to take part in your School Annual. I am quite sure I shall enjoy reading it. An important truth has forced itself on my mind more, perhaps, this year than ever before. It is this: Within each one of us there lies potentialities which, when discovered and brought into action, can give to us the maximum of happiness and fullness of living.\n\nAs I have told you many times in the past, and do so again now, true happiness and fullness of living is not plucked or derived from the lives of other people. Other people do contribute toward our happiness, but only in proportion to the measure that we give to them of the resources that are within us. The initial effort toward happiness and fullness of living must come from your own individual selves. You must, therefore, find out your own capacities and resources. Or, as one of the ancients, who lived many thousands of years ago said: \"Know thyself.\" Find out what powers, what resources, what capacities for doing wonderful things, God has placed within each of you; even as He put them in the flowers and other things of His creation. We dare not and we must not be dependent on other people for our happiness and fullness of living. It will come to us as we seek to know ourselves, and as we draw from those resources divinely bestowed in each of us as the very crown and richness of our human heritage.\n\nDuring the war years, many millions of young people were called upon to place themselves under orders. It was an enormous call, and a noble and splendid response was made by these millions of young people. They made a tremendous sacrifice; not the least of which was the sacrifice of their own initiative, which, in many instances was given little chance to mature. They depended on authority for all daily activity, and almost all their social and recreational life was ordered without any effort on their part.\n\nYou youngsters, and all other youngsters of this age and generation, must make it your most special and sacred duty to see that the forces within you, and which are the very vital part of your social structure; and from which true happiness and fullness of living is born, are not allowed to die or even remain dormant in you. Bring them into action; don't lean on other people, give of the best that you have within yourself to the welfare of others. In that way you will realize great happiness and fullness of living.\n\nLove and best wishes from myself and Mrs. Hives,\n\nEver your friend,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\"THE DRAGON\"\n\nA yearbook published by the students of the Senior Classroom of St. George's School, Lytton, B.C., June, 1947.\n\nEDITORIAL STAFF\n\nEditor..................Jeanette Dunstan....Gr. 8\nAss.

But I am sure they would appreciate far more the knowledge that in the years to come we shall try to uphold the standards they have set for us. It has been quite an easy task while they have been helping us but it will be more difficult in the future.

Do not be content with a grade-eight standing. That is just the first milestone in your education.

In October we chose four teams - the Black Hawks, the Rangers, the Hornets, and the Leafs. We played two games a week.\n\nAt the end of each month the two teams that had won the most games played for that month's Grand Championship. Near the end of the season we played two exhibition games, and the last game was for the school championship. The Black Hawks and the Rangers played for this and the former won by two points.\n\nAlthough there were a few accidents, such as broken glasses and wrist-watches, the games were thoroughly enjoyed by both the players and the spectators. At the end of the season all the points were added up for each player with Roddy Tait coming first - 140 points; Albert Wells second - 120 points, and Eddie Boston third - 55 points.\n\nGood sportsmanship was shown by all players and there were no fights throughout the season; the losers were just as happy as the winners.\n\n=Albert Wells\n\"The Dragon\"\n\nThe 24th of May\n\nAs it had been raining for three days we were a bit worried when we got up on the morning of the twenty-fourth of May and found that it was still cloudy, but soon the sun began to shine so everybody brightened up. After we had lunch packed, we started out for the field beside the swimming pool where we were to have our sports events.\n\nBefore we had our dinner we were divided into groups. The No. 2 and 3 girls and boys were together although the girls started to crowd away trying to get as far from the boys as possible until one of the staff said, \"Now, don't they boys are not going to bite you.\" We soon mixed together playing British Bulldog. After a few games we sat in two circles for our lunch. We had run so much playing games that we were very hungry. Marjorie Alan broke the record by eating six winners smothered in mustard.\n\nAfter we had finished our meal we marched around in a circle so the Hives could take our picture, then we started the various events.\n\nSome of the highlights of the day were:\n\n- The fish-pond where you could fish for necklaces, combs and other things with a magnet.\n- No. One boys' cracker eating race which was won by Ranger Scymour, of course.\n- No. 3 girls' standing broad jump won by Joan Thom, 7 ft. in, nearly breaking the boys' record of 7 ft. 7 in.\n- The No. 3 boys' high jump was really a surprise won by Johnny Joe who cleared 4 ft. 7 in.\n- The boys one mile race was a hot and long one won by Reddy Tait followed up by Wesley \"Squash\" Munroe.\n- The last and most exciting event was the greasy pole climbed by the one and only Oliver \"Blondie\" Munroe.\n\n\u2014Phyllis Dunstan\n\nWesley: Norman, what three word sentence do you always use?\n\nNorman: I don't know.\n\nWesley: You're right!\nTHE DRAGON\n\nKIWANIS HOBBY SHOW\n\nOn March 28th, news was passed around that three boys were going to Vancouver to see the Kiwanis Hobby Show. Who the boys were we did not know. That night Mr. Hives told us who was going to go and why he had chosen those three boys - Roddy Tait, Geoffrey San, and Albert Wells.\n\nOn April 1st we started for Vancouver at three o'clock in the morning. The ride lasted for about five and a half hours. We were teasing Jeff about the farmer going to the city for this was the first time he had been to Vancouver.\n\nWhen we arrived in Vancouver we waited for Mr. Hives to come and pick us up at the station. He told Mr. Hill, our manual training instructor, to take us around to the big stores and then down to the Hobby Show.\n\nAfter we had been through the stores and bought what we wanted, we walked over to the Show - about a three mile walk. We enjoyed the walk, however, for we saw many interesting things, such as the Burrard Bridge and Burrard Inlet. When we arrived at the exhibition building it was closed but after we explained where we came from they let us see all the other exhibits. We saw many interesting things there. There were locomotive engines that could pull five people around the room. The engine itself stood no higher than a foot off the floor and the engineer sat on top of the engine and fed it coal with a teaspoon. There was also woodwork, such as we sent in, and leather work from the Coquuletza Indian Hospital, totem poles, war equipment, plastic work, and many other displays. An odd hobby one boy had was collecting umbrella handles.\n\nWhen the final results were known, we found that our school had taken third prize. In the individual work Donnie McIntyre took first, David Albert second, Norman Bustace third, and Roddy Tait third.\n\n--Albert Wells\nTHE DRAGON\n\nSOCIAL EVENTS\n\nOUR HALLOWE'EN PARTY\n\nScenes around the school showed that Hallowe'en was only two weeks away. The whole school was humming with activity. Mr. Hives had bought some crepe paper so the girls started their costumes\u2014cutting, fitting, and then sewing them. Everyone was busy and if you had walked around you would have heard someone say, \"Where's my needle?\" or another, \"Who has the other sleeve of my blouse?\" On the boys side you might have heard someone say, \"Hey Jeff, where did you get the horse hair for your beard?\" I swiped it from you last night,\" was the answer. Costumes were of all sorts\u2014painted cannibals, blood-thirsty pirates, a wicked witch with his black cat, lovely Mistress Mary.\n\nThe Assembly Hall was eerily decorated with pumpkins at the windows, while black cats and witches roved the walls.\n\nAt last the longed-for night arrived and those that had costumes ready put them on. Everyone went into the hall and the parade of costumes began. The high school teacher from Lytton was the judge, and she had a difficult time choosing the winners. After the lucky ones were chosen and prizes given to the four smaller ones, the number ones played games before going downstairs for their refreshments. The older ones then had square dances and modern dancing. Prizes were awarded to the winners and refreshments were served. The party ended with the singing of \"Now the Day is Over.\"\n\n\u2014Donna Bent\n\nTHE CHRISTMAS SEASON\n\nThe feeling we had that Christmas was near began about five weeks before the holidays when the children started practising for the Christmas Concert. It was well worth the time and effort for it was a great success. From the Kinder garden's Mother Goose to the Senior Class' Christmas Carol each item was thoroughly enjoyed. There were thrilling physical training displays, while the Boys' Shoe Shop play and song caused much laughter.\n\nWe were told by our principal that some of the children would be going home for a two-week holiday. This kept us all in suspense as to whether we were going or not. All was quiet while Mr. Hives read the list of the parents who wished to have their children home for Christmas but most of us were smiling when we came out of the hall.\n\n(mont. next p.c.)\n\"The Christmas Season\" cont.\n\nThe twentieth of December was the day the children were to leave. Everyone was rushing around getting their things ready and wondering if the afternoon would ever come. When they finally did leave, everything was quiet.\n\nThe children who didn't go home had treats. They saw a movie called \"Tom Sawyer\". On Christmas morning the girls woke up to find large panda bears at the foot of each bed. They went to the Assembly Hall where a lovely Christmas tree stood. Soon Santa Claus came and wished them a Merry Christmas and distributed the gifts. On the twenty-seventh Christmas they had a party. Although there were not many children everyone had a nice time.\n\nJeanette Dunstan\n\nOUR EASTER PARTY\n\nOne morning Mr. Hives told us that he had a surprise waiting for us. Nearly everyone guessed the right answer\u2014a party on the evening of March 30th.\n\nEveryone was getting ready for it as the hours of the day passed. Right at the last minute someone would say, \"My clothes, my clothes, where are my clothes?\"\n\nWe had the usual fox-trots, square dances and waltzes\u2014the last were much too slow for the jitterbugs. We also played a game called \"Rolling the Cat\" which caused much laughter among the children who were watching it. We always enjoy those parties so the children were pleased when Mr. Hives said that we would be having more of them. \u2014Joan Thom\n\"I REMEMBER, I REMEMBER\"\n\nI remember, I remember,\nIn so many different ways,\nAll the work and all the fun,\nThat made up Laundry days.\nWe had our laundry matron\nTo watch that things went right,\nBut she always worked and helped us\nTo make our work more light.\nWe girls all worked so happily,\nAnd sometimes laughed a lot,\nBut even when our work piled up\nWe finished on the dot.\n\nI remember, I remember,\nThe meals we used to make,\nThe porridge, soup, and sausages,\nThe pudding and the cake.\nIt seemed a tedious task at times\nAnd yet it gave us joy,\nTo think that we'd prepared a meal,\nTo please each girl and boy.\n\nI remember, I remember,\nHow oft I used to dream,\nWhen I was in the sewing room\nStitching a long, long time.\nThere our matron taught us all\nThe things that we should know,\nAnd when we're in our homes someday\nWe'll know just how to sew.\n\"I REMEMBER, I REMEMBER\", cont.\n\nI remember, I remember,\nThe gym wherein I played,\nWhere we exercised so vigorously\nThat the whole gymnasium\nswayed.\nWe were taught to use the parallel\nbars,\nTo tumble, jump, and run,\nTo play basketball was a great\ndelight,\nSo we had plenty of fun.\n\nI remember, I remember,\nThe classroom bright and cool,\nThe many pleasant things I did\nWhen I attended school.\nThe hours flew by like silver wings,\nAs many a page I turned,\nAnd dreamed about the countries strange,\nAnd thought of things I learned.\n\nI remember, I remember,\nThe manual training shop,\nThe many things I learned\nto make,\nThe axe I used to chop.\nThat's where we had to mend\nthe chairs.\nWe stayed there half a day.\nWe learned to tie some\nknots\nAnd then, we put our tools\naway.\n\"I REMEMBER, I REMEMBER, cont.\"\n\nI remember, I remember,\nThe fresh green things on earth,\nThe apples, beans, and peaches, too,\nThe young things God gave birth;\nThe cows we milked, the poultry fed,\nThe lambs that frolicked free;\nLet others have their city life -\nThe farm's the place for me!\n\n\"Do I have to be a pig all my life?\"\nTHE DRAGON\n\nTHE CHURCH CORNER\n\nThanksgiving Service:\n\nOn Thanksgiving Day we had our regular Festival Service. The church was beautifully decorated with farm produce and flowers as well as colourful autumn leaves. Everyone that was able attended the service.\n\nChristmas Services:\n\nOn Christmas Eve we had our Candlelight Service. From each window wreathed in holly and ivy shone five lighted candles, while the altar was decorated with lovely flowers. Our choir numbering eighteen, sang Christmas carols and the congregation joined in singing Christmas hymns. Miss Hives sang a beautiful solo entitled \"Jesus Bambino.\" On Christmas Eve we had our midnight Holy Communion.\n\nEpiphany:\n\nOn January 6th, the Lord Bishop of our Diocese came to hear us sing our Christmas carols. We sang a variety of hymns and carols while Miss Hives repeated her solo of Christmas Eve. Before the Bishop gave his address, he mentioned that we sang lovelier every time he heard us.\n\nServices Before and After Easter:\n\nDuring the Lenten Season we held our Wednesday evening services at 7:30 p.m. On Easter morning we had Holy Communion and then Evensong and Sermon in the afternoon. There were some beautiful flowers on the altar and organs. We did not have Holy Communion on Ascension Day as Church Hives was away, but we had Holy Communion on the morning of Whitsunday and Evensong and Sermon in the afternoon.\n\n--Marjorie Alice\n\nTHE GIRLS' AUXILIARY\n\nUnder the leadership of Miss Hives and their supervisor the Girls Auxiliary held its first meeting of this term on Oct. 9th; they elected their officers and have met every alternate week.\n\nOne of our most interesting meetings was on February 23, when Miss Watt a missionary from China came and attended the W.I. meeting to which all the members of the G.A. were invited. She told them about her work over in China and also taught them how to sing \"Jesus Loves Me\" in Chinese.\n\nThe girls all did their part in sewing and knitting for the sale which was held on Wednesday, June 16th. Some did table cloths, dresser sets, dish towels, knitted socks,\n\n(cont. on next page)\n\"The Dragon\"\n\n(The Girls' Auxiliary, cont.)\n\nsweaters, and baby things. Mrs. Hives did a great deal of work for the Girls' Auxiliary, contributing greatly to the success of the sale. The W.M. also sold sewing and baking, while the latter was also sold to the children in the dining room. Tea was served on the lawn with the girls waiting on table. Canon Hives had charge of the fishpond which was very popular with the children. Altogether the day was a great success.\n\n--John Thom\n\nLyttelton - 1970\n\nTwo weeks holiday - and what should I do with it? Suddenly I thought of my school days and my school pals. At that moment I decided to come up to Lyttelton and St. George's School. It was twenty years since I had last seen Lyttelton. I went outside and jumped into my car.\n\nAs I drove into town I saw a man and woman coming up the street with a little boy. I suppose it was their son. I pulled over to the sidewalk to ask them where I could find Mr. D. McIntyre and I nearly jumped out of the car when I saw who it was. It was Wesley Lumree and his wife and child. Both Wes and his wife were in school at the same time as I. After a bit of talking Wes told me where I could find Dennis McIntyre.\n\nI drove down the street a little farther and came to a sign that read:\n\nIF YOU WANT A TOOTH PULLED\nSEE\nTHE BEST DENTIST IN TOWN\nD.R. D. MCINTYRE\n410 MAPLE STREET\n\nI was standing looking at this sign when a man walked over to me and asked me if I wanted to buy any life insurance. I told him \"no\" and said that I was already insured.\n\n\"But your car isn't insured,\" he replied.\n\nAs soon as I heard him say that, I knew who it was. It was Geoffrey Sute. He was always trying to make money when he was in school, and he's never changed a bit since then. I asked him if he would come over with me to see our old pal Dennis.\n\nAs we were about to leave, someone came over and tapped on the window of my car. Without looking out to see who it was, I said, \"What do you want?\"\n\n(cont. on the next page)\n\"The Dragon\"\n\n(Lytton, 1970, cont.)\n\n\"You've been parking here for more than fifteen minutes and the parking limit is only ten minutes,\" he replied.\n\nI stuck my head out of the car to see who it was. I knew that it was a policeman, and I thought I recognized the voice, but he knew me first.\n\nHe said, \"Well, I'll be a flat-footed cop, if it isn't Albert Wells?\"\n\n\"What do you know, Jeff?\" I answered. \"It's Norman Bustace in a policeman's uniform.\"\n\nI asked Norman if he knew where Phyllis Dunstan, Jeannette Dunstan, Loretta Smith or Violet Dunstan were. He told me that they were all married and had nice homes in Lytton. Then Norman said, \"Do you remember John Thom and Romona Bent?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think I do,\" I answered.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"They are working at St. George's School.\"\n\nWe soon forgot about the ticket that Norman was going to give me. Norman said that he was just going off duty so I asked him if he would come with Jeff and myself to see Dennis.\n\nWhile we were driving down the street asking about what we had been doing since we left school, I heard a loud noise coming from behind the car. Then suddenly, a truck went by like a shot.\n\n\"What looks like the old St. George's truck, doesn't it, Norman?\" I remarked.\n\n\"It is,\" replied Norman, \"and can you guess who is driving it?\"\n\n\"Is it Mr. Vaughan-Jones?\" I asked. \"He was always driving it when we were in school.\"\n\nNorman began to laugh and then he said, \"No, I'm afraid I'll have to tell you. It was Johnny Joe. He has been driving that same truck and has worked at St. George's for the last fifteen years.\"\n\nFinally we came to Dennis's house. I stopped the car and all three of us walked up to the door. I knocked, and a nurse answered. I recognized her first, but she did not know who I was. It was Corinne Jumbo.\n\n\"Is Mr. McIntyre in?\" I asked.\n\"THE DRAGON\"\n\n(LYTTON, 1970, cont.)\n\n\"Yes, he is, but he is very busy at the moment,\" said Corinne, \"won't you come in and wait?\"\n\nI said that we would. As soon as we walked in, do you know what we saw? Angeline Edmonds was sitting in the dentist's chair while Annie Frank and Donna Bent were trying to hold her there, and Donnie was standing on a soap box so he could reach into her mouth. Thelma Raphael was sitting on the side watching the fun.\n\nAfter we had all said, \"Hello\" to each other, Donnie invited us to stay for supper. Throughout the meal we kept saying, \"Remember this\" and \"Remember that\" and \"Remember when such-and-such happened\" about our good old school days at St. George's.\n\n\u2014Albert Wells\n\nTUBERCULOSIS POSTER CONTEST\n\nThis year, as before, the British Columbia Tuberculosis Society sponsored a poster contest amongst the children of Day and Residential Indian Schools.\n\nThe Society's silver cup, won last year by Alberni Residential School, was awarded this year to our own school. This cup is given to the school submitting the best poster which was Frank Henry's of Grade 6.\n\nFrank also won the silver cup and five dollars for submitting the best poster in the individual class for residential schools.\n\nThree additional cash prizes were awarded to every school submitting at least four posters. Since Frank had already won in the individual work, second prize of three dollars was won by Ramona Bent, Grade 8, and third prize of two dollars by Florence Kirkpatrick, Grade 2.\nHappy Holiday\n\nWe have reached the end of the school year; another one has faded away and how fast! You remember children, how long the ten months seemed to you last fall? But the days slipped by, one after another, leaving behind the cold winter, to reach the pleasant spring that brought back birds and songs, life and joy.\n\nBefore walking out on the 24th for the summer holidays, we shall say a hearty thank you to the teachers and also to every one, sisters, brothers and fathers who so devotedly gave the best of themselves to show you the way to become good christian girls and boys. Take along with you their good advice and treasure the memory of the fine examples they set for you.\n\nAs you did at school, do your duty now, at home, happy to be of some use to your parents. Make life pleasant for every one, parents, sisters and brothers. Good you are, I know it; be really good, polite and pleasant. No matter what others do or say, show that your hearts are strong and brave, ever standing up for what is right, good and true. It is indeed what we are, not what we appear to be that counts and gives us happiness.\n\nGoodbye, dear children, God bless you. Though you'll be out of school, you will still be present in my heart and my prayers.\n\nIle a la Crosse,\nJune 16, 1948.\n\nFr. Guy Remy, O.M.I.\nIle \u00e0 la Grosse Invaded\n\nFriday morning, June 18th, the citizens of our little community heard again, as they were called to their doors by the sound of the school bell, that there was an unusual commotion in the streets. They found that the school had been invaded by the teachers and pupils of the school.\n\nThe pupils, armed with sticks and stones, had broken into the school building and were causing a great deal of destruction. The teachers, however, were able to control the situation and restore order.\n\nThe next day, the school was reopened and classes resumed as usual.\n\nPicnics Three\n\nThree will fly out on June 24th: Sr. L. Brouley and Miss B. de Th\u00e9ophile will attend the University of Saskatchewan at Saskatoon; Mrs. Paul Levesque will attend the University of Alberta at Edmonton; and Miss B. B. will attend the University of British Columbia at Vancouver.\n\nTeachers on Holiday\n\nAs soon as break-up was over, the children definitely became picnic-minded. Sibling school at the University of Saskatchewan, the birds here were very busy preparing for the big event. Sr. Teresa's present in her garden, and the boys brought turn to her for a second picnic. Picnic according to plan, enriched by the experience of the previous year.\n\nThe day dawned with weather by a host of new friends. With the gratitude of the mission made-to-order, Rev. Fathers staff, Sr. Brady and Y. Levesque will be back with us in September\u2014we're happy. We're happy. We're happy.\n\n\"An ounce of help is better than a pound of preaching,\" Father Guy Buriot, beardless, said.\nCambrian areas of the province. Kirkness, Jos. Pavel, Jos. McNeil, Henry McCallum, Alex & Celestine McCay, Flora Chartier found out that even the natives Mr. & Mrs. McNabley, Martin Alcorm, Mathilda Jane and little Tippie who keep body and soul together. They found a stopping place at Hosallie Alcorm back from P.A. Mrs. McNeil's C.S. shower and after 16 mos. in the Sand. Mr. Belanger called them to Snake Lake, Rile Iron, Annie Buffalo Narrows and Canoe Lake. Johnson, Ton & John Notenaggen. These fine young gentlemen from Pachnuk, Mr. & Mrs. Kenny surprised to find a northern settlement the size of Ile a la Grosse. They liked it and Bell, Bull and Mrs. Black.

E. Kerans\nMadge la P. Grantham\n(Teachers)\nNEW LIFE\n\nNow that we can see that Spring is really here and everything around is bursting into New Life, let us take a look at things which can be done to bring us back to health and give us New Life.\n\nLet us suppose that you broke a leg bone. What would you do to make that leg strong and useful again? First of all, it would have to be \"set\"\u2014that is, put in the right position. Secondly, it would have to be kept in that position either by splints or a cast until the bone had healed itself.\n\nWhen your lung is diseased with Tuberculosis, a very similar thing is done. First of all, your lung is rested by resting your whole body. You know that if someone runs very fast, they have to breathe very quickly. Their lungs have to work extra hard to make up for the energy they used in running. So when you rest completely in bed, your lungs do not have to work hard and have a better chance to fight the disease. However, this takes a very long time and sometimes this is not enough. Then we have to do something else to rest your lung\u2014just as a broken bone has to be put in a splint.\n\nThe first thing that we try is Pneumothorax. That is a long word but it simply means that we put air in between the chest wall and the lung, and that holds the lung in a collapsed position. It looks something like this:\n\n```\nCHEST WALL\nAIR\nLUNG\n```\n\nYou can see how the lung takes up much less space after the air has been put in. It is held in that position until the lung has overcome all T.B. germs and so healed itself.\n\nAnother way to collapse the lung is to put air in the belly so that the lung is collapsed from below instead of from the side, like this:\n\n```\nLUNG\nAIR\nLUNG\nAIR\n```\n\nThis method is known as Pneumoperitoneum.\n\n(Continued, next page)\nNEW LIFE\n(Continued)\n\nThese two ways are the simplest methods of \"splinting\" the lungs; but they are not always sufficient. If these methods fail, then some other way has to be tried. This method I will try to explain to you next month. The idea is always the same, however, - to find some way of keeping the lung at rest in one position - some way of \"putting the lung in a splint\" - so that it can rest completely and heal itself.\n\nREMEMBER - a broken leg won't heal if you walk on it, and a diseased lung won't heal unless you REST it!\n\nH. Meltzer,\nMedical Director.\n\nA TRIBUTE TO THE LATE FATHER FLANIGAN\n\n- Father M. Murphy,\nSt. Andrew's.\n\nFather Flanigan, who established the famous Boys Town near Omaha, Nebraska, has been reported dead. Father Flanigan had been taken to the United States Zone of Germany to work for the re-establishment of German youth. He has been known and revered for his work and sacrifice in reclaiming wayward boys and has met with outstanding success in this field. So many important men in the United States owe their position in society to his care and understanding of problem boys. His famous dictum is that there is no such thing as a bad boy! It is with sincere regret that we learn of his passing. The world has too few who devote their lives and their all to the welfare of humanity.\n\nWHO LOVES HIS COUNTRY\n\nWho loves his country will not rest\nContent with vow and pledge alone,\nBut flies her banner in his breast\nAnd counts her destiny his own.\n\nHe is not satisfied to claim\nAs heritage her power and fame,\nBut, striving, earns the right to wear\nThe shining honor of her name.\n\n- Nancy Byrd Turner\nEMPIRE DAY\n\nOnce again Empire Day is here. Our country has now grown to the status of nationhood. By the statute of Westminster passed by the British Parliament in 1930, Canada became a completely self-governing country, bound to the Mother Country only by the silken thread of allegiance to a common Crown.\n\nThis does not mean, however, that Canada is any less a member of the British Empire - or the British Commonwealth of Nations - than she has ever been. Unity may be achieved by co-operation, just as well as by compulsion, and sometimes even better than by compulsion. The people of Canada and the Mother Country are one kindred. They inherit the same traditions, and they bear allegiance to the same throne.\n\nEmpire Day is a day when we should rejoice over the fact that we live in Canada, where we have peace and plenty, and should be thankful that we are a member of this great Commonwealth of Nations, which is such a force for world peace today.\n\nNATIONAL ANTHEM\n\nGod save our gracious King\nLong live our noble King,\nGod save the King:\nSend him victorious,\nHappy and glorious,\nLong to reign over us;\nGod save the King.\n\nThy choicest gifts in store\nOn him be pleased to pour;\nLong may he reign:\nMay he defend our laws,\nAnd ever give us cause\nTo sing with heart and voice,\nGod save the King.\n\nOur loved Dominion bless\nWith peace and happiness\nFrom shore to shore;\nAnd let our Empire be\nUnited, loyal, free,\nTrue to herself and Thee\nFor evermore.\n\nRobert Murray,\n1832-1909\n\nDedication of the Protestant Chapel will take place on Friday, May 21, at 3.45 P.M. There will be present Bishop Barfoot representing the Anglican Communion and Reverend Angus MacQueen, the United Church Communion. Anglican Confirmation service will follow the dedication.\n\n(Signed) Rev. Canon Clough\nRev. J.F. Woodsworth\nJames Bay is a long narrow, shallow sea extending south from Hudson Bay into the northern parts of Ontario and Quebec. Over a dozen mighty rivers, pouring fresh water constantly into it, make this sea less salty than most other oceans.\n\nThis section of Canada is rich in history. Nearly three hundred years ago two French trappers travelled about eight hundred miles from Montreal, by canoe and portage, and then in winter by overshoe, to be the first white men to see James Bay. They returned with stories of the vast wealth of beaver and tales about the friendly Indians found along the shores of this new ocean.\n\nFrench traders of New France would not finance these two men as they wished; they therefore went to England and convinced the King to send a ship to this new land of wealth. This sailing vessel found its way through the Arctic waters of Hudson Strait and Hudson Bay. It wintered in James Bay and returned a year later laden with furs. The King of England then granted a charter to certain of his noblemen to form a trading company. To these men he gave possession of all the lands which we knew as Canada, excepting that part then under the rule of France. He did not, of course, realize the extent of his gift.\nJAMES BAY INDIANS\n(Continued)\n\nThe French, when they found out what they had missed, took warlike means to regain it. For many years battles were fought on the shores and waters of James Bay for the right to trade furs with the Indians who lived there. Sometimes the French and sometimes the English won the fights but finally the now historic Hudson's Bay Company emerged victorious. To-day they still carry on a thriving fur trading business in the same James Bay, which was the beginning of this trading empire. From points in James Bay these early traders travelled by foot and canoe to gradually discover the vast area of our present Canada.\n\nFor many years James Bay was reached only by the Arctic water route. Sailing vessels from England brought traders and their goods to isolated settlements and returned with a cargo of valuable furs. As the southern parts of Ontario and Quebec developed the river routes became well travelled by flotillas of large canoes carrying men and supplies. Slowly the railroad was built toward the north and about eighteen years ago finally reached James Bay where the new town of Moosonee was begun. The river and the Arctic water routes were then abandoned. Aeroplane service is now an almost daily occurrence to any point in the area so that the people who once were weeks and months of hard travelling away from civilization can now be reached in a matter of hours.\n\nThis is the FIRST of a SERIES of articles on the James Bay Indians, by Dr. T.J. Orford, which will appear each month in the Camsell Arrow.\n\nA Confirmation Service was held in the Protestant Chapel on Friday afternoon at 3.45 o'clock. At this service Esther Big Bull and Doris Kikpak, Ward IV, were confirmed by Bishop Barfoot.\n\nBen Knockleby, one of our D.V.A. patients, experienced the thrill, not long ago, of having a perfect cribbage hand, with a score of 291.\n\n\"Who would not be out-of-door,\nNow that spring is here once more?\"\n- Bliss Carman\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE\n18th February, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Clifton,\n\nThe two gold bracelets which you, and the Hartley Bay Indians of which you are Chief, have so kindly sent me as a wedding present are very beautiful indeed and I am extremely pleased with them. I have read with great interest the story which explains the legend of the Sun and his descendants, represented by the carvings on the bracelets, and I should like you and the Hartley Bay Indians to know how delighted I am by the loyalty, affection and good wishes for my happiness which accompany their present.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThese bracelets, richly carved and bearing insignia of the legendary powers of heaven and earth, were sent to Ottawa by Indian Agent F.E. Anfield, on behalf of the Hartley Bay Band, and forwarded to London by the Department of the Secretary of State. There are about 148 Indians at Hartley Bay which lies 87 miles south of Prince Rupert, B.C.\n\nFrom-\nDOMAR - A Monthly Staff News Digest\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOur flag, the Union Jack, has been formed from the three original flags of England, Scotland and Ireland - the Cross of St. George, the Cross of St. Andrew and the Cross of St. Patrick. In 1603, upon the death of his cousin, Elizabeth, Queen of England, James VI, King of Scotland, became also King James I, of England. He combined the Jacks of England and Scotland into one flag. Each country continued to fly its own flag on some occasions and the new flag at certain other times. This flag was known as the \"additional\" flag of James I. In the year, 1707, in the reign of Queen Anne, the Parliaments of England and Scotland were finally brought into Union in one Parliament. The flag of James I was accepted with a few small changes, and became the first fully authorized \"Union Jack\". During all these centuries the red cross of St. Patrick had continued alone. But the time came when another change was made in the Union Jack, and in 1801, under George III, the red cross of Ireland joined the sister crosses, resulting in the Union Jack as we know it today.\n\n- History of the Union Jack\nBarlow Cumberland\nREWARD HEROISM OF ESKIMO YOUTH\n\nHeroic attempt of 15-year-old Donald Ayalik, an Eskimo, to rescue Patsy Klenegburg from a burning boat at Cambridge Bay in the Arctic in 1946 was recognized at a service in the chapel in the Charles Camsell hospital Sunday.\n\nWith other Eskimo patients and medical and nursing staff attending, Rt. Rev. W.F. Barfoot, Anglican Bishop of Edmonton, presented Donald with the Royal Humane Association's honorary testimonial for his act of heroism.\n\nThe script was read by Bishop Barfoot while Donald listened intently from his stretcher. It recited the youth's brave but unsuccessful attempt to make the rescue.\n\nSuffering severe burns, the lad was rushed to Coppermine where he was treated by Rev. Canon J.H. Webster, who has been carrying on missionary work in that area for more than 20 years.\n\nThe patient then was flown to Yellowknife for further medical attention, after which he was brought to the Charles Camsell hospital here. He has been in the hospital for 18 months.\n\nThe service in the hospital chapel was attended by Dr. H. Meltzer, Medical Director, Dr. E.L. Stone, Regional Superintendent, and others. Rev. J.F. Woodsworth, former principal of the Industrial School north of Edmonton, read the prayer.\n\nThe R.H.A. certificate was received by Canon Webster and brought back to Edmonton by Bishop Barfoot on his return from a recent Arctic tour.\n\nWe are all pleased, with Mrs. Lawrence, of our staff, over the success of her son, Bob.\n\nEdmonton Bulletin, May 17.\n\nAt Longview, Washington, Bob was named winner of the oratorical contest at the 14th annual district convention of the Optimist International. Bob, a student of the McCauley Intermediate School, won the Alberta elimination contest here, in March. He is a member of the Junior Optimist Club of Edmonton. He resides with his widow mother at 10753-97 St. Late in June he will journey to San Antonio, Texas, to compete with 21 other boys from all across the North American continent in the finals of the Optimist contest. The prize for the final winning will be a gold watch.\nMr. and Mrs. Meltzer left on Thursday, May 20, for points in eastern Canada. They will be away for six weeks.\n\nWe regret that Dr. Orford is confined to his home through illness. We all wish him a speedy recovery.\n\nDr. and Mrs. R.M. Lane have taken up residence in Unit 5. They have two young children, Ken and Mary. Dr. Lane will be a member of the staff of the hospital for the next few months.\n\nWe wish to welcome Miss Rosalie Gent, a new nurse, to the staff.\n\nThe staff held a very enjoyable party at the home of Mrs. Wood on Friday, May 7, in honour of Miss Zaremba and Miss Pomrenk, two members of the nursing staff, who are leaving soon to be married. Many lovely gifts were \"showered\" upon them. Attractive prizes for the most original costumes were given to Miss M. Cogill and Miss B. Aimer.\n\nAt the tea hour on Wednesday, May 19, the staff honoured Miss Bartman, Miss Pomrenk and Miss Kinderwater. Miss Taylor presented each guest with a farewell gift. Miss Bartman is leaving shortly for Wellington, New Zealand, to accept a position in the Wellington Hospital. Miss Kinderwater has accepted a position in St. Joseph's Hospital, Bellingham, Washington, U.S.A. Miss Marjorie Fazackerley, who has been with us for some months, will take charge of the dietetic department of the hospital. She has been assisting Miss Bartman in this department.\n\nOur apologies to Roy Miner for calling him Jack in the last issue of the paper!\n\nMr. Johnnie Bridgen left this week to take over a store on the south side.

I was pleased to see Tom Goose there, too.\n\n\u2014 Sarah Kaptana\n\nOne night at bedtime Doris was reading her autographs and she dropped her little rabbit. \"Where is my little rabbit?\" she said. \"Why, here I am!\" said a voice from the other side of the partition. IT WAS ALICE BLACK RABBIT!\n\nSarah was making topless socks and putting the tops on afterwards. Sarah says it is easy to do this and she wishes it was as easy to get cured of the T.B. as it is to do this seemingly impossible thing!\nW A R D VII\n\nThe children in Ward VII and VIII wish to thank the Rev. Miller of the Highlands United Church, and Mrs. Cobblewick, President of the Church Society, for the shows and icecream treats which they have been bringing to them during the winter months.\n\nIn the five months I have been in the hospital I have learned how fortunate we Indians, from all parts of the country, are to be able to come to such a hospital for the best treatment of tuberculosis and many other kinds of sicknesses. Most of all we are fortunate to be under the care of such experienced doctors who do such remarkable work. The nurses, too, do a wonderful work in comforting the patients when they are very sick, and I say the same for the Aids and Orderlies. I'm sure we have all learned to co-operate and to obey orders, even if they seem grim. We are doing it only for our own good and we should feel proud of ourselves if we co-operate with the staff.\n\nWe guys in Ward VII wish all the patients in the hospital a speedy recovery.\n\nKilroy.\n\nW A R D IX A\n\nWe wish to send our best regards to Robert Onespott, who has been moved to Ward X A.

He has just been admitted to the hospital.\n\nBen Adams has been putting on a lot of weight. He is feeling fine and is looking forward to a higher routine.\n\nWe admire James Klalazee and Harry Nedlin. They are in the front when it comes to fun and singing but they also know when to be quiet, and co-operative at the right time.\n\n(Continued)\nWARD IX B (Continued)\n\nJohn Tammery was back with us for a couple of days but has left us again for Ward IX A.\n\nJohn Seseequon seems to miss Mr. Tammery. Why not return to us?\n\nBill M. and Simon J. and everyone else is doing fine.\n\nWARD X A\n\nHello friends, What better can I wish you than that you will all be back with your parents and relatives soon! And once again we wish to thank all the doctors and the nurses for the splendid treatment we are getting. We miss Harry Martin from the ward. He has just had an operation. We are lucky to have Roy Hunter and Robert Onespott with us.\n\n- Richard Dick\n\nWell, I can understand Jimmie's incredible story about the big storm. They do happen sometimes. It's hard to believe, but one day I was working with a half-breed guy, Louzon Gladue, late in the autumn. The ducks had not gone to the far south to the warm country. Louzon was looking for his lost horses and came to a small lake. It was full of ducks! He came back hastily for his shot-gun. Taking a few shells he ran back to the lake. When he got close he could see the ducks were still sitting in the very same spot. So he took aim and shot. Bang! Bang! Bang! Finally after the third shot the ducks flew from the ice and to his surprise he saw that each duck was carrying off a big piece of ice stuck to each foot! After that the ice in the little lake was all opened up again.\n\nI also agree with our friends, Jack Royal and Fred Lafferty, in their praise of the doctors and the staff. We thank them and wish them good luck. We also thank our nice kind teachers who help us and keep us supplied with reading material. We are very interested in our library reading. Thanks to all.\n\n- Robert Laboucon\n\nHello to everyone! We are all fine, - good health and happiness to you all!\n\nGlad to welcome back Richard Black, who is an old-timer, to our ward.\n\nWe are all looking forward to July. We hear we are to have a picnic that month.\nHunting season is on in our ward! The first big game was killed by G. Tecomba on May 3. It was a Moose\u2014quito!\n\nModeste Piche has a habit of singing songs which he has learned from the radio programs. He enjoys the one called, \"There's a Love Knot in my Lariat\". Modeste sings it this way: \"There's a Tough Knot in my Harriets\".\n\nDear friends, it is indeed a pleasure to give you news of our ward. We are still the same jolly bunch taking the cure as best we can. We're lucky to have two fiddlers, Fred Lafferty and Eddie Lafleur and a couple of guitar players. \"Keep it up, boys. Keep on the sunny side of life and chase the dark clouds away.\" Eddy Lafleur and Fred Lafferty are lucky boys, having visitors every once a week.\n\nWe have a concert every night with Eddy Lafleur, the North West Troubadour from Yellow Knife as chief performer. Hope all the rest of you are as well and happy and jolly as we are! You'll be hearing from us next month. Best regards to all and a fast recovery.\n\n- The Boys of Ward X B.\n\nFLAG USAGE\n\nThe nationality of a country is shown by its flag.\n\nThe nationality of a vessel is made known by the flag she flies at the stern.\n\nTo hoist the flag of one nation under that of another nation, on the same flag-staff, is to show it disrespect.\n\nThe lowering of a flag is a signal of surrender.\n\nThe raising of the victor's flag in its place is a signal of capture.\n\nA flag at half-mast (halfway up its pole) is a sign of mourning.\n\nA flag reversed is a signal of distress.\n\nMiss Such, a former member of the nursing staff, surprised us at the tea hour on Thursday. She is at present taking a course in Davenport, Idaho. She had come on a visit to Edmonton to attend the wedding of her sister.\nA.M.D.G.\n\nGARNIER RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nSPANISH ONTARIO\n\nCALENDAR\n\n1948 - 1949\nSeptember 1948\n\n1. Wed.\n2. Thur.\n3.

Father Rossignol gave his first blessing to the newborn \"Island Breezes\", the brainchild of Sr. A. Blanchette and Sr. A. Brady. A precocious child, to say the least, for in its very first infancy it achieved the distinction of being not only a chronicle of local events, but also a link between the school children and those who had formerly occupied the same well-worn desks and sweated over similar tasks. The following year, Sr. M.A. Bisson picked up the editorial pen and wielded it until 1946.\n\nDuring these first years, guest articles in Cree, French and English were contributed by Rev. Guy Remy, Mr. H. Staines, Dr. P. Lavoie, Mr. E. Benoit, to name only a few. Re-reading the back copies in order, one can visualize the recent steady expansion of both mission and hamlet. One must stop to bow before a host of distinguished visitors from all walks of life whose short or long sojourn on the Island was faithfully recorded alongside the day-by-day activities ranging all the way from inoculations to the welcoming home of veterans of World War II.\n\nIn June 1942, \"Island Breezes\" gave a farewell kiss to the gelatin pad, and the following September warmly embraced the new Gestetner, the gift of His Exc. Bishop M. LaJeunesse. It was the beginning of an enduring friendship. Well and good to make a friend, but how to keep him is a more difficult proposition. Gestetner found a way in June 1946 by giving, for the first time, colour to the breezy little paper's Centennial Edition.\n\nIn September 1946, an attempt was made to classify the material printed in its pages\u2014the same type as of old, but with a New Look. In this make-up did the first paper of the remote areas of Northern Saskatchewan take its first bow in the Saskatchewan Legislative Assembly in March 1948, on its ninth birthday\u2014a novel way to celebrate one's anniversary.\n\n-The Editor.\nThe play took place in a room of the palace of Calaphas before sunrise on Easter morning and portrayed how Jesus affected such people as bringing in two men patients Death and Resurrection of Jesus and Joseph Calaphas (Raymond Ayotte) from Buffalo Narrows. On March 8th he didn't reach Canoe Lake as planned, but 3 days later he did board the plane with two prisoners on their way to P.A.P. He was back here on the 18th.\n\nA group of girls from the special class sang a glorious \"Hallelujah\" which was heard by Indians from Gr. I & II. The Indians sang and arrows came their direction in costume of the good thief Mary Magdalene (George Raymond) Tanah, servant (George Raymond) Jana, a robber (Zephyrin Gardner) Reba, a young girl, the sweetheart of the good thief Mary Magdalene (Edward Desjardins) and a Roman Captain.\n\nThe third school concert of the year was held on the evening of Easter Monday, March 29th as a feast day tribute to Rev. Father Superior G. Reby. The stage was becomingly decorated with flowers in accordance with the Easter festivities and the opening number also provoked laughter when Marcel Lefebvre from Gr. II-III, each holding a rose, expressed words of welcome and presented the older friends. Jimmy Payette, Edward Roy and Sandy Raymond. Their fun was short-lived however for the boys dispersed after the arrival of their father at the Harrison's house.\n\nThen followed a playlet \"Goldlocks\" presented by the Gr. I & II class. Although named M. Clara Orsmond sang their little Goldlocks. Helene Petit invaded the home of Mother Bear, Armand Murray, Bishop of course. In Easter play in two acts by the Senior class. It was a fine performance and the actors richly deserved the compliments they received.\n\nErnest Landry, Baby Bear stole the show.\nPLAY BALL\n\nEvery Sunday when the weather is fine, the young fellows of Ile a la Crosse play a brisk game of softball. Tom Belanger does a fine job of gathering interest in the game. Mr. Stanley Woodard, B.C., brother Joe, and S. Marion also came by truck.\n\nThe Happy-Go-Lucky Islanders Club meets every Friday evening. They are 14 girls who attend the school faithfully. They are Misses: Beatrice Sue Beaumont, Anne C. Bowden, Mary Dunstan, Mildred Horwood, Lela Atchison, Margaret Florence, Sheila and Ethel, Jean, Marguerite, Margery, and Theresa Ray. Since Mrs. Atchison brought her knitting, the girls are showing interest in this hobby. The club is taking a beautiful white pillowcase. Miss Stella is making a table cloth. We will finish the table cloth first, we can knit one for $2 or $3.\n\nThe members of the club are anxiously looking forward to a trip to Beaulieu as soon as the lake is open. They are: Misses: Beatrice Sue Beaumont, Anne C. Bowden, Mary Dunstan, Mildred Horwood, Lela Atchison, Margaret Florence, Sheila and Ethel, Jean, Marguerite, Margery, and Theresa Ray.\n\nMary Atchison, now at Stanley, Sask., writes that carried on just the same, receiving private tuition. In order to finish up the leather work, the classes will be open again after May 15th.\n\nBest regards to H.G.L.I.; the end of the rat season.\n\nGOOD NEWS, BOYS\n\nWhen Father Lemay returns from Canoe Lake he will vote part of his time to the boys' outside activities and games. Just what they had been praying for!\n\nVISITORS\n\nMarch 10th, Mr. W. J. Cobb, Pierre McCauley was in from Depew River to visit his children in boarding school.\n\nApril 7th, Mrs. G. Lariviere from Beauval visited her daughter Suzanne, a boarder.\n\nApril 11th, Mr. MacLester motored in from Meadow Lake on business as usual. Whilst Mrs. Anderson and Mary Pederson came from the lake.\n\nApril 15th, Kurt Georges left his house leaving the poor-stained little ranch long enough to get his mail and supplies here.\n\nIndian Affairs - School Files (RG 10, Volume 6034, File 150-62, part 3)\nABOUT RAT\n\nOn March 14, a first meeting was held in the parish hall to discuss the \"rat\" situation before the opening of the trapping season. 78 able-bodied men, sound of mind and firm of purpose, were there assembled to discuss the different aspects of this \"bread-and-butter\" question. They also wanted to prepare the all-important meeting with the Chief Overseer for fur conservation, Mr. W. Tunstead.\n\nOn March 21, Mr. Tunstead flew in from Portage La Loche, 3 hours behind schedule. The men, 120 strong this time, marched him to the parish hall where also present Mr. C.B. McNeil, Field Officer, Mr. J. Brocker, Game Warden and Rev. J. Kemy.\n\nThe men were satisfied with the assigned quota of rats, provided they can reach it. Married men can trap 165 muskrats, single men 100 and young people 60. Mr. Tunstead granted a larger quota and 5 days longer to the trappers going to the boundaries of Snake Lake and Pachuanak game blocks where beavers were stolen last season. They asked that the first payment be $2, but Mr. Tunstead answered that Regina had decreed that it would be $1... even though Sask. muskrats are second only to Labrador pelts (and are actually being auctioned off as high as $5 a skin). The second payment will be sent in June after auction is over. It is hoped that the Fur Marketing Service does not deal in recent cheques as the Fish Board.\n\nThe men of Ilc a la Crosse also requested that they be given rights to the Kazan Preserve, their former hunting ground. They also asked that greater authority be granted to the deputy game wardens to protect fur in their block against marauders. The deputies were told they were empowered to seize both traps and catch of any trespasser on a block.\n\nOn the whole, the meeting was a satisfactory one. But like the Pied Piper of Hamelin, the men may find it easier to trap the \"rats\" than to secure a fair price for their pelts.\n\nFIRE\n\nAt 1 p.m. on March 8, the home of Mr. & Mrs. J. Penner was entirely destroyed by fire. Joe Landry, Leon Belanger, Charles Malboeuf, J.B. & J.M. & Auguste Darrocher, Jonas Pavel and many others helped to save the furniture. The 2 mission teams on their way to haul wood and Philippe Aubichon's helped to remove the furniture to a safer place. All was saved except the week-old linoleum which had been on back order for months.\n\nMrs. E. Benoit gave hospitality to Mr. & Mrs. Penner and little Julia, whilst Mrs. O.B. McNeil invited in Miss Hilda Schroeder until they could find other lodgings. Later, they rented R.T. Burrough's house. On April 2, Miss H. Schroeder returned to B.C.\n\nISLANDERS ON THE MOVE\n\nMARCH 3: Dr. P. Lavoie was on call at La Loche. He left by plane with 4 discharged patients and brought back 5\u2014all men.\n\n6th: Mr. & Mrs. Watt and Cpl. P. Nightingale left for Canoe Lake on business, by snowmobile. The party had to turn back because of the slush. The mission cat went to their rescue and on the way back all stopped at the Father's residence to warm up. Mr. W. Watt finally made the trip alone two days later with the G. Greening plane.\n\n10th: Dr. Lavoie had slightly better luck. He reached Pachuanak, but on the return trip the snowmobile stalled in the slush. Doctor had to wade through the remaining four miles, dropped in at Mr. Aheenakew's for breakfast while Pete Edison had to keep the engine running until the cat got there to pull him out.\n\n17th: Mr. Francois Burrouf left for St. Paul's Hospital, Saskatoon for surgical treatment. He came back March 31 in much better health.\n\n19th: Mrs. E. Benoit and Miss H. Smekta went to Beauval with the Schneider truck to fetch a load of hay. While the men were busy with pitchforks, the ladies visited the village. The following day they were the hosts of Mr. & Mrs. Walser at Deep River. They came back in time for the Saturday night picture show.\n\n30th: A score of men left for their traplines as the season opens tomorrow\u2014 that's no April fool!\n\nAPRIL lst: Mr. O.B. McNeil, field officer, went to Pachuanak with Mr. Marion in the latter's snowmobile\u2014 surely not on an april fool's errand!\n\n7th: Dr. Lavoie was again on call at La Loche. He went with the mail plane.\n\n10th: Mrs. V. Ayotte left for Prince Albert to visit her 13 year old son, Charlie, a patient in the Sanatorium, whom she hasn't seen since January 1947.\n\n10th: Clement Roy was called to Beauval to the bedside of his mother dangerously ill with pneumonia.

I agree in general with your final comments. On the other hand, I think we should do everything possible to make sure that persons appointed as Welfare teachers are in fact capable of actually doing welfare work. This title should never be given unless we are satisfied that the teacher comes up to the standard that has been set for the classification. From this cross section, I am inclined to think that in some cases, the title has been given to some partly dubious incumbents. In my opinion it would be wise to build even more slowly and more solidly. In the case of welfare teachers we must avoid the old experience of incompetence that has stultified so much of the history of Indian education in the ordinary schools.\nJanuary 28, 1948.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nCOLONEL NEARY --\n\nFor attention and information in connection with future appointments.\n\nC. Hannum\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER.\n\nWelfare Teachers in Indian Schools.\n\nAs requested in your memorandum of 14 January, I present hereunder the reports on certain of our welfare teachers.\n\n(a) In Hospital Schools.\n\nMost of the teachers in these hospital schools are employed on a full twelve month year basis. In practically all instances they live in residence in the hospitals and are on call at all times.\n\nThey are engaged in two main types of teaching activity:\n\n1. Bedside teaching; here a portable blackboard is used and two or three bed patients at a time are instructed. Much of this teaching is to adult Indians who have never been to school before and who learn to read and write for the first time when in hospital.\n\n2. Classroom teaching; here up-patients are taught in a small room set aside for classroom purposes. In inspecting these schools our inspectors have been most satisfied with the results achieved in such classes.\n\nIn both the above instances, the teachers can carry on classes only at times prescribed by the medical superintendent.\n\nThis means that they carry on classes in the evening; on Saturdays and at any other time when they can be fitted in to\nthe hospital programme.\n\nThe medical superintendents of these hospitals have been most enthusiastic about these teachers and their work. Due to their teaching activities they are in close contact with the Indians and win their confidence. As a result they are able to carry out a worthwhile welfare programme in addition to their teaching duties. A few illustrations are:\n\n1. The writing of letters to home reserves, Indian superintendents, residential schools, etc., on behalf of illiterate patients.\n\n2. To advise these Indians concerning family allowances, school attendance of their children and many other matters arising out of such letters.\n\n3. The conduct of adult education projects such as handicrafts, (I enclose samples from Coqualeetza Hospital School) educational films, hospital newspapers (I enclose the Charles Cassell paper), etc., have done a great deal to improve patient morale.\n\n4. Assisting the hospital staff in a programme of health education by presenting in their health lessons the sanitary habits and procedures which the doctors wish the patients to follow when they return to their home reserves.\n\nThe most difficult part of this hospital education is the selection of a suitable type of teacher. Our success in this regard is best judged by the repeated requests from medical superintendents of these hospitals for \"another teacher like Miss So-and-So\".\n\nThe reports on the teachers marked are as follows:\n\nMiss Alice Eaton, Grade 2 Welfare Teacher, Clearwater Lake Hospital; Second Class Teaching Certificate; 11 years Provincial Schools; 15 years Indian Day Schools.\n\nInspector of Schools H. P. Moffat, in his report of December 8, 1948, comments:\n\n\"Miss Eaton works for the most part with the bed...\"\npatients while Mrs. Smith has the classroom. The cheery optimism of Miss Eaton is quite marvellous to behold. She feels that she is doing a highly worthwhile work and forgets herself completely in the interest taken in the welfare of those in her charge.\n\n\"The amount of study which the bed patients are able to do is sharply limited by their physical condition, however, a good deal of work is being done. One young man of twenty-six is learning to read and write and enjoying it immensely. A good deal of beadwork and knitting is done by these patients. Miss Eaton appears to have the complete confidence and cooperation of those in her charge.\"\n\nMr. T.A.J. Cummings, the Secretary Treasurer of the Sanatorium Board of Manitoba, wrote on August 14, 1947:\n\n\"As you know, Miss Eaton has been doing excellent work at the hospital and is well recommended by the Medical Superintendent.\"\n\nMrs. A. L. Hughes, Grade 3 Welfare Teacher, Miller Bay Hospital, B.A.; B.C.L.; High School Teacher's Certificate; 10 years provincial schools; one year Indian hospital school; Specialist training at McGill in handicrafts and social welfare.\n\nMrs. Hughes opened this school just over a year ago and we have only received a preliminary report from Inspector Davey. In this report he recommended the employment of a second teacher as did the Medical Superintendent of the Hospital. As a result of these representations, we engaged the services of\n\nMiss Mary L. Starratt, Grade 3 Welfare Teacher; Academic Teacher's Certificate; 15 years of provincial teaching experience, particularly with retarded children; also Social Service experience.\n\nYou will recall that this teacher was recommended to the Department by the Honourable Milton F. Gregg, V.C., C.B.E., Minister of Veterans Affairs.\n\nWe are anticipating the School Inspector's reports on both these teachers in the near future.\n(b) In Day Schools.\n\nBrother F. Leach, Grade 2 Welfare Teacher, Bloodvein School, Clandeboye Agency, Manitoba; two years of provincial school experience; twenty-eight years in Indian schools.\n\nIn recommending Brother Leach, Mr. Indian Superintendent Olson reported as follows on December 23, 1947:\n\n\"To us in this office the request merits every consideration. Brother Leach has 28 years' teaching experience in Indian schools and three years in Provincial Schools. His work as school teacher is of high standard and his handling of Indian children is outstandingly effective and desirable.\n\n\"Regarding welfare work, he has been our medical dispenser for years. He looks after all first aid and medical work. He visits the sick and has handled numerous maternity cases. He completely supervises our housing improvement program, bridge building, etc. In fact, Brother Leach is an excellent example of value of leadership and proper supervision given by one man. He is largely responsible for the welfare of the entire band.\n\n\"On the basis of sheer merit I have no hesitation in recommending your favorable consideration of this request.\"\n\nA further report on February 11, 1948, stated:\n\n\"It is my desire to support this application for reclassification by saying that on no reserve in this agency is there being given such significant leadership to the Indian people as is the case with Brother Leach. His teaching work is very effective; his welfare activities among his people embrace all activities, such as health, dispensing drugs, supervising housing improvement, road and bridge building, gardening and canning fruits and vegetables. His cooperation with this office in our varied efforts leaves nothing to be desired.\n\n\"Your favorable consideration of this request is most sincerely recommended.\"\nMrs. L. E. Culton, Grade 2 Welfare Teacher, Homalco School, B.C.; Second Class Certificate; 15 years' experience in Provincial Schools; 7 years' experience in Indian Schools.\n\nThis is another isolated school and the teacher is the sole Departmental representative. Mr. Indian Superintendent Taylor has commented on the good work being done by her under isolated and difficult conditions. She was also recommended for this position by Inspector Davey and the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia. In his report of April 10, 1947, Mr. Davey stated:\n\n\"The register indicates that there has been a considerable improvement in this respect.\n\n\"Mrs. Culton has a very definite personality and is quite outspoken. This might not be accepted in some places but seems to be fairly effective here.\n\n\"This teacher is making an effort to develop a fluent use of English by her pupils and seems to be achieving good results in this respect. Reading and number work are fair. The exercise books of the class are neat and carefully supervised. The writing of the class is satisfactory.\"\n\nMr. William J. Brownlee, Grade One Welfare Teacher, Carmacks School, Yukon; Teaching Permit; two years' teaching experience in Yukon.\n\nIn recommending Mr. Brownlee for classification as a welfare teacher, Mr. Indian Superintendent Meek, on January 6, 1948, stated:\n\n\"Reasons for this recommendation are: Due to the isolated position of Carmacks, to the fact that Mr. Brownlee is the only Government employee there with the exception of the telegraph operator, and that by virtue of his position many requests from other Government agencies are made to him. Also due to the co-operation he has given this office to date, and his very conscientious manner in carrying out a specific request.\n\nIn commenting on the Indians at Carmacks, Mr. Meek said:\n\"There are more Indians on indigent relief at Carmacks than at any other point in the Yukon; the natives there have a notorious name for making home-brew with amazing regularity.\n\n\"From what I have seen of the Carmacks Indians, anyone living amongst them and endeavoring to raise their standard of living has a heart-breaking task and is entitled to the full consideration of the Branch.\"\n\nMiss L. R. Nelson, Grade 2 Welfare Teacher, White Bear School, Saskatchewan; Second Class Certificate; 7 years' experience provincial schools; 20 years' experience in Indian schools (mostly in residential schools).\n\nWe have been very disappointed in the reports on Miss Nelson's work at this school. She had returned to our service in September, following a year spent in the United States, during which time she took a rural welfare course at the Scarrett College Rural Centre, Tennessee, and observed at some of the United States Indian Services large schools.\n\nHer previous experience has been with smaller classes and with a male principal. It seems evident she cannot handle 33 children in a one-room school. Her discipline is poor and there is a strong antagonistic spirit in the school. When this was reported by the Provincial School Inspector we immediately wrote to Mr. Ostreander and he has recommended her replacement. He is to see the Superintendent of Education concerning this teacher tomorrow.\n\nMiss M. E. O'Connor, Grade 3 Welfare Teacher, Sliammon School, British Columbia; First Class Certificate, 22 years' experience.\n\nMiss O'Connor has just transferred to this school since the fire at Coqualeetza Hospital, where she taught formerly. In his last year's report on her work, Inspector Davey commented:\n\n\"Miss O'Connor has a very pleasant personality and secures a good response from her pupils. Her work is well prepared and carefully organized. Miss O'Connor is thorough in her instructions and in her supervision of the pupils' work.\"\nMiss O'Connor is keenly interested in welfare work and is taking an extra-mural course in Sociology from the University of Washington in Seattle.\n\nL. Allard, Grade One Welfare Teacher, Fort Rae School, N.W.T. Manitoba Permit teacher, two years' provincial experience.\n\nHe is really pioneering in this new school being operated in a fur trading post purchased by the Department. The school opened in April, 1943, and Inspector McKinnon was fortunately in the Territories and was able to help Mr. Allard to begin the classroom work.\n\nDr. Mulvihill reported on the Fort Rae Indians as follows:\n\n\"They are the most primitive in the Agency. They have absolutely no conception of the state of affairs except in their own small area. Very few have any education, very few speak English.\"\n\nWe hope to have Mr. Allard's sister, a teacher now at the University of Manitoba, join him next summer, when the pupilage at this school will rise to the 80's.\n\nIn general, we have tried to secure, for welfare work, the services of teachers who are either qualified for such work or who have had a great many years of Indian school experience and who know and have the confidence of the Indians. It has been very difficult to obtain fully qualified welfare workers, due to the great shortage of such trained personnel. This shortage is so great that welfare agencies are now adopting the services of untrained or partly trained workers and are arranging \"in service\" education for them.\n\nWe have consulted officials of the Canadian Welfare Council and hope to have some of our welfare teachers attend sociology courses next year. There are those who feel that some\nof our older teachers with many years of Indian experience and given some professional social service training, could do more welfare work with the Indians than a young trained worker newly graduated from a University School of Social Science. This would be particularly true of isolated reserves where the day school teachers probably know and understand the local problems of the Indians better than any other Branch official.\n\nHowever, we have required that both the local Indian Superintendent and the Regional Supervisor recommend a day school teacher for a welfare appointment on an isolated reserve. It is felt that personal suitability for such work can best be assessed by the field officials directly concerned with the progress of the particular reserve. We have appointed relatively few welfare teachers as we believe that proper supervision by adequately trained welfare officials is necessary in many cases. When such welfare officials are appointed it is felt that more rapid progress can be made, not only by providing guidance and professional aid to our present welfare teachers, but in conducting special courses for them and for future appointees.\n\nI agree in general with your final comments. On the other hand, I think it should be anything possible to make sure the persons appointed to welfare positions are in fact capable of actually doing welfare work. I am still inclined to agree with your views on the question of the qualifications. From this course-section I am inclined to think that it would be desirable to have a list of the titles in each section to show exactly what duties incumbents in my opinion it would be wise to avoid from these classes, but more suitable. In the case of welfare teachers we must avoid the risk of assuming a competence that has not been demonstrated.\nNewspaper Report on the activities of Mrs. F. L. Ross,\nWelfare Teacher, Thunderchild Reserve, Saskatchewan.\n\n(Western Producer, January 13, 1949).\n\nThunderchild's Christmas\n\nDear Editor\u2014I would like to tell your readers about our Christmas concert on the Thunderchild Reserve last week. Instead of accepting the charity of the white man and his old clothes, many people wanted their children to have something more\u2014something of them themselves. It makes one feel one is inspiring them to help themselves. The good use they are making of the family allowance money is evident in the health and good clothes of the children.\n\nThirty-one, bright, smiling healthy Indians, the children all waiting for Santa to come and distribute gifts and treats, the funds for which had been raised by their parents and friends. That was the scene at the Thunderchild School, Turfird, Sask., on Wednesday afternoon, December 22.\n\nFirst the children sang a program under the direction of the teacher. Then the school was gaily decorated and a pretty Christmas tree stood in one corner. Santa came and gave each child on the Reserve a toy and candy, and each family a bag of treats.\n\nIt was especially gratifying to those interested in the welfare of the Indians that this reserve had been able to raise funds for their Christmas dinner. This had been done by having three box socials during the year, all the efforts of W. Wapase. Assisting him were Albert Catagamis, assistant, Mr. and Mrs. Ross, and Mr. Chetagneur, and Mr. and Mrs. Ross.\n\nMrs. Ross is one of our best welfare teachers and has done a great deal to promote the formation of Homemakers' Clubs both on this reserve and in Saskatchewan.\nVOLUME II\nEDITION III\n\nCHARLES CAMSELL\nINDIAN HOSPITAL\nEDMONTON, ALTA.\n\nCHRISTMAS MESSAGE\nH.

To those of you who are sick, the very best gift you can give to your loved ones and friends which will bring them the greatest happiness is your own restored health.\n\nMany people buy Christmas seals at this time to help 'fight' Tuberculosis; but you have a better opportunity than they\u2014 you can fight it without any physical effort at all, not even licking seals and sticking them on parcels \u2014 just by lying perfectly still in bed. How about making that your Christmas present to everyone? Be determined to \"lick\" your disease and thus play your part in \"whipping out\" Tuberculosis.\n\nMy very best wishes to you all for a Very Happy Christmas and may the New Year of 1949 bring you all good health once more.\n\nH. Meltzer, M.D.\nMedical Director.\nWith the approach of Christmas our thoughts turn to home and our families and \"Christmas Past\". But this is another year, and we must look forward \u2014 we will do our best to make this Christmas another very pleasant one to tuck away with your memories.\n\nTo each and every one of you I wish a very merry Christmas, and may 1949 bring you the wishes you most cherish.\n\nF.

He restoreth my soul; He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the House of the Lord forever.\n\n23rd Psalm\nA LEGEND ABOUT CHRISTMAS\n\nIn the little Austrian village of Hallein in 1818, what has come to be known as the universal Christmas carol was sung for the first time. The carol was suggested by the birth of a child in one of the poorest homes in this parish on Christmas Eve. As the pastor, Father Joseph Mohr, was returning from blessing the babe, the words, \"Silent Night! Holy Night! All is calm, all is bright......\" kept going through his head. Later that night the schoolmaster and organist, Franz Gruber, dropped in to tell the Father that the church organ had broken down; and that if there were to be any music at all at Christmas Mass it would have to be simple, very simple. He read the words which the priest had just written and decided to set them to music.\n\nThey were sung for the first time, on Christmas Day, by the school-children with only a guitar to guide them. Carols are now sung by choirs accompanied by orchestras and fine organs all over the world.\nA CHRISTMAS MESSAGE\n\nOne of the most beautiful and famous Christmas stories is that written by Dr. Henry Van Dyke, entitled \"The Other Wise Man\". It is the story of a supposed fourth \"Wise Man\", who following a vision given by God, travelled far from the East to join his fellow pilgrims in their adoration of the Christ Child. However, his progress was constantly slowed down by demands on his sympathy, his nobility, and his sense of human needs; and by people in distress. Not only did he miss seeing the Divine Babe but his gifts and treasure had been given to those in need. He wandered for years in search of the King and finally found Jesus on the way to the Cross, but he also, found there the blessing that comes to those who give their all in service of their fellow-men.\n\nWe read, \"Now are we the Sons of God\"\u2014those who take their places with the \"Wise Men\", with the \"Shepherds\", with the \"Pure in Heart\" and the \"Peace Loving\"; those who see the Star of Hope, and hear the Angelic Choir sing, \"Peace on Earth to Men of Good Will\". These are, indeed, \"The Sons or Children of God.\" May we all be among that number at this Christmas season.\n\nWe were all thrilled a few weeks ago because of the birth of a Royal Prince. To-day we celebrate with joy the birthday of a greater Prince\u2014the \"Prince of Peace\"\u2014the \"King of Heaven\".\n\nMay I wish you all\u2014the patients in the Charles Camsell Hospital, the Doctors and Nurses and all the Members of the Staff\u2014a very Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. And again let us say with Tiny Tim, \"God bless us every one.\"\n\nJ. F. Woodsworth\n(Rev. Dr. J. F. Woodsworth)\nThere has been born to you today, in the town of David, a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord.\n\nSoon we will celebrate the birth of the Saviour. Everyone hopes from the bottom of his heart that this feast will bring joy and happiness to all. We should bear in mind that it is not the earthly things that bring us true happiness, but God, Himself.\n\nAs the angels gave glory to God at the birth of Jesus we also must do all we can to glorify God, not only at Christmas but every day of our lives by good Christian living.\n\nWhile He was on earth, Jesus told us what we must do to be His friends, \"Do the will of My Father, who is in Heaven!\" Jesus also told us that whatever we ask for in His Father's name would be given to us, \"Ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full!\"\n\nSo dear patients, remember the message of our Lord while preparing for Christmas. Remember that Jesus wants you among His friends; and, being His friends, you may ask with more confidence for the things for the things you want. In His infinite goodness God has just no limit to the things you may ask for. Ask and you shall receive. So start right now to be good and kind to your neighbors, and to be more obedient to your nurses. It is by these little things that you show that you are Jesus' friends; and if you keep praying every day I am sure He will make you very happy on Christmas Day.\n\nFather A. Rodrique, who replaced me for a few months wishes you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. I, too, wish you a Merry Christmas, and also, a speedy recovery.\n\nFortune Gamache\n(Rev. Father Gamache, O.M.I.)\n\nREFLECTION\n\nI'm glad I'm not the president,\nSanta Claus - or the king.\nThere's something grand about them, but\nThey're blamed for everything.\nCHRISTMAS\n\nWhat a joyful time! Why is it that Christmas Day is so different from any other day? Is it because of the presents we get? Is it because of the extra special \"eats\"? No, rather it is because of the thoughts we have had for weeks before that day. Every one of us has been thinking of others; thinking of our friends at home \u2014 so many of them far away, yet during these weeks so near to us in our thoughts. We have been saying in many ways, \"I hope they have a Merry Christmas!\" That is what makes this time of year so different! And it all comes about because we realize that God was thinking of us when He sent His Blessed Son to be born in Bethlehem on that day.\n\nMay we as the days go by retain that spirit of thinking of others and wishing them happiness and peace. As we wish our dear ones and friends a Merry Christmas, may we have this one wish for ourselves, \"Less of self and more of others.\" May our lives and actions be reflecting in our earthly passions. Less of self and more of others.\" As the days go by may we think of life as being lived by the side of the road, and say, \"Give me a house by the side of the road, to be a friend to man.\" May the blessings of Christmas be with you and yours.\n\nSincerely,\nC.F.A. Clough\n(Canon Clough)\n\nGIVING\n\nNow the good season of Christmas is here\u2014Bringing the spirit of peace and good cheer\u2014People seem kinder, there's joy in the air\u2014Sympathy, good-will and joy everywhere........ Everyone's thinking of giving, that's why,\u2014Scheming and planning the gifts they can buy\u2014Thinking of others, their frowns disappear\u2014 Oh, what a shame that it's just ONCE A YEAR!\n\n--Patience Strong\nJAMES BAY INDIANS\n\nThe Attawapiskat band numbers nearly 600 people who live and hunt in a large section of country reaching to the south shore of Hudson's Bay. These Indians have married to a certain extent with their neighbors to the west, the Ojibways; and have adopted two or three Ojibway families into their band but none of the Cree. Attawapiskat men have taken the status of a different tribe.\n\nMany years ago these Indians had an abundance of food and fur animals in their large hunting grounds but by unwise trapping and hunting the country became almost depleted. The large herds of barren-land caribou used to end their summer immigration in Attawapiskat territory but for some unexplained reason they no longer roam so far south so that a source of meat supply has been lost to these people.\n\nAs a result of the loss of food and fur animals this large band has been greatly undernourished for years and they have had to depend to a large extent upon government relief. During the winter they can travel by foot and scatter in families so that it is easier to obtain what food there is. In the summer months travel over the muskeg country is very difficult so they gather at the mouth of the Attawapiskat River where the traders have stores and where the Roman Catholic Mission has a large church. It is during these summer months that living is so difficult. In the fall of the year they obtain large numbers of geese and ducks and by freezing and salting some of these birds, they have some food for part of the winter.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties the Hudson's Bay Company and the Indian Affairs Branch have created a beaver sanctuary out of the entire band trapping grounds. Each head of a family unit is paid a small yearly sum of money to count and record on a large map the number of beaver houses on his trapping ground. If his beaver houses are not increasing he is given a pair or more of beaver by the Indian Affairs Branch. These beaver do not cost him anything and he is supplied with food and equipment necessary to place them on his grounds. When the beaver house-count reaches such a number that some of the animals can be trapped and still leave enough to keep a constant level year after year, he is given a quota to kill depending upon the needs of his family.\nJAMES BAY INDIANS\n(Continued)\n\nIn this way the family not only has the meat of the beaver to eat but also the fur to sell, from which they receive money to buy clothing and other food.\n\nThis band has had very little schooling and few of them speak English. Some send their children to a residential school 150 miles away at Albany but the children are not left there long enough to receive a fair education. A day-school is being built at Attawapiskat where the children can go to school during the summer. In a few years, perhaps, with better food and better education these poor Indians will have better health.\n\nAt the present time their health is very bad. Seldom is it possible to see a fat Attawapiskat Indian, particularly amongst the children. A great many of the babies die during their first year of life. If they survive this first year many more of them die of tuberculosis before they become adults. Indian Health Services realize this bad condition and are trying to improve it. A nursing station is being built and a public health nurse will help the mothers to look after the babies and thus keep so many from dying. The large tuberculosis Sanatorium being built at Moose Factory will look after tuberculosis and the doctors from this hospital will treat the other medical and surgical illnesses of these people.\n\nBy the establishment of fur-hunting sanctuaries, schools and sufficient medical care it is hoped that in the next few years the Attawapiskat Indians will become a happy healthy group of people.\n\n\"-\"-\"-\"-\"-\"-\"-\"-\"-\"-\"-\"-\n\nTIT FOR THAT\n\nand had a falling-out.\n\nI can't say what it was all about.\nOne grew angry and said, \"Oh, fie,\nYou know you're worth three less than I!\"\nThe other cried, with a pout and frown,\n\"You're nothing but six turned upside down!\"\nDear Santa Claus, I am feeling better now.

Mama had tried everything she knew of to stop Dagmar's earache, but nothing had helped. When Dr. Johnson came he told Mama that Dagmar must be taken to the hospital.\n\n\"We must operate at once,\" said Dr. Johnson.\n\n\"Can wait?\" Mama asked. \"Until my husband comes home from work?\"\n\n\"No time,\" the doctor said, \"it must be done at once.\"\n\n\"We go!\" said Mama.\n\nBecause Papa was at work Nels and I went to the hospital with Mama. When we got there two nurses put Dagmar on a high table and started to wheel her down the hall. Mama tried to go along, too.\n\n\"She is my little girl,\" Mama explained.\n\n\"Hospital rules,\" the nurse said firmly. \"You must wait here.\"\n\nMama obediently let go of Dagmar's hand then, and walked with slow steps to the desk. They gave her papers to sign, but she didn't even try to read them. Her eyes kept looking down the hall.\n\nWe had never been in a hospital before. We watched the ladies in white uniforms, we watched the important looking men with little bags hurry in and out of doors; we watched the cleaning women as they took their mops and buckets out of the closet by the elevator.\n\nWhen Dr. Johnson came hurrying down the hall Mama stood up.\n\n\"Dagmar came through it fine,\" he told us. \"She is sleeping now.\"\n\nMama smiled and said happily, \"I go to see her now.\"\n\nDr. Johnson coughed, \"Sorry. Against the hospital rules. See her to-morrow night.\"\n\n\"But, she's so LITTLE,\" Mama said, \"when she wakes she will be frightened.\"\n\n\"The nurses will take excellent care of her. Don't worry. You see for the first twenty-four hours patients are allowed no visitors.\"\n\nMama did not seem to understand. \"I will not make a SOUND.\"\n\nDr. Johnson lifted his hat politely and hurried out.\n\nMama looked bewildered, \"Come,\" she said to Nels and me.\n\n\"Come, we go find Dagmar!\"\n\nThe nurse at the desk tried to explain the rules to Mama.\n\"Your child will get the best of care, madam,\" she repeated.\n\n\"In fine hospital, FINE,\" Mama agreed, \"I go see Dagmar now?\"\n\n\"NO visitors for the first twenty-four hours, madam.\"\n\n\"Am NOT visitor,\" Mama explained patiently, \"I am her MAMA.\"\n\n\"AGAINST THE RULES!\" The nurse spoke loudly and firmly.\n\nWe slowly left the hospital. Mama held my hand firmly as we walked to the street car and never said a word all the way home.\n\nChristine had kept lunch hot for us, but Mama just drank two cups of coffee. She did not take off her hat.\n\n\"We must think of some way,\" she worried, \"We must see Dagmar before Christmas Day.\" We children sat very still and watched Mama.\n\n\"They'll let you see Dagmar to-morrow. They said so,\" said Nels.\n\n\"But unless I see her to-day,\" Mama asked, \"how will I know that all is well with her? What can I tell Papa when he comes home?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"No,\" said Mama, \"TO-DAY I see Dagmar!\"\n\nSuddenly she took paper and string out of the kitchen drawer. Carefully she wrapped up Dagmar's little doll in a neat package. We watched her uneasily. We wondered just what Mama was going to do next.\n\n\"It will be like this,\" Mama explained. \"I will go past the hospital desk very quickly. If anyone asks where I go, I will just say, 'Delivering packages to Dagmar.'\"\n\nWhen Mama came back later \u2014 still carrying the package \u2014 we knew that she had been unsuccessful. We knew, too, that she was upset, because she answered us in Norwegian.\n\n\"Almost,\" she said wearily, \"almost did I get down the hall!\"\n\nThen she tied her apron around her waist, filled the bucket with hot water, and started to scrub the kitchen floor.\n\n\"You scrubbed yesterday,\" Christine reminded her.\n\n\"And the floor isn't a speck dirty,\" I said.\n\n\"Comes a time,\" Mama answered, \"when you must get down on knees!\"\n\nMama had scrubbed all but the part near the back door when she stood up suddenly and handed the scrub brush to Christine.\n\n\"You finish the floor, Christine. Katrin, you come with me!\"\n\n\"Come where, Mama?\"\n\n\"To the hospital,\" said Mama \u2014 her face was serene. \"I have thought of a way to see Dagmar sure.\"\n\nWe walked in so quietly that the nurse at the desk did not\neven look up. Mama motioned me to sit still in the big chair by the door. While I watched - mouth open in surprise - Mama took off her hat and coat and gave them to me to hold. She tiptoed over to the big closet by the elevator and took out a damp mop. She pushed the mop past the desk and as the nurse looked up, Mama nodded brightly.\n\n\"Very dirty floors,\" Mama said.\n\n\"Yes. I'm glad they've finally decided to clean them,\" the nurse answered. She looked at Mama curiously, \"Aren't you working late?\"\n\nMama just pushed more vigorously, each swipe of the mop taking her farther and farther down the hall. I watched until she was out of sight and the nurse had turned back to the desk. Then I saw that I held Mama's hat so tightly that one side was all bent up.\n\nAfter a long time Mama came back. Her eyes were shining.\n\nMama placed the mop neatly back in the clothes closet, put on her hat and coat and took my hand. As we left, Mama bowed politely to the nurse and said, \"Thank you, thank you, much.\"\n\nOutside Mama told me, \"Dagmar is fine. No fever. I felt her forehead.\"\n\n\"You SAW her, Mama?\" I asked in amazement.\n\n\"Of course. She wakened while I was with her. I told her about the hospital rules, she will not expect us till Christmas.\"\n\n\"You won't try to see her again,\" I asked, \"before then?\"\n\n\"Why,\" Mama said, \"that would be against the rules. Besides, I have seen for myself that all goes well with her. Papa will not worry now. And we can all have a Merry Christmas to-morrow!\"\n\nI swallowed hard.\n\n\"It's a FINE hospital,\" said Mama, \"a much FINE hospital.\"\n\nThen she clicked her tongue disapprovingly. \"But SUCH floors! SUCH floors I never did see! A mop is no good. Floors should always be scrubbed with a brush! Next time I use a BRUSH!\"\nDECEMBER THOUGHT\n\nA day that's full of happiness for you and yours we pray and may a gleam of friendly cheer melt all your cares away. With every joy that heart could wish to light the yule log's glow on face of the friends you love, may their number grow. Let singing voices fill the air and Christmas bells ring out; let every one with glad accord a joyful message shout. Let plenty crown your festive board with heaps of food and fun, and may you say with Tiny Tim, \"God Bless Us Every One.\"\n\nHOLIDAY ACROSTIC\n\n1.

CHRISTMAS\n10.\nROB RABBIT'S CHRISTMAS PRESENT\n\n\"Wherever is that son of mine?\" cried Mrs. Jack Rabbit, one late autumn morning. \"Rob! Oh, Rob!\"\n\nNo answer came.\n\n\"Father, have you seen Rob this morning?\" she asked Mr. Rabbit, who was smoking his briar-pipe after a hearty breakfast.\n\n\"No, Molly, I haven't seen him, but I think I know where to find him.\" And taking up his cane, Mr. Rabbit set off at a hop across the fields.\n\nHe headed straight for Farmer Hill's garden, for he knew there were still some juicy, tender plants in one corner of it, and Rob was very fond of greens. Sure enough, Mr. Rabbit had no sooner stepped into the garden than he beheld Rob eating his fill of green leaves.\n\n\"Rob!\"\n\nRob jumped fully three feet into the air, and came down facing Mr. Rabbit. His ears stood straight up in terror and his eyes seemed ready to pop out of his head, for when Mr. Rabbit used his gruffest tone, he sounded remarkably like Farmer Hill's hound\u2014at least to guilty Rob. Then his ears drooped in shame on seeing his father. Mr. Rabbit caught him by one of those long ears.\n\n\"Your mother is looking for you, young man,\" said Mr. Rabbit sternly. \"Never yet have I seen you around when there is work to be done.\"\n\nWhich was all very true, for Rob hated work as much as bears love honey, and he could smell it a mile off. When he scented an errand, he always got a few miles away from it as soon as he could!\n\nBut almost overnight, Rob changed! He became a different rabbit. No longer did he droop his ears and sulk when there was work to do. He simply waded into it, and when he had finished, asked for more! No longer did he waste time chasing his cottonball of a tail; he ran errands willingly; he gathered twigs and bark and young shoots for every meal, without reserving the tenderest and sweetest for himself as he had been wont to do. He obeyed his father and mother at once, and even minded Baby Bun and kept him from wandering off and losing himself. All in all, Rob underwent such a complete and sudden change that Mrs. Rabbit seriously considered taking him to Dr. Hare. Mr. Rabbit, however, merely twitched his whiskers and made the remark that Rob's nature would assert itself in a day or two.\n\nBut it didn't. Rob went right on being as good as gold, and as courteous and helpful as the Golden Rule advises us to be. Mr. Rabbit developed a great pride in his son and declared him to be a tuft off the old fur.\n\nThen one day Mrs. Rabbit found Rob looking through the catalogue, and all at once a great light dawned on her. She looked at the calendar and then winked at the cuckoo clock. It was mid-December, and here was Rob with his nose in the catalogue. It took Mrs. Rabbit no time to multiply two by two and get the right answer, for, as you know, rabbits are good multipliers.\n\n\"Rob,\" she called, \"run down to the meadow and bring me some bark for supper.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mom,\" said Rob, and hopped away, leaving the catalogue open on the table, just as Mrs. Rabbit had expected he would.\n\nShe went over and looked through the pages that Rob had been finding so interesting.\n\n\"So this is what he wants!\" she exclaimed. \"Well, he shall have it, for he certainly has been a good boy.\"\nThat night she told Mr. Rabbit what she had found out, and he agreed that Rob was a deserving little rabbit. They quite overlooked all his lazy naughty tricks. (Parents are like that, which is very lucky for children!)\n\nAnd so it happened that on Christmas Eve, while Rob lay fast asleep, a shadowy figure crept in softly and filled his sock, which hung by the fireplace. Then it picked up the other sock, which lay on the floor, and crammed it full, too. (Santa attends to two socks only if children have been extra SPECIALLY good.)\n\nRob awoke early the next morning and looked at his sock. He rubbed his eyes with both paws and looked again. There were certainly TWO socks hanging up and both filled to bursting. Rob gave one happy squeak and jumped for them.\n\n\"Mom! Pop!\" he cried. \"Santa has filled BOTH my socks!\"\n\nAnd he at once began to empty them.\n\nOne was crammed full of peppermint sticks, chocolate cucumber bars and onion gumdrops. The other sock held a lovely white fur coat.\n\n\"Oh! Oh! Oh! Just what I wanted!\" cried Rob. \"My old brown coat is getting so patchy!\"\n\n\"Indeed it is!\" said Mrs. Rabbit, \"and it's time you had a white coat, anyway, for there is a snowstorm coming up. As long as the ground was bare, your old brown coat was good enough, and much safer. But when snow covers the ground, you need a white one.\"\n\nSo Rob put on his fur coat, and he was the happiest bunny in Bunnydom!\n\n\u2014 Myrtle Larsen\n\nCHRISTMAS CANDLES\n\nCandles on the mantelpiece,\nCandles white and red\nLight the way for Santa\nWhile we are in bed.\n\nSilently they flicker\nWinking at the fun,\nCasting weird shadows\nTill the work is done.\n\nBut the morning after\nWhat a weary sight!\nI wonder if we'd look like that\nIf we stayed up all night?\n\n\u2014 M.

Grantham\nHilda Kamrath\n(Teachers)\nTRIP TO YELLOWKNIFE, FORT RAE AND FORT SMITH, N.W.T.\n\nJULY 14TH. - 17TH., 1948.\n\nFor almost two years I had planned to fly North and see the \"Territories\" \u2014 and finally I realized this wish: At the request of Doctor Moore, Director of Indian Health Services, Ottawa, and Mr. Gibson, Deputy Commissioner for the Northwest Territories Administration, I flew to Yellowknife to arrange for an X-ray Survey of the entire community. I also had an opportunity at this time to visit the new hospital there.\n\nWhile in the vicinity, I visited Fort Rae, and on my return stopped off for a day at Fort Smith.\n\nMy air trip via C.P.A. was uneventful as far as Fort McMurray. After leaving McMurray, we ran into disturbed atmospheric conditions and the plane did a good deal of bumping and side-slipping. At Fort Smith, fine sand and clay on the landing strip filled the air on the plane's arrival, and made it rather unpleasant, especially on a warm day, with hordes of bulldog flies and mosquitoes to add to the discomfort. From Smith to Resolution the trip was even rougher, but after leaving Resolution, on crossing Great Slave Lake, the flying became smoother.\n\nHalf the way to McMurray the view was the usual green patchwork quilt effect of farmland. After that, bodies of water, small and large, joined by winding rivers surrounded by forests, formed the scenery.\n\nFort McMurray is a small settlement on the Athabasca River, and Fort Smith is on the Slave River. We more or less followed these two rivers to Great Slave Lake and Fort Resolution.\n\nThe town of Yellowknife is on the North shore of Great Slave Lake, and is flanked on the West by Consolidated and Negus Mines, and on the East by the Giant Mine. The airfield at Yellowknife is a large one, used by the services as well as C.P.A. and privately-owned planes.\n\nDoctor Bickford met me at the airport and drove me to the hotel, which is quite new and very modern. The day was really hot; it was quite a surprise to me to find Yellowknife much warmer.\nTRIP TO YELLOWKNIFE\n\n(Continued)\n\nthan Edmonton! But I no sooner got into my hotel room than a downpour of rain and hail, which lasted over an hour, replaced the heat.\n\nThe hospitality of the North was soon evidenced when I was invited to be a guest at their regular monthly Board of Trade dinner. I had the honour of being the guest speaker, my topic being the proposed X-ray Survey. I found the members of the Board of Trade and all the others to whom I spoke, most enthusiastic about the survey, and anxious to give their whole-hearted support toward making it a success.\n\nThe following morning I spent seeing the hospital and discussing various problems with Doctor Bickford, the Hospital Manager and the Matron. In the afternoon, I met Doctor Mulvihill of Fort Resolution, who reached Yellowknife by boat from Fort Rae, having gone there to pay Treaty. With Dr. Mulvihill were his charming wife and the Hudson's Bay Factor from Fort Rae.\n\nLater in the afternoon, Dr. Mulvihill and I flew in a small plane to Fort Rae: This small isolated settlement is about 65 miles almost due north from Yellowknife, and a northern arm of Great Slave Lake. The settlement consists of many small huts and tents, placed on a small peninsula of rolling rock, with a Roman Catholic Mission Church and Hospital a few hundred feet inland; also in the same area are the Hudson's Bay Company store and the R.C.M. Police detachment.\n\nWe visited at the hospital, which I was amazed to find so clean, roomy and well-equipped for such an outlying area. Unfortunately only about 10 of the 30 available beds were being used. The Sisters and Father Laperriere were most friendly, and after our tour of the hospital served us a delightful cold drink and fruit. After this we visited the Mission, where Father Laperriere showed us some of the local Indian Handicraft Work. I admired some gloves and moccasins, and was presented with a pair of each to bring home.\n\nI saw Michel Thom again, and found he had refractured his arm in a scuffle. When I suggested that he come back with me, he assented at once, and had his belongings ready in about ten minutes! I met the Chief of the Dogrib Band, who was very cordial\nTRIP TO YELLOWKNIFE\n(Continued)\n\nin his welcome. I promised to take good care of Michel Thom who is his adopted son.\n\nI also saw a woman with a Tuberculous knee whom I advised to come to the hospital, but she refused. She has since come in. (Mrs. Widzie - Ward 1).\n\nOur air trip was most enjoyable as we had perfect weather. We flew directly over Yellowknife on our return, thus seeing the town layout beautifully.\n\nI left Yellowknife for Fort Smith on Friday afternoon. Again it was a grand day. My main cause for wonderment on this visit was the complete daylight for almost 24 hours, with slight dusk for only about two hours \u2014 between 12:00 midnight and 2:00 A.M. As a result, it was hard to know just when to go to bed, and it seems that even the inhabitants have the same difficulty for they do keep late hours.\n\nAt Fort Smith I visited the hospital, which is very active and doing excellent work. I was more than welcome there, as there had been no doctor for almost three weeks, since Dr. Riddell had left, and no replacement had been made. Sister Chaloux, who incidentally is a most capable person, had carried the full medical responsibility in the absence of a doctor. I saw many of her problem cases, and felt that the visit was worthwhile as I eased her mind a good deal.\n\nThe following day, I was again at the hospital until plane time, seeing problem cases for the sister. I left Smith in the mid-afternoon and reached Edmonton about 7:00 P.M. after a reasonably smooth trip, although we skirted a rain storm near McMurray.\n\nThus ended my very interesting and instructive four-day visit to the Yellowknife area.\n\nH. Meltzer, M.D.,\nMedical Director.\nThe Moose band numbers approximately four hundred. These people have hunting grounds on the south shore of James Bay in country which is well watered by large and small rivers. Their grounds have been encroached upon in past years by some white trappers but since 1946 this is forbidden and the entire area is licensed by the band trappers from the province of Ontario.\n\nIntensive trapping had up to 1942 greatly reduced the fur-bearing animals and consequently brought the band to a low income level. Formerly the area was teeming with beaver and muskrats and there was still an abundance of water and proper food for these animals. So in 1942 the trapping grounds were declared, by band consent and government arrangement, to be a fur sanctuary. Each year a certain number of beaver families were brought in from central Ontario game preserves at government expense, and released under the care of the trappers. By the winter of 1946-47 there were nearly 2000 beaver colonies by actual count and trapping was begun with each head of a family, man or woman, receiving a share proportionate to the family needs.\n\nTrading is done with the Hudson's Bay Company independent local traders; and, as the railroad is available, many men take their furs to towns and cities, such as Cochrane and Timmins. The Indian Affairs Branch also maintains a fur buyer through whom most of the beaver are marketed.\n\nIn addition to a good income from fur many of the men are excellent labourers and make extra wages as sectionmen on the railroad and as lumbermen in the many nearby logging camps and lumber mills.\n\nWhile some of the band gather at the railroad terminal of Moosonee most of them live on Moose Factory Island near the mouth of the Moose River. This settlement is the second oldest Hudson's Bay Company establishment in Canada. It was founded about 1672 and participated in the early wars between the English and the French trading companies. At one time it was a huge establishment and served as the main warehouse center for all of James Bay until the\nJAMES BAY INDIANS\n(Continued)\n\ncoming of the railroad made this unnecessary. Company \"servants\", as they were called, were brought from Scotland as carpenters, shipwrights, painters, blacksmiths and tradesmen of all kinds. These were necessary for a community to become self-supporting.\n\nTo-day some descendants of these Scotsmen still live at Moose Factory and retain their old customs and accents of speech. There has been a good deal of inter-marriage between these settlers and the Indians and they live side by side as friends, neighbors and relatives.\n\nNearly every one of the band speaks English as well as Cree due to many years of association with the white people. Residential and Day schools have been in operation for a long time. Many of the children stay at the Residential school during the winter but more of them attend Day school from May till October while the families live at Moose Factory. Some also attend the Public school at Moosonee and outnumber the white pupils there.\n\nThe Government Doctor and the James Bay Indian Superintendent live at Moose Factory. The Indian Health Services are now building a large modern Sanatorium on the Island which will serve not only the Moose band but all the James Bay area. It will cost over a million dollars and is expected to treat tuberculosis and all other sickness in the same way as the Charles Camsell Hospital is doing.\n\nTuberculosis at one time was a major problem in the Moose band but with constant X-ray surveys and treatment has been greatly reduced. In the year, 1947, only two active cases were discovered in the band. It is hoped that with the new hospital, more doctors and equipment, that in the years to come the whole Cree tribe living around James Bay can be similarly protected.\n\nThe band has a Chief and three Councillors. The Chief, John Fletcher, is a fine old gentleman who has guided his band wisely for over twenty years. He intends to retire this year due to his age. His stature of body is as great as his mind for he is six feet three inches tall. His son, Pat, is even taller. He is a very intelligent young man who may some day also be elected as Chief.\nI am sure that the people of this Moose band would be interested in having a letter from some of the western Indians. Correspondence would serve to introduce you and help you to learn and understand the problems of each other. Should some of you here at Camsell or members of your band at home wish to write send your letters to Moosonee Post Office, Ontario. Here are some of the names of the Moose band men: John Fletcher, Pat Fletcher, John Jeffries, Abraham Cheechoo, John Carpenter, Angus Cheechoo, Angus Chum, William Hardisty, Gilbert Faries. Perhaps some of your younger brothers and sisters at school would like to begin a correspondence with Moose band children by writing to the Bishop Harden Memorial Residential School at Moose Factory, Ontario.\n\n---\n\nFond du Lac, Saskatchewan,\nAugust 17, 1948.\n\nDear Doctor Meltzer,\n\nJust thought I would drop you a note before we pulled out of Fond du Lac.\n\nSo far the X-ray work is going very well; we have now done over a thousand X-rays. The Indians have been turning out very well. Yesterday we X-rayed 216 out of 245, which I would think is a good average.\n\nThe white people and Metis at Chipewyan were not co-operative at all; there were only 200 X-rayed out of a population of 500.\n\nWe have all been hit with an intestinal upset the last\nREAD WHAT OTHERS SAY\n(Continued)\n\nfew days; although not severe, it was annoying while working.\n\nYoung Charles Stone was hit the worst.\n\nDoctor Younger has been kept very busy, pulling teeth, &c.\n\nHe certainly is a very keen worker; he has been working day and night on this trip. He sets up his equipment in a corner somewhere and works from 9.00 A.M. to 6.00 P.M.; then after supper he makes calls to the various homes on the reserve.\n\nWe have collected a few items from the Indians -- shawls, moccasins and gloves.\n\nI would imagine that we should hit the 1,500 mark in our X-raying, as we still have four more reserves to do. We are leaving for Stoney Rapids at noon and should arrive there to-night and finish our work sometime to-morrow night.\n\nThe greatest drawback on this trip is getting our equipment off the boat and up to the place of X-ray: At times we have to haul the things up a steep bank which would be some 200 feet, and then a good 400 feet to the building. By the time we get there we are all ready to lie down for an hour!\n\nThese people speak no English at all at this end of the lake, so it is quite difficult to get anything done; although Mr. Stewart, the Indian Agent, speaks Cree and could help us on our first lap of the trip, he is lost among the Chipewyan Indians.\n\nYou stated in your letter that it would be best to leave the X-raying of the Indians at Fort Smith and have the X-ray Clinic proceed direct to Yellowknife: I think I will have plenty of time to do them all before Mr. Berg comes up. If I don't, I am afraid they will not be there when he comes back from Yellowknife, because they will be heading back into the bush.\n\nI only intended to write a note, but it looks as if I have written a book, so I will close for now. (Caught three fish last night.)\n\nBest regards,\n\nDon Harkness.\nDear friends at the Camsell Hospital,\n\nAm sending greetings to my many friends at Camsell Hospital. To those of you who are still in bed\u2014 or are resting for \"the cure\" most of the time, I would like to tell you of some of my travels.\n\nAt present I am staying at Banning in Southern California, 89 miles east of Los Angeles where the movie stars work and live.\n\nTo the north and south rise high mountains, making a valley east and west. This valley is called the San Gorgonio Pass and looks out to the east and west \u2014 unlike the Whitehorse where its valley looks north and south.\n\nUnlike the mountains in Canada \u2014 with grey rocks, green grasses and trees \u2014 these mountains are of red and yellow powdered lava or red slabs of soft rock easily crushed. No grasses grow \u2014 only cactus plants something like those in Alberta \u2014 only very tall\u2014 much taller than a man! There are many bushes but all are so unlike anything that grows in Canada. Here there are huge palm trees \u2014 like those you see in pictures of the land where Jesus was born. There are pepper trees with long green branches and shiny red berries in clusters. The eucalyptus tree gives shade to travellers \u2014 for the scorching sun brings the temperature up to 125 degrees F. and over.\n\nSome of the flowers are very pretty \u2014 the oleander, hibiscus, bird of Paradise, yucca and many kinds of cactus flowers.\n\nAs we drive along the roads we can see, in the valleys, the water being sprayed all the time on the dark-leaved orange trees\u2014 the golden balls hanging like decorations on a Christmas tree, only the leaves are real leaves. Then we can see peaches, apricots, almonds, walnuts \u2014 each growing on its own kind of tree \u2014 and dates on the date palm, and olives on the grey green olive tree.\n\nJust near the town of Banning, east toward the desert, about five miles is the Reservation owned by the Morongo Indians. Each family owns a farm on which they grow alfalfa, olives, oranges, nuts or whatever they wish. They sell their fruit to the town stores. They also have horses, cattle, trucks and cars.\nTheir houses are built of brick made from local mud\u2014called adobe. The houses are quite open as there is little cold in Southern California. Thirteen above zero is very cold for this part of the country. The worst winter weather here is more like the summer weather in the Yukon.\n\nDrinking water is a big problem\u2014here are no rivers or lakes. Only a little rain falls between December and April. Sometimes a little snow falls in the valleys\u2014but of course there will be snow on the mountain tops from December till April, though not as much as the Yukon.\n\nThe Morongo Indians look much the same as our western Canadian Indian people and dress much the same except for winter wear\u2014which is never needed. The women tend the fields and house, shell almonds, pick oranges, peaches, etc., and in their spare time weave beautiful baskets and mats. The men tend their cattle and their farms, and hire themselves out to work for the local people in Banning and on near-by farms\u2014which they call ranches. They are excellent workers and are held in high esteem by the local people. They do not travel around as do the people of the Yukon and the Mackenzie country.\n\nCaptain John Morongo gave his name to this group who once belonged to the ancient Cahuillas and Serranos. At one time there were many tribes, but being very war-like, they killed each other or were killed by the scorching heat in the desert, or by grizzly bears, wolves or lions. Lions may still be seen deep in the mountains.\n\nBefore these people settled on farms and before there were stores, food was very scarce and the Morongo people in the mountains ate acorns or roasted the stalks of the yucca plant and boiled its flowers. On the desert they ate fruit from the date palm, stalks and flowers of the cactus pine, juniper nuts, chia (a seed used for flour), wild plum, berries of the elder and sumac and flowers of the ocotilla (pronounced ok'-a-ti-ya).\n\nThere are many tribes scattered all through these valleys that I have not yet seen.

I am sorry that I have no wonderful news for you - just the same old story of thanks to the doctors and nurses for the splendid work they are doing amongst us. We are receiving so many kindnesses. We enjoy the car rides. The picnic was a wonderful treat. It was so nice to see our friends from the other wards and have a visit - we have been lonesome for them since. It is nice to learn that some of our friends are returning home happy and well. I am getting better each day and hope to be going home some time myself, happy and well. I wish you all a speedy recovery and the best of luck!\n\nA sincere frier,\n\nMrs. Victoria Sepp.\n\nWe are glad to have some of the girls from Ward IV with us while their ward is being re-modelled.\n\nWelcome to Mrs. Widgie, from Fort Rae, a new-comer!\n\nA little boy who was sent to the butcher shop delivered his mother's message in these words; \"Ma says to send her another ox-tail, please, an' Ma says the last one was very nice, an' Ma says she wants another off the same ox.\"\n\nLeonard Helen, have you a father?\n\nHelen - Yes, I have a dad, a papa, a father and a pop. Have you any sisters?\n\nLeona - Yes, I have two sisters and a half.\n\nDelia - When will it be a month since you've been here?\n\nLeona - Oh, lemme see, Delia, on the 27th of this year.\nWard II (Continued)\n\nHelen - Gee, I'd like to have my picture taken.\n\nLeona - Have you a film?\n\nHelen - Yes.\n\nLeona - Where is it?\n\nHelen - Down at the canteen.\n\nAdeline - Celine says she can buy an electric guitar for 2 CENTS.\n\nVictoria - Celine should have more CENTS (SENSE) than that.\n\nWe miss Dorothy McLean since she has been moved to the private ward. Hope you are doing fine, Dorothy. Come back soon!\n\nFrom the ZEE BEE HAPPY GANG,\n\nWARD II G\n\nThe thunder rumbled and it roared,\nThe lightning came in streaks -\nAnd Helen Oldpan said her prayers -\nThe first she'd said IN WEEKS!\n\nWhen Flora wants to ask a person's last name, she says,\n\n\"What's her name that comes last?\"\n\nPhilomene has a new word,\n\nIt should be \"Holy Doodles\"!\n\nBut Philomene has a little lispth,\n\nAnd says it, \"Holy Tootles\"!\n\nGrasshopper Language\n\nPhilomene - Marion, whatever made you say that?\n\nMarion - Well it jumped in my brain and then it jumped into my mouth and then it jumped out!\n\nMargaret Ward - Doctor, my hair is coming out. Won't you give me something to keep it in.\n\nDoctor (kindly) - Yes, Margaret, take this. (He handed her an empty pill box.)\n\nIvy Lefthand would like a pen pal and promises that she will answer any letters that she receives.\n\nWARD II H\n\nWe are all glad that Beatrice Courtoeille was able to go home this month. Although we miss her very much we hope she does not have to come back.\nWARD II H (Continued)\n\nWe are glad to have a new patient, Isabel Moron, with us.\n\nWe miss our Dr. Meyers.\n\nPansy - What has four legs and only one foot?\n\nHelen - I give up - what has?\n\nPansy - A bed.\n\nWARD III\n\nCongratulations to Mrs. Skani and Louise Wahkeeniuw, who each won a first prize for their beaded mukluks at the Edmonton Exhibition.\n\nRuthie was trying to teach Anne Desjarlais how to speak English. She started, \"Now say, 'I see a monkey.'\" Suddenly Margaret said, \"Ruthie, please don't look at me when you say that!\"\n\nMarie Backs (who has just arrived from Ward IV) - I am so lonesome in this ward. Nobody ever talks to me!\n\nMaggie (quickly) - Well, you talk so much that you never give a person a chance to talk to you!\n\nOne night Margaret was complaining of a bad pain but she could not explain to the nurse just exactly where that pain was. Finally, in desperation, she said, \"Oh, you know, it's just where the chickens have their wings!\"\n\nThe Ward III girls' sixty-four dollar question is: What did Ward IV have that Ward III has not? Why should all the Ward IV girls be so lonesome since coming to Ward III?\n\nOh, Margaret Eaglechild's so mean -\n\nAnd every night the same -\n\nShe tells us stories in her sleep -\n\nBUT doesn't tell his name!\n\nWARD IV A\n\nHello, everybody! There are six of us in this private. We are glad to have Emily Wesley with us - also Bertha Quinn, who is quite a cheerer-upper with her funny sayings. The ward aids are getting tired of us bombarding them with questions about the T.B. cure. \"Bad eggs\" is what one calls us. Bertha holds a Revival meeting every night, sings Heavenly Sunshine and tells us to turn around and shake hands with each other.\nWARD IV A (Continued)\n\n\"Goody, goody!\" said Annie. \"SPARE RIBS for supper! I haven't had SPARE RIBS since I came to this hospital many years ago!\" (Annie has been in the hospital for five months only.)\n\nWARD IV E\n\nThe girls in Ward IV were scattered here and there while their ward was being re-modelled. Victoria Sanscouteau was so disappointed that she was put in Ward I while most of her friends were put in Ward III right ABOVE her. Said Victoria, \"I never thought the time would come when all my good friends would keep on walking over me like this!\"\n\nOne night we were all trying to get to sleep - but the whispering continued from the far side of the room. Finally Margie said, \"Who's talking?\". A mysterious voice, from out of the darkness answered, \"My stocking!\"\n\nWhen evening lunch came around Marie Back took the BIGGEST apple on the plate, but sad to relate it was HALF bad. \"You know,\" she said to Mildred, \"I was a little too greedy. This apple is half bad - but I am so hungry that I will have to eat it!\"\n\nOne night just after everyone had been moved from Ward IV Annie Cotton went a-visiting as usual. She stopped at the door and called out to Ward IV, \"Hello, everybody!\" \"Hello, everybody,\" came the answer. Then she looked - the ward was empty! She went back to her bed and sat down in bewilderment. \"That's strange,\" she said, \"there isn't a person in that ward but I am sure somebody answered me and said 'Hello, everybody' so clearly!\" (I guess the nurses must have forgotten to move Mary Echo.)\n\nSoliloquy of a Ward IV Girl\n\nWe were turned out of old home a few days ago. How we miss the lovely old place! However, it has been nice to be with the girls on this side. We cannot compete at all with them when it comes to jokes. I think they have been too well trained by their Comedian, \"Slick\". Then over in the corner is Little Cold Ham - she is just funny, naturally, without half-trying. We all hope to be back in our ward in a month or so.\n\nQuestion - When is a piece of wood like a queen?\nAnswer - When it is made into a ruler.\nWARD IV SUNPORCH\n\nMY THOUGHTS TO THE GOOD LORD\n\nGive me good understandings, Lord,\nAnd also things to learn,\nGive me a healthy mind, Lord,\nWith sense to keep it at its best.\n\nGive me healthy deeds, good Lord,\nTo keep the good and pure in sight,\nWhich seeing sin, is not weak with fear\nBut finds a way to set it right.\n\nGive me a mind that's not a bore,\nThat does not whine nor sigh.\nDon't let me worry over much,\nAbout the fussy things, called \"I\".\n\nGive me a sense of humour, Lord,\nThe eyes to see a joke,\nTo get some happiness from life,\nAnd pass it on to other folk.\n\nK. Melinda Twigg.\n\nWARD VII\n\nWe welcome the following new members to our ward:\nJohn Suzan - no fixed address\nArsene Freeman - Hay Lakes\nMichael Tom - Fort Rae, N.W.T.\nJimmy Delan - Fort Norman, N.W.T.\n\nWe are glad to see Leo Sowan again. He needs no introduction having been in this hospital thirty months before. He returned for a check-up.\n\nGilbert Big Sorrel Horse is enjoying a trip to the Colonel Mewburn Hospital every morning.\n\nBernard Buffalo and Philip Simon have left for their home in Hobbema. Joe Germaine left, also, for his home in Mayo, Yukon.\n\nAs for me -- I am looking forward to the great day when I shall be getting my operation. I hope it won't be long now.\n\nWishing everybody good luck and a speedy recovery.\n\nA.A. Atcheynum.\n\nWARD IX A\n\nWelcome to our new ward mates, Frances Poitras, John J. Courtereille, Fred Cleary and Leon Francis.\n\nAu revoir to our \"side-kicks\" ---, Joe Hoof, Robert Wesley and Isadore Michel, all transferred to other wards.\n\nArchie Half is in a private until such time as he has learned adherence to the rules of the game, Cure Chasing.\n\nEmil was the envy of his chums one evening - a surprise visit from his lady friend of long standing. We believe her first name is Josephine but Emil refuses to divulge it or her phone number.\nThe notable Louis Henault celebrated his 23rd birthday and received a handsome cigarette case and lighter, which anyone would be proud to own. Says he, \"from a close friend\". Louis' mates would still like to know who brought him the basket of delicious strawberries. Could she be another \"close friend,\" Louis?\n\nMoses Jim Johnson and Louis Henault of this band were amongst those who were able to go to the Patients' Picnic of July 20. They both wore blue for the occasion. We gathered from their remarks that a good time was had by all.\n\nIsadore Gladu is the leading linguist of this part of the institution, being able to speak English, French and Cree fluently. He also has a fair knowledge of the Blackfoot lingo. Isadore's timely jokes, that would make even a \"stone-faced Indian\" laugh has made him very popular amongst us. Keep it up, Isy!\n\nJoe Hoof, who was unable to read or write when admitted nine months ago, now exhibits a fair hand at writing. He can now read and reply to his own personal correspondence. He specializes in local letters -- and you know that helps a good deal!\n\nThe Wells, Hoof and Henault Company, Recorder of Native Songs, etc., regret to announce that it will be temporarily suspending operations owing to the transferring of the Chief Drummer, Hoof, to Ward X B. The Company will resume operations as soon as a satisfactory replacement is located.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nHoward McMaster.\n\nA WORD ABOUT HOWARD\n\nWe boys in Ward IX A are all very pleased and proud to have Howard McMaster in with us. He is our main stand-by. Whenever we have any problem or difficulty, from the proper spelling of a word to a matter of discipline, we always turn to Howard. We are never refused his help and advice. Howard is enrolled for a Course in Business English by correspondence. We hope that he will soon feel well enough to take up his studying again.\nWARD IX B\n\nWHO'S WHO IN OUR WARD\n\nJERRY CHALIFOUX and ALPHONSE THOMAS have been competing in a letter-writing contest. ALPHONSE holds first place to date having written eleven letters to JERRY'S nine, a day.\n\nBEN ADAMS is still tops when it comes to checker playing. He has beaten all the boys and is willing to take on any of the girls now.\n\nJIMMIE KLUIZEE has been here for some time but still does not believe he has T.B. Every time we mention his having \"bugs\" he just shakes his head and laughs to beat sixty.\n\nAnd last comes HARRY NEDLIN, the great man to make the news, for he has travelled on the Great Slave Lake - and that's ME\u2014 ha,ha!\n\nWARD IX C\n\nOne day the boys were out for a drive. One of the boys lost his hat. He asked the driver if he might go after it. \"No,\" said the driver, \"if you run after it, you'll never come back. You stay here and I'll run after it!\"\n\nA FEW FAREWELL WORDS FROM ABRAHAM OKPIK\n\nIt was a grand experience to meet all the boys at the Charles Camsell Hospital and to get acquainted with the splendid staff. Rose B. is a grand ward aid and many a time her smile has helped to cheer us up. All the staff are very kind and good to the patients. I shall often think of the days I spent in the hospital and the good times we had in spite of being sick.\n\nWARD IX (Private)\n\nHello, boys, especially Ward IX C and X B \u2014 hope you are all doing fine and will be able to go home. Two lads from Ward IX C, Abraham Okpik and Sam Williams, received their \"evacuation\" this morning. The nurses and aids will not let the patients worry or be lonesome. They do all they can to cheer them up. I try to co-operate all I can. God bless you all! Jim Johnson.\n\nWARD X A\n\nAugust 23, 1948.\n\nDear friends,\n\nGlad to know most of you are doing well. I hear some of you are getting ready to start for home. I do hope that we won't forget to thank everyone before we leave the hospital. I have been mighty glad to have visitors from home. I had the\nWARD X A (Continued)\n\nminister, Rev. N.T. Cathcart also Mrs. Fraser and Jean. I received good tidings of all at home, and was glad to know that my nephew, whom I had advised to come into this hospital for treatment, was all better again.\n\nI am still with my Eskimo friends - have been here since early in the year, 1947. I do like them well. They are most kindly people and treat their friends so very very well.\n\nRobert Laboucon\n\nWARD X B\n\nWe take great pleasure in taking advantage of this opportunity of informing you all as to how we are doing. Quite a few of our lads have been transferred to other wards: Frances Poitras and James Courtoreille were promoted to Ward IX A and Eddy Lafleur to Ward IX C. What's the big idea, boys, leaving us just as we were really getting acquainted? Good luck to you and keep up the jokes and the fun. Robert Wesley, Joe Hoof and Abraham Vinelar have been transferred into our ward. Greetings to all in the Camsell.\n\nFrom the boys of Ward X B (John Pascal)\n\nWARD X C\n\nThe nurse looked in vain for one of our boys (we won't tell which one). She looked in all the beds, behind the doors, in the private ward and then she opened the bathroom door and called out, \"Are you in there?\" An answer came back promptly and clearly, \"No, nurse, have you looked under the bed?\"\n\n.......................\n\nOVERHEARD AT THE PICNIC OF THE PATIENTS\n\nWard Aid - (after winning tug-of-war against the nurses) I hope the nurses won't think that we can do all the lifting of the casts after this!\n\nCanon Clough - If I could have got into those \"jeans\" ---- I k-k-k-now Miss Ferguson and I could have won that CLOTHES RACE!\n\n.......................\n\nOne of the Doctors - We must try and have another and bring all the patients who did not get to this one!\n\nEVERYBODY - It has been one of the most successful projects we have had!

Also you will note that two shades of Brown have been used for the Beaver. We believe the darker shade to be better.\n\nWe have averaged the time of making all badges, and if they can be purchased in fairly even quantities, we can give you a straight price of $1.80 per dozen, Sales Tax extra. You will note that there is a great deal more embroidery work in the Poultry, Housekeeper, Weaving, and Leatherwork, so if you required the major portion in anyone of these particular badges we would have to price the items separately. The price quoted is for a minimum order of 170 badges of each type, or what we refer to as a machine-run of each, or it's multiple.\n\nWe are sorry for the long delay we caused you, but we really have been very busy on war orders. Further, if you find our work satisfactory, and are prepared to place an order with us, please do so at your earliest possible convenience, so we may be sure to have the badges for you by November.\n\nWe trust that the samples as prepared are satisfactory to you, and we will be pleased to give any further information that you may require.\n\nThanking you, we are\n\nYours very truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nDominion Crest Co.\nDOMINION CREST COMPANY\nTHE QUEENSWAY, AT CULNAN\nETOBICOKE TOWNSHIP, ONTARIO\nADDRESS CORRESPONDENCE TO BOX 1018 STATION 'C' TORONTO\n\nSeptember 24/42\n\nMr. A.J. Doucet\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOttawa,\nCanada.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nUnder separate cover we have today forwarded to you 10 embroidered samples of badges patterned after designs as suggested by you. We have prepared these in actual embroidery work, as we thought this would be more satisfactory to you. The 10 badges are as follows:-\n\nCooking\nPoultry\nGardening\nSewing\nKnitting\nCarpentry (Woodworking)\nHousekeeper\nWeaving\nLeatherwork\nMetalworker (Blacksmith)\n\nWe have placed the badges in the above order, when mailing, so you will have no difficulty distinguishing the purpose of the patterns, although we believe each badge has features that definitely associates itself with the line it is to represent.\n\nYou explained that you wished two backgrounds, suggesting Red & Green. You will note that we have prepared the Red & Green samples, and also a Khaki or Fawn sample. If it possible, we would suggest the use of the Red & Khaki, as these two colours are more easily secured in Felts. In fact it is almost impossible to secure a Green Felt at present.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nVOTE\n\nSHIP TO\n\nPurpose for which required\n\nNOTE\u2014Requisition for non-consumable equipment, state if New Issue or Replacement.\n\nconsumable equipment and supplies use columns 1 and 2.\n\n| Quantity | Description                        | Quantity on hand | Quantity needed per month | Unit Price | TOTAL |\n|----------|------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------|------------|-------|\n| 340      | Cooking badges (170 green, 170 red)| \u2713                |                           |            |       |\n| 170      | Poultry \" (85 \" 85 \")               |                  |                           |            |       |\n| 170      | Gardening \" (85 \" 85 \")             |                  |                           |            |       |\n| 340      | Sewing \" (170 \" 170 \")              | \u2713                |                           |            |       |\n| 340      | Knitting \" (170 \" 170 \")            | \u2713                |                           |            |       |\n| 340      | Carpentry \" (170 \" 170 \")           | \u2713                |                           |            |       |\n| 340      | Housekeeper \" (170 \" 170 \")         | \u2713                |                           |            |       |\n| 340      | Dairy \" (170 \" 170 \")               |                  |                           |            |       |\n| 60       | Leatherwork \" (40 \" 40 \")           |                  |                           |            |       |\n| 60       | Metalwork \" (40 \" 40 \")              |                  |                           |            |       |\n| 80       | Weaving \" (40 \" 40 \")                |                  |                           |            |       |\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and will suffer if it is not made.\n\nSIGNED\n\nAPPROVED\n\n(SEE OTHER SIDE)\nSupplies mentioned hereunder have been received and found satisfactory with exception of those listed under \"Remarks\".\n\n| QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION | UNIT | TOTAL |\n|----------|-------------|------|-------|\n| 340 only | cooking badges (170 green, 170 red) | 170 | 340 |\n| 170 | Poultry | 05 | 85 |\n| 170 | Gardening | 05 | 85 |\n| 340 | Sewing | 270 | 900 |\n| 340 | Knitting | 270 | 900 |\n| 340 | Carpentry | 270 | 900 |\n| 340 | Housekeeper | 270 | 900 |\n| 340 | Dairy | 270 | 900 |\n| 60 | Leatherwork | 40 | 240 |\n| 60 | Metalwork | 40 | 240 |\n| 60 | Bowling | 40 | 240 |\n\nTotal: 2000\n\nPrices F.O.B.

Enclosed you will find an order covering the amounts required for various proficiencies. I am not impressed very favourably with your fawn sample. I certainly would appreciate your making these in the green colour. You will notice that I have added a proficiency badge in dairy work. You will no doubt find no trouble in picking out a suitable design. One change, however, which I would like to make is to change the DMR (Department of Mines & Resources) to Indian Affairs; that is, the two letters IA. I agree with your suggestion that the beaver should be in the darker brown.\n\nYou will notice from the enclosed order that some quantities are less than a complete run. However, as these quantities affect the badges that require the most work, I thought that your quoted price would not be changed. If, however, there is any change in your prices, please notify me at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. W.C. Leslie,\nDominion Crest Company,\nBox 1018 Station \"C\",\nToronto, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES & RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nOttawa,\nJanuary 29, 1943.\n\nTo principals and teachers of Indian schools:\n\nRe: Proficiency Badges\n\nAs illustrated by Mr. Doucet on various occasions, the proficiency badges will soon be ready and it is our intention to award badges for cooking, sewing, weaving, knitting, housekeeping, gardening, leather work, dairying and poultry raising.\n\nBefore making these badges available the Indian Affairs Branch desires the teachers of the various manual skills to make a list of the basic operations which, in their opinion, the pupil should cover for each year of a three-year course in order to entitle the pupil to receive a badge.\n\nThese basic operations should be progressive from the easiest to the more difficult. It must be kept in mind that the operations listed must be basic; namely, operations that are absolutely necessary in carrying out the simple duties of a housewife, of a cook etc. There should be about twenty basic operations for each year.\n\nPrincipals should notify the teachers concerned and forward their lists as soon as possible to the Training Division, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nTo principals and teachers of Indian schools:\n\nRe: Chart for Proficiency Badges\n\nYou are being forwarded two charts illustrating the proficiency badges about which you were advised in circular letter of January 29, 1943. These charts should be framed and one posted in the boys' side of the building and the other in the girls'.\n\nYou will note that these charts indicate the basic operations which pupils must know in order to qualify for a badge.\n\nWhen a pupil has efficiently covered the first group of basic units a green badge is awarded. When the second group is covered a red badge is awarded. Later you will be advised regarding the badge which will be awarded for covering the third group of basic units.\n\nIn the majority of cases it will require one year for a pupil to cover each of the groups of basic units. In some cases a pupil may cover this group in less time than a year, while other pupils will require a longer period than a year.\n\nFor reasons that will readily suggest themselves to you, it has been decided not to award any badge to a pupil under twelve years of age. It is true that some of the operations recognized for badges will have been learned before that age is reached, but these operations will not be recognized for badge purposes until the age mentioned.\n\nWhen a pupil has qualified for a badge a special form is signed by the instructor and the principal and forwarded to this office. The badge will then be sent to the pupil. This badge should be awarded publicly as soon as possible after its reception, either by the Student Council or any similar school organization.\n\nTeachers should keep in mind that the success of any enterprise depends on the enthusiasm shown by the teachers themselves. The Department, therefore, depends upon principals, teachers and instructors to use every possible effort to create interest and enthusiasm among the pupils in the badge system.\n\nR.A.

Hoey, Supt. of Welfare and Training,\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nAs requested in a letter addressed to the principal, dated Jan. 29th, I am submitting a list of basic operations in cooking......sewing......laundry......and housecleaning, covering a period of three years. We have been using this course in our school for the past two years and find it quite suitable.\n\nYou will notice that there are only ten basic operations in each course; this is meant so as to give the teacher one a month, giving her a wide scope for planning her work. As you know, this is sometimes all given by the same teacher, to pupils attending classes, and we find that in working out four lessons from each of these basic operations we can cover all the work.\n\nWe will be pleased to have more information on the manner of procedure in obtaining the proficiency badges.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSister Mary Damian,\nSuperior\nOttawa,\nFebruary 24, 1943.\n\nTo principals and teachers of Indian schools:\n\nRe: Chart for Proficiency Badges\n\nYou are being forwarded two charts illustrating the proficiency badges about which you were advised in circular letter of January 29, 1943.

Time will tell us if I am wrong in so doing. If the experience is satisfactory, next Academic term will see other changes as radical as this one.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very obediently,\n\nRev.

We need special information concerning the awarding of these Badges. I assisted with convention last November and ever since have tried to carry out the nice decisions and grand ideas in the development of the Indian boy or girl. You see, Mr. Peter, that it will be difficult to award these pupils this year with the badges for the teacher have just begun the woodwork course. Other members of the staff here sewing, cooking, etc., organized classes, it will require me just for a pupil to cover each of the groups of basic units. So, not feel that it is proper to distribute the prize.\nDo you think it better to order the badge immediately or wait until later? The information and advice that will be given to us will be greatly appreciated and all orders will be carried out exactly as suggested. I thought of asking you about this, knowing of your interest in this affair.

(See student record for woodwork) At a definite period, once or twice a week, each pupil calls out his standing: Badge No., Basic Operation No., and standing A, B or C. The teacher posts these on the class Student record. The teacher should take advantage of this period for a general discussion.\n5. Teachers should prepare a reading list and keep a record of each pupil's reading. This may advantageously be done by the pupils themselves. (See Reading Record Sheet for Woodwork). A definite discussion period on the reading should be provided.\n\nThe eleven badges so far provided do not comprise all the training that may be given to Indian children. Badges may be added from time to time.

It is realized however each School has its own special functions, and it may not be possible for your badge system to particularize in every instance. This matter has been delayed, not through neglect, but in order to give ample time for our Staff to consider this whole question in detail.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL\n\nP.S. Consideration might also be given to a badge for Physical & Recreational activities, both for girls and boys.\nSaint Anthony's School,\nLloydminster, Sask.\nMay 15, 1943.\n\nTraining Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa,\nCanada.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWe now have a group of girls who have satisfactorily mastered the basic operations of the first year for different badges; some of them are nearly finished the second year's task. They will complete it during the month of June.\n\nWould you kindly forward us one hundred card forms provided by the Department, for this special work?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nST. ANTHONY'S SCHOOL\n\n[Signature]\n\nMay 28/43.\nShannonville, Ont.\nJune 19, 1943.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nDept. of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have four pupils whom I believe are qualified for First Year badges in Manual Training and Sewing. Two boys, Alwood Brant and Lloyd Brant have completed the course prescribed for First Year work.\n\nOf course our schools are not equipped with sewing machines but two girls, Joan Claus and Alma Maracle took sewing machine work at the last short course held on this reserve and last year Joan Claus took the work at Ryerson Junior High in Hamilton.\n\nI wish to present these badges at our annual school picnic when school closes.\n\nI would like to offer the suggestion that first year badges be awarded to those in grade six who have satisfactorily completed\nthe course, rather than attributing it to age.\n\n12. Some of our pupils pass their entrance at twelve and thirteen and are unable to compete for all the badges. I have one boy in particular, Raymond Green, who does excellent work and yet cannot compete due to his age. He has completed the course, does neat and careful work and yet cannot win a badge for another year. Would it be practical to leave it to the discretion of the teacher as to whom badges should be awarded?\n\nI have three in my entrance class this year. Joan Claus was accepted by the board but Alwood Beant and Alma Maracle must write the Departmental paper. The girls wish to take commercial courses next year but the boy is a farmer. He would like two years high and a course at an Agricultural College then take up farming. He says he wants to be not just a farmer but a good one.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nLeslie Claus.\nOttawa, June 28, 1943.\n\nRev. A. Alac, Principal, Sturgeon Lake Indian Day School,\nCalais, Alberta.\n\nI am returning herewith the Student Record of Mastered Basic Operations) for Proficiency Badges. These records should be kept at the school. I realize that you have sent them because of the dearth of proficiency requisition cards. I am also enclosing four dozen application cards which you will complete and forward to us, after which we will be able to forward to you the badges requested.\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nOttawa, June 28, 1943.\n\nMr. Leslie Claus, Teacher, Shannonville, Ontario,\n\nReturning to the office after an absence of three weeks I found your letter of the 19th instant. I regret that it will be too late to give the at the time you planned, however, another occasion will present itself, I hope. Your request for badges for pupils who have not yet reached the age of twelve has been given serious consideration. I feel, however, that due to complications which would set in, if this were allowed, it is impossible for us to consider this request favourably. This should not prevent the child from working towards other badges which will be awarded to him when he has reached the age of twelve.\n\nI am pleased to note that some of your boys have qualified for badges. I have also noted that no request has been made for badges for the girls. I wonder if this was an oversight or whether the girls have not been able to qualify for the first year badges in sewing?\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nNOTE - 1.

What a boon to education this would be.\n\nWe have very few books here, having lost many of them in the Senior School Fire. For your information, I am enclosing a list of them.\n\nThe girls of the Domestic Science Class are beginning to receive their badges for their work. Are they enthused? We are planning some demonstration where we will give these badges out publicly. If you still intend coming to Saugnawaga, probably we could arrange so that you would hand them these badges personally. Our boys have also done wonderful work. I am enclosing a report submitted by their professor, Mr. Wescott, asking that all of these boys be given a badge for First Year Woodwork.\n\nWe would appreciate receiving a supply of the special cards requesting these badges.\n\nWe know that the Department is not issuing any grants for boys wanting to attend High School but would you kindly write me a letter stating this fact. It will help to have a letter to this effect that we may show the parents when they call at the convent.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSISTERS OF SAINT ANN\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, Sept. 20, 1943.\n\nReverend Sister M.

Please complete these and sign them and send to this office. We will then proceed to issue the badges.\n\nI am also pleased to note that the girls received their badges with great enthusiasm. I am sure that this is the echo of the teachers' enthusiasm. In order to instil the pupils with enthusiasm, the teachers must create this enthusiasm, which is to say contagious.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. Sister M.

Hepgood, revised by Ella Spooner and published by the Ginn & Company? These books would be highly appreciated by the Domestic Science Department.\n\nI have advised Mr. Brisebois concerning the hiring of an Indian teacher to help out in the First Class.

You will also find a chart representing the various badges that may be obtained by the pupil when he has covered the basic requirements. These badges are sent to the pupil, in care of the teacher when we receive the card which certifies that the pupil has attained this proficiency. These cards are also enclosed.\n\nShould there be any doubt in regard to the use of this material, I would be pleased to forward any directions that may be required.\n\nA. J. Doucet.\nYouville Indian Residential School\nSt. Albert, Nov. 10-1943\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter dated November states that you have received no report of the work done by the children of this school for the past two months. I wish to explain this delay and apologize for all inconveniences which it may have caused.\n\nSister Ste Sabine, former superior of this house, has been transferred to a new post, and I, as her successor in this charge, have been in office here since three weeks only. There are some things therefore, which have not yet come to my attention as to the usual routine of affairs. As the sending of reports had not been mentioned to me, I knew nothing of this. Your request is very much appreciated and I shall try to satisfy this requirement in the future.\n\nI would very much appreciate some information for procedure in this matter.\n\nWe have at hand some forms which seem to be for use in determining the yearly standing of the children for the distribution of badges. Are these the ordinary forms to be used for the report in question, or are there some special monthly forms? Your card gives me to understand that a new method, which I would like to be made clear is now in use. All explanations on this subject would be greatly accepted.\n\nWhen we hear from you, we shall try to send, as soon as possible, an up-to-date report of the children under our care.\n\nThanking you for your kindness,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nYouville Indian Residential School,\nSt. Albert, Alta.\nOttawa, November 17, 1943.\n\nRev. Sister Jose Vincent, Principal, Youville Indian Residential School, St. Albert, Alta.\n\nYour letter of the 10th instant, has been referred to me.\n\nThe enclosed forms and explanations of procedure should give you all the details necessary to follow these manual training courses. The class monthly report with its instructions on the reverse will answer your question on the special monthly form.\n\nI hope this information will allow you to visualize the procedure necessary to carry out these instructions.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, November 23, 1943.\n\nReverend Father:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, I have carefully taken note of the contents.\n\nI know that this system appears somewhat complicated but in reality, very simple. I am sorry that I have been unable to visit the B.C. schools as yet, but I hope in a future, not too remote, to be able to do so. My idea in this form of manual education is to motivate the child's endeavors so that he may earn a badge if he so desires. There are probably a number of pupils in your school that are deserving of a badge. The award of a badge I believe should greatly encourage them. Read the instructions sent with the coloured sheets (basic operations). You will notice what is required to qualify for these badges. I will be only too pleased to send badges to pupils who have qualified for them.\n\nEducation today needs a great deal of change. This goes for all types of schools. The whole child must be educated morally, physically, intellectually, and religiously. There must be more cooperation between the school and the home. If these principles are not carried out it is to be feared that more hardships must still fall upon society. These are a few principles that should\nbe studied by the teachers. I believe the activity program of study is the only program that will rectify some of the evils of society. In due course I will be sending books which the teachers should read, take notes and discuss among themselves. Let us work together in the adaptation of the activity mode of education.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J. P.

Doucet\nTraining Division\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nDear Sir -\n\nIn reply to the enclosed form - I must confess that I have not kept records of the time spent by each child in Manual Training. I had never inspected the clock or the work sheet and I must say that due to carelessness on my part I was ignorant of the fact that a report was to be sent each month.\n\nStarting December 1st I will keep these records and send the report each month.\n\nHoping that you\nChristie Indian Residential School\nHakatusis, B.C.\n(WEST COAST, VANCOUVER ISLAND)\n\nWill overlook this carelessness on my part.\n\nI remain\n\nYours truly\nJ.P.

The forms for badges #1, #2, #3, #4, and #7 are required.\n\nThe boys have had to discontinue their shop work because they have no instructors. We hope this valuable training may be resumed as soon as possible.\n\nThank you for your kindly interest in the welfare of these Indian children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Sister Mary Shilling, Principal, St. Catherine's Day School, Duncan, British Columbia,\n\nUnder separate cover you will receive the badges for five of the pupils for which you requisitioned. The sixth badge was not granted because of the regulation which you may have noticed on the directions accompanying the basic operation chart. This girl is but ten or eleven years of age.

This is the first time we have sent any, and there are some children who have qualified for both first and second badges. I do not know what the procedure is but I will send this list for your examination.\n\nThe boys under the supervision of the Manual Trainer,\nChristie Indian Residential School\nKakawis, B.C.\n(WEST COAST, VANCOUVER ISLAND)\n\nwho is also an Indian, have started to build a 36 foot deep sea boat. The agent believes that this is the most practical form of manual training for boys who will all be fishermen.\n\nI cannot find the necessary forms to send in a complete report so I have listed the names on ordinary stationery.\n\nWould you be kind enough to send monthly report forms and student record of attendance?\n\nThanking you. I remain\n\nYours truly\nJ. McLean\nOttawa, January 17, 1944.\n\nRev. J. Mulvihill, O.M.I., Principal, Christie Indian Residential School, Kakawis, B.C.\n\nI am returning herewith the coloured sheets. These sheets are to be posted in the classroom for the information of the pupils. Please read the inclosed instructions. Monthly reports are sent in on a special form which I am inclosing. I am also inclosing fifty badge requisition cards which are to be filled in, signed, and countersigned, after which I will be pleased to send badges to the deserving pupils.\n\nThe thirty-six foot boat which you refer to is no doubt very good exercise for the pupils who intend to become fishermen provided that they learn the basic operations. This project may be very good for the advanced pupils.\n\nA. J. Doucet.\n\nEnclosure\nOttawa, January 17, 1944.\n\nRev. C. Schmidt, O.M.I., Principal, Ermineskin Indian Res.

Nous ne pouvons pas de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que nous puissions faire quelque chose dans le moment pr\u00e9sent et nous avons donc \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9s de faire quelques travaux int\u00e9rieurs et ext\u00e9rieurs de l'\u00e9cole.\n\nP.S. T\u00e9treault\n\nP.S. T\u00e9treault\nDear Mr. Vincent:\n\nThe local Sister Superior has asked me to apply to you for badges #1 (Cooking) for Ann Mary White and Anastasia Francis. I told her that I believed these badges were awarded only at the end of the School year. She has asked me to write, nevertheless, and to ask for the badges as she believes these girls getting them will prove an incentive to others. The record shows that these girls have \"a\" for the various operations, while Ann Mary's last four superior to the others. This is Ann Mary's last year and ought to be possible (especially with her) to earn encouragement (suggested) for her to complete the five years' operations. This girl is the best of our plains organ players and accompanies at high Masses. She has made her future quite promising. Her parents at least, he has given up drinking and has paid up his debts. The granting of a badge to his eldest daughter may help him overcome a little his eldest daughter's vice (alcoholism). We need the new standard (for excellence).\n\nI hope you will be doing fairly well. We hope...\nhad a case of chicken pox here for over 2 weeks, but, so far, we have managed to stop it from spreading. Quite a few Indians were already ill with the flu, so far, we have escaped it.\n\nThe sending of girls, as promised, to the Coqualeetza hospital has proved disastrous. Mr. Inspector Coleman, who is to meet the Indians here on Monday, will likely get an earful. I knew of three cases of very severe flu. I suggested what might occur & pointed out what might have prevented all this trouble.\n\nBarre is leaving fairly close to his time you traced, but he is a little old to learn new tricks. Quite a few of the boys are rather good, in his opinion, and he isn't entirely mistaken.\n\nI'm sorry that Mr. Campbell made it impossible for me to see you in Ottawa. However, he has likely saved me from mastoiditis. I'm still a bit deaf & therefore, am tempted to apply to the Indian Dept. for the position of \"Hearer or Complaints.\"\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nP.S. If you know where heat packs can be obtained, please let me know.\n\nYours sincerely,\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, February 1, 1944.\n\nDear Father Forbes:\n\nIn reply to your letter of January 26th, I wish to say that the badges are available, as soon as the pupils have completed, satisfactorily, the basic operations required for the badge in question. If these girls have completed these basic operations, they are entitled to the badges at present. I am, therefore, sending, under separate cover, the requisitioned badges. Inclosed you will find twenty-five requisition cards. Would you kindly have the cards for Ann Mary White and Anastasia Francis completed, signed and returned to this office. We need these cards to complete our records.\n\nI am looking forward to the day when the boys will have the services of a thoroughly qualified manual training instructor. I have hopes that the Government will finally understand the necessity of these teachers, and give the necessary help. In the meantime, I know that you will carry on, in the best possible manner.\n\nI regret to learn that you have not yet completely recovered from your illness. I hope that Divine Providence will send you the blessing of good health, in order to carry on this work of Indian education.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nIt would almost seem as if we had done nothing about the very interesting looking Charts which arrived just before school closed in June, but such is not the case. I think the idea is a good one, but if I might make some comments I don't think the 'requirements' are very well graded, and some not very practical. There is much repetition and even the operations which are carried on in all schools have certain things listed which do not apply.\n\nMost of our senior girls can do many things listed under all three jerseys, but they become discouraged when they see so many things which neither time nor place make possible.\n\nFor instance, who ever has heard of a cremaise? Bannock is foreign to our girls; we have no ice box, and don't need one, and few men wear home made suits and overcoats these days.\n\nThe most that any school has time to do in knitting, sewing, cooking or housekeeping is to learn the general mechanics of the project and hope the student will apply it in detail himself.\n\nI would suggest that each school send to the Department for approval a 'Basic Operations' based on those you sent out but able to be applied to that particular school. Some of the requirements only come to perfection after years of experience.\n\nI would very much like to know what has been the reaction from other schools regarding this project.\n\nPlease may I have a sample badge also a Reading Record Sheet for wood work? These were not included in my packet.\n\nMany thanks, Yours truly,\n\nPovesh Frenzel,\nPovesh.\n\nAddress - Miss Bevins French\nPort Simpson - B.C.\nOttawa, February 9, 1944.\n\nMiss Bessie French, Teacher, Crosby Girl's School,\nFort Simpson, B.C.\n\nI have read your letter of the 20th instant, with\na great deal of care. I thank you, for the suggestions\nthat you have made, therein. As you will notice, many\nof these suggestions have already been carried out.\n\nYou understand, that there must be a certain amount\nof repetition from one year to another, but it must be\nnoted that the requirements of the repeated basic\noperation are more advanced. As far as certain operations\nbeing beyond the pupil's capacity or not being suited to\nthe locality, the basic operations are sufficiently flexible\nto be adopted in any locality. If the making of a pattern\nand the cutting of a chemise does not seem practical\nbecause they are not worn, another article of clothing may\nbe substituted, but still the basic operation remains.\n\nThe basic operation charts are a summary of work\nsubmitted by many teachers of residential schools, as well\nas day schools. Perfection is not expected, but the pupil\nmust have satisfactorily mastered the operation.\n\nFor your information, I might state the following\nbadges have been sent out:\n\n| First Year Manual Training | Second Year Cooking |\n|---------------------------|---------------------|\n| \"Sewing\"                  | \"Sewing\"            |\n| \"Dairying\"                | \"Knitting\"          |\n| \"Knitting\"                | \"Housekeeping\"      |\n| \"Woodwork\"                |                     |\n| \"Housekeeping\"            |                     |\n| \"Cooking\"                 |                     |\n| \"Gardening\"               |                     |\n\n(Over)\nIt would be very unfortunate, indeed, if instead of encouraging the pupils, these charts should have the opposite effect. This does not seem the case at the various schools that have been visited, and that send in monthly reports. Their object is to train the pupils as thoroughly as possible in the elementary operations necessary in carrying on their duties out of school.\n\nEnclosed please find a sample badge and the reading report sheets as requested in your letter. If there is anything else I can do to further this training please write.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, February 10, 1944.\n\nRev. A.

I send, at the same time, three reports: one for last December, another for January, and a third one for last February.\n\nWe reorganized last fall our woodworking course, and I am pleased to say that our boys take an interest in learning the different operations in the field of woodwork. In our teaching we use the Woodworking Course sent to us by the Department of Mines and Resources; we use also a book published by F.F. Tushon and A.J. Brown \"Instructional Units in Hand Woodwork.\" According to that author, our boys select their own article, and then proceed to analyze the operations which they should know to make the article selected.\n\nBesides hand woodwork, we organized also book binding\u2014but the boys do not take so\nmuch interest in that matter. \u2014 But Concerning hand woodwork, our boys are encouraged and some of them assume a knowing look and.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nFr Ferdinand Smith our instructor\nSt. Martin's Mission, Deyaraia, Alberta March the 13th 1944.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan, Chief,\nTraining Division, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI find enclose the monthly returns for the training given to some of our children.

Daniel\nWelfare & Training\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am enclosing the monthly reports for the girls. The boys have been working and observing the laying of a keel, stem and stern of a fishing boat and I cannot put these results on a monthly report form. This is very important work for them. If they do any carpentry work after leaving school it will be boat building. Last term we had them each build a model house to scale, when it was completed, we built a regular house so that they received both the theory and practice.\n\nYours very truly,\nJ.M. Mitchell\nMarch 1944\n\nDear Mr. Odeeret:\n\nWould you please send me a supply of these application forms for badges? Only one card was sent to me and I shall need it very soon and more later. I have been teaching four young boys in poultry raising and they have been given \"A\" for all operations (last year) except for #6 (natural ventilation) and #3 (to feed baby chicks). Our baby chicks arrive from Calgary on the 28th and shall have done hatch here later.\n\nTwo of these boys had previous experience here but we did not start a regular course until 6 weeks ago. The boys are really interested and, without any suggestion, I have applied certain suggestions which I found in poultry books. I have just told 3 of the older girls to the poultry house and explained a few things - they seemed really interested and we may even have some female poultry experts.\n\nIn the Carpenters' shop, besides other things, Berndt and his boys are building a 10'x12' house for the baby chicks. The boys and I are down...\nSome old, unused & unsightly pleasant pans & \nare changing others (in line with & adjoining the chicken \nhouse - which house we tore down weren't) into a \nchicken run. In the building referred to, he says \naren't just holding nails or running messages \nfor Barrie. They will know how to build a real \nchicken house.\n\nWith Kind personal regards,\n\nYours Truly,\nG. Forbes\n\n6 Reg cards sent\nMarch 29/44.\nOttawa, March 29, 1944.\n\nRev. G. Forbes, O.M.I., Principal, Kootenay Indian Residential School, Cranbrook, B.C.\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 19th instant, I wish to express regret in answering this letter only at this time. I have been away for several weeks and have been unable to attend to the correspondence which has accumulated on my desk during my absence. Inclosed you will find six cards. I will be sending more in the near future as soon as the new edition comes from the press. We are very short at this time.\n\nI am very much pleased to hear that the boys and girls are taking a great deal of interest in these activities. I know that some of the operations might be difficult to perform in school, however, the pupil may qualify for badges at any time at any place, provided he proves to the Principal that he is proficient in the basic operation in question. It is gratifying to read that the girls are also developing an interest in poultry, as this will probably be one of their duties in later life.\n\nI hope that your health is back to normal. Give my best regards to your personnel. To yourself, I offer Easter greetings.\n\nYours for better Indian education,\n\nA. J. Douget.\nSturgeon Lake Indian Res.

Platon,\nChief Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn your letter of March 14, you requested that I fill out and send to you a set of registration cards. In December 1942 I received a set of cards, in June 1943 I filled out these cards and returned them to you. Badges for last term's work were sent to me. These distributed last September. Last December more badges arrived which I intended to give in June. The cards for this year's work I intended to send in June. Would this be satisfactory?\n\nThanking you for the interest taken in our school, I remain\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. Alan\nOttawa, April 15, 1944.\n\nRev. A. Alac, Principal, Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School, Calais, Alberta.\n\nI have on hand your letter of the 3rd instant and have taken careful notice of its contents. In reply to your suggestion on giving out these badges only at the end of the year, I wish to state that I feel that you will achieve greater work, greater enthusiasm and consequently greater results, if these badges were given out at some student meeting as soon as they have been deserved. A pupil may earn several badges in one year. There is no limit except his own ability. I wish you would consider this angle and let me have your comments at your earliest convenience.\n\nA. J. Doucet.\nOttawa, April 17, 1944.\n\nRev. H. W. Snell, Principal, Mohawk Institute Res. School,\nBrentford, Ontario.\n\nAs a sequence to our conversation in Toronto last week, I wish to state that I have looked up our returns for badges and find the reports of April 1942 along with a separate list of names stating the basic units covered. For some reason or other the year has been left out so that it is impossible for me to know which badge should be sent, as the number of the units indicated do not correspond fully with the basic operation charts. I think that the simplest method for you would be to fill out the requisition cards required for these pupils and we will then be able to consider the matter. I am sorry that any misunderstanding has occurred in this matter.\n\nA. J. Doucet.\nOttawa, April 17, 1944.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will recall that in 1942 you prepared Proficiency Badges for the Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources. We are very short at present of some of these badges and wish to know how soon you would be able to replenish these. I presume that you still have samples of these badges, if not, please let me know and I will send you one of each. The following are the badges required in the green colour only:\n\n170 of each type; this I believe is what you call a machine-run: Sewing, Cooking, Batting, Carpentry, Housekeeping. It may be that the prices due to present conditions have changed, please let me know at your earliest convenience what you can do in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. J.

Hoey,\nSupt' of Welfare & Training,\nDept' of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs the end of the scholar year draws near, I think it is great time,-if I am not already too late,-to ask for some Proficiency Badges for the children who deserve them.\n\nSince it was my first year as Principal of a school, I confess that there was so much to do,-and to learn,-that I was unable to give all the attention required to take full advantage of the new Proficiency Badge System. Something has been achieved though and according to the Students Records there would be about 60 Badges to be distributed before the children go home for their holidays. Most of those badges are for the girls: knitting, sewing, cooking, housekeeping; a few for the boys in woodwork.\n\nAmong the papers supplied for the Instructor in woodwork a sheet entitled \"Class Monthly Report\" was recently brought to my attention. There is a note on the back of it that had completely escaped me; it says: \"This Report is to be sent to the Department of Mines and Resources Training Division, at the end of each teaching month\". If that is absolutely required, then I presume that we are out of luck to get any badges in woodwork this year; but if it is not mentioned on the \"General Directions to use Proficiency Badges\", I am wondering if they are, those monthly reports, strictly required. Please let me know, as well as if any similar reports should have been filled for the Department in the other branches of manual Training.\n\nIf the badges are to be awarded, shall I need in each case to send a badge requisition card, of which I have but one sample? In that case I would ask you to have sent to me about 60 of those cards. Or may be, since there are many at a time, a list of the children and the details of their proficiencies, would do? In either case, please let me know soon how to proceed, so that I may have the badges before the end of the year or before the middle of June at the latest,...and we have mail only once a week.\n\nA few more questions I would like to ask you about those badges:\n1/- Can a child be awarded in the same branch of training medals for two years of proficiency during the same scholar year?\n2/-In the training for dairying, some boys would be qualified for badges except that since we have no goats here we have been unable to answer the first questions for the first year of training in dairying. Shall those badges never be awarded unless we have goats? And who should provide us with goats then?\n\n3/-Are there any manuals made or being made for the better understanding and easier explication of all the operations for the various trainings, proceeding as per the basic operations charts provided?\n\nAssuring you that I shall always try to the best of my ability to co-operate in your plans for the better education of our Indian children,\n\nI am,\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nL. Poirier, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nIndian Residential School,\nCamperville, Man.\nle 15 mai, 1944.\n\nCher Monsieur,\n\nVeuillez, s.v.p., nous faire parvenir les formes \u00e0 remplir en faveur d'un enfant qui aurait fait toutes les op\u00e9rations demand\u00e9es pour obtenir un certificat ou \"Badge\".\n2 doz. first year badges forms.\n2 doz. second year badges forms.\n1 doz. third year badges forms.\nPour tous les sujets except\u00e9 Metalwork.\n\nNos enfants se sont montr\u00e9s int\u00e9ress\u00e9s et nous avons plusieurs qui ont r\u00e9ussi les op\u00e9rations des deux premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es au cours de l'ann\u00e9e scolaire.\n\nVotre tout d\u00e9vou\u00e9,\n\nC.

E. Javel, o.m.f.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, May 20, 1944.\n\nRev. L. Poirier, O.M.I. Principal, Guy Indian Residential School, Sturgeon Landing, Sask.\n\nEnclosed you will find sixty badge requisition cards which you requested in your letter of the 13th instant. I realize that the work that a new Principal encounters is very great indeed and that for some time many details may escape his observation. This however, should not disqualify the pupils from receiving Proficiency badges provided that they have mastered the Basic Operations required or would like to receive a Monthly Report of these Basic Operations which include Manual Training for girls as well as for boys because it creates more interest for the pupils as they know that there monthly record is sent to Ottawa. These reports are acknowledged by this office. It is impossible for me to send out these badges without knowing the names of the pupils, as they are addressed to each individual pupil, in care of the Principal. You will complete these cards and return them to this office at your earliest convenience and Proficiency Badges will be immediately issued to the pupils deserving them.\n\nA child may be awarded as many badges as he deserves provided he masters the basic operations required for those badges. In other words the training that we have in mind is to induce each child to become as skillful as possible in the operations that are so necessary in later life. I believe that this answers your first question.\n\n(Over)\nIn answer to the second question with reference to goats; goats or cows answer the purpose. If they can take care of a cow, this would fulfill the requirements. If you are interested in goats, get in touch with your Indian Agent, who will in turn notify our Welfare Branch who will give him directions on the best method of procuring goats.\n\nIn reply to your third question we are sending out reference books on the various subjects from year to year. You will receive some of these books in the near future.\n\nI am gratified at the interest that you are taking in this work. If there is anything else I can do, do not fail to write.\n\nA. J.

Since we were a little short of those cards, we have in some instances used the same card for two different years in the same matter for the same pupil; I hope that this will not stop the pupil concerned from having the two badges he or she deserves.\n\nWould you be good enough to send the badges by Air Mail because our poor mail service might be too late to bring them before the children are out. If the parcel could be in The Pas before the 9th of June, please have it addressed o/o Bishop's Palace, The Pas where I expect to go at that date.\n\nNext year I shall give more attention to this Proficiency Badge System and I am sure the children will get much profit out of it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL.

The regulations require that a requisition card for badges for each child be signed by the Principal and the Instructor. As it is near closing time for the school and in order not to disappoint these pupils I am sending these badges along with a number of cards which you will kindly fill in and return to this office at your earliest convenience.\n\n(Over)\nYou may put as many names as possible on the reverse of the card, provided that the different badges be kept separate.\n\nYou have noted undoubtedly, the regulations as regards the age of the pupil.

There seems to be a mistake with regard to the 4 badges sent. I spoke to you about gardening but believed that I asked for 2nd year poultry badges for Isaac Kruger, Louis Francis, Anthony Jacobs and Alec Toby. The badges received (4) are evidently gardening badges (4) or evidently gardening badges (4) or evidently gardening badges (4) or evidently gardening badges (4).\n\nAlthough dear \"engineer\", Mr. Townsend, has passed an examination he will soon be given papers. I am having a Brother learn what he can from another Brother (a former CPR engineer, I believe) & will likely have him take a correspondence course when he arrives.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S.

I am sending immediately the badges you require for these four pupils.

Before we issue badges we generally require special cards to be filled out and signed by the Principal and Instructor, but we are ready to overlook this at this time due to the fact that the time is very short if you desire to have these badges for the end of this term, they must of necessity be sent immediately. I am therefore sending the badges but I expect in return that you will exercise the greatest care in distributing these badges only to the pupils deserving them.\n\nSeveral of the children on your list are eleven years of age but I presume that they will be twelve on the next quarterly return so I am sending badges for them. I am making exception however, for Andrew Delorme, Florence Lerat, Doris Sparvier, Carolina Kinistino and Albina Sparvier. These pupils do not appear on the quarterly return.\n\nI feel sure that another year it will be possible to organize this sooner, so that everything may be done according to regulations.

The materials on the badges were not here at the beginning of the term, but in the hope that their use might give the boys greater encouragement, we tried to catch up with the tests, and some of the boys could perhaps be given the first year badge. They were quite interested in trying the tests, and if you see fit, the awarding of the badge for this year might be an added incentive for another year.\n\nI have enjoyed the work with the boys, and the teachers tell me that they were quite interested in the work. I regret that I will not be here next year, but hope that someone will be available to carry on the work. If you judge it worthwhile to award these badges, you can send them to Mr. Down, or to me, or to their respective teachers.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBadges sent June 17/44\nOttawa, June 17, 1944.\n\nRev.

War time conditions make it hard to have everything function just as we would like to have it but progress has been more favourable than we expected.\n\nCould you add a course in Farming to your list? We emphasize this training more than any other because, after graduation, all our boys will have a farm.\nIf we give badges for less essential things and leave this vital one out, a boy would leave school with his sense of values all wrong. As far as we are concerned, the farm is the essential and all other skills are only of value when they fit into the life of an Indian Farmer.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJohn W.

House, Principal, Old Sun's Indian Residential School, Gleichen, Alberta.\n\nYour letter of June 15th has been referred to me. I am pleased to note that fourteen boys have qualified for the badges in first year woodwork. I am sending these immediately. I was expecting to receive some requisitions for the girls in sewing and housekeeping as I remember when having the pleasure of visiting your school I noticed some splendid sewing done by the girls which should qualify them for the badges in sewing. However, I understand the circumstances under which you are working and I fully appreciate the difficulties you encounter.\n\nI am happy to read of the suggestion you have for a course in farming. I always had this in mind that woodwork and metalwork lead up to that; however, as the pupils leave school at sixteen years of age I find that it would be somewhat difficult to outline a course that would really be suitable for pupils of that age. Of course, gardening, poultry and dairying lead up to farming but is only a phase of it. I would greatly appreciate if in your spare time, if you ever have any, you could sketch roughly basic operations which you believe children of that age would be able to master in farming. This would greatly help us in outlining a course such as you have in mind.\n\nPlease extend my kindest regards to Mrs. House.\n\nA.J.

On receipt of these completed forms I will be able to take this matter into consideration.\n\nA.J. Doucet.\nMemorandum\n\nMR. HOBY\n\nIt is interesting to note that since the introduction of the badge system two years ago one thousand four hundred and ninety-three badges have been issued to the students of Indian Residential and Day Schools. This number is broken up as follows:\n\n| FIRST YEAR | SECOND YEAR |\n|------------|-------------|\n| Cooking    | 209         | Cooking    | 48          |\n| Woodwork   | 148         | Woodwork   | 38          |\n| Housekeeping | 276     | Housekeeping | 49        |\n| Knitting   | 215         | Knitting   | 33          |\n| Gardening  | 69          | Gardening  | 16          |\n| Poultry    | 15          | Poultry    | 11          |\n| Sewing     | 246         | Metalwork  | 78          |\n| Dairying   | 30          | Dairying   | -           |\n| Leatherwork | 8         | Leatherwork | -          |\n\nTherefore, one thousand two hundred and twenty pupils have satisfactorily learned the average twenty-four basic units for the ten subjects of the first year and two hundred and seventy-three of the second year.\n\nA.J. Doucet.\n\nOttawa, July 25, 1944.\nSt. Joseph's Residential School,\nSpanish, Ont.\n\nRemarks regarding Proficiency Badges.\n\nThe basic operations outlined for the sewing, knitting, and cooking, for the first and second year badges have been found very practical. The children in the knitting classes have done a lot of work for the Red Cross, as well as for their own use. The used clothing supplied by the Department have been renovated by the children who made them into jumpers, skirts, blouses, etc., for themselves. We feel that this is experience of very practical value.\n\nThe work in dairying has presented a little difficulty. As we do not have goats at the Girls' School, it has not been possible to do all the work of the first year. The pupils have, however, done very satisfactory work in the remaining operations, so we think it best to give the badges for the first year this time. In the meantime we await instructions from the Department regarding such circumstances in the future.\n\nIt was hoped at the time of requisitioning the badges that thirty of the pupils would have completed the work of the first year in housekeeping. As there are a few operations which some pupils have not completed, it has been decided to withhold seventeen of the badges, and to give them only to the pupils who have completed the work.\n\nWe are introducing gradually a correlation of the class and manual work. The senior pupils are working on booklets in which they keep a record of the projects done in connection with this correlation.\n\nJune 26, 1944.\nAttention: Mr. Doucet\n\nBadges already received.\n\nHandyman. (signature)\n\nPoor copy\nOttawa, July 27, 1944.\n\nRev. C.A. Primsu, S.J., Principal, Spanish Indian Residential School, Spanish, Ontario.\n\nYour remarks regarding Proficiency Badges sent in last June have come to my attention.\n\nI noticed that the dairying has presented some difficulty caused by some operations which mention the care of goats. At schools where no goats are kept, the numbers dealing with goats should be discarded which will leave eighteen basic operations for the first year instead of twenty-two. In number six the word \"cow\" may be used instead of \"goat\". In number five \"calf\" may be substituted for \"kid\". The general purpose of these basic units is to prepare these children to face life as they meet it. Therefore, where local conditions demand substitutions this may be done by the Principal. The Department would appreciate being informed of these changes. This may be readily done when the pupils complete the monthly reports.\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nTraining Division.\nSame letter sent to:\n\nSandy Bay,\nSturgeon Lake\nCowessess,\nBeauval,\nErmineskins\nYouville\n\nOttawa, July 27, 1944.\n\nRev. L.C. Latour, O.M.I., Principal, Blue Quills\nIndian Residential School, St. Paul, Alberta.\n\nI have received requisition cards for graduation brooches. Special cards are provided for these requisitions. The cards for the badges should not be used. I am enclosing a number of these special requisition cards. You will notice that the first condition to attain these brooches is \"The student is to be honorably discharged at the end of the term\". This would imply that the child has attained the age of sixteen. At times, no doubt, children are discharged earlier and when this discharge is for honorable reasons the brooch may be awarded at the time of the discharge provided, however, that the second condition has been fulfilled.\n\nWe have requisitions for the following:\n\nEmilia Bisson, Mary M. Cardinal, Mary M. Collins.\n\nWe have had no notice that these children were being discharged. We would like to have more information about these pupils before issuing any brooches.\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nTraining Division,\n\nEnc!\nAug 31/24\n\nMr. A.J. Bennett  \nTraining Division  \nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSorry to have not well understood when these licences were to be issued to pupils. The names mentioned in yours are not to be discharged yet. Therefore I'll make requisition later when they shall be discharged.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nFather J. Lemire  \nPrincipal\nBlue Quills Ind. Res. School,\nSt. Paul, Alta.,\nAugust 3, 1944.\n\nMr. A. J. Doucet,\nTraining Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAnswering your letter of July 27, I beg to state that the requisition cards you refer to, were sent with the April Manual Training Monthly Report, but for the third year Sewing only. In a letter dated May 11, you have given me all informations concerning the issuing of the brooches.\n\nThe four graduating girls of this year have practically completed the different courses and are entitled to a brooch, but as some of them have manifested the desire to come back to school this fall, if they obtain the consent of their parents, I have delayed to ask their discharge; this, I hope, explains why no special requisition card has been filled. My intention was to do so in September.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. L.C. Latour, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nTo principals and teachers of Indian schools:\n\nRe: Chart for Proficiency Badges\n\nYou are being forwarded two charts illustrating the proficiency badges about which you were advised in circular letter of January 29, 1943. These charts should be framed and one posted in the boys' side of the building and the other in the girls'.\n\nYou will note that these charts indicate the basic operations which pupils must know in order to qualify for a badge.\n\nWhen a pupil has efficiently covered the first group of basic units a green badge is awarded. When the second group is covered a red badge is awarded. Later you will be advised regarding the badge which will be awarded for covering the third group of basic units.\n\nIn the majority of cases it will require one year for a pupil to cover each of the groups of basic units. In some cases a pupil may cover this group in less time than a year, while other pupils will require a longer period than a year.\n\nFor reasons that will readily suggest themselves to you, it has been decided not to award any badge to a pupil under twelve years of age. It is true that some of the operations recognized for badges will have been learned before that age is reached, but these operations will not be recognized for badge purposes until the age mentioned.\n\nWhen a pupil has qualified for a badge a special form is signed by the instructor and the principal and forwarded to this office. The badge will then be sent to the pupil. This badge should be awarded publicly as soon as possible after its reception, either by the Student Council or any similar school organization.\n\nTeachers should keep in mind that the success of any enterprise depends on the enthusiasm shown by the teachers themselves. The Department, therefore, depends upon principals, teachers and instructors to use every possible effort to create interest and enthusiasm among the pupils in the badge system.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nTo principals and teachers of Indian schools:\n\nRe: Proficiency Badges\n\nAs illustrated by Mr. Doucet on various occasions, the proficiency badges will soon be ready and it is our intention to award badges for cooking, sewing, weaving, knitting, housekeeping, gardening, leather work, dairying and poultry raising.\n\nBefore making these badges available the Indian Affairs Branch desires the teachers of the various manual skills to make a list of the basic operations which, in their opinion, the pupil should cover for each year of a three-year course in order to entitle the pupil to receive a badge.\n\nThese basic operations should be progressive from the easiest to the more difficult. It must be kept in mind that the operations listed must be basic; namely, operations that are absolutely necessary in carrying out the simple duties of a housewife, of a cook etc. There should be about twenty basic operations for each year.\n\nPrincipals should notify the teachers concerned and forward their lists as soon as possible to the Training Division, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nR.A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nGENERAL DIRECTIONS TO USE PROFICIENCY BADGES:\n\n1. These badges are awarded in two colours -- Green for the first year and Red for the second. A special badge will be provided at the end of the third year.\n\n2. Proficiency Badges, on the facsimile, are numbered. These numbers correspond to the numbers on the \"Basic Operations Required to Obtain Proficiency Badges\" and the same number is inserted by the teacher on \"Student Record of Mastered Basic Operations\". These charts are of corresponding colours as follows:\n\n| Badge | Subjects       | Basic Operation Chart | Student Record |\n|-------|---------------|-----------------------|---------------|\n| #1    | Cooking       | Blue                  | Blue          |\n| #2    | Woodwork      | White                 | White         |\n| #3    | Housekeeping  | White                 | White         |\n| #4    | Knitting      | Rose                  | Rose          |\n| #5    | Gardening     | Green                 | Green         |\n| #6    | Poultry       | Yellow                | Yellow        |\n| #7    | Sewing        | Rose                  | Rose          |\n| #8    | Dairying      | Yellow                | Yellow        |\n| #9    | Metalwork     | Russet                | Russet        |\n| #10   | Weaving       | Rose (to follow)      | Rose          |\n| #11   | Leatherwork   | Goldenrod             | Goldenrod     |\n\n3. The badges are awarded by the \"Indian Affairs Branch\". A special requisition must be made on a card form provided by the Department.\n\n4. A pupil may be awarded any number of badges provided he has mastered the basic operations required for each badge and provided he has attained the age of 12 years.\n\n5. Teachers should prepare a reading list and keep a record of each pupil's reading. This may advantageously be done by the pupils themselves. (See \"Reading Record Sheet\" for woodwork.) A definite discussion period on the reading should be provided.\n\nYOU HAVE RECEIVED:\n\n1. A facsimile of the eleven badges available;\n2. \"Basic Operations Required to Obtain Proficiency Badges\";\n3. \"Student Record of Mastered Basic Operations\";\n4. Card requisitions for badges;\n5. Instructions for the use of the Proficiency Badge System.\n\nPROCEDURE:\n\n1. Frame the facsimile of the badges and hang one in the boys' quarters and one in the girls' quarters.\n2. Post the \"Basic Operations Required to Obtain Proficiency Badges\" near the facsimile.\n3. Post the \"Student Record of Mastered Basic Operations\" in a place readily accessible to the students, preferably the classroom. Each pupil should rule a sheet for his own record. (See \"Student Record Sheet\" for woodwork.) At a definite period, once or twice a week, each pupil calls out his standing: Badge No., Basic Operation No. and standing A, B or C. The teacher posts these on the class student record. The teacher should take advantage of this period for a general discussion.\n\nThe eleven badges so far provided do not comprise all the training that may be given to Indian children. Badges may be added from time to time. Commentaries and suggestions from the principals and teachers will be appreciated.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nTo principals of Indian residential schools:\n\nRe: Proficiency Badges\n\nAt the opening of the new academic year I wish to again direct your attention to circular letters of January 29, February 24 and May 8, 1943, with reference to the awarding of badges to deserving pupils. The Department would appreciate having a wider use made of these badges.\n\nSince the badge system was instituted 1933 badges have been issued to students of Indian residential and day schools and a review of the names of those to whom badges have been awarded indicates that the greater number have been given to girls. This means that the Department's programme for vocational training for girls has received more attention than the courses suggested for boys.\n\nIt is realized that at the present time there is considerable difficulty in securing qualified teachers for vocational work, but at the same time the Department feels that a more definite interest should be taken in the development of our programme for boys.\n\nI, therefore, suggest that at the opening of the coming academic year the principal should arrange a meeting of the teachers in his school and direct their attention to the circular letters mentioned above.\n\nAt this time I would like to refer to instructions previously given to the effect that badges should be awarded publicly as soon as possible after their receipt, either by the student council or any similar school organization.\n\nIf there is any further information that you require regarding either our vocational programme or the badge system, I would appreciate hearing from you.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOBY\n\nIt is interesting to note that since the introduction of the badge system two years ago, one thousand four hundred and ninety-three badges have been issued to the students of Indian Residential and Day Schools.

Doucet.\n\nOttawa, July 25, 1944.\nI have learned, with pleasure, from the Principal of the school that you are attending, that your work has been so satisfactory that you have qualified for a badge.\n\nWhile the badge is being sent direct to you, I should appreciate your delivering it to the Principal, in order that he may formally present it to you at a gathering of all the pupils.\n\nDuring the balance of your time in school the Department trusts that you will meet with further successes and that you will realize that the training being given to you is intended to assist you in providing for yourself when school days are over.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

I am glad to tell you that some of our boys are doing fine; Some of them have almost mastered the basic operations for the first year; there are still a few operations that they cannot learn because we do not have the tools indispensable for the learning of those operations; For example we have no Regular taper file, no back-saw and no level. We send an order to \"The J.H. Ashdown Hardware Co., Edmonton, but they answered back that they do not have any of those tools to sell at present. However, as we started the course in woodwork at the beginning of last year, I could recommend that a Proficiency Badge be granted pretty soon to some of our boys who have almost mastered the basic operations for the first year.

Of course, they worked for wages.\n\nThe children's refectory looks much brighter & cleaner since it has been repainted.

As you are likely aware, the Indians generally take their father's Christian name as their family name & the pupils are generally known by that name in school & at home. On the Quarterly Returns, I generally give the real family name. That will partly explain my giving them the wrong names as I simply copied the lists given me by the Teachers.\n\nCoy Nicholas is #265 Coy N. Eugene.\nMary Madeleine Johnson is #304 Mary M. Miller.\n#345, Evelyn Alice is sometimes called Eva Alice.\n\nAs for those under age:\n#282, Rudy Paul, was 11 in March (Report erroneous\u2014by his own account)\u2014He is now 12.\n#0293, Susan Kroger, is still 11 but will be 12 in January.\n#0310\u2014Alice Jack was 12 in October.\n\nAppears to have mentioned one ex-pupil.\nKilled in Action (Sicily). Another has been killed recently, - one who was considered his best young man (20 yrs old) on the Reserve. As most local Indians get their mail here, I noticed that four overseas officers wrote to the boys' fathers. No mail has been good over there too. Another pupil, twice wounded, expected to be back for Christmas with a useless leg.\n\nWe have just had the visit of another former pupil who is in the U.S. Army and who was in Burma & India.\n\nOur Doctor, who knows his business & therefore stays within his limits, reported that one girl required glasses and two others needed the attention of an optometrist. There is no oculist in Crookwood - the local optometrist found that his two had cataracts that she urgently needed an immediate operation. One all three to Lethbridge. There, a good oculist found no cataracts but T.B or Trachoma @ ears. He could do nothing for them two but give one glasses - as our M.D. has said, the 3rd girl needed glasses also.\n\nWith every best wish for the New Year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG. Farley Ouellet\nMr. J. O. Daceet,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Daceet:\n\nAs I did not have sufficient application cards for badges, I simply gave you the names of the pupils deserving badges. You sent me a few application forms but not nearly sufficient. I have used them & the cards I had but have none for the following (all appear gardening):\n\n#267 - Anthony Guello 13 (enclose card in top pocket)\n#270 - Isaac Kruger 13\n#271 - Ernest Stanley 12\n#278 - Gregory McCoy 13\n#279 - Louis Doucet 12\n#280 - Stanley Pierre 12\n#283 - Jacob White 12\n#284 - Francis Jacque 12\n#297 - Vincent Lorne 13\n\nSome badges were refused on account of the pupils being under age according to the Sept. Quarterly Report. In a recent letter, I pointed out what pupils had had their 12th birthday since Sept. 30th. I am en-\nClosing application cards for Susan Kruger (O293) as she will be 12 on January 3rd as mentioned.

However, I kept them up to the Sisters so they taught the girls as well as I.\n\nWith New Year's Greetings,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. Copy\nOttawa, January 3, 1945.\n\nReverend G. Forbes, OLM.I., Principal, Kootenay Indian Residential School, Cranbrook, British Columbia.\n\nI notice that your letter dated December 30th, was written on the same day that we sent the badges.\n\nThe only difference between the first and the second year badges is the colour. The first year is green and the second year is red.\n\nAs regards the third year badges, we give a graduation brooch to the child who has completed the requirements. I believe you have a circular outlining the requirements for these brooches. I am however, enclosing an extra copy.\n\nI am inclosing the second year (red) badges in poultry for the four pupils for which it appears we sent green badges. You may keep the green badges and award them to pupils who qualify for them. Will you kindly send us the names of the pupils who have qualified for these badges in order that our records may be complete.\n\nEnclosed please find three dozen requisition cards for badges and one dozen requisition cards for brooches.\n\nA.J.

L.C. Latour, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\n\nBrooches sent\nFeb. 145\nexcept Brooch\nto be sent in May\nJanuary the 13th, 1945.\n\nMr. A.J. Doucet,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nJust a few days ago I sent you our first monthly report on manual training. It includes in fact four months; but from now on we shall try to be more punctual about those monthly reports.\n\nI should have included with it the corrections we had begged to make to some items asked for the third year of knitting. In yours of November 13, you had approved of us submitting other questions or tests more practical here. So here are the first eight numbers for the third year training for knitting, as we would like to have them:\n\n1. To choose rags for braided door mat.\n2. To dye the rags.\n3. To braid the rags.\n4. To sew the braided rags.\n5. To knit a toque.\n6. To crochet a tan.\n7. To knit a scarf.\n8. To use a garter stitch.\n\nSo with your permission, if there is no objection found, our third year course of knitting will consist of the above items for the first eight numbers instead of the ones proposed in the official course as first published.\n\nFor all the branches of practical training we trust that whatever publications the Department may provide us with in order to facilitate our work, it will make available to us without our having to enquire often if anything new has been published on the matter. What you have sent already is so interesting, as regards woodwork and metalwork, that we look eagerly forward to something similar in all the other branches of manual training.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nL. Foirier, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, January 19, 1945.\n\nRev. L. Poirier, O.M.I. Principal, Guy Indian Residential School, Sturgeon Landing, Saskatchewan.\n\nI have received your letter of the 13th instant, in which you suggest changes for the eight first numbers of the third year in knitting.\n\nAs mentioned before, this outline is meant to be very flexible so that it may be adapted in any locality. The changes which you suggest namely:\n\n1. To choose rags for braided door mat.\n2. To dye the rags\n3. To braid the rags\n4. To sew the braided rags\n5. To knit a toque\n6. To crochet a tam\n7. To knit a scarf\n8. To use a garter stitch.\n\nare approved with the exception of number six. This number six reads \"To keep cost accounts\". This, I believe is very important as the correlative between arithmetic and manual training. I wish, therefore, that you would retain this number six possibly, in place of either number six, seven or eight which you suggest.\n\nI have taken note of the contents of the last paragraph of your letter and will keep you on the mailing list for any new outlines which may be ready from time to time.\n\nA.J. Doucet.\nDear Mr. Bennett,\n\nThank you for your letter of Nov. 3rd. I noticed the difference in the colour of the badges but the IA on them led me to believe that, by one or both of these letters, you were designated.\n\nI may be wrong on another point & would appreciate information. All pupils are taking more than one subject & I have applied for badges in each of the subjects, - e.g., Louise Qualtier and Edna Guild qualified for (490) badges in cooking, housekeeping & sewing - so you send me two application forms for badges, I wonder whether I should not apply for badges only in the main subject or two compulsory subjects. If badges are given for several subjects, I shall need application forms because perhaps 20 girls will be expected, will pass the examination & will get in garden work and that will cut into my stock of forms.\nA couple of Indian parents, to whom I explained\nafter dinner the basis she learned about poultry,\nseemed greatly to appreciate the fact that I was\nteaching poultry raising. I showed our pictures of\npoultry raising, and they said that he had\nheard that looked like the picture but that he\nhad heard that looked like \"only lies.\" My poor pupils spotted\nhim with roses & killed & burned his affected\nbirds. In order to teach him better, I am taking\nan extension course from the B.C. University. So far,\nmy papers have rated & my essay on poultry\ndiseases seems to have impressed the instructor.\nOne or two \"White\" visitors thought the idea of\nteaching poultry raising good.\n\nI am enclosing cards with the names of\nthe boys who qualified in poultry raising, as\nyou request, although I sent in the names he-\nfore.\n\nYours truly,\n\nP. Parker.\nOttawa, January 22, 1945.\n\nRev. G. Forbes, O.M.I., Principal, Kootenay Indian Residential School, Cranbrook, B.C.\n\nIn answer to your letter of January 13th, I wish to say that the I.A. on the Proficiency Badges stands for Indian Affairs.\n\nA child is entitled to as many badges as he has qualified for.\n\nForms are available according to the requirements of the school. Enclosed you will find three dozen requisition cards for badges. Should you require any more forms please let us know and we will be pleased to send more.\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nTraining Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nPlease refer to my letter of Sept. 29th, 1944, in regard to third year cooking badges for eight girl students at Youville Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Principal of the school has written me again in this connection, advising that the badges have not been received. The girls' names are as follows:\n\nMadeline Ward,\nLillian Aginas,\nMarceline Rain,\nMary Rain,\nMary House,\nEva Alexis,\nEvelyn Papin,\nMarceline Simon.\n\nWill you please advise if these badges will be furnished.\n\nJAN 23 1945\n\nP.T.

Special requirements are needed to qualify for this brooch.\n\nAs soon as we receive these cards, properly filled out, we will be able to consider the awarding of these brooches to the girls who have qualified.\n\nA.J.

It will be sent along with others who should graduate this year in May. My aim is to have these brooches reach the various schools in the month of May, so that they may be awarded to the pupils when they leave for home in June.

Doucet,\nTraining Division,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reference to the third year proficiency badges, may I ask if they are all cancelled by the new graduation brooches?\n\nOn the \"Circular re Special Badges\" I read: \"The Student must have satisfactorily completed the First, Second and Third year course in four subjects....\" But as the pupil completes one or several of the third year courses, wouldn't it be possible to let him or her receive the third year badge, and then, when the pupil has perfected or is to perfect the fourth course required, be awarded the Special Badge coming with the graduation?\n\nEspecially in the case where a pupil has finished a few of the third year courses, or even four, but is not to be discharged yet, he would be encouraged in his work by those third year badges and would be eager to come back to receive the Silver Brooch at the time he is discharged. Having a few pupils in this case this year, I am confident that you may do something to keep their enthusiasm, as your proficiency system so well does in other cases. One girl here for instance has completed last year the first and second year course in four matters; this year she has completed the third year courses in the same matters, but I can not apply for the Silver Brooch for her since she has one more year to go to school: would it not be possible in such a case to award third year ordinary badges? and next year she would receive the Silver Brooch?\n\nI enclose also many other requisitions for badges, and one Class monthly report.\n\nHoping to read you soon, since the classes are rapidly coming to an end.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. L. Poirier, O.M.I. Principal.\nOttawa, May 28th, 1945.\n\nDear Father Poirier:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant with reference to proficiency badges.\n\nIn this connection, I desire to refer you to Mr. Doucet's letter of April 7th.\n\nIn order that you may be perfectly clear on the whole matter I may say that badges are awarded at the end of the first and the second year of the course provided the Indian pupil has successfully completed the required subjects and each pupil is at least twelve years of age before receiving the first badge.\n\nWe have not thought it advisable to issue a third year badge. After the second year badge has been issued we only issue a silver brooch which is only given to the pupil when he is being discharged.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. L. Poirier, O.M.I.,\nSturgeon Landing, Sask.\nOttawa, May 28th, 1945.\n\nDear Father Hayes:\n\nEnclosed you will find the proficiency badges for woodwork and gardening.\n\nWith reference to the second year badges, our records do not show that any of these pupils for whom the second year badges are requested have been awarded first year badges. As you know the regulations require that second year badges can only be given to pupils having successfully completed the course and having obtained the first year badge. It is possible that we have overlooked recording them in our records. If they have already secured the first year badges please let me know when they received them.\n\nWe are returning the third year requisition cards. We only issue badges on the completion of the first and second years of the prescribed course. We do not issue a badge on the completion of the third year.\n\nWhen a pupil is being discharged and has satisfactorily completed the course and has previously obtained both the first and the second year badges we award a silver brooch. Kindly fill in the enclosed cards and forward to this office, after which we will be able to give your request our immediate attention.\nRegarding Tommy Laboucane, you do not mention the exact basic operations that this boy has completed. I regret that we have no special badge for \"all round good work\".\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. F.J. Habay, O.M.I.,\nGrouard, Alberta.\nIndian Residential School,\nBeauval Sask., May 11 1945.\n\nMr. Alp.

I guess there is no university which compels a student to excel in 2 subjects to obtain a diploma for one subject only.\n\nI hope that you will understand the discouragement of the pupils and that you will do something to make more easy the obtaining the brooch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Joseph Angin,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 6th, 1945.\n\nRev. J. Angin, O.M.I., Principal, Thunderchild Indian Residential School, Delmas, Saskatchewan.\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo and I have taken careful notice of the remarks therein.\n\nTo obtain the housekeeper's brooch, the pupil is required to have covered the three years in housekeeping and the three years in cooking. You will notice, if you go over the basic operations in housekeeping for the three years that there are few operations that a girl from twelve to sixteen years of age does not actually have to do while working around the school. There should then be no difficulty in qualifying for this brooch, if the proper integration between the classroom subjects and the manual training subjects exists.\n\nThe seamstress's brooch requires housekeeping also. The knitter's brooch also requires housekeeping. I wish to summarize this for your information. We will take the seamstress's brooch:\n\nA. Compulsory subjects:\n   1. Sewing\n   2. Housekeeping\n\nB. Optional subjects:\n   Any two of the following:\n   1. Knitting\n   2. Gardening\n   3. Poultry\n   4. Cooking\n   5. Dairying\nTo qualify for this brooch the pupil will excel in sewing, that is, she will satisfactorily cover the first, second and the third year basic operations in sewing. Moreover, this pupil selects sewing because she prefers it and wishes special credit for it. As mentioned above she will, I may say unwittingly, qualify for housekeeping. Therefore, the difficulties which are met are more apparent than real.\n\nI wish to draw to your attention, the fact that these brooches are not a diploma for one subject but as in the case of the seamstress's brooch, represents a course comprising four subjects. It may be described as an award for a special division of domestic science. In reality, it is a domestic science diploma representing extra skill in some special subject.\n\nShould there be any other questions in regard to this work, I will be pleased to answer them.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nGrouard Indian Red School,\nGrouard Alberta.\nJune 4, 1945.\n\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nThank you for sending proficiency badges for woodwork and gardening to seven boys in our School.\n\nRegarding 2nd year badges, we did not know that 1st year badges were required before getting the 2nd. We only had in mind that the girls mentioned had completed all that was required for first and second year, but since it can not be done we are again sending their names, asking for first year badges.\n\nAnnie Twin...Sewing---Knitting---Housekeeping---Cooking.\nRosie Shott...\nDoris Labouette...\nDorothy Macdonald...\nFrances Millier...\nLotie Lhirondele...\nLucy Nescotosis...\n\nAs to the group for the third year badges, again we didn't know that badges were not issued for that year, but as these girls have satisfactorily completed the \"three year course\" and expect to be discharged this year, we are asking for silver brooch awards for the following:\n\nNore Cardinal...Housekeeping---Gardening---Sewing---Weaving\nAline Maskinack...\nAnnie Colin...Cooking...\nTheresa McDonald...Gardening\nRose Anna Keysawasuw...Beading\n\nTommy Laboucane is on the list for \"silver brooch award\" for the following:\n\nGardening---Woodwork---Farming---Machinery.\n\nTrusting these informations will be more satisfactory,\n\nI remain, sincerely yours.\n\nRev.

Kindly check this and let me know at your earliest convenience as I am very desirous of trying to avoid duplication.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nTraining Division.\n\nRev. J.R.

Joseph Anglin\nPrincipal\nOttawa, December 13, 1945.\n\nRev. P. Piche, O.M.I., Principal, Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School, Lebret, Saskatchewan.\n\nI have received your applications for badges. They are going out in today's mail. One of the applicants, Irene Makusais, is demanding a badge for second year sewing but our records do not show that she has received any badges thus far. Hence, she has not officially qualified for the first year. This is not absolutely necessary but if she is entitled to the second year badge she must also be entitled to the first year because of necessity she would have covered the basic operations required for the first year. On the other hand this may be an oversight on our part here. Please check this matter and let me know in due time the standing of this pupil.\n\nThe coloured sheets are to be kept in the school for your records. I presume that you probably ran out of Monthly Reports. I am returning under separate cover the coloured sheets and I am also sending fifty Monthly Report forms and two extra sets of coloured sheets.\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nTraining Division.\nOttawa, December 17, 1945.\n\nRev. Sister Mary George, Principal, Caughnawaga R.C.\nIndian Day School, Caughnawaga, Quebec.\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 14th instant, enclosed please find two dozen Monthly Report sheets and six Student Record sheets.\n\nI am at a loss to understand why one hundred of these would be needed. It is required to send in one Monthly Report of work done by the pupils during that month. Two sheets are sufficient for this; one for the Caughnawaga schools and the other for the United Church. The United Church report of course, should be signed by the Principal of the United Church School. All that is necessary for the Student Record sheets would be a few of them each year. These sheets are kept posted in the work-shop.\n\nI have carefully noted the request for plans. I hope to be able to communicate with you about these at a later date.\n\nI wish to thank you and the Reverend Sisters for your kind words of appreciation for Agnes's recital; I will be pleased to let you know when she will broadcast again.\n\nA.J.

The Department is very anxious to have the Manual Training work continued. We realise that it has been very difficult to obtain the proper Instructor to carry out this work.\n\nYou are no doubt aware that a report should be sent even if no Manual Training has been taught.

E.J. Staley, Principal, Morley Indian Res. School, Morley, Alberta.\n\nEnclosed please find three dozen requisition cards for badges. From the reports I have and from the work that I have seen at Morley I feel sure that many children have qualified for badges. However, we have as yet received no requisition for them. This, I imagine, is due to a misunderstanding of the system. I am enclosing one of the circulars re badges. This circular and the cards are, I believe, self-explanatory. Please fill out the cards and sign them and return to this office after which badges will be issued.\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nTraining Division.\n\nEnclosure:\nOttawa, February 12, 1946.\n\nReverend J.

I am herewith sending the badges for those girls who have qualified.\n\nAs regards the third year or the Brooches, I believe, that there has been some misunderstanding. I am sending two copies of a circular concerning the conditions required for pupils who qualify for these brooches. I am also including two dozen cards which must be completed for the brooches. You will notice that these cards are different than the ones that you have signed for the badges. If the pupils have fulfilled the conditions as required in the enclosed circular, please fill out these special cards and send them to this office for further consideration.\n\nI am returning the coloured record sheets as they are the class record.\n\nA.J.

I am wondering if that was an omission on our part or whether you have not requisitioned for first year badges. Please let me know in order that our records may be complete.\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nTraining Division.\nFebruary 13, 1946.\n\nMr. A. J. Doucet,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing three sheets with records of work done during Mr. Smell's time that might be of interest to you. The teachers say that they had followed as well as possible the given instructions and could never understand why the Department never sent the Badges.\n\nWhat I am wondering is this is it possible at this late date to award any Badges? The children who have done the work can hardly be expected to do it a second time. If any Badges are due it will help to show the other children what can be done. I am just wondering what you think about it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J. Zimmerman, M.A., B.D.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, February 15, 1946.\n\nRev. W.J. Zimmerman, Principal, Mohawk Institute Residential School, Brantford, Ontario.\n\nIn reply to your communication of the 13th instant, I might say that any child who has covered the basic operations and proves to his teacher or instructor that he or she has done so is entitled to a badge. Our aim is to see that the children get fairly proficient in these basic operations. They may be learned at home or at school.\n\nI am sending special badge application cards which should be completed by the Instructor and returned to this office, after which badges will be issued.\n\nI am returning the coloured sheets. You will notice that some of the numbers have not been completed. Kindly have the pupils complete these numbers after which they will be eligible for a badge.\n\nA.J.

School, St. Philips, Saskatchewan.\n\nThis is in answer to your letter of the\n13th instant, re Manual Training Monthly Reports.\nThe numbers on the Student Record Sheet must correspond\nwith the number on the Basic Operation. In other words,\nthe Student Record Sheet is a record of the Basic Operations\ncovered by that student. Hence, a Monthly Report is a\ncopy of the Student Record Sheet. Consequently, these three\nnumbers must correspond. For example: if the Student has\nlearned the basic operation seven from the basic operations,\nthen, in the column seven of the Student Record Sheet is\ninscribed the grade (A, B, or C). Let us suppose the\ngrade A in this case. In copying for the Monthly Report,\nthe figure on the column (which in this case is seven) will\nbe written and next to it the grade (7A).\n\nThe knitting machine was forwarded as soon as\nreceived to the Company near Montreal, who have been\ninstructed to return it to you as soon as it is repaired.\nIf you should not receive it within a reasonable time,\nplease let me know and I will check this matter.\n\nAJ. Doucet,\nTraining Division.\nLeonard Indian School\nFebruary 25, 1946\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWould you kindly send a supply of Class Monthly Report Sheets and also sheets of the White, Pink, Blue and Green sheets for the records.\n\nThanking you in advance for your service.\n\nRev.

In order to do so effectively it is necessary to have a list of the books at present in the library of each school. When compiling your record of library books list them according to grade, giving the title, author, publishing company and also the number of copies. The above refers to library books and supplementary readers, but not to authorized text books.\n\nWe would appreciate receiving your list at your earliest convenience.\n\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\n502-1395\nOttawa, May 24, 1943.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 21st instant, in which you acknowledge receipt of the vocational courses sent forward to you a few days ago. The official in charge informs me that information regarding the weaving course will be prepared and sent out, together with the badge, in the course of a few weeks.\n\nMay I express the hope that you will find your visit to the residential schools interesting and helpful. I would like you to feel free to visit a number of the schools administered by the Catholic and United Churches. You will, no doubt, visit Ottawa at an early date, and it is unnecessary to state that we shall be glad to discuss a number of matters relating to the administration of your schools at the time of your visit.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. H. A.

A. Story Esq.,\nDept. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Story,\n\nIn reply to your letter of April 30th, I have made a survey of our libraries here and the books are really in a bad state of repair. Some I could not find the fly leaf for the publisher's name. I debated whether they were worth reporting\u2014butterfly say our library was not large for close sent us last year.\n\nHowever, my conscience dictated \"send in the list,\" here it is.\n\nPerchance you might be interested to know my Entrance pupil passed on his year's work.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nMary B.

I am still in doubt as to the type of book available, but have found that the children in this school are more interested in the \"read and do\" books than in straight story books. However any books which would increase their knowledge of English would be much appreciated.\n\nThanking you\n\nYours truly,\n\nMary Shelan,\nWest Bay Indian Bay School.\n\n[Signature]\n\nApril 20, 1943\nGrade III\nSing Canary Sing\nTales in the Wood\nThe Golden Key\nBrownie and His Friends\nPied Pipers of Hamelin\n\nGrade IV\nMagician Gift\nFifty Years Ago\n\nGrade V\nFighting Planes of the World\nAll the Philosophers and the Writers\nHeroes and Spots\n\nGrade VI\nWith Allenby in Palestine\nHis Unfinished Voyage\nRough Riders at the Campfire\nCecil Morton's Holidays\nThe Three Mischiefs\nGreat Stories for Boys\nAlice in Wonderland\nBooks on Hand\n\nGrade I\nBeginning Days - off the go.\nIn Came Pinky.\nTip.\nNow She go again - 2 copies.\nThree Little Kittens.\nThe Story of the Seal.\nThe Painted Calf.\nThe Surprise Box - 2 copies.\nThe Twins and Tom - 2 \"\nMac and Muff - 2 \"\nMother Goose.\n\nGrade II\nBruce and Barbara.\nElsa & Elephant.\nPolly and the Kid - 2 copies.\nThe Animal Parade - 2 \"\nMr. Jolly and the Pig - 2 \"\nGoing to School - 2 \"\nOttawa, April 12, 1943.\n\nMiss Mary Whelan,\nWest Bay Indian Day School,\nExcelsior Ont.,\n\nDear Miss Whelan:\n\nIn answer to your letter of the 8th instant I would like to know what kind of books you refer? Are they library books or text books?\n\nAs regards text books it must be kept well in mind that they are but tools in the teacher's hands. I prefer direct, energetic teaching from the black boards. The text book is then used as reference under the guidance of the teacher.\n\nIf you refer to library books I might say that the Department is endeavouring to build a simple library for the pupils. In order to do this effectively send the inventory of the books which you have. Be sure to classify them according to grade.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nR.R.I., Ohsweken, Ont.\nJune 4, 1943.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nWelfare and Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMy report was sent in to the Local Indian Office Brantford, along with a list of the library books, about two months ago. However, these I am mailing direct to you.\n\nRegarding library books, No. 10 SS is badly in need of same, and we shall be glad to receive any, particularly for junior grades. The children in this section are noticeably backward in English. Teachers should be made responsible in keeping the library books intact. The children have evidently been allowed to carry them home and have not returned them, and I have been unable to get trace of them.\n\nThis school has received books in the past along with the other schools, but they have disappeared.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nMrs. Wilma Jamieson\nLibrary Books (No. 10, Six Nations)\n\nOn hand:\n\n| Title                                      | Grade | Copies |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------|--------|\n| Pioneers in Ontario                        | VII   | 3      |\n| Anne of Green Gables                      | VIII  | 1      |\n| Pollyanna                                  | VII   | 1      |\n| What Katy did next                         | VIII  | 1      |\n| Short Stories of Great Lives              | VIII  | 2      |\n| David Copperfield                          | VIII  | 1      |\n| View of Wakefield                          | IX    | 1      |\n| How Canada was won                        | VIII  | 1      |\n| Pioneers in Canada                         | VII   | 1      |\n| Heart of Oak Reader                        | VII-VIII | 1     |\n| Piers Norman History                      | VI    | 1      |\n| Jack and Frances                          | VI    | 1      |\n| Alice in Wonderland                        | V     | 1      |\n| The Wonderland                             |       |        |\n\nThere are about 15 discarded books from St. Catharines Public Library\u2014all badly worn.\n\nMrs. Wilma Jamieson\nTeacher\nJune 7, 1943\n\nDept. of Mines & Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch\nParl. Bldg., Ottawa\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nIn reply to your letter asking for a list of library books, as teacher of Sherrard Bay Indian Day School on Sangren Reserve, I take this opportunity of sending you a list of most of the books. I made a list of the books of any value to the school with the exception of a number of easy little books for beginners etc.\n\nIn sending books for our library I would like books of Science, Social Studies, Health for grades up to 7, also a book of interesting short stories.\n\nThanking you, I am,\n\nYours truly,\nGladys Elder.\nBlack Beauty by Anna Sewell\n(Hand, W.

Although these books are old, the children are enjoying reading them and we would appreciate receiving a few new ones.\n\nA suggestion:\n\nChief Inspector Dr. V.K. Greer, in a recent circular recommended that \"The Canadian Geographical Journal\" should be in every school library. Address: Canadian Geographical Society, 49 Metcalfe St., Ottawa, Ont.\n\n\"Canadian Nature and The School\" are also highly recommended by Inspector Scott.\n\nWe are already receiving \"Canadian Nature and World Affairs\" and wish to return thanks.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJanet McCaig (teacher).\nShawanaga Indian Day School\nLibrary Books\nGrade I.

They prefer fiction books, e.g., \"Jack's Day\" by Dorothy King. She exceptionally good! Large print simple stories. The children can read but the story has to be very simple for them to get any meaning from them. Personally I think no books greater than grade 7 should be sent to the schools in this agency. A few nursery rhyme books with pictures (and a number of National Geographics Second Hand) are very advisable.\n\nMy grades run from One to Grade 4. I had some girls in Grade 4 two years ago who read books of Grade 3 & 4 and liked that type; the age of these girls was approx.\n\nI hope that you will not think me too forward in passing out this advice.\n\nIf we could make the adults speak English all the time we would show more advancement but try to do it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.S.

Would it be possible to have also an English dictionary? I will be delighted to have a library in my class.\n\nI thank you for the kind attention to our school.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nJr. Teacher of Jesus.\nTitle: No Author.

All we have on hand are the authorised text books.\n\nThe organization of school libraries is a praiseworthy undertaking!

You will note that the books for Beginners and junior grades very few. Most of my pupils are in the lower grades so that we would appreciate more library books.\n\nThere was no list for library books so I was obliged to make it up. There are many books donated by church societies which are really for older people so I did not include many of them in my grade VII list.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD. K. Simbo.\n(teacher)\n| No. of copies | Title                                      | Author                  | Publishing Co. |\n|--------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------|\n| 1            | Can.

Crossland\nTeacher\nThe Secretary Indian Affairs Branch Ottawa Ontario\n\nRe: Day School Libraries.\n\nIn reply to your letter of April 30th last, re Indian Day School Libraries.\n\nThe only Indian Day School in this Agency is situated on the Nicola-Mameet No.1 at Shulus Village. This school has not been in operation since June 1942. No available teacher.\n\nOn receipt of your letter I examined this School, but could not find any library books.\n\nPresumably this school never has been supplied with Library books.\n\nG.C. Mortimer\nIndian Agent\n502-1295\n\nPemberton Indian Day School\nCreekside, B. C.\nMay 15th 1943\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare and Training\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\n\nRe: Day School Libraries.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is with pleasure that I noted the Department's desire regarding school libraries. I have found that illustrated books with written commentaries are very good. I have also used film slides with success.\n\nWhile I have a number of supplementary readers and booklets, these are too well worn to be listed and should be destroyed.\n\nMy pupils have had access to such magazines as Hygeia, Geographic, Red Cross Junior, and Canadian Nature, which you send.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJ.M.
