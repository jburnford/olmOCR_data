People passing by see everything. I have told them not to do that, but they wouldn't listen to me.\n\nThey love a slop pail and could easily empty it in the closet, not to throw it around the house.\n\nIt's an awful dirty sight around the house and now it's commencing to melt now. Oh it's terrible.\n\nThe hallway they have made it their garbage pit throw everything on the floor.\n\nThey have been breaking the dishes, knives and broke the bed. Now I have been renting my room to the teachers for about five years and have never found any fault till now, and I'll tell you it's a mean.\n\nThe Customs Officer comes to\nSee the teacher he hitches his horse stallion to the house and \ncuts off the clapboards. I told him to watch and he got \nso mad that he told me I have \nrented my house and have \nnothing to say.

Sharrons, requests that two Yale locks be placed on the doors of her quarters, one on her bed-room door upstairs, and one on the room downstairs. The reason for this request is, that Miss Lagarde does not wish to have her rooms interfered with, or occupied during her absence from the residence. If I remember right, although I am unable to find anything on file in this matter, that in the year 1927 this same matter was brought up, but the owners of the house objected, assuming that they should be entitled to enter the two rooms in question, during the absence of the teacher to look over the stove, in case of fire.\n\nI am unable to visit Mrs. Sharrons, in the Chenail at present, on account of poor crossing.\n\nKindly advise me if you recommend the placing of these two locks, if so, authorize me in purchasing locks and placing them.\n\nI am your obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

However, you may take this matter up with them, and if they give their consent, you may arrange to have two Yale locks installed, forwarding an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.

Most of the furniture had been removed and partially replaced with some in a more dilapidated condition. The bedroom walls were left only partly papered and there is also a leak in the roof which was not repaired.\n\nI think that arrangements could be made to have her stay at the residence in the village and a man could be engaged to drive her to and from school. The same man who is now employed to row Miss Fitzpatrick across the river could also row Miss Lagarde. I understand that the cost would not be any more than the present arrangement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 19, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, in which you report that Miss Legarde, teacher of the Chetlain Indian Day School, is not satisfied with the room that has been rented for her for living quarters.\n\nThe Department does not consider that it would be advisable for Miss Legarde to live in the residence at St. Regis Village. This is a considerable distance from the Chetlain School, and even though she were driven to the school, it is doubtful if she could conveniently reach Chetlain School in time to begin duties at nine o'clock, especially during the winter months.\n\nPlease see Mrs. Sharron, and if you cannot make satisfactory arrangements with her for suitable living quarters for Miss Legarde, you should endeavour to obtain living accommodation for the teacher at some other residence near the Chetlain School. For the amount allowed by the Department, it is considered that it should be possible to obtain proper accommodation for the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

The paint on the metal ceilings is peeling, dirty and neglected looking. If at all possible they should be painted during the coming summer holidays.\n\nRegarding fuel for the various schools for next winter, I think it would be wise to instruct Dr. Baight to make no arrangements for wood or coke until officially instructed.

REGIS, P.Q.,\nMarch 16th, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise you that Mrs. Christie Sharrow's house, where Miss Lagarde teacher at the Chetlain Indian Day School lives, was destroyed by fire at 11.00 a.m., this date. Miss Lagarde's personal property was practically all lost, and the furniture supplied by the Department was also destroyed.\n\nMiss Lagarde has been advised to live at the Teachers' Residence in the Village. Arrangements have been made for transportation to and from the school until her new quarters are ready to be occupied.\n\nNo doubt new furniture will have to be supplied. Would it be in order to transfer the necessary furniture from the household effects of the nurses residence?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, March 14, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is noted from your letter of the 10th instant that the residence in which Miss Legarde was living was destroyed by fire.\n\nWhen Miss Legarde visited the Department a few weeks ago it was understood that she was aware of another house where she could obtain accommodation. If this is still available, arrangements should be made for her at once, as it cannot be very satisfactory for her to live in the teachers' residence in St. Regis Village, as this is a considerable distance from her school.\n\nIn the event of her being able to secure a room in the house near the school, you may arrange for the purchase of the fuel and supplies that are absolutely necessary. The Department will depend on you to keep the cost of these as low as possible and to only purchase what is required to make Miss Legarde absolutely comfortable. Please let me know when you have taken action in this matter.\n\nThe furniture to which you refer in the last paragraph of your letter should remain where it is, as it is possible that it may be required at a later date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nD. P. McNaughton, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, P.Q.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter re the changing of residence quarters for Miss Lagarde, teacher of the Chetlain Indian Day school.\n\nOn account of Mrs Sharron's residence being destroyed by fire, on the 10th inst., it will be necessary for the teacher to occupy her new rooms in the residence of Mrs Annie David, as soon as they are ready for occupancy, which I understand will be in a day or so.\n\nI wish to advise that I have secured one ton of coal for the use of Miss Lagarde in her new rooms as the balance of the coal she had on hand was destroyed with the house.

BAILEY\n\nThe new teacher's residence at the Chetlain School, St. Regis Indian Reserve, was not completed until about the middle of September. The Indian Agent was authorized to secure window blinds, a stove and the necessary pipes and elbows. I attach the account covering the cost of this equipment and it would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSt. Regis, Que.\nDecember 10th, 1942.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, OTTAWA.\n\nAt the time of Inspector Thibault's last visit to the Agency, the teacher of the Chatlain School, Miss Foisy, discussed with him and the undersigned the prospects of having the interior of the teacher's residence redecorated as nothing had been done in this regard since the building was constructed. Nothing at that time was settled in this connection.\n\nOn my recent visit to this school I note however that the teacher has made some remarkable changes to the interior of the residence, having papered, and painted where necessary. All labour was done by the teacher and with very good results.\n\nWhile it was quite apparent that redecorating would have to be done in the very near future it was not expected that the teacher would have the work done herself at this time. Regarding cost of labour there is no expense involved for papering and painting as the teacher did the work herself. She did, however, expend an amount of approximately $12.00 for materials and which amount is considerably less than we would have to spend for the same materials through our sources.\n\nIn view of the fact that it has been possible to have the residence put into such condition for so little cost I would recommend that authority be granted for purchases in the above amount also, if possible at this time, that authorization be granted for the purchase of a linoleum for the residence kitchen. I believe the teacher can obtain one of excellent quality for around $7.00 or $8.00. The present floor covering is in bad shape but enough can be salvaged to repair some bad spots in the bedroom and bath.\n\nD.F. McNaughton\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nDecember 14, 1942.\n\nMr. D.P. McNaughton, Indian Agent, St. Regis, Q.M.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant, regarding the Chetlain School, you may forward an account for $12.00 covering materials used in redecorating the teacher's residence. You may also expend an amount not exceeding $8.00 in the purchase of linoleum.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSt. Regis, Que.,\nJuly 20, 1944.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq., Superintendent of Welfare & Training.\n\nPrior to closing of the Chetlain School, the teacher advised me she had experienced difficulty with the drainage system in her residence for the past three years, and that the cellar drain installed a couple of years ago in the residence basement never took the water out of the cellar.\n\nIt is an expensive proposition to get a plumber to go to that district so I went down today with an Indian to see if we could clear up the trouble in the residence drainage from the sink and bathtub. I find this system constitutes a 1/4\" pipe from the sink and bath connection on a \"Y\" in the cellar and along the cellar floor through the foundation wall. On the outside stones are laid to a cesspool to carry off the water. I could not get the outside line opened today but from Indians that were around when the system was installed they told me the piping ends at the outside of the cement wall of the foundation.\n\nThere is not even one union in the cellar where the piping can be broken to clear the pipes but by removing the bathtub connections I was able to get a stout wire down the piping and as this was knotted at intervals on the end, I managed to clear the sludge from the pipes inside the building.\n\nThe stones will have to be removed outside, as they must be all fallen in and a suitable drain-off outside the building made. I am hopeful that a new cesspool need not be made, and unless unforeseen circumstances arise, this work can be finished with small cost.\n\nI will not attempt the cellar drainage system which was installed a couple of years ago and never worked unless you want the work undertaken. There will be a labour cost here of at least $100.00. This should be done, however, as it is impossible for the teacher to get any coal out of her cellar during March and April and part of May, due to the depth of water in the cellar. I might say that considerable rot is taking place here as well.\n\nT. L. Bonnah,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 25, 1944.\n\nMr. T. L. Bonnah, Indian Agent, St. Regis, Quebec.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th instant, the Department approves your action in making the necessary improvements to the drainage system in the residence at the Chetlain Indian Day School. It is noted that you do not expect the expenditure will be heavy.\n\nIn the last paragraph of your letter I understand that the cellar drainage system can also be improved at a cost of $100.00. There is no doubt that this work is necessary, not only for the maintenance of the building but for the welfare of the teacher. Authority is granted for you to do whatever you consider necessary to put this system in proper condition.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nNote Possibly The well being so close to Residence adds to rise of water in cellar during spring.\n\nWell, hand pump inside supplies water to residence. Also outside pump here.\n\nSlope of ground is to the North & River.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoey, Esq., Superintendent, Mines & Training.\n\nFurther to my letter of July 20 concerning the drainage system in the teacher's residence at the Chetlain Indian Day School. Under separate cover, voucher #168 in the amount of $4.90 is going forward which represents cost of labour so far on this job.\n\nI might say that in order to get the system working freely from the sink and bath in the residence, the drain was dug up to the cesspool. It was found, after digging the drain, that the 1\u00bc\" pipe ran through into the cesspool and not as previously advised. Rocks were removed in the cesspool to the level of the drain pipe and it was possible then to clear out all obstructions in the system. It was noted, however, that the cesspool is not working very good and there does not appear to be any sump whatever with the result that the water and sludge piles in the pool and backs up into the system. The attached sketch will show the approximate layout of this drainage system.\n\nI believe the only way that we will be able to get satisfaction would be to install another cellar drain running out on the north side of the building towards the gradual slope of the land. The drainage from the bath and sink could be connected up in the cellar onto the system or it might be possible to have the drain off from the cesspool connecting with a \"Y\" outside onto the cellar drain. This would keep the water level down in the cesspool eliminating any blocking of the 1\u00bc\" pipe drain.\n\nI would not consider it advisable or economical to re-open the cellar drain which was installed a couple of years ago as this drain runs uphill towards higher ground instead of running out the north side of the building and following the natural slope. It will cost us approximately $100. for labour to put in a new line coming out the north side of the building. If this were done, I would block up the other cellar drain and remove the trap and install it in a more suitable location in the cellar. This will, however, be an additional expenditure for glazed and field tile but I do not expect this will run much above $20. Until I hear from you I am leaving the present cesspool open and it would be appreciated if you could forward your reply without delay.\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. L.

Mr. McCaffrey, the Agent, wrote the Department on the 2nd inst., stating that he would forward an application, but up to the present none has been received. As it is only fair that the applicants should receive definite replies I would suggest that a selection be made from one of the three applications now on file.\n\nMiss McDermott was recommended by Dr. White last year for the position of teacher at St. Regis. He says she is in his opinion well qualified to take charge of an Indian school. She has had a good education and some experience in teaching.\n\nMiss Gilheoly sends in recommendations from the Principal of the Collegiate Institute, Rev. Father Whelan and Mr. Chas. Murphy, Barrister, of Ottawa.\n\nMiss Montagu forwards no references, but states that\nthat she is the holder of a diploma from the Board of Entrance, Collegiate Institute.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The severe cold and storms that we have had have caused the thermometer to register as low as fifteen degrees below zero, and then the snow has drifted so much that nearly all roads are blocked. It has been impossible for the children living any distance from the school to attend. The children who have been at school seem delighted with...\nthe idea and are more willing to work.\n\nI am sure that there will be a great improvement in the attitude and cooperation this month.\n\nI do not think that the meal will cost more than seven dollars a month, that is counting on an average attendance of eighteen children. I shall let you know when I have used the supply on hand how many meals I have supplied with the ten dollar order. I do not give them a full meal but a few biscuits and tea, and then either boiled rice, peas or beans.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Since the Department has been supplying material for sewing the attendance has increased considerably and the children take much more interest in their work. The mid-day meal has also been an inducement for them to come to school. I think that we should have swings, lats, balls and skipping ropes for the children. These poor children have very little happiness and sunshine in their homes and I think it would smarten them to have such things to play with, as well as making their school interesting to them.\n\nRose H. Gilhooly,\nTeacher.\nOttawa, March 12th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nMiss Gilhooly, teacher of the Congo Bridge school, in her Annual Report, states that swings, bats, balls and skipping ropes should be supplied for the pupils.\n\nThe Department is prepared to incur a small expenditure in the purchase of these articles when the spring season opens, and I have to ask you to be good enough to obtain an estimate of the cost of erecting a suitable swing, and you may purchase two bats, two balls and some rope suitable for skipping.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nW.

She has had charge of this school for about four and a half years and is now paid at the rate of $400.00. This school is not nearly so conveniently situated for a teacher as the Maniwaki School, which is only a short distance from the village, and the teacher of that school receives $450.00 per annum. The enrolment and average attendance are practically the same at each school and both teachers are said to be doing good work by the Public School Inspector.\n\nI think Miss White might fairly be placed on the same footing as Miss McCaffrey, the teacher of the Maniwaki School.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The progress made during the year is very satisfactory, the lack of interest taken by the parents is shown by the fact that there was only three adult Indians at the examination.\n\nThe public examination at the Orono Bridge School was postponed until the opening of the classes in September owing to the pupils being mostly ill with mumps, whooping cough.

As the district in which school is situated is rather isolated, also that the majority of the children live at a distance of two miles from school, the attendance could be improved by the teacher teaching in summer and taking her vacation in winter.\n\nDate of Report February 4th, 1916.\nOttawa, February 15, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nMiss White, teacher of the Congo Bridge Indian Day School, in her annual report to the Department, states that owing to the distance which the children live from the school, insufficient clothing and lack of interest on the part of the parents, the attendance is very irregular and would be improved if the annual holidays were taken during the winter and teach in the summer.\n\nIt is considered that owing to the above reasons this plan regarding holidays should receive a trial at this school. If you consider it advisable you may instruct the teacher to close the school until after the Easter holidays and she should resume duties again on April 8th, next. If this arrangement is carried out the teacher should teach during the month of July next to make up for the period the school is closed. You are to consult the teacher in this matter and inform the Department what arrangements are made for taking holidays at the present time and the date on which the school closes. You should inform the teacher that if holidays are taken at the present time she will be required to teach during the month of July next in order to complete the required number of days and to receive payment of her full yearly salary.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE.

Gauthier, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManiwaki, Que.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the CONGO BRIDGE School, March 31, 1925.\n\nIt seems to me that pupils are not properly classified. Apparently pupils are promoted every year without considering their degree of advancement. So in the third standard you find pupils that simply can read, spell and make easy problems. This is due largely to the fact that the programme is not quite definite for each standard.\n\nIf I am not mistaken by the register the Indian boys and girls are supposed to follow the programme for the public schools for the province in which the school is located. Therefore, the programme of studies for Quebec should be found in the schools situated on Maniwaki Reserve.\n\nRodolphe Maltais,\nInspector.\nOttawa, April 22nd, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Congo Bridge Indian Day School, states regarding the classroom work of the pupils as follows:\n\n\"It seems to me that pupils are not properly classified. Apparently pupils are promoted every year without considering their degree of advancement. So in the third standard you find pupils that simply can read, spell and make easy problems. This is due largely to the fact that the programme is not quite definite for each standard.\"\n\nPlease draw the Inspector's remarks to the attention of the teacher with a view to having her grade the pupils according to the degree of their advancement in their studies. The teacher should follow the programme of studies as provided for the rural white schools in the Province of Quebec.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE. S. Gauthier, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManiwaki, P.Q.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. INSPECTOR MALTAIS,\ndated February 28th, 1926, on his inspection of the Congo Bridge Indian Day School.\n\nOriginal on File 18-1-6.\n\nHelen J. White:- has always been little satisfactory though it has been impossible to appreciate the pupils work. Parents are scattered on the Reserve. Some pupils are consequently far from school. Attendance is generally poor.\n\nThere were only two pupils present on the occasion of my visit, yet they were very little advanced in their work. They could hardly read in an intelligible way.\n\nThe teacher could be more sympathetic but a change is hardly possible knowing that the White's family is the only boarding place for a teacher.\nIn his report, dated October 2nd, on the Congo Bridge Indian Day School, Inspector Maltais states as follows:\n\n\"Almost without exception, pupils of this school are very irregular in attending school. Such a condition has existed in the last few years. A reward of some kind to those who would attend school a minimum number of days of the year might prove a great incentive towards a better attendance.\"\n\nThe inspector also points out in his report that \"the results in this school have been limited to the acquisition of elementary knowledge of reading and arithmetic.\"\nOttawa, November 10th, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nIn a report on his inspection of the Congo Bridge Indian Day School on the 2nd ultimo, Mr. Inspector Maltais states as follows:\n\n\"Almost without exception, pupils of this school are very irregular in attending school. Such a condition has existed in the last few years. A reward of some kind to those who would attend school a minimum number of days of the year might prove a great incentive towards a better attendance.\"\n\nThe inspector further points out that the results achieved by the teacher at this school have been limited to the acquisition of an elementary knowledge of reading and arithmetic. The reports of the inspector on the attendance and work at this school have been unsatisfactory for some time. You should inform the teacher that, if there is not a decided improvement in the work, it will be necessary to make a change in teacher. I have to request that you will inquire into the attendance and endeavour to persuade Indians to send their children to school more regularly.\n\nI should be pleased to have a report from you regarding the attendance at this school and the work performed by the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. O. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. S. Gauthier, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManiwaki, P.Q.\nManiawski, December 7th, 1928.\n\nSirs:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 10th ultimo, No. 18-1-1, concerning the attendance at Congo Bridge school, I beg to inform you that I have had an interview with the teacher Miss White, and she concurs with the report of the Inspector Mr. Maltais, that the work of the pupils is far from satisfactory, but she says that she is doing all she can possibly to stimulate their ambition, but without any noticeable results.\n\nI have myself often tried to make them read louder or in a comprehensible manner, but always to no avail, they do not seem to pay attention to remarks made to them.\n\nConcerning the lack of attendance, in most cases the parents will not insist on their children going to school, and when you ask them why such a boy or girl is going to school, their ordinary answer is \"He knows the road to school, he can go if he wants to.\"\n\nThe troublesome dispositions of some of the Indians during the last few years also contribute to this lack of attendance, as some families are keeping their children from attending.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Subsequent information showed that the regular teacher was not prepared to resume duties, and, as the temporary teacher was not fully qualified, the question arose at the end of November regarding what provision should be made for teaching services at the Maniwaki and Congo Bridge Schools for the term beginning January 6th, next.\n\nAs Miss Freda White, the present teacher at the Congo Bridge School, had been in our employ for many years and reports showed that she was doing good work, the Department decided that it was only fair to promote her to the Maniwaki Indian Day School.\n\nTo succeed Miss White at the Congo Bridge School, several applications were considered, and we believed that Miss Rita Somers, who has a second class professional certificate and has had six years' experience, was the best qualified among the applicants, and she was, therefore, appointed by official letter of November 27th to take charge of the Congo Bridge School on January 6th.\n\nThe appointment of teachers of Indian day schools rests with the Department of Indian Affairs, and we have always endeavoured to secure the services of the best qualified teachers, without any consideration as to their place of residence at the time of appointment. The Department\n\nF. W. Perras, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nis endeavouring to supply for Indian schools teachers who are well qualified, and, when a teacher's services do not prove satisfactory, it has always been the practice of the Department to try someone else. I feel you will agree that this is the only manner in which schools can be properly operated. Recognition of this fact has, no doubt, influenced succeeding Ministries in leaving the appointment and dismissal of teachers of Indian day schools to the permanent officials, who endeavour to the best of their ability to supply qualified teaching service.\n\nAs I have pointed out in the first part of this letter, Miss Somers has already been appointed and she has accepted the position requiring her to open the school next week. Without specific directions from the Honourable the Superintendent General to the contrary, the Department does not feel that her appointment should be cancelled.\n\nI note that you now recommend Miss McSheffrey. I am directing the officers of the Schools Branch to keep her in mind whenever a vacancy occurs. I would appreciate Miss McSheffrey writing me stating her age, religion and qualifications.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n| CENTRAL REGISTRY | REFERRED TO | DATE REC'D | INITIALS | CENTRAL REGISTRY | REFERRED TO | DATE REC'D | INITIALS |\n|-----------------|-------------|------------|----------|-----------------|-------------|------------|----------|\n|                 |             |            |          |                 |             |            |          |\n\nIndian Affairs.

Previous to September 1, 1923, salaries to teachers in Indian day schools were paid on a quarterly basis, that is, your salary for the year was paid in four payments of equal amount at the end of each quarter. From September 1, 1923, the method of payment of salaries to teachers was changed to a monthly basis of ten teaching months in the year. For the quarter ended September 30, 1923, you, having taught the month of September only, were paid one month's salary. For the quarter ended December 31st, 1923, you were paid salary for the months of October, November and December, and again at the end of March and June you received three months' salary for each of these periods, thus completing your full salary for the school year - September 1, 1923, to June 30th, 1924. Each school year begins on the 1st of September and ends on June 30th, comprising a period of ten months. You will receive three months' salary at the end of each of the following periods, viz., December 31st, 1924, March 31st and June 30th, 1925.\n\nIf you will examine the method of payment since September 1st, 1923, you will find that you have been paid salary in full to the end of September, last. If any further explanation is required by you the same will be furnished upon your request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Helen J.

The locality where they wish to put up a new schoolhouse and where a number of Indians reside, (The Agent stating that there are 23 children who could attend the school) is over 7 miles from the school now in operation and over 4 miles from the village, and the children are thus cut off from receiving an education.\n\nThe accompanying sketch of the Maniwaki reserve contains a list of the Indians with the lots on which they are located. They are divided into three settlements; one on the Gatineau Road, one on the Gatineau River east of the village and the other on the Desert River near the Congo Bridge.\n\nSome of the children on the Gatineau river settlement attend the white school in the village, while others occasionally go to the Gatineau Road Indian school, while the Indians near the Congo Bridge, as before stated, have no opportunity of going to school.\n\nThe River Desert Band has about $28,000 to\ntheir credit and pays all expenses in connection with their present school. Their capital would stand the cost of another school building, which could be put up and equipped for about $700.00, but at their present rate of expenditure their interest would not, I think, stand the teacher's salary. If the Department decided to allow them to build a school it would have to provide the greater portion of the salary at least.\n\nA similar application was made some two years ago, when the question of salary proved the stumbling block.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The specifications call for the building of a schoolhouse laying out and enclosing the grounds and the erection of closets.\n\nMr Jos. Lavasseur offers to do the work for $3595.00\nMr W.L. Ecuyer will do it for ........... $1676.36\nMr Anastase Roy will do it for .......... $3150.00\nMr Napoleon Vaillancourt will do it for $2575.00\n\nAll these tenders exceed the amount originally contemplated to be expended for this purpose by nearly $1000.00, while the lowest tender is, according to Mr McCaffrey's estimate, nearly $1000.00 short of the amount figured out by him.\n\nIf the Department considers that the funds of the Band could stand Mr Ecuyer's offer of $1676.36 and he is prepared to furnish security for the due fulfilment of his contract, his offer is by far the best and should be accepted.\n\n1 Mr McCaffrey does not state whether he is a practical builder or competent to fill his engagement, while two of the other tenderers are carpenters and practical builders and Mr Roy is a merchant who\nhas put up a deposit of 10% of his tender as a guarantee of good faith.\n\nOf course a much cheaper building could be erected but I consider that where Indians have capital available and are willing to spend their money for permanent improvements, something better than the ordinary log schoolhouse should be provided.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The only way I can see to overcome the difficulty would be for the Department to assume the cost of the salary of the teacher of the school on the Main Road, which would relieve the interest money sufficiently to allow of the cost of the new schoolhouse being taken from their capital funds.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

General,-\n\nThe tender of Mr. W.L. Bouyer of $1,676.36\nfor the erection of the proposed new school-house near Con-\ngo Bridge, Maniwaki Indian Reserve, is a reasonable sum for\nthe work, and should leave a fair profit to the Contractor.\nThe remaining three tenders are absurdly high.\n\nChief Surveyor.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nFor the Deputy Supt. General of I.A.\n\nIn the matter of this new school for the Indians of Congo Bridge, Maniwaki, I think we should go back to the first principles as soon as possible.\n\nThe School house which we erected on this Reserve about 5 years ago cost us (completed and furnished) about $700.00. It is an ordinary frame school house, 18 x 24' and meets all the needs of the case. It is impossible to find funds for the school house to cost $1,676.36; and in any event it would be a profligate expenditure for that district. There is no reason why the Indian School there should be any better than the ordinary white schools throughout the Gatineau region, they are frame and log buildings. I therefore recommend that we use our ordinary plan and abandon the present scheme which is beyond our means or requirements.\n\nAccountant.\n\nOTTAWA, March 4th\u20141904.,\nDept. of I.A.\nOTTAWA, 5th March, 1904\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd ultimo, with further reference to the new schoolhouse to be built for the Maniwaki Indians at Congo Bridge; and in reply I beg to say that it has been decided not to accept any of the tenders forwarded by you as the funds of the Band would not stand the expense of even the lowest one. The cheque deposited by Mr. Anastase Roy, one of the tenderers, is returned herewith.\n\nIt is thought that a school building similar to the one erected on the Main Gatineau Road five years ago will meet the requirements of the Indians, and I beg to refer you to the official letter of 18th July 1899, with which plans and specifications were sent you, and beg to say that if you have the same now in your possession, you may call for tenders in accordance therewith. The cost of the school then put up was $535.00 and it is thought that a suitable building could be erected and equipped for about $700.00, which is the limit to which the Department will go.\n\nW.J.

Mr McCaffrey now reports that he has only received one tender, which is from Mr Anastase Roy for the sum of $695.00, which is $160.00 more than the other schoolhouse cost. However, the price of material and labor has advanced considerably since then and Mr Roy's appears to be the best offer we are likely to get, as he is a perfectly responsible man. If the school is to be built no time should be lost in commencing operations so that it will be ready for occupation after the summer holidays. The material will have to be teamed a considerable distance from the village and it would be better to have it on the ground before the roads break up.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

MacCaffrey\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nRiver Desert May 12th 09\n\nMr. Benson & Co.\nDept Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn regard to a fence for the garden, the Indians do not care to make any kind except a wire. They will supply the posts if the Department supplies the wire. Ordinary fence wire can be had here for three dollars and fifty cents per hundred pounds. I do not think it would take a hundred pounds to fence the garden. Some of the Indians were clear up around the school on Saturday, and they said that if the Department would supply the wire...\nThey would fence in about an acre around the school. Then they could plow and level off the ground and sow grass seed. I think if we had the wire for the fence, for the garden, you could set about the other things so when the Indians would not be so busy.\n\nMr. Benson, how about the dumb-bells and food stuff? Do you think the Department will supply them? The floods have started up here. I think they will be as bad as last year.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nRose H. Gilhooley\nRiver Desert\nQuebec.\nOttawa, May 17, 1909.\n\nMadam,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 13th inst., I beg to say that the Department will provide wire to fence the garden in connection with the Congo Bridge school, if the Indians supply the posts and perform the necessary labour.\n\nIf this work is done, the account should be sent in through the Agent in the usual way.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Rose Gilhooly,\nTeacher,\nManiwaki, Que.\nOttawa, May 17, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nThe teacher of the Congo Bridge school writes the Department that the Indians are willing to provide posts and perform the labour, if they are supplied with wire to fence the school garden.\n\nMiss Gilhooly has been advised that the Department will pay for the necessary wire and instructed to send in the account through you.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nW.J. McCaffrey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNanikaki, Que.\nMay 26th, 1907\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 17th instant:\n\nIn relation to garden for Congo Bridge School. This school is situated on a high arid point of the poorest quality of gravelly sand and is unfit for any kind of vegetable growth. I consider it would be useless to go to any expense with it for garden purposes.\n\nIn any case it would be well to not purchase the wire until the Indians should have the post ready.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nW.J.

You will be so good enough, therefore, to give the teacher any assistance you can in this instance.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nW.J.

Celui qui part \u00e0 24 pouces du plancher monte directement au-dessus du toit dans une fausse chemin\u00e9e construite \u00e0 cet effet. Celui qui part \u00e0 18 pouces du plafond rejoint l'autre \u00e0 un angle de 40 degr\u00e9s o\u00f9 il est bien soude. Le diam\u00e8tre de ces tuyaux est proportionn\u00e9 \u00e0 la grandeur de la classe.\n\nIl vaut mieux placer les lieux d'aisances en dehors du hangar lorsque celui-ci est adoss\u00e9 \u00e0 la maison d'\u00e9cole. Il est d\u00e9sirable, dans ce cas, de relier le hangar aux lieux d'aisances par un passage de 12 pieds de long, ferm\u00e9, \u00e9clair\u00e9 par deux petites fen\u00eatres, l'une vis-\u00e0-vis de l'autre et pouvant s'ouvrir \u00e0 volont\u00e9, et pourvu d'un ventilateur au plafond.

H. Fillan\nVentilation of School Buildings\n\nEach class-room ought to be provided with two permanent ventilators, which run generally in the walls. These pipes, in galvanized iron, should start, one at 24 inches from the floor, the other at 18 inches from the ceiling. The one starting at 24 inches from the floor rises directly above the roof in a false chimney built for that purpose. The one starting at 18 inches from the ceiling joins the other at an angle of 40 degrees, where it is well soldered. The diameter of these pipes is in proportion to the size of the class.\n\nIt is best to place the water-closets outside of the shed when the latter is attached to the school-house. It is desirable in such case to connect the shed with the water-closets by a passage 12 feet long, closed in, lighted by two small windows, opposite each other and able to be opened at will, and provided with a ventilator in the ceiling. The ventilators of the water-closets ought to start from under the seats and urinals and go out by the roof.\n\nA diameter of 3 inches would be sufficient in the present case.\n\nA.M. Filteau\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 238636-5 of the 27th of Oct. in which you asked me to make suggestions as to the ventilation of the Congo Bridge School.\n\nEnclosed please find a copy of instructions given our Public Schools by missioners re the ventilation of their schools.\n\nAt least two of the windows are supposed to open from the top. This being done the ventilation will be perfect.\n\nYours obedient servant\n\nA. M.

I thought advisable to give a coat of paint to all the old desks.\n\nThe black board were peeled in different places, and by giving two coats of paint they are now in good order.\n\n9 broken panes of glass were replaced.\n\nI also thought advisable to install some clothes hooks in the porch.\n\nThe stove the way we have it fixed now will add comfort to the pupils. I had to protect the walls with galvanized metal 5 inches away from the wood, also additional pipes had to be procured, as the stove is now further away from the chimney.\n\nTrusting the above mentioned repairs will meet the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 24, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, regarding the request of the teacher of the Congo Bridge Indian Day School, that stabling be provided for a horse, which she uses in travelling to and from her work as teacher at that point.\n\nIn reply I have to say the Department approves of your recommendation, that it would be better to build a woodshed, 12 ft. x 24 ft., at one end of which a stall, 6 ft. wide, could be provided for stabling the horse. You may arrange for the purchase of the quantity of lumber and other materials required and for the erection of a woodshed, as soon as possible. This building should contain a stall suitable for stabling the teacher's horse. The cost of this building, including material and labour, should not exceed the sum of $140. Purchase of the materials should be made from firms on the list to receive consideration and the work, as far as possible, should be done by Indian labour.\n\nI enclose encumbrance certificate, authorizing an expenditure to the above mentioned amount. You should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of all materials. These accounts, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. Further, please keep proper time sheets, in triplicate, for the labour employed. These should also be certified by you and forwarded for payment.\n\nPlease see that a satisfactory job is completed in the erection of this woodshed and that all costs are kept to the lowest possible point. In forwarding the vouchers for payment of materials and labour, you should state on each copy that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E. R. No. 1069.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

This means that the additional amount required at the Maniwaki school will have to be taken from appropriations set apart for repair work at other Indian schools where the need is almost as urgent as it is at Maniwaki.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

The water supply is taken from a clear running brook a short distance from the school and I recommend, as for the Hanwaki school, a covered water container with faucet or tap attached. This school is also in need of a good coat of paint on the outside, the inside walls having been repaired and decorated in 1937. The porch steps should also be repaired.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa,\nMarch 4, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReporting on his recent inspection of the Congo Bridge Residential School Inspector Thibeault recommends that a covered water container, with faucet or tap attached, is required.\n\nHe also recommended a similar container for the Naniwaki Day School. Please let me know at what cost you could secure these.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoby,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nE. S. Gauthier, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNaniwaki, Que.\nManiwaki, March 9th, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 4th instant, File No. 18-1-5, concerning water containers for the schools, I beg to advise you that the quotations are as follows:\n\nWater tanks with double walls, insulation space between, with tap, 3 galls. $5.50, 4 galls. $6.25.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nR.

MacInnes, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter dated July the 18th in regard to the Report made by the School Inspector Gagnon to painting the inside of the Congo Bridge Day School.\n\nI am positive that Mr. Gagnon made a mistake as it was the outside of that school that needs paint and not the inside. The inside was painted but a few years ago.\n\nTo my estimation the painting of that school would cost about $75.00 to $100.00 comprising labour and paint. This also would include the steeple which is hardly anything, the repairs to the steeple could also be made for the amount stated as I figure that around $2.00 to $3.00 would repair it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJuly 31, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 25th instant with reference to painting the Congo Bridge day school.\n\nDoes the estimate mentioned in the last paragraph of your letter include both material and labour? Can Indians be employed to do the work or will it be necessary to employ a white painter? On receipt of your reply the question of painting this school will receive further consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nJ. E. Gendron, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManiwaki, Que.\nManiwaki, August the 9th, 1939.\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Painting & repairs Congo Bridge School.\n\nI have your letter of July the 31st, asking if the estimation of $75.00 to $100.00 would be comprising the material and labour for painting the Congo Bridge Day School. I wish to inform you that I have inquired from different Indians about painting this School and find Mr. Noel Chalifoux, Band No. 234 willing to take the job of painting and furnishing the paint for the amount of $85.00. Naturally this work would consist of scraping the old paint with a fiber brush wherever it would need it and apply after two coats of paint.\n\nThere would be also two base boards holding the clapboards to renew as they are rotten and clapboard the steeple as recommended by inspector Gagnon. This in all cannot cost more than $7. or $8.\n\nTo be absolutely sure of everything I would say that $100.00 would cover everything that is labour, paint, material and repairs. It may cost a little less and if it does the money will be returned to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nAugust 15, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Painting and repairs, Congo Bridge School.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 9th instant in which you state that a tender has been received from Mr. Noel Chalifoux, an Indian, Band No. 234, for painting and repairs to the above-noted school for the amount of $85.00.\n\nIt is noted that certain minor repairs are needed in addition to the painting at an estimated cost of $7.00 or $8.00. You are authorized to proceed with this work at the earliest possible date. It is very desirable that the painting should be completed prior to the opening of the school on September 5.\n\nIn response to your request I am sending forward an accountable cheque for $100.00. The paint necessary must be purchased from a firm or firms on the approved list.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. E.

MacInnes, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am returning you herein return of labour ending September the 2nd, 1939.\n\nR.M. Gendron's account for furnishing material is duly receipted as asked. It is almost impossible to mark the exact time for this work as it was given by job to Mr. Noel Chalifoux and the exact labour of every day was not kept. I can say though that Mr. Noel Chalifoux' account for paint, oil, brush etc., at Anastase Roy amounted to $34.26. He had therefore an amount of $50.74 that was paid in wages to him and his Indian employees, which I think were mostly his boys. The amount for the job given to Mr. Chalifoux was a fixed price of $85.00 and for that he was supposed to furnish all the material and labour, except the lumber for repairing this school.\n\nIf you require the exact amount of hours and days of work that were spent on that work, we will have to put it in approximately. Before giving this job to Mr. Chalifoux I interviewed Mr. Ashenbault painter of Maniwaki, who had previously done this job for the Indian Department and his price was $75.00, but with the wood work Mr. Chalifoux had to do, I considered the price of $85.00 very satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian agent.\nManiwaki, September the 25th, 1939.\n\nT.R.L.

Shall I buy them here in Maniwaki and send voucher to the Department?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMay 16, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant you may purchase 6 bars of soap for use at the Maniwaki Indian Day School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

MacInnes, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI visited the Congo Bridge Day School today with Miss Rosetta Laflour and also tried to find a boarding house.\n\nThe only decent place where a school teacher can board there is at Mrs. Joe Chalifoux and they have answered us that they would prefer not taking the school teacher to board this year. If the teacher cannot board there, I do not see another place where she could board and Miss Laflour was inquiring if the Department would not build a small place next to the school house where she could live and cook her own meals.\n\nTo my estimation a small place like that would cost around $600, and I do not know if the Department would be in a position to build one or not. Naturally there is no doubt that it is very much needed and would be a great advantage to the teachers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 25, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letters of the 20th instant in connection with the Congo Bridge Indian Day School.\n\nUnless Miss Lafleur is able to obtain boarding accommodation the school will have to remain closed as the Department has no funds available for the erection of a teacher's residence.\n\nIn the event of her securing boarding accommodation and opening the school it should be distinctly understood that her employment is only temporary as we will expect her to forward satisfactory proofs that she is a British Subject. If unable to do this she should take immediate steps to become naturalized.\n\nYou should advise me later whether or not Miss Lafleur opens the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J. E. Gendron,\nIndian Agent,\nManiwaki, Que.\nManiwaki, October the 17th, 1940.\n\nT.R.I. MacInnes, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Lots 34 or 35 Range 7 Maniwaki Reserve.\n\nThe Congo Bridge Day School is built on one of the two above mentioned lots.\n\nTo-day while visiting this School I noticed that Mr. Jos Chalifoux' boys had chopped the nice birch trees that are around the School and even felled them right in the School yard.\n\nWhen this School was built was there a piece of land bought for its location, if so Mr. Chalifoux must be immediately stopped from chopping down those trees as it is spoiling the sight of that School completely and even making dangerous for fire as those branches will be left there to rot and make it very easy to set fires when they are dried off. Kindly look into the matter right away and let me know what can be done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nOctober 22, 1946.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant with reference to Joseph Chalifoux's boys cutting the trees in the school yard at the Congo Bridge School.\n\nYou should seize the trees that have been cut and advise the Department what further action you consider should be taken in regard to Chalifoux's action.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

There might be a few other little repairs to do also at Hammond's Indian Day School which would amount to little anything and while I have the carpenter would like to have it done also. I am sure it will not take more than 8 to 10 hours for both schools as at the Maniwaki Indian Day School it is mostly adjusting doors and getting screws wherever they are needed. I would also like to get authorized to buy a lock for the Maniwaki Indian Day School for the back door. This lock was broken by the children last year and it would cost approximately $75.00.\n\nE.

Gendron,\nIndian Agent.\nManiwaki, June the 6th, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nHerein please find copy of resolution No. 1, which speaks for itself.\n\nThis resolution was adopted at the meeting owing to the fact that some children living on Ritchie lake road and Congway road live too far away to walk to school, therefore the Band is asking that the Department provides those children with means of taking them to the Congo Bridge School, any way which you may judge suitable for this purpose.\n\nShould you be in favour of the project you could let me know and I will inquire if anyone could be found that would be willing to drive the children from their homes to the School morning and night.\n\nJ.E. Gendron,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJune 16, 1944.\n\nMr. J.E. Gendron, Indian Agent, Maniwaki, Que.\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to transporting children living on Bitobee Lake Road and Congway Road to the Congo Bridge Indian Day School.\n\nPlease let me know how many children would be affected. Have any of the parents transportation which could be used?\n\nOur experience on other reserves with regard to driving Indian children to school has not been satisfactory. It appears almost impossible to arrange a time that will suit everybody. You can realize that when anyone is transporting pupils they have to start early enough to reach the school before 9 o'clock. This means that those living farthest from the school have to be ready much earlier than those living somewhat closer. As stated above, this appears to be a very difficult matter to properly arrange. With our former experience I am doubtful if the expenditure that would be necessary in carrying out this suggestion would be justified. However, a final decision will not be made until we hear further from you.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nManiwaki, August the 7th, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nReferring to your letter of June the 16th, 1944, concerning a resolution passed by the Indians of the River Desert asking the Department to organize in order to pick up the children living too far away to go to School.\n\nI would estimate 35 to 40 children would be living too far away from School to go, this would comprise the Bitobee road where there is not School on that road and where there is approximately 20 children of the School age. Would this system be a success, should we be able to organize it, is something more than I can say and no doubt a lot would not come to School just the same. I would suggest that such a scheme be let go till the war is over and then may be at that time a bus could be acquired for such a scheme. I do not know of any one on the Reserve which would have an outfit to take those children to School, in the Winter with the organization we have and the roads blocked with snow, only a team of horses could be used and a lot of those children would be late for School. It is too bad to see that some of those families are unable to send their children to School on account of living too far, but I am at a lost to know how the situation can be remedied.\n\nJ.E. Gendron,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nAugust 9, 1944.\n\nMr. J.E. Gendron, Indian Agent, Maniwaki, Que.\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, in further reference to driving certain Indian children of the River Desert Band, who are living too far away to attend school regularly. The information given in Mr. Hoey's letter of June 16 outlines the view of the Department with regard to driving children and I note from the second paragraph of your recent letter that you are doubtful if full advantage would be taken of this facility. Under the circumstances I feel that the matter should be allowed to stand for the present.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nM.

Gendron, Indian Agent,\nManiwaki, Que.\n\nWith reference to requisition of the\nlast instant, you may purchase the following\nsupplies for the use of the Congo Bridge Indian\nDay School:\n\n- 12 bars of Barsolou Soap\n- 10 yards towelling\n- 50 lbs. Dustbane\n- 5 tins stove polish\n- 1 dozen hooks\n- 2 combs\n- 10 bars Lifebuoy soap.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nReferring to your letter of May the 30th, 1945 concerning the painting of the Maniwaki Indian Day School and the Congo Bridge Indian Day School, I wish to inform you that I finally succeeded in getting a painter to go and visit these schools to make an estimate of the painting jobs.\n\nThe Congo Bridge Indian Day School would cost for painting the inside and outside, excepting the floor, which would need a new floor the sum of $165.00\n\nThe Maniwaki Indian Day School would cost for painting the inside and outside, excepting the floor which would need sanding before oiling or varnishing as they are hardwood floors, the sum of $460.00. Moreover this latter school would certainly need some repairs in the verandas before the painting job is done. I would estimate the veranda repairs at $40.00.\n\nRegarding desks for the Congo Bridge Indian Day school the teacher tells me the medium size would be needed. The small size are too small for the children attending.\n\nJ. E. Gendron.\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 20, 1945.\n\nMr. J. E. Gendron, Indian Agent,\nManiwaki, Que.\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to painting the Maniwaki and Congo Bridge Schools. Owing to present conditions, we believe that only one school should be painted this year and I am inclined to feel that the Maniwaki School should be chosen.\n\nIt is noted that you have secured a quotation of $460.00 from a painter. I presume this covers both material and labour and would also mean the painting of both the interior and the exterior, with the exception of the floor, which would be sanded and then oiled or varnished. Please let me have a written tender from the painter from whom you secured the estimate. When submitting the tender, it would be appreciated if he would state the number of square feet of painting which is required. As soon as we receive the tender, it will be referred to the Director for his approval.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| Item Description | Quantity | Price |\n|------------------|----------|-------|\n| 10 ver tulle     |          | .50   |\n| 4 peignes        |          | .45   |\n| 3 mins \u00e0 po\u00eale  |          | .50   |\n| 1 doz crochet    |          | .50   |\n| 7 servons        |          | .62   |\n| 6 Gillett        |          | .72   |\n| 50 lbs dusthams |          | 4.25  |\n| 6 servons com ami|          | .90   |\n| 3/2 old bush    |          | 1.84  |\n| 6 servon bon ami |          | .90   |\n| 6 Gillett        |          | .72   |\n| 10 servon        |          | .60   |\n| 100 lbs dusthams |          | 8.10  |\n| 6 pre serviettes |          | .75   |\n| 3 \"               |          | .63   |\n| 2 chauffi\u00e8res    |          | 1.30  |\n| 2 bols \u00e0 main    |          | .70   |\n| 4 brosse \u00e0 plancher |        | .40   |\n| 4 b\u00e9ton          |          | .20   |\n| Gr une chauffi\u00e8re|          | .50   |\n\nTotal: $43.57\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Oct. 8 | Merchandise supplied to the Maniwaki Indian Day School and the Congo Bridge Ind.

They have indicated that while primarily handling veterans' housing, they are willing to undertake Government orders.\n\nWe would naturally want to provide a full basement and brick chimney. Our standard teacherage has four rooms, so we have selected for your consideration:\n\n(a) The Windsor at $1,551.00 plus extras,\n(b) The Beaverbrook at $1,458.00 plus extras,\n(c) The Robin at $1,523.00 plus extras.\n\nWe would appreciate your comments on this proposal.\n\n.....

We have also included a sum for the erection of a small teacher's residence at Congo Bridge.\n\nCould you please advise me of the local building situation and give me an indication as to whether you think it will be possible to have tenders called for the erection of such buildings in the near future.\n\nWe are having great difficulty in other agencies with our school building programme and are now investigating the possibility of erecting prefabricated teachers' houses where we find lumber is not available. However, I understand from Mr. Raymond, M.P., that we should be able to obtain a supply of lumber in your agency.\n\nBernard F.

I telephoned to Mr. Hargreaves of the Surveys and Engineering Branch this morning. He states that on the occasion of his visit to Maniwaki he left with you sketches showing exactly how to proceed. He also tells me that he supplied you with full particulars regarding the equipment needed and it was his understanding that you would obtain prices on this equipment and submit same to this office for our approval. Mr. Hargreaves advises me that he definitely informed you that he did not intend to send in further plans. He feels that the sketches and other information that he gave you should be sufficient to enable you to carry out the work in the necessary manner.\n\nCongo Bridge. With my letter of May 9th you were forwarded two copies of the plan of the cottage to be erected at the Congo Bridge School. Please let me have a requisition for the materials that will be needed. If any or all the materials can be purchased locally you should supply this information in your letter and state at what cost they can be purchased.\n\nAs soon as we hear from you we will make immediate arrangements to secure the materials and when these arrive you are authorized to proceed with the building.\n\nBernard F.

Gendron,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Projected house for Congo Bridge Indian Day School.\nFile: 15-2-5 (WT 1).\n\nIn answer to your letter of July the 5th, 1947, concerning the building of the above house, I wish to include you the estimates prepared by myself and the carpenter who is supposed to build this house.\n\nAs you see by these estimates the cost of installing a pump and a sink in the kitchen, also the drain pipes are not included, for the simple reason, that it might be hard to pump water where that house will be located, as it will be built on a hill.\n\nLast year I had put in an estimate of $2000. to build that house, but since the material has kept going up and in order not to be disappointed I would say that we would go nearer to $3500. than $2000. to finish this house. It may be possible that it would not cost us exactly that amount, but we will not be far from it.\n\nWill you kindly let me know what you intend that I should spend on the Maniwaki Indian Day School, the well has already cost us $780.00 adding $3500. for the Congo Bridge house, that will make $4280. Putting in the lights the toilets, pump, wash basins, stairs etc. etc., in the Maniwaki Indian Day School will cost quite a bit and I am working on those estimates and as soon as they are ready I will let you know what they are, but at a first glance I am sure they will cost\n$4,000. to $5,000., thus making a total expenditure of about $8,500. to $9,000. for the two schools. Naturally there would be no need to put in a pressure tank if we do not put in the electricity and as I always said before I do not like to go over my estimates in a project of that kind and this year especially it is quite hard to estimate anything.\n\nWork at the Congo Bridge Indian Day School can be started at any time and we have all the material here in Maniwaki to go ahead with this project, but I certainly would like to do what we had intended doing at the Maniwaki Indian Day School as it is very badly needed to improve the situation there.\n\nJ.E.

Day School.\n\nAlready I have received an advance\nof $500. on the labour for the repairs to the Maniwaki In-\ndian Day School and $500. for the labour on the Congo Bridge\nIndian Bay School.\n\nAt the Maniwaki Indian Day School\nthe Cess Pit is all built and connected and the partitions\nin the cellar, as well as the stairs are nearly all comple-\nted and it is expected that by next Saturday there will be\nvery little wood work to be done there, except the plumbing\nand painting. The electricity at that School is also nearly\nfinished and we are waiting on the carpenters to finish up\nthe cellar as far as electricity is concerned. The power has\nnot yet been brought in by the Gatineau Power, but the Manager\nhas promised me a couple of days ago that he would look after\nthis soon. On this job already an amount of $258.97 have been\npaid up to last Saturday on labour and timber furnished by the\nIndians. I would therefore need a further advance of another\n$500. on that job and would you please see that it is sent as\nsoon as possible.\n\nIn regard to the Congo Bridge Indian\nDay School the cellar is dug, the small Cess Pit for that School,\nthe gravel and the stones are drawn for the cellar. In fact\nan amount of $357.50 has already been paid on that job and I\ntherefore would need a further advance of $500. on that job too.\nThe full amount paid out up to Friday August the 29th. on both schools is $616.47.\n\nThe work is now progressing rapidly and the Carpenters are to start on the Congo Bridge Indian Day School by next Monday.\n\nJ.E.

I tried all over to get some but without satisfaction and I am wondering if it would not be possible to get 50 bags in Ottawa and have it shipped by a transport to Maniwaki. Only for this our house would have been finished for the first of October, except the painting. The footings for the foundation are made and I have on hand 85 bags of cement, but it is not enough for that foundation. If we cannot secure any cement I doubt very much if it will be possible to go ahead with this house before the first shipment of cement which might come in October sometime.\n\nJ.E.

We are short of 300 bricks for the chimney but I expect we will be able to secure them somewhere around here. Besides this it seems we have everything needed for that house.\n\nIn regard to the Maniwaki Indian Day School the electricity has not yet been connected and we are waiting on the Gatineau Power, all the installation is completed, but there is yet a lot of plumbing work to do, as the plumber is also short of material and expecting some every day. In general things are going fairly well and it is expected the carpenters will be finished in 8 or 10 days at the Congo Bridge House.\n\nJ.E.

From the tenor of the correspondence we were led to infer that this would be a bona fide Government school, and not a denominational one. We were willing to agree to this arrangement, and the school carried on under the auspices of the Methodist Church was discontinued accordingly. In recent correspondence from the Island I am informed that the Catholic school is carried on just as before, that nothing has been said to the Indians about the two schools being united, and that the Agent seems to know nothing about it. In a letter received from the Rev. H. Tennant of Cornwall, dated Oct. 17th, I am informed that none of the Protestant children are attending the school, and the parents do not want to send them under any circumstances. In justice to the Indian families under our care, we cannot allow this state of affairs to continue, but before taking steps to re-open the Protestant school I will await any explanation from the Department that may throw light upon the situation.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYours Obedient Servant,\n\nA. Smith\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Honorable the Super't General,\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 6th Nov., 1896.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to arrangements which have been made by the Department for the education of Indian children on Gannan Island.\n\nIt appears that in some respects at least the information you have received on the subject was incorrect. On the 13th August last the Department wrote to the Agent informing him that \"this school would be conducted as an unsectarian school\" and that both Roman Catholic and Protestant would have the privilege of giving instruction at stated hours after the lessons were over, and no children of other denominations shall be required to be present at the religious instruction given to those of the other faith.\" The school is held in the building in which the Roman Catholic school was formerly conducted; but if the instructions of the Department are followed, there seems to be no reason why the Protestant Indians should object to sending their children to this school. It is strictly unsectarian, and during school hours proper religious instruction whatever is to be given. We have engaged a teacher who is highly recommended, and it is hoped that you will see your way clear to cooperating with the Department in the establishment of one good school upon these conditions. The reason for the change primarily was that\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6088, file 309-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nthe Indians were constantly complaining that the expenditure for education upon the reserve was too large, and in attempting to maintain the cost, and at the same time improve the facilities for instruction, the plan at present being carried out was the only one which seemed possible to adopt with reference to Cornwall Island.\n\nRev. A. Miller, L.T.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Mission Board,\nToronto.\nSir,\n\nI have delayed replying to your letter of November 6th, No.151,930, referring to the school on Cornwall Island, until I had an opportunity of consulting the Executive Committee of the Board of Missions. I am now in a position to say that if the school is carried on as a bona fide public school, under the instructions mentioned in your letter above referred to; and with liberty to our Missionary to impart religious instruction, if deemed advisable, after school hours to the Protestant children, we have no disposition to complicate matters by pressing for a Methodist school. In harmony with this view instructions have been sent to the Missionary to advise the Protestant Indians to send their children to the existing school, and to co-operate with the Indian Agent in giving the present experiment a fair trial.\n\nI may say further, however, that in a letter from the Missionary, the Rev E.Tennant, he writes to the effect that the teacher had spoken of making up some time \"on account of some church holidays.\" I understand that in some places church holidays are quite numerous, and it seems scarcely fair to the Protestant children that they should be compelled to absent themselves from school on such days.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Deputy Super't General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nIndian Affairs.

Tennant, Missionary in charge, he writes as follows respecting the change made when the two schools were supposed to be consolidated in one:\n\n\"On Sunday after the service I spoke to the parents about sending their children, and had old Mr Benedict explain the matter, as he had it direct from the Agent. For a little while only a few of the Protestant children attended. But lately there is not one child from our people going. I enquired into the matter, and find it difficult to get all the facts in the case. There is an unwillingness on the part of our people to have their children go. They tell me the Catholic children are very rough and profane. One man said it took several days to break his little boy from the habit of swearing, and said that he would send his children no more to that school.\n\n\"As the matter stands now only the Catholic children are attending the school. However, seven Protestants have been sent away to the Industrial schools, some to Brantford, and others to Muncey, and there are others wanting to go. I feel sorry to have so many children growing up uneducated.\"\n\nI feel satisfied that Mr Tennant has been faithfully advising the people to send their children to the existing school, but without success, and I have thought that perhaps a little kind advice to the Indians from the Agent might help to bring about a better condition of affairs. If one school can be efficiently carried on, and all the children induced to attend, we would prefer that to the policy of two schools; but almost any course would be better than leaving the children or any considerable number of them to grow up in ignorance.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nThe Deputy Super't General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Catholic children attending there are in the habit of using profane and bad language.\n2. That they fight with the Protestant children who attend for a while among themselves.\n3. That with the exception of Louis Benedict, none of the Parents or guardians would promise to send their children providing the practice of using profane language and fighting was strictly prohibited.\n4.

This may be correct to a certain extent but I think if the teacher were more energetic and tried to obtain the good will of the Indians that better results could be had. Mr Killoran receives a salary of $350.00 a year, which is paid from the funds of the Band and I think that better value should be had for money and it is question whether it would not be advisable to look out for a new teacher after the summer holidays.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Bishop\nhas been a Public School Teacher in\ncharge of a rural school within my\nInspectorate, and that he possesses the\nrequisite qualifications for teaching a\nschool such as that of Cornwall Island\nunless a knowledge of the Indian language\nis considered necessary.\n\nIn reference to the Cornwall Island school,\nI may state that since the union of the two\nschools the Protestants have withheld their\nchildren from attending the school on the\nground that it was a R.C. school, and I have\nbeen thinking that the employment of a\nProtestant teacher for a few years might tend\nto remove that impression. Mr. Bishop is a R.C.,\nand his employment might confirm them in their views.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. M. Naughton\nOTTAWA, 15th August, 1900.\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nRe application of Mr W.J. Bishop for position of teacher of Cornwall Island school.\n\nMr McNaughton, Public School Inspector of Cornwall writes stating that Mr Bishop possesses the requisite qualifications for teaching an Indian school. He states, however, in connection with this school that since the union of the two schools the Protestants have withheld their children from attending on the ground that it was a Roman Catholic school, and he thinks that the employment of a Protestant teacher for a few years might tend to remove that impression. He says that Mr Bishop is a Roman Catholic, whose employment might confirm the Indians in their views.\n\nThe Protestant Indians may make this an excuse for keeping their children from school, and in fact complaints have been made against the conduct of the Roman Catholic children towards the Protestant children but this school, although under the charge of a Roman Catholic teacher, is an undenominational school.\n\nI think that a lady teacher might be able to overcome the prejudice of the Indians and might be likely to prove more successful than a man, as in the case of the St Regis school.\nShould the Department wish to employ Mr Bishop there is a vacancy for a teacher for the Boys' school at Coughmawaga, where he might be appointed provisionally and where a Roman Catholic male teacher is required. The salary of the last teacher was $400.00 with a residence, but I think that a less amount might be offered to start with.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr Bishop has had charge of this school for two years and although it is a difficult matter to reconcile the religious difference, this being an interdenominational school at which both Roman Catholic and Protestant children should attend, I think that had the teacher shown more energy in striving to overcome the Indians prejudices, better results could have been obtained. Mr Bishop does not reside on the Island and evidently has done very little to induce the parents to send their children. The Inspectors say the children are very backward and I think that a change after the summer holidays would be advisable, and that if a lady teacher were put in charge a better showing could be made.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

There are five schools on this reserve, two of them being in charge of Indian teachers, and the results obtained at these two schools are in marked contrast to the other three. The Indian teachers have no qualifications or training and, while they are doing their best, they are handicapped by their lack of education. Both these teachers have been in the service of the Department for some years, Mrs. Back, who is in charge of the Chenail School, was appointed six years ago, and Miss Roundpoint, now Mrs. Armstrong, who has the Cornwall Island School, has been there seven years.\n\nI think it would be well to make a change after the summer holidays, as there would be no difficulty in getting duly qualified teachers to take charge of both these schools.\nOttawa, January 4, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nIn view of the very satisfactory work performed by the three white teachers in charge of the Indian schools on the St. Regis Reserve the Department has decided that it would be in the interests of the Chenail and Cornwall Island schools to secure qualified white teachers for these schools to replace the present incumbents and, with a view to carrying this into effect, you are authorized to inform Mrs. Back and Mr. Armstrong that their services will not be required after the 30th of June, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN.

Mr. White called at the Department the other day and made a personal application to this effect and was informed that his application should come through the local agent, Mr. Taillon, accompanied by testimonials. As he stated that his niece had attended the High School in Cornwall he was recommended to obtain a testimonial from the Principal and also a certificate from you as to her fitness for the position. He was told that the application would then be considered.\n\nIn this connection I beg to inform you that Mr. Agent Taillon has been instructed to communicate with you with a view of securing the services of a qualified teacher to take charge of this school, as the Department is anxious to have a qualified teacher, if one is available.

O'Hare\nI am desirous of securing information relative to the length of Cornwall Island, in order that the school regulations may be better enforced.\n\nInformation given me by Peter White, leads me to believe that the island was surveyed some years ago by Mr. Austin.\n\nAs a member of the Indians' mission they are exempt from the school law and quote sec. 3, subsec. c., page four of the school laws in their behalf; I am therefore particularly anxious to secure the desired information before making any visits, so that their school will have any chance of the defendant, having his consent or to the distance of school from his residence.\n\nJ.

Simon, P. Bing, Chas. Peters and Jos. Lear, who are outside of a two mile radius. Only children under ten years of age who live outside the two mile radius would be exempt under sub-section C of the section above referred to.

Tailon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, Que.\nExtract from report of Inspector Froats on the Cornwall Island School dated October 6, 1916.\n\nOriginal on 151930/6.\n\nCarelessness is chief cause of irregular attendance; then, again, distance from the school for the little ones may be the cause, especially during unfavourable weather.\n\nIf a truant officer were appointed he might be able to improve the attendance.\n\nThe general management of the school seems to be fairly good. The teacher seems to stress promptness, obedience and cleanliness; and to give them work in language, problems and general knowledge such as should be useful to them when they leave school. She could do much more for them if they would attend more regular; this irregular attendance handicaps the progress very much.\nSir,\n\nI have this day caused the arrest of Peter Delormier, of Cornwall, blond, for the non attendance of two of his children at school; finding him guilty I have sentenced him to the Cornwall Jail for seven days and I hope you will concern in the action taken by me.\n\nI have at all times ever desired by precept and example to get the Indians to send their children to school but in some cases I have met with nothing but a marked desire to keep the children out of school.\n\nI now hope during the past few weeks, for their fires and eventually dropped into the old way, therefore I have with great reluctance decided it was for the welfare of the children to make an example of someone and I do sincerely hope that it will make the Indians realize that the children must attend school.\n\nAs to Delormier's family,\nSir,\n\nI may say they were in the office to get along quite nicely during his forced vacation.\n\nRegarding the constable's fees, for his services, I suppose I should send it in to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

Therefore, I sentenced him as stated above.\n\nMost assuredly he is the hardest worst case, I have ever had upon this reserve, no matter what the complaint may be.\n\nMay 29, 1915.\nSir,\n\nfor instance, after I had consulted\nthe necessary papers, and was\nabout to send them to the constable,\nhe bowed to the door and in forcing\nthe store, grated an iron grate,\nthen made for Leof who was aiding\nDog, sitting at his feet.

Where, however, the children reside at a great distance from the school due consideration will be given to weather conditions.\n\nThe present school building will be put into the best conditions possible for the winter. It is realized that there should be two schools on Cornwall Island and the Indians must look forward to spending their own moneys in the hands of the Department for the purpose of providing proper facilities.

Again if Domestic Science and some of the Manual Arts were taught the pupils would, I think, be more interested in school work, and possibly the parents would also be more anxious.\n\nJames Froats,\nInsp.\nOttawa, October 20, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Froats, in a report to the Department on his recent inspection of the Cornwall Island Indian Day School, states that the children in the lowest form seem quite backward in their work. He attributes this to the irregularity of attendance and recommends that, if domestic science were taught the pupils, they and the parents would be more interested in the work of the school.\n\nI may say that, if the teacher will undertake to teach sewing, knitting, etc., the Department will be prepared to provide a reasonable quantity of material for the purpose. You might consult the teacher regarding this matter and also furnish your views as to whether you consider the teaching of this work would be of any advantage and, if so, you should also state what material the teacher would require for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

She has also received bonus at the rate of $150.00 per annum during the past three years. She has an Intermediate Model Certificate for the Province of Quebec and had three years' experience in white schools previous to her appointment at Cornwall Island. There is an enrolment of 30 pupils, with an average attendance of 14. The Separate School Inspector, in his report of his inspection in October, last, states that Miss Legarde is making a fair success in the work, but is handicapped by the irregularity of the attendance. There is no doubt that the Indians take very little interest in the education of their children, mainly due to the influence of the Thunderwater element. The Agent states that he has always found Miss Legarde to be conscientious, ambitious and eager to do anything that might possibly benefit the children under her charge, and he recommends that she be granted an increase.\n\nI would recommend that she be given an increase of $50.00 from the first of the current month.\nOttawa, January 26, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant enclosing a communication from Miss Geneva Legarde, teacher of the Cornwall Island Indian Day School, applying for an increase in her salary.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it has been decided, in view of your recommendation, to grant Miss Legarde an increase of $50.00 per annum in her salary from the first of the present month. This will make her salary from that date at the rate of $550.00 per annum and she will also receive the bonus during the period it is continued to teachers in Indian day schools. This is the full salary that the Department is prepared to allow at the present time. You will be good enough to inform Miss Legarde accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst.

The teacher is often late for school and also dismisses the school session 2:30 and 3:00 P.M. She is indifferent to the scholars and often sleeps while at school. Last Friday the Priest came to the school and had confession with the scholars. The Protestant parents object to his interference in school matters and ought to be so informed.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours truly,\nJohn Bruce.\nOttawa, March 1, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 24th ultimo regarding the hours the teacher of the Cornwall Island Indian Day School opens and closes the school each day, I beg to say that inquiry will be made.\n\nThe Department has no objection to the Priest giving religious instruction to the Catholic pupils, but this should only be done after the regular school hours.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. John Bruce,\nCornwall Island,\nOnt.\nOttawa March 1, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nA complaint has been received from John Bruce, Cornwall Island, regarding the hours the teacher of the Cornwall Island School dismisses the children in the afternoons. He also states that the teacher is often late opening the school and dismisses the children at from 2:30 to 3 P.M. He also states that she is indifferent to the scholars and often sleeps during school hours.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will inquire into this matter and you should inform Miss Legarde that it is expected that she will open the school promptly at 9 A.M. each school day and it should be closed after the afternoon session at 4 P.M.\n\nHe also states that the Protestant parents object to the Priest visiting the school and giving religious instruction. In connection with this matter I beg to say that there is no objection to the Priest imparting religious instruction to the Catholic pupils, but this should only be done after the regular school hours.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will furnish as soon as possible a report regarding Bruce's complaint as to the hours this school is opened and closed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. E. Taillon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, Que.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your request, I have investigated the complaint made by John Bruce concerning Miss Legarde's conduct at the school. I have spoken to her about this matter and visited her school to observe the conditions mentioned.\n\nMiss Legarde states that she invariably arrives at the school between 8:30 and 8:45 AM, and that she never dismisses school before 4 PM unless on some occasions when no recess is given, except the younger children whom she dismisses earlier in the day, after having heard their lessons.\n\nAs to the statement that she is indifferent to the pupils' needs, I agree with him as I personally know Miss Legarde's dedication and devotion to do all she can for the children. If success does not come from her efforts, it is the fault of irregular attendance.\n\nI have, several times, discussed the matter raised by Mr. Bruce with Miss Legarde before school.\nSir,\n\nI am writing on each occasion\n\nShe does emphatically say\n\never sleeping during school\n\nhours she asks, \"How do I\n\nwith the children?\" and she\n\nsays is sufficient, as with the\n\npupil she has, I don't believe,\n\nshe could sleep even through\n\nit.\n\nJust what object Bruce\n\nhas in despatching such a letter\n\nI am not able to know.\n\nAs to the Protestant\n\nobjecting to the Priest\n\nvisiting the School, I fail to\n\nunderstand why they refused\n\ncomport, as their children\n\nattended rarely.\n\nThe Priest was at the\n\nschool twice I think, this winter,\n\nonce with me and the other\n\ntime alone, on our first visit\n\nI think there was one Protestor\n\npresent, and his last\n\nvisit also very rare, so just\n\nwhat evil effect it would have\n\nupon the children, I am not\nSir,\n\nI prefer to say:\n\nAt any rate, I think Mr. Brown, is exercising his authority to be for no interest whatever in the school, so he has not any children attending; ever since I have been here, I have always welcomed visits of clergymen of any denomination to the school.\n\nJ.

It is noted that there are no grounds for the complaints made and that Miss Legarde, the teacher, is performing her duties satisfactorily.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst.

Miss Legarde arrives at her school each morning between 8.30 and 8.45 and is ready and prepared to begin her duties at the hour of opening the school, 9 A.M. She never dismisses the school before 4 P.M. In the case of some of the younger children she sometimes dismisses them a little earlier in the afternoon after having heard their lessons. Regarding your statement that she is indifferent to the pupils, I beg to say that Miss Legarde endeavours to do all she can for the children and, if full success does not crown her efforts, it is entirely owing to the irregular attendance. Your charge that she sleeps on duty is emphatically denied by the teacher herself and substantiated by the Agent. As to your complaint that the Priest visits the school and gives religion instruction to the objection of the Protestant parents, I beg to say that two visits were made by the Priest this winter; on one occasion there was one Protestant pupil present and on the last visit of the Priest there were none. The Department is informed that you have no children attending.\n\nI would point out to you the serious nature of making charges against teachers which have no foundation in fact and in future the Department cannot pay any attention to trivial charges such as you have made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Indian Affairs,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been Missionary to the Protestant Indians on Cornwall Island for the past four years, ending June 30th last. I had ample opportunity to see how educational affairs progressed, as well as the manner in which the Indian agent, Leillon, attends to things.\n\nThe school might be as well closed, the same teacher has been in charge of the school for several years. The children are learning next to nothing. Complaints have been made to Mr. Leillon, but he seems to be too indifferent to make any change or attempt to improve matters. I had an appeal from our family and others to see if I could try and do something to help bring about a change. I am writing you therefore to ask you to take this matter up and see that those people, at least, be given a chance to get a little education. The family referred to have a bright boy and are desirous of giving him every advantage possible.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nA.W. Williamson\nOttawa, March 26, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to the education of the Indian children of Cornwall Island. This part of the St. Regis Reserve presents considerable difficulties, in view of the lack of interest in, and even objection to, education on the part of a large group of the Indian parents. The Department has for some years contemplated the erection of two suitable day schools, one at each end of the island; but the attitude of the Indians makes us hesitate to incur the capital expense attendant upon such building activity. We have no safeguard that either school would be any more successful than the present one.\n\nWith reference to the services of the present teacher, I have to inform you that the Department is not wholly satisfied, but it is doubtful if even an exceptionally well qualified incumbent could secure a large and regular attendance. The Public School Inspector who visits the Cornwall Island Indian Day School reports that Miss Geneve Legarde is fairly successful.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. W. Williamson, Esq.,\nOxford Mills,\nOnt.\nOxford Mills, Mar. 28th 1925\n\nA.W. Wilkinson Esq.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour favour of the 24th inst., just to hand, I am in perfect accord with your statement in the allude to the building of two new schools on Cornwall Island. I do not think the matter would be very much improved. I do believe however, that a change of teachers more frequently would have good results, when one has been in charge for a couple of years there is a tendency to fall into habits and lose that interest and alertness which are so necessary to the work. The chief complaint about the present teacher is not lack of ability or qualification, but that she adopts a strict drill during school hours which is very manifestly strong evidence of lack of enthusiasm for teaching in the school.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nA.W. Wilkinson\nOttawa, April 2nd, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the services of the teacher of the Cornwall Island Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will obtain a special report on the services and ability of the teacher before the end of the present school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAest. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. W. Williamson, Esq.,\nOxford Mills,\nOnt.\nOttawa, April 2nd, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to request that at your early convenience you will pay a visit to the Cornwall Island Indian Day School and make enquiries with a view to forwarding a special report to the Department concerning the services being performed by the teacher, Miss Geneva Legarde. The Department has received certain complaints regarding her lack of interest, and that she frequently goes to sleep during the regular class periods. We are aware of the irregular attendance, but it is thought that, to some extent, this could be overcome if the teacher showed sufficient interest to make the classroom activities attractive.\n\nPlease state whether you would recommend that a change in the teacher be made at the end of the present school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. E. Taillon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, Que.\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 2nd April regarding complaints against Miss Geneva Lagarde, teacher of Cornwall Island School, I beg to say that my physician would not consent to my visiting the school owing to my present condition. I have waited until now to answer thinking the weather would improve and I could make the visit. There is not much question as to the teacher apparently lacking the necessary interest and as to her frequently going to sleep, there must be some truth to it as this statement has been made to the Department before. Personally I believe a change at Cornwall Island would be to the best interest of the school. You should endeavor to secure the services of an experienced teacher, one who can attract the children to her and will at least try to make the school-work interesting and attractive.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Sec.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\nNovember 12, 1925.\n\nMemorandum\n\nRev. Arthur Barner, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Missions, strongly recommends that two schools be provided on Cornwall Island. The Protestants have about 10 children, but are quite willing to send them to the two regular schools which are known as R.C. He says there is a group of Protestant Indians that are very fine in type. He names the Benedicts, Bruces and Peters.\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nWith reference to the school needs of Cornwall Island, I have learned that the first new building should be placed at the East or lower end and that it will require a residence. The West end, also known as the Upper or Head of the island, needs no teacher's residence as the site would be fairly close to Cornwall.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF INSPECTOR JAMES FROATS,\nDATED SEPT. 21st, 1926, ON THE CORNWALL ISLAND\nINDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nIf the teacher would call on the different families, it might help to increase the attendance and cause some of those who do attend to do so more regularly.\nOttawa, October 7th, 1926.\n\nMadam:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Cornwall Island Indian Day School, has made the following suggestion:\n\n\"If the teacher would call on the different families, it might help some to increase the attendance and cause some of those who do not attend to do so more regularly.\"\n\nI have, therefore, to request that you will, at the earliest opportunity, carry out the Inspector's suggestion and visit each of the Indian families whose children attend your school and endeavour to impress upon them the necessity of seeing that their children attend regularly. You should also visit the families whose children do not attend, and endeavour to persuade them to see that their children of school age attend.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear later as to whether you have been able to comply with the Inspector's suggestion and of the results of your visit to the parents.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Genevi\u00e8ve Lagarde,\nTeacher, Cornwall Island Indian Day School,\nCornwall, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIt has been impossible for me to comply with the Public School Inspector's suggestion in a report on his recent inspection of the Cornwall Island Indian Day School.\n\nOctober 16th I visited the different Indian families residing on the Eastern Section of Cornwall Island. Since above mentioned date the roads have been impassable so I can not visit the Indian families residing on the Eastern Section of the Island until later.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Miss) Geneva Logarde\n244 Gloucester Street,\nCornwall.\nPenfors, Ont.\nMay 17, 1927.\n\nMr. J.B.

I have obtained my Normal Entrance and have Model Training.\n\nFor my services as teacher in your school, I should require eighty dollars per month, so you could let me know\nwhat salary you are paying, and I could adjust myself to same.\n\nIf the Cornwall Island Indian School has already engaged a teacher for after September, would you be so kind as to consider my application for any of the other vacant Indian Schools.\n\nMr. Ferrier, would you please give me a definite reply at once in regard to any of these schools but if possible the one I mentioned.\n\nTrusting to hear from you as soon as possible, I await your reply.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMargaret Donovan,\nPenfield,\nOnt.\nOttawa, May 19th, 1927.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, applying for the position as teacher of the Cornwall Island Indian Day School for the next school year and stating the qualifications and experience which you possess.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in the event of a vacancy at the Cornwall Island School, arrangements have been made for the transfer of one of the other teachers at St. Regis to take charge of this school for the next school year. There will, however, be a vacancy for a teacher at the Chetlain School, which is located at a distance of approximately 5 miles from St. Regis Village. Enquiry is being made as to what vacancies there will be for the next school year, and you will be advised later as to whether we can accept your services or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

She states that she has been advised by you to make application for any vacancy that may occur. I shall be pleased to have a report from you stating whether you consider the services of Miss Donovan would be satisfactory or not if she were appointed as teacher at any of the schools on the St. Regis Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Margaret MacNulty,\nSt. Regis,\nP.Q.\nSt. Regis, June 27th, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. [Last Name]:\n\nMiss Donovan wrote me in March re. vacancies here. At that time there were none but I advised her of the possible one on Cornwall Island which you spoke to me about for the coming Sept.-June term, and asked her to write you regarding same, using my name if she wished.\n\nI should think she would be a very dependable girl for say Cornwall Island, St. Regis island, Chenail or Chetlain where vacancy may occur. I might add yes, give her a trial; you have this to bank on; she is looking for a permanent position and would therefore put forth an effort to please.\n\nShould I be in charge of the schools as you have suggested for the next term, I would like her placed on Cornwall Island. This is the more remote centre, she is an older girl and I feel I can depend her to do her work. (M. Whalley)\nOttawa, May 30, 1927.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th instant, with reference to Miss Margaret Donovan, of Renfrew. I note you suggest Cornwall Island for her. Miss MacDonald, at present at Chetlain, has made a strong plea to be transferred to Cornwall Island for next year. I understand her home is not far from Cornwall. Do you think Miss Donovan would accept Chetlain if she knew all the circumstances? I am seriously thinking of engaging a Caughnawaga Indian girl, who has had experience with the Sisters there, for St. Regis Island. She would live on the island. This would mean that Miss Dunnigan would have to be moved. How would she do in the junior room of the village? If this transfer were made and Miss MacDonald transferred to Cornwall Island, the only vacancy for Miss Donovan would be Chetlain. Would she be willing to board with one of the families there? The new village residence can be used for both village teachers and the Chenaill worker. Please let me have a further expression of your opinion.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

I have written two letters to the Indian Agents at St. Regis, one the former one who resigned or died last fall & the present one. In the former one I wrote about one of our young men on Cornwall Island who was arrested on the St. Lawrence near the American boundary by American officers on a charge of bootlegging all I wished was that the Agent would inquire into the matter since that the young man was native & belonged to a very respectable family. That letter was never acknowledged. And the Mother told me today that as far as they knew, he took no interest in the matter.\n\nIn regard to the present agent I wrote him about school matters calling his attention to the poor attendance in the school. I also wrote some prospect of the Department building a school, I would like to see him & talk matters over. I mentioned the fact that both he & I were engaged in looking after the welfare of the Indians & would be helpful if we could talk the matter over. I asked him to call on me when in Cornwall. He has neither replied to my letter nor called.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6088, file 309-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\npoor copy\nI have heard from a builder in town that he has a contract to build a school house on Cornwall Island. I was on the island today and some of the people are talking about two school houses being up. I venture to suggest to the Department that the best thing to do is to build one large school near the centre of the island or a little further to the east and engage a man to convey the children to and from the school in this way. I think the children would do better work.\n\nMiss Lepage, the teacher, is of the same opinion, one of the serious difficulties on the island is that the parents do not send their children to school; they seem to know so little about the benefits of education and do they feel any responsibility for sending them to school? Then in the winter, once a number of them being poor they complain that they can't afford them useful clothing, if they could be called for in a crowd conveyance they would get over that difficulty\u2014besides children would be more apt to go with the band. Then the man in charge could be employed by the Department to report them if they persisted in refusing them at home that the Department would send them to Mission schools. This is a very important matter which should receive careful consideration from the Department.\n\nI am convinced if we are to save these people from being educated properly we must educate them.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nA. G. Alley, Missionary\nOttawa, August 22, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, addressed to the Superintendent of Indian Education.

Our agent states that the Indians claim they have never been asked to pay the past academic year's fees, and I should be grateful if you would suggest to Mr. Wood, the Secretary of the Board, that he make an effort to collect what is due.\n\nI am pleased to state that I hope the Indian parents, in future, will be glad to send their children to the Cornwall Island Indian Day School.

This was intimated to me at the time I was first engaged, providing my services were satisfactory.\n\nI am able to make application for my Professional Certificate, having taught two years, and being accustomed to the ways of the children, I feel that I am being justified in asking for a $20 raise in my monthly salary.\n\nHoping you will find it satisfactory to do this, I am\n\nRespectfully yours,\nFrank Burns\nOttawa, July 3rd, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, relative to the retaining of your services as teacher of the Cornwall Island Indian Day School for the next school year.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will be pleased to have you continue as teacher at this school, resuming duties when the school re-opens after the present summer holidays, on or about September 4th, next.

Mr. Chisholm could not understand why such a matter was reported, as it was not true, also he said, that the children were free to keep their lunches and eat their lunches where they wished. And as to the children being kept out of school in rainy and stormy weather, he also said that this was not true, although, in nice weather, he tried to have the children enjoy themselves out in the open fresh air as much as possible.\n\nMr. Chisholm said he would explain to the school children that they were free to eat their lunches where they wished, so in future there would be no false reports on school matters such as the one recently reported.\n\nI am,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.B.

Before enforcing these regulations care should be taken to see that it will not cause hardship to any children in travelling to and from the school. In cases, however, where there is no good reason why the parents should not send their children to school the regulations should be enforced. This matter will be left to your discretion, and you should be careful to see that no undue hardship is occasioned to the children of those parents who reside at a distance from the school to compel them to attend regularly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. E. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, Que.\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your of Dec 9th instant #157930/5 relative to certain conditions at Corn was the school, I beg to inform you that as stated in my letter to you of October 30th, the repairs were made with the exception of one window which apparently has been injured by force.\n\nI may say the building is quite satisfactory and will be found very suitable an improvement.\n\nThe outside door and the two closets have been injured by recent high winds; I am hoping these immediately above as well as any other that may require attention so that the school may be warmer when reopened after the holidays.\n\nThe glass was all put up with the exception of the south window, the house looking but this will be remedied at once.\n\nI regret exceedingly that this work was done properly at\n\nIndian Affairs.

I had no knowledge of its one window not being repaired.\n\nHowever, I assure you that I shall see fit that these further repairs are done and more satisfactory.\n\nAs to the enforcement of the regulations, I note your comments therein, I have no desire to cause any hardship to these children but I do think that an example must soon be made of some of the cases of non-attendance or some parents keep their children out of school and because the school is closed but because they won't lose their own money for mistakes like the case of brown Jock whom I certify for eight days during which\nSir,\n\nIn 1918, Mr. Peter Selkirk, who was connected previously to this office, now lives in Quebec and informs me that some of them have never attended school regularly except last September and others of them still longer; I say to you that as long as they are allowed to follow their own way, the attendance will be poor.\n\nJ.

Your explanation in regard to the delay in carrying out the work of having the repairs made to the windows is satisfactory.\n\nWith reference to the enforcement of the regulations I beg to say that, as advised by official letter of the 9th instant, it is not intended that these should be enforced in cases where it is likely to cause hardship to the children in travelling to and from the school. You should use your own discretion in the matter and in cases where you consider that there is no good reason why the parents are not sending their children to school the regulations should be enforced. If one or two examples were made in cases where the parents reside within a reasonable distance of the school, it might have a salutary effect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. E.

The Inspector also states that there should be a flag for the school and that the flag pole should be furnished with a rope, so that the flag can be hoisted.\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to furnish as soon as possible an estimate of the cost of having the foundation and steps repaired and storm windows put on and of the rope required for the flag pole. With reference to the foundation I may say that it is not the intention that any undue expense should be incurred. It may be that, if the school were well banked, this would serve the purpose. However, you should furnish an estimate of the cost of furnishing the above materials and state your views as to what you consider should be done to the foundation and the probable cost of the same. If you consider that the banking of the building would be sufficient you should state the cost of having the work done.

The premises are not enclosed. There is a poor barbed wire fence to the front along the roadside. The gates are poor. There is a flag pole but no rope attached, so that the flag cannot be hoisted. The premises are stony and covered with heaps of cow manure. There are no shade trees. Cows should not be pastured on school grounds.\"\n\nPlease state whether in your opinion the work of erecting one of the proposed new school buildings on Cornwall Island should be proceeded with this coming spring, and if it will be possible to obtain a site. If not, you should arrange early in the spring to have the necessary repairs made to the barbed wire fence around the present school building, and the premises generally cleaned up and put in satisfactory condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The wood shed is small and in a better condition than are the other buildings. The water closets are small, too close together, entrances not screened properly, ventilation poor, and they are dirty. The school house is not in good condition. The teacher reports that it is quite cold. There is no proper approach to the classroom from the front, as the steps are poor and there is no way of getting in from the main road, only through the mud. The gates are poor and the school premises (grounds) are not fenced to the rear, so it is really in the corner of a cow pasture. The cows lie around the school and leave the dirty yard in a dirtier condition. I am told that the buildings are owned by the Dominion Government.\n\nThe teacher said that there were at least 50 pupils on the Island, and possibly more. There are a few at the head of the Island, attending the Public School No. 2 Township of Cornwall on the mainland; these walk across the railroad bridge and are progressing favourably in their studies.\n\nThe present school building is situated about the middle of the length of the Island, and it seems the greater populations are nearer the ends of the island - hence the distance to the school for the younger children is great. I would strongly urge that two schools be erected, one near the head, and one near the foot of the Island.\n\nThe parents are careless regarding the sending of their children to school.\nThe Department authorized Miss Legarde, Teacher of the Cornwall Island School, to expend the sum of $5.00 in the purchase of Christmas prizes for the children of her school.

OHR.\n\nThere is an item of $3,500 in the Supplementary Estimates for the purpose of erecting a classroom at the west end of Cornwall Island, St. Regis Reserve. Accommodation for 24 desks is required. Nearly all the children at this school carry their lunch, and, if a long cloakroom 11 or 12 ft. wide could be included in the building, it might be an advantage. This would permit of a long table with benches for the lunch hour.\n\nThe Cornwall Island Indian Day School has always been heated satisfactorily by a box stove and I believe a basement is unnecessary. The present stove can be moved to the new building, as it is in good shape.\n\nYou might note my suggestion in my memo on 33-6-8 (St. Regis Village Teachers' Residence) that both buildings be awarded in the same contract. The site on Cornwall Island is being selected by the Indian Agent and is approximately one mile from the wharf of the town of Cornwall.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I visited this school on Oct. 3rd./27. there were thirty-two pupils present, and Miss Mac Donald, Teacher, reports that she expects there will be forty pupils who will attend the new school when it opens. The desks in the old school, the most of them are pretty shaky, and in bad condition. I would recommend that all new single desks be placed in new school, forty in number. There will be ten small desks required for the smaller children, and thirty desks for larger ones. These desks should not arrive at Oscar Station, Cornwall Island, until the first part of the week of the 17th. October, 1927. I have made arrangements with the carpenters who are working on the new school, that if the desks arrive at Oscar Station, to have them transferred over to school, but I should be notified the day the desks should arrive, and see to this transferring myself. I will have the old desks stored away, three of them could be used at St. Regis Island school. Enclosed is a diagram of class-room, and placing of desks, which is the best to my opinion. About the stove for this school, the store in the old school is a good heater, and in good condition if it will be large enough to heat the class-room in the new school, it could be given a try. I may say that the number of pupils attending Cornwall Island School at present, is the largest on record.\n\nI Am,\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nW. H.

I enclose herewith a copy of our order showing the sizes of the desks ordered, the number of each size and the price quoted for supplying same. The above firm have been requested to make early shipment and to notify you of the date in order that you can arrange to accept delivery at Uscon Station.\n\nThe above firm have been requested to forward their account, in duplicate, to you, and upon receipt of the desks, if in good condition, you should certify the account in the usual manner and send it to the department in order that payment can be made.\n\nWhen these desks arrive at Uscon Station, you should arrange to have them taken to the school, assembled and set up in the classroom. They should be set up in four rows, having the same size of desk in each row, with a front and rear seat.\n\nWhen the building is ready, you may arrange to have the stove in the old school transferred and set up in the new building, as it is hoped that it will be satisfactory to heat the new building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. A. MacGibbon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, P.Q.\nSir,\n\nOn my trip to Ottawa, on Sept. 28/27, I was authorized by Mr. Ore to have slate black-boards installed in the new school on Cornwall Island. I instructed Atchison & Co. of Cornwall, Ont., to do this work.\n\nPrice of materials and labor, including chalk rail and frame $133.00\n\nSize of black-boards\u201422 Ft. 4\" x 3 Ft. 2\"\n\nYour Obedient Servant.\n\nW.C. Mac Gibbon\n\nAgent.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,-\n\nI beg to say regarding Cornwall Island old school. If this school is to be sold after the new one is completed and in working order, Ira Benedict, Indian on Cornwall Island would like to buy it; he offers $65.00, half cash, balance in ten months.\n\nMr. Benedict has very few buildings on his farm, if he had this old building I think it would help him considerable. Mr. Benedict is a steady worker and trying to make good.\n\nMr. Louis White of Cornwall Island spoke about wanting to buy this school, but Mr. White has lots of buildings, and I would say that Ira Benedict should have the chance to buy it.\n\nI am,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nW.C. Mac Gibbon\nAgent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 27, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, relative to the sale of the present old school building on the Cornwall Island Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that when the new school building is ready for occupation and the old furnishings, etc., removed, the Department will approve of your arranging for the sale of the old building. If Ira Benedict will pay the sum of $40 in cash, and agree to remove the building and level up the foundation on which it stands and also clean up all materials, the Department will approve of the sale to him of this old building. It is considered that the above amount, along with the work in levelling the site, is a fair charge. You should, however, obtain the above amount from Benedict before he takes possession of the building, as well as his promise to level the site, and you should forward the amount received to the Department for credit of the Receiver General. I shall be pleased to hear us to whether he agrees to purchase the building and do the work mentioned for the sum of $40.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW.

Mr. Chisholm thought that a slide could be made with very little cost. Mr. Paul Caldwell, caretaker of the school, is willing to provide the timber, two long skids, about 30 or 40 feet long, and supports, and is asking $4.00 for this material.\n\nIn addition to this, there would be the lumber for the slide, possibly $6.00 or $7.00 would purchase the required lumber. Mr. Chisholm would erect the slide with the help of the older school boys, so there would be no cost to the erecting of the slide. Mr. Chisholm is doing good work on the island, and would recommend this slide supplied.\n\nIn previous years, this school has been allowed $5.00 to purchase Christmas Gifts for the school children. Mr. Chisholm says that this amount is too small for the number of pupils attending school, and requests that this amount be increased to $7.00.\n\nWill you please advise me in these matters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is noted that the cost of the material would not exceed the sum of $12. The teacher and the older boys are to erect the slide without cost to the Department. You may forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the two long skids and for the other materials required, the total cost of which should be kept within the amount mentioned by you. The teacher should be responsible to see that no injury is occasioned to any of the pupils in the use of the slide.\n\nRegarding the grant to purchase gifts for the pupils at Christmas, I have to say that you may incur an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $7 for this purpose.

It runs the Department into mileage fees when I have to run after these accounts a second or third time. I am enclosing the second account of Mr. Leaf for the labor, and would have sent that of Atkinson for the material, but for the fact that as it was a cash sale they had not kept any record other than that given in quadruplicate to Mr. Chisholm at the time of the purchase.

A. Galley of Cornwall, in which he speaks in most appreciative terms of the benefit to the Indians of your visit to Cornwall Island. He asks that you visit them again and I think it well if you could include it in the itinerary of your next eastern visit. You might communicate direct with Mr. Galley.\n\nNot having the Agent's Address, I communicated as directed with Mr. Galley, supposing that he would arrange with the Agent for Agricultural meetings afternoon, and evening of Apr., the 28th, I received word, in answer, to the effect that he would take the matter up with the Agent and let me know. I expected the Agent to send me a letter but evidently he wrote to the Department for permission to use the School House. I hope the Agent will not feel that we ignored him, in this connection. We have always been careful, in all our work to acknowledge the position and authority of the Indian Agents. I think, now as I have the address of the Agent for the first, in your letter, I will write him an explanatory letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe SECRETARY,\nDept., Ind., Affs.,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This shed is annexed to the main building but without any cement foundation, hence it is off the ground about three feet. There are no centre supports to take the strain off the sills and consequently, the latter have broken.\n\nIt will be necessary to get five 2\" x 8\" x 12' planks, remove the coal and wood from the shed; get jacks and raise the floor to its proper level and install new sills. I can't say for sure yet but I hardly think it will be necessary to put in any new flooring. It is expected the labour cost will be around $35.00. I may have to rent a couple of jacks as I have nothing here to work with. May we proceed with the work?\n\nT. L.

Bonnah\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncs.\nSt. Regis, Que.\nSept. 8th, 1944\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq., Supt. Welfare & Training.\n\nPlease be advised that on the morning of Sept. 5th, a survey was made to ascertain any visible damage to school buildings as a result of the earthquake during the early hours of that morning.\n\nOur schools in general do not appear to have suffered damage to the extent of having to close any of them. As far as getting any repairs done for some time at least, I am at a loss to know where to look for help along this line as it is out of the question to get any locally or in the neighbourhood as every available mason, bricklayer and plasterer is engaged in Cornwall trying to patch things up there before the cold weather sets in.\n\nCornwall Ild. West school appears to have fared the worst. Foundation is cracked in several places (but there is no cellar here). The south wall of the classroom should be replastered as well as parts of the north wall over the blackboards. The boys and girls cloakrooms need repairing. The chimney is cracked in two at roof level but due to the cement over the bricks the extent of damage cannot be known as yet... Approximately one-half of the S. east wall needs replastering.\n\nCornwall Ild.-E. school chimney is cracked vertically from top to bottom. This chimney is set in flush with the east wall and I cannot say what damage is done, if any, beyond what is visible. It may be that a filler is all that is required here. As far as the other schools are concerned and residences, things appear to be fairly good. Due to being practically on the go for three days and nights I have not as yet been able to get to St. Regis Island but have contacted Mr. Thompson, where the teacher lives, and he tells me no serious damage occurred.\n\np.t.o.\nWhile up to this writing tremors are still being felt, unless we get another severe rocking, I do not expect further damage will result. Teachers have been advised to clear their classrooms should any tremors be felt during school hours.\n\nT.L. Bonnah\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 14, 1944.\n\nMr. T. L. Bonnah, Indian Agent, St. Regis, Que.\n\nRe: Damage by Earthquake,\nto Indian Day Schools,\nSt. Regis Agency.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of September 8 and have noticed with the utmost interest the information sent forward by you. It would appear at this date that our schools have escaped serious damage.\n\nI can readily appreciate the difficulty you are likely to experience in securing the help necessary to make even urgent repairs, in view of conditions in Cornwall. This letter will be your authority to exercise your own best judgment in respect to the urgent repairs that should be undertaken when labour is available.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nR. A. Hoey, Esq., Supt. Welfare & Training.\n\nI have been requested by Mrs. White, teacher of the Cornwall Island West School, to try and solve a housing problem which has confronted her. As you probably know she has been living with her mother on Cornwall Island and up until recently matters have been going along fairly well. The fact that all but our two Indian teachers are provided for in that respect does not help the situation any and has in the past provided much room for discussion amongst the natives.\n\nHowever, to aggravate Mrs. White's problem, her sister's husband died recently and she and her three children have been forced to return with the mother to live. They have no means of support and another child is expected shortly. Which means that in such a small home, Mrs. White will have to get out. There is no suitable vacancy existing in an Indian home within reasonable distance from the school where she can stay. There is a small house owned by Johnny Thompson just across the NYC tracks off the highway. This house is rented but Mr. Thompson advises he would rent it to us to supply accommodation for one or two teachers at $12.00 per month. He will, however, have to lay another floor and is agreeable to do this if he is advised in time that it will be rented as a teachers residence. We would, however, have to supply some fuel and a limited amount of furnishings and possibly a small cook stove. It would appear that whether or not Mrs. White continues to teach on Cornwall Island a residence will be needed as it is very doubtful if a lady teacher could stand the trip to Cornwall across the bridge especially during winter months, that is of course, should the idea of a teacher living in Cornwall be entertained. May I have your views on this matter at an early date.\n\nT.L. Hannah, Agent.\nOttawa, September 14, 1944.\n\nMr. I. L. Bonnah, Indian Agent, St. Regis, Que.\n\nRe: Teacher's Residence,\nCornwall Island School\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 8th instant and have noted with interest the suggestion submitted therein.\n\nIn view of all the circumstances, I am disposed to recommend that the house owned by Johnny Thompson be rented as a teacherage, provided that the rent asked by Thompson is in your judgment reasonable. It may be necessary also, as you state, to supply certain furnishings. A list of these, with the approximate cost, should be submitted in due course. Care should be taken, of course, to see that this house is reasonably comfortable.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSNETSINGER'S HARDWARE\n\nHousehold and Builders' Hardware, G. E.

Welfare & Training,\n\nMrs. White, at the Cornwall Island West School, advises that on her requisition for supplies for the current year, she requests $20. for sewing needs and home training classes. We have not received any authorization as yet to purchase this material. Would it be possible to allot her $20. to cover her needs?\n\nThis teacher also requisitioned shades for the windows of the school, and no authorization has been received for the purchase of these shades as yet.\n\nAnything you can do about authorization for these two items will be greatly appreciated.\n\nT.L. Bonnah,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nOctober 31, 1944.\n\nMr. T.L. Bonnah, Indian Agent, St. Regis, Que.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th instant, the Department does not appear to have received a previous request for window shades for the Cornwall Island West School. However, if you consider these are necessary you may arrange for their purchase.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMr. R. A. Hody, Supt. Welfare & Training\n\nOn a recent visit to the Cornwall Island West School, Mrs. White pointed out the very unsatisfactory conditions existing with respect to storage space for school supplies. These supplies are at present piled around the room on benches and desks, which gives a littered appearance to the school, and does not protect the books and papers sufficiently. Mrs. White needs a cabinet constructed on the back wall of the school room to house these supplies.\n\nIf authorization for the construction of such a cabinet can be obtained, it could probably be done by local labor for around $35. The limited space in this school house has been forced to accommodate a much larger class than usual this year, and the supplies are accumulating to such an extent that it is difficult to find a place to operate for ordinary class work.\n\nYour early attention to this matter will be greatly appreciated.\n\nT.H.

Repairs have been made to the porches of the Cornwall Island West School, the interior of the classroom redecorated, a new toilet was also constructed. Both cloakrooms as well as an entire wall of the school had to be replastered before any decorating could be done. In the Village, the Senior room of the Village school has been redecorated, giving it a much brighter appearance.

It has been set up and minor repairs made. It cannot, however, be put in satisfactory condition and a new building will have to be constructed. As I am unable to get carpenters on the Reserve now, I would like authorization to have a toilet made up at Hodgins Lumber Co., in Cornwall and transported to the school. This would cost us in the neighbourhood of Sixty-five dollars ($65.00). I do not think we have exceeded the amount originally authorized for school repairs and the above method would be the most economical way to rectify this situation.\n\nMay we hear from you at an early date, please.\n\nT.
