The facts are as follows:\n\nOn the 7th July last Mr. McColl recommended that owing to the condition of the school house, the house belonging to the Commissioner be rented at the rate of $4.00 per month for the time the new house would commence to be used by the Indians in building the new school house. On the 25th of the same month the necessary authority was given to rent the house for the time specified.\n\nOn the 28th June last Mr. McColl reported among other things that the arrangement for buying lumber from the Fisher House Mills to be used by the Indians in building the new school house could not be carried out & the appropriation for the school having\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, 189\u2014\n\nHaving been informed out of the Estimates for 1891-92 by the Comptroller that he requested to be informed whether he might not instruct the Agent to rent a house for school purposes for a longer period than that referred to as there would be no use in sending a teacher to that school unless suitable arrangements could be made to keep the school open for more than one or two months as it is a long and expensive trip. No reply was given to this inquiry and on the 18th July last he repeated the request. On the 23rd ult. he was informed that it was understood that the school house was to have been completed by the 25th July and that the school had been in operation since the authority was given to rent the house referred to for that purpose and that the Dept. must have a report on these points before any authority could be given.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTo Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa\n\n...to rent the house for longer than 4 or 5 months. Mr. McColl has already given his reasons why the school house was not completed by that time arrangement for conveying the teacher cannot be carried out & besides the application was struck out of the Estimates for 1892 as to the School's not being in operation after the authority was given to rent the house Agent MacKay reports he had letter of the 28th March last enclosed in McColl's letter of the 16th May last that the teacher was engaged temporarily by him with the understanding that his wife would teach in his place when he was absent on duty as catechet & that he had directed the teacher to close the school at the end of April 26 & that he warned he careful in future not to interfere in the temporary absence of teachers. It will thus be seen that he ordered the School to be closed about the time...\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, 189\u2014\n\ntime he was instructed by Mr. McColl to rent the house referred to. That does not appear to be any appropriation in the estimates for the Cement near to cover the erection of a school house on this site; but there was an item of $1000 voted in last year's Estimates for repair and furniture. It goes without saying that the school should be kept in operation & the question of renting a house for school purposes until a school house can be erected is one for consideration. I would certainly recommend that the house referred to be rented at $75.00 per month until the 1st July next provided there are funds.\n\nJohn McLean\n\nIndian Affairs.

We also beg to remark that it is impossible for the school master with whom we...\nWe are well satisfied to carry out the strict observance of school rules, or an encouragement for the children to attend regularly, as they are directed.\n\nWe hope therefore that an early consideration will be taken in favor of our present desire, as we have been made to understand frequently, that a new school should be granted to us like the one at Nishnabotna Reserve and other reserves, at an early date.\n\nWe have the honor to be,\n\nYour most obedient humble servants\n\n[Signature]\nJohn X.

Under the circumstances it seems natural that the owner of the property felt justified in claiming rent for the September Quarter, which claim was duly endorsed by Mr Indian Agent Short, and forwarded in due time to the Department for payment.\n\nI may add that the arrangements for the purchase were not guaranteed by Mr Inspector McColl, who said that they were subject to the approval of the Department, and until the receipt of the cheque Mr Travers ignored that the bargain had been found satisfactory and authorized by the Department.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nIndian Commissioner.\n| Item Description                          | Quantity | Price |\n|------------------------------------------|----------|-------|\n| 6 dozen coarse knitting needles          | 10       | 60    |\n| 12 stove pipes                           | 10       | 20    |\n| Short D handle                           | 5        | 25    |\n| Bars Royal crown soap                    | 5        | 20    |\n| Cooking glass 10x12                       | 15       | 45    |\n| Steel combo                              | 15       | 35    |\n| Zinc pail                                | 15       | 30    |\n| Dust pan                                 | 15       | 30    |\n| Doz. spoons \"1/2\"                        | 15       | 40    |\n| Thimbles                                 | 15       | 50    |\n| Nat & clock hooks                        | 25       | 50    |\n| Yards wire mosquito netting              | 25       | 50    |\n| Freight prepaid                           | 100      |       |\n\nTotal: 9.00\n\nGoods supplied charged paid and just.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This covers the work of completing the Jack Head and Blood Vein River Schools.\n\nThese schools were commenced last summer and completed. The amount of the grant made in the first instance was not found to be sufficient hence an amount to complete was asked for and granted. Robinson and Company have waited until the new grant was available.\n\nWith reference to the $110.34 amount I find it is below the amount granted. Not so however with the other which is 14 Dollars higher than the Grant allowed.\n\nIf it be possible I should like to see the full amount paid as per bill and Voucher so as to settle the matter. I shall be absent from the Office for two months and thought it best to explain circumstances and ask the Department to meet the case.

He should be given to understand that his engagement is temporary and his retention will be dependent upon the success with which he meets.\n\nThe school supplies asked for will be dealt with in another communication. It is noted that a number of articles such as xxx ordinarily would be used in the school-room are not asked for.

(RG 10, Volume 6237, file 518-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES CANADA\n\nArchives Publiques\n\nPoor Copy\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. II8274/I of the 22nd ultimo requesting a report of repairs and equipment to enable the Jack Head School to be re-opened.\n\nI respectfully beg to state that the School building appears to be in need of re-plastering, whitewashing and cleaning, generally.\n\nIt will also be necessary to provide stove pipes and perhaps a new stove as the one at the Jack Head School has been thickly coated with rust for many years.\n\nThe supply of books and other equipment has been entirely destroyed by mice so that it will be necessary to furnish a full equipment for this school. I have inserted in the estimates for the fiscal year of 1920-1921 a sum of $100.00 for repairs and equipment for the Jack Head School.\n\nThere are about 35 children of school age in the Jack Head Reserve whose parents will claim are protestants but I would say most of the people at Jack Head are pagan.\n\nThere is a fair house belonging to the Church of England just outside of the northern boundary of the Jack Head reserve, which with a little repair can be made very comfortable as a residence for the teacher. It is to be hoped that a person who has had plenty of experience with Indians will be selected for the Jack Head school.\n\nNative teachers are useless.\n\nI have the honour to be your obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\nFisher River Agency.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, November 15, 1919\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, regarding the re-opening of the Jackhead Indian Day School.\n\nKindly furnish the Department with a detailed statement of the $100.00 which you state will be required for repairs and equipment. If that amount does not include the cost of purchasing a new stove and stove pipes and the residence for the teacher, you should furnish an estimate of the cost of these.\n\nIn a letter from the Bishop of Rupert's Land he states that as the season is so late it is not advisable to send a teacher to Jackhead until next spring. You will, however, be good enough to furnish the information requested in this letter as soon as possible so that whatever repairs are authorized may be attended to before the school is reopened.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nT. H. Carter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Halfway P.O.,\nMan.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6237, file 518-5, part 1)\nReferring to your letter No. 118274-1 of the 15th ultimo I respectfully beg to submit the following estimate of cost of repairs and equipment for the Jack Head Day School:\n\n- Box stove, pipes, damper, wire, roof-top and jack: $20.00\n- Plastering & whitewashing, including lime & brush: $25.00\n- Window glass, putty, nails and outside door set: $5.00\n- Equipment, including slates, pencils, readers, scribblers, reading cards, ball frame, hand bell etc.: $25.00\n- Freighting supplies to Jack Head: $35.00\n\nTotal: $110.00\n\nTo erect a residence similar to those in connection with the schools upon the Peguis Reserve would entail a cost of between $500.00 and $600.00, owing to the cost of freighting materials and the extra cost of labour which could not be obtained in the Jack Head Reserve.\n\nAs stated in my letter of the 3rd instant, there is a house belonging to the Church of England just outside of the Jack Head Reserve which could no doubt be rented for use of the teacher, but would require some repairs. Although I do not think repairs to this house would cost more than about $50.00, I could not be sure as I have not seen the interior for some years and I should judge the stoves and pipes I last saw in the house would now be worthless.\n\nThis house is situated just outside the northern line of the reserve and is less than a mile from the school.\n\nI have the honour to be your obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\nFisher River Agency.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, December 13, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant submitting an estimate of the cost of repairs and equipment required for the Jackhead Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, before authorizing this expenditure, the Department will await information from His Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land as to whether he has been able to secure the services of a teacher to begin duties next spring. His Grace is being informed that as soon as he has secured a teacher instructions will be given you to have the necessary repairs completed.\n\nI may say that the Department cannot authorize any repairs being made to the house mentioned by you as a residence for the teacher, as this building is not the property of the Department. The matter of repairs to this building will be drawn to the attention of His Grace.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nT. H. Carter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Halfway P.O., Man.\n18th December, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Mackenzie:\n\nI thank you for yours. As soon as I succeed in procuring a suitable teacher for Jack Head I will let the Department know, and give full particulars regarding him. We have at that point, I believe, a Church and a Mission House. The latter, of course, could be used by the teacher rent free, but we might need some help in putting it into better repair.\n\nI am,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F.

The\nfence needs new posts and rails so that animals can be kept\nout from the gardens. The toilets of course, should also be\nmoved. This will have to wait till the frost is out of the\nground as new pits will have to be dug.\n\nfor P G Lazenby, Indian Agent\nOttawa, March 19, 1946.\n\nMr. P. G.

(RG 10, Volume 6237, file 518-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nPoor Copy\nMr P G Lazenby  \nIndian Agent  \nHodgson Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr Lazenby:\n\nHaving regard to the psychological reactions of the pupils, as well as the reactions on the disposition of the teacher, I would say that the interior conditions of the school are far from inspiring. In fact they are rather depressing. I shall try to make the picture a bit clearer.\n\nThe school is a log structure, on cement foundation, bearded gables, shingled roof. All is good material, flooring good, and ceiling of matched lumber. Inside dimensions are: Length 30 feet width 20 feet height of wall from floor to ceiling 8 feet.\n\nThe logs are plastered along the cracks, and the whole lime washed. However, the trouble is that plaster drops out continually and lime-wash rubs off easily. The ceiling was long ago painted a dull grey, and never repainted.\n\nThere is on the West side only 40' Sq feet of window light. On the east side there is none at all. There is only 50 sq feet of black board, this on north end. There are only nine double desks, the same being in the last stages of dissolution. They hold together by the grace of fish cord bindings and fish box reinforcement. One seat consists of an empty biscuit box. To the best of my information these desks are about forty years old.\n\nI would suggest that the walls be stripped with 1x2 inch boards 2 feet apart, then lined with shiplap, a layer of building paper and the whole covered with Ten Test. On the east wall there should be at least 60 sq feet of Black board and the old black board on the North wall renewed. There should also be four transom windows high up on the east wall. This for added light and ventilation.\n\nShould the above suggested improvements receive favourable consideration, I attach for your convenience a list of approximate quantities of materials required for the work.\n\nYours faithfully\n\nGEO E JEFFERY\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept' of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI beg to forward herewith in duplicate, requisition for new desks for the Jackhead Day School, also, on a separate requisition, a new heating stove for the same school, with a copy of a letter, written by the teacher, Mr. Geo: E.Jeffery.\n\nI would strongly recommend that these two requisitions be approved.\n\nAttached also, is a list of materials, showing the estimated cost, with labour, for the repairing and improving of this school. I would recommend that the purchase of this material, and the use of the labour, for the construction be authorized. With regard to the wages of the 'Supervisor', Mr Jeffery, who is a fairly good carpenter, suggested that if he were to receive wages at the rate he is paid for teaching, he would stay there for the necessary time during the summer holidays, and supervise the work.

In former correspondence with the Department it was understood that where Boarding schools were established, the ordinary day schools would be closed unless the people were in sufficient numbers to require an adjunct of a day school. I would further remind the Department that the Norway House Reserve has from the first been supplied with missionaries and teachers solely by the Methodist Church; that there has been no complaint from the people of insufficient school and church accommodation. Under these circumstances it seems very undesirable that the people should be divided by handing over what was part of our work to the agency of another Church. If in the judgment of the Department a school at Jack River should be re-opened, I think the Methodist Church is the rightful agency to undertake the work.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nA. Sutherland\n\nGeneral Secretary\n\nThe Honorable the Super't General of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nSir,\n\nI am informed in a letter just received from the Rev John Nelson, missionary at Norway House, that the school at Jack River has been re-opened under the auspices of the Church of England, and that a grant of $300 has been made by the Department in support of the same. I beg to call the attention of the Department to the fact that the school at Jack River was conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church, but was temporarily closed, with the concurrence of the Church and the Department, on account of the dilapidated condition of the school building, and that steps were being taken with a view to locating a new building so as to accommodate all the people. At the same time it was thought that possibly the opening of a Boarding School at Norway House would afford all the additional facilities required without re-opening the school at Jack River, but that opinion was held in abeyance pending further investigation.\n\nIn regard to part of the pupils in the Jack River neighborhood, I am further informed that it has been represented to the Department that they have come from York and Churchill to Norway House, on account of the fishing industry, and that the Church of England authorities have asked for a grant because these people were without a school. So far as I am\nOTTAWA, 13th November, 1900.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant calling the attention of the Department to the statement of Rev. Mr. Nelson, missionary at Norway House, that the school at Jack River has been re-opened under the auspices of the Church of England; and in reply I beg to say that the Department has no record of any school of the name of Jack River in the Barrens River Agency. There is however, a school called Jack Head, carried on for many years under the auspices of the Church of England in the Barrens River Agency, for which a grant of $300.00 per annum has been paid.\n\nIf the school to which you refer is known by any other name, kindly advise the Department and further enquiries will be made in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

He was advised that the Department had no record of any school at Jack River in the Berens River Agency but that the Church of England had a school at Jack Head, and he was asked to state whether the school to which he referred was known by any other name.

Mr Scott tells me that the Commissioner's estimates for next year include a $300 grant for a Church of England day school on the Norway House Reserve. As this is the first intimation the Department has had of the establishment of such a school I think it might be well to ask the Commissioner for further particulars, as this Reserve has always looked upon as the field of the Methodist Missionary Society.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Please let me know the facts in regard to this. It should not be done as the Reserve has been under the charge of the Methodist Church for a great many years, and it will simply result in disputes if the Episcopal Church is permitted to put a school within a few miles of Norway House.

Dr. Sutherland, General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society, against the re-opening of this school under the auspices of the Church of England with the usual Government grant. By direction of the Deputy Minister the Indian Commissioner was asked to report as to the necessity for providing for the salary of a teacher to carry on a school under the Church of England.

Mr. Burman of Winnipeg was informed on the 21st March last that it would not be possible to pay until after the estimates were passed, what additional outside treaty schools carried on by the Church of England would be entitled to receive a grant, and he has not since been communicated with in this matter.

But I think that if you will read the application of the Bishop of Moosonee for the grant above referred to, you will see that he had no intention of entering the field in opposition to the Methodists. The Indians for whose benefit he wishes a school established are non-treaty and have always belonged to the Church of England, and although he mentions the locality by\nthe name of Norway House, that title is merely given to designate the neighborhood, as you will see by reference to the map showing Treaty 5, you will see that the boundaries of that Treaty extend only some thirty miles east of the Norway House Reserve.\n\nThe Methodists still have two schools in this district, Rossville and Norway House which are inside treaty and have lately applied for two more schools in this neighborhood, outside treaty.\n\nIt is a difficult matter to fix the exact position of any place in this unsettled region, as the same locality is called by different names by different people.\n\nI think it well that you should have this additional information before you, although I did not feel called upon to make it official.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This school is at Jack River, 6 miles from the Rossville School. There is a school population of 60 of whom 37 are on the roll, the average for Mch. quarter as shown by enclosed return, having been 21.55. This is good for the opening quarter.\n\nThe school has been in operation since last fall at the expense of the church in a building built in the rough by the Indians themselves, and finished by the Church, which has also found such furnishing and supplies as have been available. I believe good work has been done by the teacher, Mr. Hart, as no doubt the Agent, who has visited the school can report. Mr. Hart has also done good in other ways. He has ministered to Indians in sickness (partly with medicines given him by Rev. Mr. Nelson) and when he last wrote mentioned having vaccinated 52 children.\n\nRecently fire partly destroyed the roof of the building, but Mr. Hart repaired it and the work goes on as usual.\n\nI think the above facts warrant my asking respectfully for the renewal of the grant which we were unable to claim during the year for which it was made.\n\nTrusting you may see your way to recommend this.\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n(Sgd) Wm.

You will find that upon the request of the Bishop of Moosonee, $300.00 had been provided for such a school in the supplementary estimates for 1900-1901. Afterwards Rev. Dr. Sutherland protested against the establishment of this school, the Methodist Church considering the ground as its own. The result was that the provision for this institution was dropped.\n\nLast June Rev. Mr. Burman on behalf of the new Diocese of Keewatin made a further request for provision for this school, a copy of which is enclosed.\n\nThe school has been in actual operation for some time and returns have been sent in to this office and were not forwarded to Ottawa as there were no funds available for the payment of the grant. The returns showed an average attendance of 21.55 for the March quarter - total enrollment of 37, out of whom 13 are regular treaty Indians, the others non-treaty halfbreeds.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\"is not entitled to the support which the Department\n\"is not entitled to the support which the Departmen\n\"is accustomed to give to schools of this class.

W.A. Burman, in reference to the establishment of a Church of England school, for the instruction of the Indian and Half Breed children at Jack River or Play Green Lake.\n\nAs you will observe by consulting the map that the children of this district, who number about seventy-five, would have to go fully six miles to attend the present school, which I understand is of the Methodist Denomination.\n\nThey would also have to cross three rivers or bays to make this trip.\n\nPlease return this letter with your views upon the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6237, file 519-1, part 1)\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 26th March, 1903.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nWith reference to the application submitted by Mr McCreary, M.P., for the recognition of a Church of England day school for the instruction of Indian and half-breed children at Jack River or Playgreen Lake in the Heren's River Agency, I beg to say that the Church of England has a day school in operation there which the Indian Commissioner states is successfully conducted and regularly attended by treaty as well as non-treaty Indians.\n\nMr Agent Semmens, who visited this school last month reports that a new schoolhouse was built last summer by the Indians, assisted by a carpenter brought from Selkirk, and that they have a fine schoolhouse. There were 11 children present on the day he visited the school and it was quite up to the standard of the other schools in this Agency.\n\nAs you will see in my memo. of the 4th Nov. last, provision was at one time made for this school, but no payments were ever made as the Methodists protested against its recognition. The school is situated in the Norway House district, which they claim as their mission field. Mr Agent Semmens, however, who is a Methodist minister, considers that a school doing such good work is entitled to the support of\nthe Department. My memorandum was submitted to the Deputy Minister, who sent it on to the Superintendent General. His decision then was \"Nothing at present\".\n\nRev. Mr. Burman points out that it is impossible for the children attending this school to go to the one at Rossville, owing to the distance (about six miles) with long stretches of water to be crossed.\n\nThe Church of England apparently has a footing at Jack River and it seems to me that Mr. Semmen's favorable report on the school should override the objection of the Methodists to its recognition.\n\nThis is one of the schools for which the Bishop of Keewatin lately applied for a grant, but without success.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

However, the grant for this school has been continued in the Estimates and is provided for in the current year and for next year also. A return was received from this school for Dec. quarter last; none having been received for over a year previously and as Mr Sutherland, who has charge of the payments, finding the money available in the estimates, prepared a requisition for the amount shown to be earned by the return, and a Cheque for $52.27 was sent the teacher.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6237, file 519-1, part 1)\nThe trouble about this school has originated in the similarity of the names of Jack Head and Jack River, which are one and the same place. The Methodists have abandoned their school and the Ch. of England wishes to continue theirs. The Department has made provision for the Methodist children by making a grant to the Norway House Boarding school which has a day school attachment, called Rossville.\n\nThe physical formation of the country renders it necessary that there should be a day school at Jack River, and as the Ch. of England has been there for such a length of time I think it would be only right that they should receive the grant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Wilkins, Esq.,\n680 Ellice Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nSecretary.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been away in Hudson's Bay all Summer visiting our Schools and Missions, and only returned a short time ago.\n\nIn reply to your letter of August 25th to the Rev. A. A. Adams I was simply amazed to learn that Mr. C. Wilkins had been paid the Quarterly Grant to the Jack River school for the June quarter. Mr. Wilkins had already been paid in full to the end of July. Mr. Wilkins was engaged by us as school teacher and Catechist, and his Salary was paid by us, the Grant for the school being paid to us as part of his Salary. I cannot understand how the Dept would pay him this on his own request without consulting us, and I am obliged respectfully to claim the Grant for the June quarter, having already paid this to Mr. Wilkins. It rests of course with the Dept to deal with Mr. W., but there can be no doubt that he can be dealt with for obtaining money under false pretenses having already received his full quarters Salary at the rate of $400 a year.\n\nOur reason for dismissing Mr. Wilkins was that for some time his work both as school teacher and Catechist has been very unsatisfactory, and we found it quite impossible to keep him in our service. I could say a great deal more but this is I think quite sufficient.\nThe school work at Jack River has been carried on since the end of June by Mr. W. Malin, a third year Wycliffe Student, fully qualified to teach school; he is leaving there about the end of September, and I have been trying to get another teacher for the Winter, but so far have not succeeded and the school may have to be closed for the Winter.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you as to what step the Dept will take about Mr. Wilkins, meanwhile I trust the Dept will pay over to us the Grant for the June quarter.

When you meet with such you expect them as head in the Church.\nTo be more Christian-like & more Christ-like; Bishop Lofthouse had no right to have received this money at any time does he think that any man could live & find everything himself for a salary $400 & do the work of School & Church for that amount especially in the North where everything is so expensive & he himself live in luxury upon his thousands, & say what I only want my rights & justice which I never got while working for Lofthouse.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I explained matters to her and asked her to request her husband to call upon me when he returned home. This he did and gave me a long explanation of the transaction. I asked him to write me his explanation, and herewith inclose same for your information.\n\nMy first letter to him was returned to me by the Dead Letter Office, as he had moved from his old address. This same letter I handed to him when he visited my office so that he might thoroughly understand his position as taken by our Department and could reply intelligently.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nDear Sir,\n\nOn Oct. 13th I received a letter from Mr. Stewart, the Assistant Secretary re Mr. C. Wilkins late school teacher at Jack River, to whom the Dept. paid $75 for the same quarter without any authority from us. Mr. Wilkins had already received his salary in full from us. This sum of $75 should be refunded the Office of Reclamation, as Mr. W. was in our employ, not the Departments. The grant was due to us not to him.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Wilkins is in possession of money that he did not earn and he is in honour bound to refund it to the Department. He admits having received from Bishop Lofthouse $133.00 for four months, which paid him his full salary to the 30th of June last. When he sent in his return for the June quarter with a request that payment be made direct to him he suppressed the information that he had already been paid for that period by the Bishop. The Department would like to know if there is any prospect of its obtaining this amount from Mr. Wilkins without taking legal proceedings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nS.

Wilkins as teacher of the Jack River school for the June quarter, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is at present in communication with Mr. Wilkins. In a letter recently received from him he states that he should have been paid by Your Lordship up to September 25, last, and also that he showed to Your Lordship the remarks made upon his quarterly return, asking that the salary for the June quarter be paid direct to him.\n\nWhen a reply is had to an official letter sent by the Department to one of its Inspectors on the 26th inst., you will be again communicated with.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRight Rev. J. Lefthouse, D.D.,\nBishop of Kenora,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nSecretary.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to thank you for your letter of Nov 29th re Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Wilkins was engaged by us subject to a three months notice from any time. In April last I sent him such notice which he acknowledged receiving on the 1st of May. His full stipend was paid up to the end of July. Even if he could claim another three months after June 30, he was not justified in drawing $75 from you. This would only be $45 if what was due him if he had any claims he is at liberty to sue us for it.\n\nRe his statement that he showed me his quarterly returns, this is absolutely false. I left Norway House on the 19th of June, his statement, of which I have had a copy, was made up, or dated July 1st, and I never saw it until my return to Norway House on Sept. 3rd. I never saw Mr. W. after the 19th June.\n\nHe had no authority to draw this $75, and the Department had no authority to pay it to him as he was not really in the employ of the Dept. The grant was made to the School, not to the teacher.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

He is willing, at least for a year to carry on the school work, so I shall be glad if you will sanction this appointment.

File 160,370-17E.\n\nANGELICAN SCHOOL:\n\nAt Norway House the Anglican school in charge of the Rev J. Marshall is doing good work. The buildings are in fair condition, new seats have been put in and Mr Marshall is very much interested in his work and anxious to make a success. Whether the building belongs to the Anglican Mission Association or to the Government I am unable to say. As is the case with all the other schools in this district there are times in the year when it is impossible for pupils to attend the school owing to the ice forming upon the river and lakes or at the breaking up of the ice. Another great drawback to regular attendance is the custom of travelling away in the winter time to their hunting grounds with parents or to the regular fishing grounds in the summer. As you are well aware of these circumstances you will be able to understand the great drawback this is to the successful education of Indian children in the ordinary day schools.\n\nX X X\n\nyour obedient servant\nC.C. Calverley\nAgent\nOttawa, March 2, 1912.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nIn June, 1910, the Department approved of the appointment of Rev. J. F. J. Marshall as teacher of the Jack River school, the salary to be at the rate of $500.00 per annum.\n\nFour quarterly returns were received from Mr. Marshall and there have now come to hand returns for the quarters ending September 30th and December 31st, 1911. These are signed by Mabel Marshall as teacher. Before payment of the grant can be made to Your Lordship I have to ask you to be good enough to state whether any change has been made at the school and, if so, what qualifications are possessed by Miss Marshall, who is evidently in charge. This information is necessary before payment of the amount of the grant can be made.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev.

I think it possible that Mrs Marshall may have made out the school reports and signed her name without thinking.\n\nMr Marshall was married in the Summer, and Mrs M. did not reach Jack River until the end of August, so she could not have taken the whole of the September quarter. I do not think she took the Dec quarter, but have no means of knowing. I will write.\n\nHowever if Mrs Marshall did take the school, there is only an irregularity, as Mrs M. is a fully qualified teacher, and taught in Toronto for several years before her marriage. She would therefore be as good, or better than her husband for this work.\n\nI trust this explanation will be satisfactory to you, and that the Grants will be paid.\n\nBelieve me Sincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We are somewhat perplexed as to the reason for this, and should be obliged if you could advise us on the matter. We are aware that Mrs. F.E. Marshall gave up her work as teacher last summer, but we are advised by the Rev. J.F.J. Marshall the missionary in charge, that he secured a teacher for this school with Second Class Certificate.

The most suitable property is being used by the Church and they may have title. This matter should be looked into before building operations are commenced.\n\nMiss E.B. Wood is the incumbent but Rev.

They are prepared to transfer a site for the new school building, which should be erected early in 1924.\n\nRev. Mr. Marshall, the Missionary, is, to my personal knowledge, a competent carpenter and builder, and, when arrangements are being made for the new structure, I believe it will be well to have it done by day labour, with him as foreman.

The average attendance of non-treaty pupils is 9.7 and of Treaty 7.56. It would appear that the Provincial Dept. of Education should bear a larger proportion of the cost of this school than they do at present. I understand that said Department give a Grant of $200 per year to assist in paying the salary of the teacher, while the Indian Department and the Anglican Mission provide practically everything else. I do not think the Indian Department is paying too much, but I think the non-treaty people should do more for themselves.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Asst.

The Provincial Department gives a grant of $200 per year for this activity, and as one-half of the enrolment are non-treaty children, the Department considers that some of the capital expense should be borne by the Province, and perhaps more of the current expense.

If you could make a suggestion as to how I might assist you, I should be glad to give it my careful consideration and to help in the matter.\n\nAs to the Grant given by the Provincial Department, this might well be taken up, the facts being as stated by you. I will confer with Rev. J.F.J. Marshall concerning the matter. I am away from home now attempting to interest our people in Eastern Canada in Indian and Eskimo work and will be exceedingly busy in that behalf until the end of March.\n\nPlease do not hesitate to let me know what concerted overtures you consider ought be made to Dr. Fletcher.\n\nMost faithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

On receipt of these particulars her Permanent Second Class Professional Certificate would be issued to her.\n\nI expect that Miss Ross has been out of touch with our work, and this is probably the reason for her not having obtained her Permanent Second Class Professional Certificate.

Walter, Jack River, Norway House, following a wireless message of the 13th ult., intimating that Miss Cathcart, the teacher there, had been compelled to leave on account of illness. I understand that Miss Verna Blackford has been teaching at the school temporarily, but only as a stop-gap as she had to give up teaching on account of ill health.\n\nIt is going to be difficult to secure a teacher just now for the balance of the year especially as it involves expensive travel by dog team. I have suggested that Mr. Walter might, if necessary to keep school going while I am seeking a new teacher, himself give at least part time to teaching; I trust this will meet with the approval of the Department. I am also writing to the Education Department of Manitoba which shares in providing the teacher's salary.\n\nWith all kind regards,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nMost faithfully yours,\n\nMr. Russell T.

The amount of stipend to be granted would differ in their cases, however, and would also depend upon the amount of school activity. When each quarterly report is forwarded, the Department will give consideration to the grant that can be allowed.

Walter, Jack River Anglican Mission, writes the Department nominating the services of Mrs. W. Gall as teacher of the Jack River Anglican Indian Day School to succeed Miss E. Finlayson, who decided not to remain. He states Mrs. Gall has a second class permanent certificate for the province of Manitoba and that she has also been approved by the Manitoba Department of Education. I shall be pleased if you will inform the Department if the appointment of Mrs. Gall meets with your approval.\n\nMr. Walter has also requested that, in order to save time, cheques in payment of the teacher's salary be sent direct to him and that he could then endorse and hand them to the teacher. As you are aware, cheques have been made payable to the Diocese of Keewatin and sent to you. I shall be pleased to have your views regarding this request.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRt. Rev. A. D. Dewdney, D.D.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nBishopstowe,\nKenora, Ont.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nIn reply to yours of the 10th inst., I beg to say that I approve of the appointment of Mrs. W. Gall as teacher of the Jack River Anglican Indian Day School in succession to Miss E. Finlayson.\n\nWith regard to Mr. Walter's request that, in order to save time, cheques in payment of the teacher's salary be sent direct to him and that he could then endorse and hand them to the teacher, there are several reasons why I think it advisable to make a change in procedure in this regard. In the first place as you are aware it is found advisable often that the missionary should be also the teacher, in which case the salary from the Department is only a portion of the stipend of the missionary who receives his full stipend each quarter out of Diocesan funds, the Department's cheque acting as a refund for payments already made. While there is no likelihood of a change in this regard in the near future, should the present missionary be changed it would be a very likely action if we could get a qualified missionary as teacher, especially in view of the fact that the teacher has to live with the missionary.\n\nIn the second place as you are aware the school in Indian missions is under the church carrying on the mission and is part of the missionary administration and is so recognized by the Department. The fact that the salary is paid by the Department through the Diocesan authorities rather than through the local missionary makes this plain to the teacher, and constitutes an important link between the Church authorities, the Department, and the teacher.\n\nI have written to Mr. Walter with regard to the third point, the saving of time, that this would be better accomplished if the teacher would open an account in a bank to which the salary should be sent as the chief delay is caused by the remoteness of the school from banking facilities, and also for six months of the year from a Post Office, other than the isolated Post Office at Norway House.\n\nFor these reasons I think a change is inadvisable.\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes\nActing Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 4, 1932.\n\nRev.

Lazenby\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.,\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that on the 13th instant I inspected the Jack River Church of England Indian Day School.\n\nThis is a combined school, there being 36 pupils on the roll, 18 of which are Indian, and 18 non-Indian. All 36 pupils were present on the day of my visit, and the register was marked up to date.\n\nThe teacher, Miss Evelyn Hope, is efficient, and with the exception of one pupil who appears to be mentally sub-normal, teacher and pupils are making good progress.\n\nThere is a shortage of pupils' desks at this school, and several of the pupils were sitting on upturned biscuit boxes, and using desks improvised from biscuit boxes and old boards. It was noticeable that the pupils who are sitting on the biscuit boxes were physically tired before the close of the school day, and under such circumstances they cannot be expected to do good work. This also reflects on the teacher, as she cannot possibly get as good results from such pupils. There are, however, sufficient desks to accommodate the strictly Indian pupils. I am of the opinion that one of three policies should be adopted in connection with this school, namely: Provide eight or ten new double desks; limit the pupilage to about 20 to 24; or exclude all non-Indian children.\n\nI understand that the Manitoba Provincial Government makes a grant for this school, yearly, though what the amount of the grant is, I do not know, but I believe it is not very much. If it is desired to continue the school as at present, and accommodate these non-Indian children, I think the Provincial Government be approached with a view to having them bear at least a fair portion of the cost of new desks.\n\nThe inside walls of this school would be much the better for either painting or lime-washing, to brighten the room up.

He stated there were 36 pupils on the roll, 18 of whom are Indian and 18, non-Indian - all being present on the date of his visit.\n\nThe Agent states there is a shortage of pupils' desks and that a number of the pupils were using desks improvised from biscuit boxes and old boards. There were, however, sufficient desks to accommodate the strictly Indian pupils, but eight or ten new double desks are required for the non-Indian pupils.\n\nThis Department understands that your Department makes a grant towards teacher's salary. It is considered, as the desks are required for the non-Indian pupils, your Department might provide the number required or bear at least a fair portion of the cost. I shall be pleased to hear, at your convenience, if your Department will be prepared to provide the extra desks required.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDr. Robert Fletcher, B.A., LL.D.,\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Education,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

Of these, there were present 6 treaty Indian pupils, and 11 non treaty pupils.

There was but one non treaty pupil absent.\n\nTwo registers are kept, one for treaty Indian pupils, and the other for non treaty pupils. Both these registers were well kept and marked up to date.\n\nThe appearance of all the pupils was good. They were well clothed, and clean.\n\nThe school building, and its equipment were in good condition, excepting for rather dirty walls inside, which I would recommend kalsomining. This would greatly improve the appearance of the room, and brighten the place up.\n\nThe pupils, and the teacher Miss Evelyn Cope, are doing good work, and the pupils' work shows some improvement. The reading of the non treaty children was good, but that of the treaty Indian children was poor. The teacher however, informed me that the best of the treaty pupils were among the absent ones.

There were two pupils doing grade 8 work, and their work was commendable.\n\nThe teacher is Mr Alan B Cheales, and both he and the pupils present showed keen interest in their work, and progress was noticeable, especially in the higher classes.\n\nThis is a 'Combined' school, and comes partially under the jurisdiction of the Provincial Board of Education. The teacher, however, had but one register of attendance; of the type used by the public schools. The treaty Indian pupils were registered in this, as well as the non-treaty.

The schoolroom itself was untidy and very dusty, which, as the teacher Mr. Alan Cheales explained was due to the fact that it had not yet been properly cleaned up since the Christmas concert.\n\nReading aloud, by all the grades was very creditable, the pupils speaking out quite distinctly.\n\nThe book work, and work at the blackboard was fairly good; the book work being the better both in accuracy and neatness.\n\nThe teacher, Mr. Alan Cheales appears to be very interested in his work, and thorough in his teaching.\n\nA number of the Indian pupils had lost some school days of late, owing to sickness.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nP.G.

However, neither of them would act for him.\n\nThe young man he has secured, as he states in the enclosed letter, is Mr John Sunde, who has just completed his second year at Manitoba university. He however, has not taken a normal course, and is not a qualified school teacher. When Mr Cheales suggested to me that Mr Sunde take the school during his absence, I said that as Mr Sunde was not a qualified school teacher, I could not, on behalf of the Department, authorize the substitution, without first taking the matter up with the Department. However, as there was no possibility of doing this, and receiving a reply from the Department in time, Mr Cheales took the matter into his own hands and secured Mr Sunde's services during his absence in Winnipeg, to be ordained as a Deacon.\n\nWill you kindly advise me if the Department will approve of the action taken by Mr Cheales.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

He further advises that Mr. Cheales devotes most of his time to teaching halfbreed children. Actually these are not our responsibility and Mr. Hamilton has been instructed to confer with the Provincial Education Department with a view to ascertaining what assistance they are giving in the conducting of this school. If the suggestion of Mr. Cheales were approved it would mean that we would have another residential school at Jack River. On first consideration it looks quite easy to house 10 or 12 children in the building to which Mr. Cheales refers but many complications would immediately arise if such a programme were adopted.\n\nTaking everything into consideration the Department, at the present time, is extremely unfavourable to this proposal.\n\nIf you consider it advisable we might provide a small amount to serve a midday meal for the Treaty Indian children but the difficulty in this matter is that the Department does not consider itself responsible for supplying a midday meal for all the children who attend this school and there might be trouble if the Treaty Indian children were served a meal and the halfbreed children did\n\nP.

I am informed by Dr. Fletcher that the Provincial Government did supply the desks mentioned in your letter, they also give a grant of $2.00 per day for 5 months or 160 days and this is paid direct to the teacher. Dr. Fletcher points out that this school is operated in an unorganized school district and they are not prepared to incur any further expense. I have suggested supplying a noon-day meal but Dr. Fletcher said that as far as his Department were concerned this would not be possible as this procedure is not carried out in any other rural school. The estimates provided 600 pounds of Eskimo Biscuits for this school and if the Department saw fit this might be supplemented by giving the children a drink of hot cocoa along with the biscuits. However, in view of the large number of half-breed children, I am not prepared to recommend the expense necessary to provide a noon-day meal.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G.

In view of the large number of half-breed children in attendance at this particular school, it is exceedingly difficult to decide just what action should be taken by this Department.\n\nThere is available for the school this year Eskimo biscuits to the extent of 600 lbs. and I can see no serious objection to your suggestion that, in addition to the biscuits, a drink of cocoa should be provided. You might make arrangements for the purchase of this cocoa, locally. These supplies are provided on the distinct understanding that they are for the use of Indian children and Indian children only. It would be in my judgment a rather serious matter if a report got around that the Federal Government was providing noonday lunches for half-breed children anywhere in the northern sections of the prairie provinces.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nNorway House, Man.\n18th September, 1939.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to Mr Philip Phelan's letter, No.123-7-1, of the 1st August last, I beg to say that I have advised Mr Cheales, the teacher of the Jack River C. of E. Combined Day School, by letter, that the Department does not approve of his suggestion for keeping 10 or 12 pupils of the School at the Mission.\n\nWith reference to the matter of a midday meal at this School, I may say that biscuits, cocoa, and condensed milk have been supplied for several years past for this purpose, and the teacher has been instructed that these supplies are to be used for treaty Indian children only.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. G. Lazenby\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nPGL/FB\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa, Can.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nIf such can possibly be arranged it is necessary that I go to Winnipeg during the Christmas holiday. Circumstances would not permit my going by plane; however, thus as I have no horse, I plan to drive to Wabowden Station, and thence by the Hudson Bay Rly. This journey will require at least six days travel for the round trip; then I would like to have about six days in Winnipeg. It would mean two weeks leave.\n\nNow, if you would please approve of such, I could leave here on Dec. 25 after holding our Sunday service and I would arrive back here by Sunday Jan. 7.\nI note by your outline of \"Teaching Days\" that school is scheduled to open on Wednesday Jan. 3, 1940. Now by special request I'm asking you if you would kindly permit me to table those three extra days i.e. Jan 3, 4, and 5, holidays and rather than open school on Jan 3 (the middle of the week) I would then re-open it on Monday, Jan. 8.\n\nThe attendance for the first few days after Christmas is always poor, to say the least, and from my experience in past years, I'm sure that I'd have few attending for the last three days of that week. Then, with your approval, I could, if necessary make up the three days between Christmas and June by teaching on the odd Saturday.\n\nKindly let me know by return mail if you can possibly allow me these three days.\n\nVery truly yours,\nRev. C. B. Charles\nMissionary Teacher.\nNorway House, Man:\n12th October 1939.\n\nSir,\n\nAt the request of Mr A.B.Cheales, teacher of the Jack River C of E Combined Day School, I beg to forward herewith a letter he has addressed to the Department, in which he requests permission to take an extra three days holiday at Christmas, for the purpose of going to Winnipeg.\n\nPersonally, I see no objection to this, provided he makes up the three days teaching before the close of the academic year.\n\nKindly advise me if the Department approves of Mr Cheales' request.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nP.G.Lazenby\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.:\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, October 25, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant, you may allow Mr. A. B. Cheales, teacher of the Jack River Combined School, three days' extra holidays at Christmas. It is understood that he will make up the days lost later in the quarter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. P. G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward herewith the teacher's return for the September quarter, for the Jack River C of E Combined School.\n\nThis return shows a very poor enrollment and attendance for this quarter, as compared with an enrollment of 12 and an average attendance of 8.5 for the same quarter last year.\n\nWith reference to Departmental letter 123-7-1 of August 1st last, it is noted that Mr Inspector A.G. Hamilton had been instructed to confer with the Provincial Education Department with a view to ascertaining what assistance they are giving in the conducting of this school, and if the Department has this information now on hand, a check might be made as to whether or not the Provincial authorities are bearing a fair share of the cost of operating this school. The average attendance for the whole of the last academic year, was only 5.64.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.,\nEXD.\nA.\nOttawa,\nDecember 29, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of October 17, which has just reached the Department, in connection with the September return of the Jack River C.E. Combined School.\n\nAs you remark in your letter the attendance at this school was very poor during the September quarter. Has the attendance increased during the December quarter? Please make inquiries with a view to advising me the exact number of Indian children and non-Indian children enrolled at this school during the December quarter.\n\nFor your information I may say that Inspector Hamilton interviewed the Department of Education at Winnipeg last summer but was unable to obtain any assurance that the Provincial authorities would make a larger grant than they are making at the present time.\n\nYou might also state if the attendance of Indian children is likely to increase at this school. If not the Department would hardly be justified in continuing its grant for the small number of Indian children mentioned in your letter. When your reply is received it may be necessary for us to intimate to the Department of Education that unless they increase their allowance to this school and thereby enable us to reduce our payment in view of the small number of Indian children this Department will find it necessary to discontinue all payments to the Jack River C.E. School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. P. G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Mr R.A.Hoey's letter No; 123-7-1 of the 29th December, in connection with the small average attendance, during the September quarter, at the Jack River C of E Combined School.\n\nIn reply, I may say that during the December quarter, the average attendance increased to 7.89, from 2.26 for the September quarter. This average attendance of 7.89, is the highest it has been during the past calendar year, but the average attendance for the whole year, from Jan: 1st to Dec: 31st 1939, is only 4.58.\n\nDuring the December quarter, there were on the roll, 12 Indian pupils, and 27 non-Indian pupils.\n\nThe Anglican Community here is small, comprising 32 families, consisting of 121 individuals, 25 of whom are of school age, and several of those of school age are enrolled at the Norway House Residential School at present. These figures are taken from the Census, taken last treaty time, and would, I think, indicate that the attendance of Indian children at the C of E School is not likely to increase very much. By far the greater part of the teacher's time is devoted to the teaching of non-Indian pupils, as there are more than twice as many of them.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nP.G.Lazenby\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa,\nApril 13, 1940.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of August 9, 1939, in connection with the Jack River C. E. Combined School.\n\nSince that time we have been in communication with Indian Agent Lazenby regarding this school and it has been found that the average attendance of Indian children in the calendar year 1939 was only 4.58.\n\nThis small attendance does not warrant our allowing the school the amount of $650.00 a year and consequently you should inform the Provincial Government authorities that it is our intention to discontinue paying grant at the above rate on June 30, 1940.\n\nAfter that date if any Indian children attend this school the Department will be prepared to consider allowing a per capita rate of $20.00 a year each based on their average attendance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Apparently they have used over a thousand dollars a year to operate --- our grant has been $360.00. On enrolment basis the per capita then has been approximately $27.00, and the per capita cost on the average attendance has been just a little over $41.00.\n\nThis school is not an organized school district under this Department at all. We have in its vicinity the School District of Norway House under an Official Trustee, Mr. Stevenson, who collects taxes from the property owners in the area. All we can do is to continue to treat Jack River school as we do all these isolated groups of children; namely, assist the children on a daily grant basis. The daily grant will be limited to about $2.50 a day.\n\nIt is obvious that the Dominion was paying more than its share of the cost of operating this school, but the new rate of $20.00 per capita on an average attendance basis is less than half of the cost of last year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.K. ROGERS (signed)\n\nCKR/MB\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter 123-7-1 dated April 13th and now enclose copy of one received from Mr. C. K. Rogers, Chief Administrative Officer.\n\nYou will note that the receipts obtained, under the proposed plan, will amount to about $450.00. No doubt the Church of England Bishop for the district will find it more difficult to secure a teacher. I presume the Department has advised His Grace concerning the proposed change.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G.

Combined School\nNo. 519\n\nAt the present time payment at the rate of $65.00 a month is being made to the teacher of this school. This payment should be discontinued at the end of June, 1940.\n\nCommencing September 1, 1940, it has been decided to only allow a total amount of $175.00 for the academic year 1940-41.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nFor some years past the Department has been allowing an amount of $650.00 toward the salary of the teacher of the Jack River C.E. Combined School.\n\nDue to the fact that our appropriation for the current fiscal year has been drastically reduced it is necessary for us to survey our expenditures very carefully. In reviewing the returns received from the Jack River C.E. School it is found that the average attendance of Indian children during the calendar year 1939 was only 4.58. Under these circumstances the amount allowed by this Department is greater than the attendance warrants. As a matter of fact Inspector Hamilton has been in communication with the Department of Education at Winnipeg and in a letter written to Mr. Hamilton it was stated that \"It is obvious that the Dominion was paying more than its share of the cost of operating this school\". The Department wishes to deal fairly with all parties concerned but, as pointed out above, expenditures must be reduced and consequently it has been decided that for the academic year 1940-41 we can only allow an amount of $175.00 toward the salary of the teacher at this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRt.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare Training,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe: Jack River C.E. Combined School.\n\nYours with reference to the above school to hand.\n\nWe had already been advised that the school year for all Indian Day Schools was to be reduced to nine months, thus rather seriously affecting the income of missionary-teachers in those schools, hence it was with some alarm that I learned from you that the salary of the teacher at Jack River for the academic year 1940-41 was to be more seriously affected in that the Department would allow only $175.00 as against $650.00 formerly paid towards salary.\n\nI was not aware that the average attendance of Indian children at this school stood at the low figure of 4.58; the report for the Fiscal Year ending March 31st, 1939 shows the average for this school as 7, hence there must have been a falling off in the meantime.\n\nOwing to our severely strained financial circumstances your decision to thus reduce the grant greatly imperils our work at Jack River, although it does seem that the Department has being paying more than its share of the cost of this school in view of the small attendance of Indian children. I hesitate to plead for re-consideration, but it would be much appreciated if such could be done, and the amount allowed for 1940-41 be increased.\n\nWould you suggest that the Department of Education of the Province of Manitoba be approached as to the possibility of an increased grant, seeing they agree that your Department has been paying more than its share?\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoey,\nDirector of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWe have had a letter from Bishop Lofthouse of Kenora re Jack River school at Norway House. In making application for additional assistance for this district to enable them to operate for the coming academic year, I have been advised that the grant from your Branch has been cut from $650.00 to $75.00. As you know this school has no official status with this Department. We have been allowing $2.00 a day for 160 days a year which is the limit we have been paying to schools of this type. Bishop Lofthouse's request brings up the whole problem of the half-breed schools scattered along the northern lakes.\n\nWe understand that the cut in the grant from your Branch has been made because of the small number of Indians attending. We should appreciate having your comments on this situation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC.K. Rogers\n\nCKR/KM\nOttawa, August 12, 1940.\n\nRe: Jack River Day School.\n\nDear Mr. Rogers:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 8th instant, in which you seek additional information with respect to the grant allowed by this Branch to the Jack River Combined Day School.\n\nA report received by this Department from Inspector Hamilton, dated January 17, 1940, indicates that the average attendance of Indian children at this school amounted to 4.58. At that time we were allowing a grant of $650.00 a year to this school and, in addition, were purchasing annually a supply of Eskimo biscuits and cocoa for the Indian pupils.\n\nOur estimates this year have been drastically reduced, with the result that all Indian schools in the Dominion will operate this year on a 9 month rather than a 10 month basis. It will not be possible, therefore, for us to increase our allowance to the Jack River School.\n\nThe matter of providing education for half-breed children is one that has been reviewed from time to time, particularly by the educational authorities in Alberta, but so far no definite decision has been reached. The term \"Half-breed\" in my judgment is somewhat unfortunate. The inhabitants of Canada are either citizens in the usual sense that we speak of citizens or Indians as defined by\n\nC. K. Rogers, Esq.,\nChief Administrative Officer,\nDepartment of Education,\nLegislative Buildings,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nthe Indian Act. The appropriations voted by Parliament from year to year are voted on the distinct understanding that the money so voted will be used for the education and general welfare of the Indian population. Payments made by the Branch from time to time are carefully reviewed by the Treasury officials, with the object of determining if these expenditures have been made in conformity with the provisions of the Indian Act and the wishes of Parliament. This procedure is in striking contrast to the procedure followed in the old days, prior to the organization of the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. In those days the Dominion Government scarcely ever differentiated between Indian children and half-breed children living the Indian mode of life on reserves. Since I entered the Department, however, definite instructions have been received from the office of the Minister that the education of Indian children as defined by the Indian Act, and Indian children alone, is the responsibility of the Dominion Government.\n\nI appreciate very fully, of course, that these comments are not likely to prove very helpful to you in your attempts to keep the Jack River School open and in operation. In view of the fact, however, that it appears impossible for us to increase our grant, the only suggestion I can make is that consideration be given to the desirability of reducing still further the annual operating period of the school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.

Combined School.\n\nI have recently returned from an official visit to our mission of Jack River, Norway House where I met and discussed both the Church and School work with our missionary-teacher, the Rev. A. B. Chelles and with his people, urging the latter among other things to send their children to school.\n\nMy latest first hand information proves beyond doubt the insufficiency of the combined grant to provide for this school. I have taken up the matter with the Dept. of Education of the Province of Manitoba, but their regulations do not permit them to increase their grant, which consists of $2.00 per day for 160 days. They suggest the formation of a School District, but as there is already one such school at Norway House, this is out of the question. The Rev. A. B. Chelles is a fully qualified teacher, and now holds interim First Class Certificate which next year will become permanent. He does his own cartaking of the school and has everything in good order. The grant now made by your department, viz., $175.00 per year would not do more than pay a caretaker. It is true the attendance of Indian children has been small, largely because of the indifference of the Indians, and the fact that there is no truant officer, and the teacher has to gather them in as well as teach. You have an excellent school building at Jack River and there are ample children.\n\nMay I respectfully suggest that special consideration be given to the matter of the grant. I realize the need of economy, but I am most anxious that this worthy work shall be continued with efficiency, and if you could possibly increase the grant, say to $500.00 I would further urge that Indian children be pressed to attend in greater numbers.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

A. B. Cheales of Jack River, Norway House; and the Rev. G. C. Cowley of Split Lake, who each inform me that they have received teacher's salary cheques direct from the Department, amounting to the monthly salary grant, in the former case for three consecutive months, and the latter for two months. Since they wrote, other such cheques may have been received.\n\nOn the other hand I received as usual the quarterly cheque for our missionary-teacher at Hollow Water River, which fact in conjunction with the above leaves me a little confused as to the policy now being followed.\n\nAs we have to considerably augment the amount of the teacher's salaries, the amounts by cheque received hitherto from the Department have passed through our accounts, and cheques for salaries or stipends in full paid quarterly by us, which in view of the widely scattered areas, and the infrequency of mail has been the most convenient method.\n\nCould you kindly inform me if the Department has now changed its method, or have the cheques for Jack River and Split Lake been sent direct to the teachers by mistake?

Cheales, teacher of the Jack River C.E. Combined Day School.\n\nIn Mr. Cheales' letter it is stated that in the past four years there has been an attendance of from 12 to 15 Treaty children during the winter months. This information differs materially from that contained in letters received from Indian Agent Lazenby dated October 17, 1939, and January 17, 1940. In the former letter Mr. Lazenby pointed out that the average attendance of Indian children for the academic year 1938-39 was only 5.64 and in the letter of January 17, 1940, Mr. Lazenby stated that the average attendance of Indian children for the calendar year 1939 was only 4.58. He also pointed out in that letter that the greater part of the teacher's time was devoted to the teaching of non-Indian pupils as there were more than twice as many of them as there were Indian children.\n\nThe reports submitted by Indian Agent Lazenby were carefully considered and we wrote to you on April 13, 1940. Subsequently we corresponded with Rt. Rev. J. Lofthouse, D.D., Bishop of Keewatin, and it was finally decided that in view of the small proportion of Indian children compared to the number of non-Indian children attending this school the Department's grant of $650.00 a year to this school was too high and it was, therefore, decided to only allow grant of $175.00 a year from September 1, 1940.

Since that time I have endeavoured to secure a successor for the position of Missionary-Teacher at Jack River.\n\nI have secured the services of Mr. Chas. R. Harbord now of the Fort Alexander Day School, where for some years Mrs. Harbord has been the teacher. In 1926 Mr. Harbord was teacher of the seasonal school at Cat Lake. It is my purpose to admit Mr. Harbord to the ministry and have him take charge of our Jack River Mission. Mrs. Harbord who has I believe done good work at Fort Alexander will be pleased to teach at Jack River, and I know her husband will take the deepest interest in the school.\n\nAs Jack River has a Combined School, I have still to secure the approval of the Manitoba Department of Education to the appointment. Will you kindly advise as soon as possible if your Department approves the appointment of Mrs. Harbord as teacher at this school. I am anxious to have Mr. and Mrs. Harbord settled in the mission and at the school in time for the fall term, and while navigation on Lake Winnipeg is open, hence the urgency.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

As we have no record of the salary paid to the teacher at Fort Alexander, I should be obliged if you could inform me as soon as possible what amount the Indian Affairs Branch provides for the teacher's salary.

It would be appreciated if you would let me have your views regarding this school, stating if there is any likelihood of the number of Indian children increasing.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. P.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nNorway House, Man:\n3rd December 1942.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Mr Philip Phelan's letter of the 2nd November, File 123-7-1, in connection with the Jack River C of E May School.\n\nIn his letter, Mr Phelan states that the Department is allowing the teacher of this school salary at the rate of $95.00 per teaching month plus bonus.\n\nIn connection with the teacher's salary, I would refer you to Mr R.A. Hoey's letter to Mr Inspector A.G. Hamilton, dated 5th November 1940, File 123-7-5, in which it is stated that prior to that date the allowance towards the salary of the teacher of this school had been $650.00 a year, but that in view of the decided decrease in the average attendance, this allowance has been reduced to $450.00 a year; the expenditure for fuel used for this school had been reduced from $50.00 a year to $25.00 a year, and the janitor's fees from $1.50 a month to .75\u00a2 per month. Since that time too, no school materials such as scribblers, pencils etc; have been provided, nor have any school biscuits been provided. This school, as you are aware, is a 'Combined' white and Indian school, and the province of Manitoba has certain responsibilities in connection with its upkeep and operation, and, as I have always understood, has paid a yearly sum towards the teacher's salary. The school building itself however, is the property of the Indian Department.\n\nThe Rev. G.R. Harbord, Anglican missionary, whose wife, Mrs Harbord is teacher on this school, was in the office this morning, and I have discussed the problems of this school with him. Mr Harbord advises me that at present there are 30 non-treaty half breed children attending this school, and 3 Indian children, and that the school is accommodating all the pupils it can with its present equipment. Mr Harbord informs me that one Indian family, (with no mother), is sending two children to the Jack River R.C. School, although they belong to the Anglican Church, and another family lives about two miles from the school who have three children of school age, but will not send them to school, as the father is sick, and has been for some time; this father is in receipt of monthly sick rations. Some Anglican families have moved away from that part of the reserve. For instance, one Anglican family now lives at Rossville, and they now send four children to the Rossville school, and I do not see much likelihood of the Indian attendance at this school increasing very much.\n\nTaking into consideration the proportion of\n\n- non-treaty -\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ont.;\nnon-treaty children and Indian children attending this school, it would seem that the Province of Manitoba should assume practically the whole cost of operation, including teacher's salary, fuel for heating, and janitors. The Indian Department provides the school building, which is of frame construction, and is in very good condition. In addition, practically all the desks in use at this school were provided by the Indian Department.\n\nIn speaking to Mr. Harberd this morning, about the teacher's salary, he informed me that the teacher had not received any payments at all from the Indian Affairs Branch, and that he had written to Bishop Lofthouse about it; and that the Bishop had also informed him that he had not received any payment from the Department on behalf of the teacher of this school.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nP.G.

MacInnes,\nSecretary, Indian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have noticed that since the appointment of Mrs. Chas. R. Harbord to the position of teacher at the Jack River, Norway House, Combined School, the Department's cheque for salary has not been coming to my office.\n\nIt is possible and quite probable that cheques have been sent direct to Mrs. Harbord or to the Rev. Chas. R. Harbord. If such is the case it is quite satisfactory, but I should be obliged if you could advise me as to the actual facts regarding such salary cheques.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Lazenby, Indian Agent, Norway House, Man.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, I regret that in my communication of the 2nd ultimo I stated the salary allowed the teacher of the Jack River (C. of E.) Combined School was $95.00 a teaching month.\n\nYour statement is correct, namely, that the allowance is $175.00 for an academic year, or $17.50 a teaching month. For some unaccountable reason, payment of even this amount has been overlooked, and I would therefore appreciate hearing from you, regarding the exact number of months for which you consider payment should be made to Mrs. Harbord. The last payment we made was to the former teacher, Mr. A. B. Cheales, who was paid to May 31, 1941.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nNorway House, Man:\n7th January 1943.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.:\n\nIn reply to Mr Philip Phelan's letter No; 123-7-1 of the 17th December 1942, I beg to say that Mrs Charles R Harbord, teacher of the Jack River C of E Combined Day School, has taught this school since 1st October 1941, without any loss of days of teaching, apart from the regular holidays as specified by the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nMrs Harbord is therefore entitled to payment for the following quarters:-\n\nOct: 1st to Dec: 31st 1941 -\nJan: 1st to Mch: 31st 1942\nApl: 1st to Jun: 30th 1942\nOct: 1st to Dec: 31st 1942\n\nP.G.

Indian Day School, No. 518.\n\nFrom June 1, 1940, it was decided to allow an amount of $175.00 a month toward the salary of the teacher at the above-mentioned school. The Church authorities found it impossible to secure a teacher for the academic year 1940-41, but the school re-opened on October 1, 1941, and has been in continuous operation since that date.\n\nAs this is a combined white and Indian school, it is operated on a ten-month basis and consequently payment of salary for the following period is now due:\n\nOctober 1 to December 31, 1941 - 3 months\nJanuary 1 to June 30, 1942 - 6 \"\nSeptember 1 to December 31, 1942 - 4 \"\n\nTotal - 13 months\n\nThis makes the amount due 13 x $17.50 = $227.50. The cheque should be drawn in favour of the teacher, Mrs. Charles Harbord, and should be sent to her at Norway House, Man. Previous to her appointment as teacher of the Jack River C.E. Combined School, Mrs. Harbord taught at the Fort Alexander Upper Indian Day School, No. 518. It would be appreciated if you would forward the amount now due. For your information I enclose copy of official letter of November 5, 1940, also a copy of official letter of September 3, 1941.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nNorway House, Man:\n22nd May 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept' of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to report that I visited the Jack River C of E Combined Day School on the 20th instant.\n\nAt the time of my visit there were 27 pupils present, 7 of these being treaty Indians, and 20 non-treaty. There were 10 names of Indian pupils on the roll. The register was marked up to date. The average attendance of Indian pupils, from April 1st to the date of my visit was a fraction over 6.\n\nThe teacher, Mrs C.R.Harbord, was efficient in her work.\n\nReading aloud was good apart from the usual monotone generally used by Indian children. The book work was very good, neat, and accurate. Singing by the whole school was also very good, some two part songs being sung.\n\nBlackboard work was good and fairly quickly done, and generally accurate.\n\nThe pupils were well dressed and clean.\n\nThe school building and the grounds were clean and tidy. The new doors and windows provided last year were all installed, which was a great improvement to the building.\n\nThe discipline was very good. Some handwork such as a small quilt and small pieces of sewing sewn to me were very well done.\n\nThe seating accommodation at this school is - inadequate -\n\np.t.o.\ninadequate, but this is not the fault of the Indian Affairs Branch, as we have furnished this school with a number of school desks, more than sufficient to take care of the Indian pupils attending, and at the time of my visit, all the Indian pupils present were seated at proper school desks. If any further desks have to be provided, they should, I consider, be provided by the Department of Education of the Province of Manitoba. It will be noted that about three times as many non-treaty pupils as Indian pupils attend this school.\n\nP.G.

Mrs Harbord herself, taught the Fort Alexander Indian Day School for fourteen years from 1927 to 1941 and the Norway House Jack River C of E school from 1941 to the present time, making a total of twenty-three years of teaching Indian Day Schools for Mr and Mrs Harbord together.\n\nI am not aware myself, of any such superannuation fund as Mrs Harbord mentions.

Lazenby, Indian Agent, Norway House, Man.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th ultimo, you may inform Mrs. Harbord, teacher of the Jack River C.E. Day School, that there is no superannuation fund for teachers of Indian day schools.\n\nIn the case of teachers appointed since September 1, 1939, the Department deducts 5% from their salary. This is put in a special fund and is repaid to them when they leave our service. This was a special provision made following the outbreak of war and applies to all temporary employees in the Government service. Possibly Mrs. Harbord heard of this arrangement.\n\nR.A.

Harbord has been teaching for three years at Jack River, Norway House Combined Day School. I now have a letter from her in which she states that on account of domestic and other duties she cannot continue as teacher, and at this rather late date she asks me to send in a teacher for the coming Fall Term.\n\nHer letter is not in the nature of a formal resignation, but it is obvious she does not desire to continue as teacher. She is the wife of the missionary, and as such she has household and other duties which demand time and effort. I know she has found the work a strain upon her, and if it is possible I would recommend an independent teacher, but at this late date such is difficult to secure.\n\nIs it possible that you may know of a suitable teacher who might desire a transfer, or one such who might be available for the Jack River Indian Combined School. As the school is so closely associated with the mission it would be advisable that the teacher be an Anglican. I am taking up the matter with the Manitoba Department of Education in the hope that they may be able to recommend a teacher.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

There is, as you know, an acute shortage of teachers throughout the Dominion and it is not at all likely that we shall be able to secure the number necessary to keep our schools open and in operation during the coming academic year. In view of this fact, would it be possible to persuade Mrs. Harbord to continue as teacher at this school for another year? It is our earnest hope that by that time the war will be over and the supply of teachers sufficient to meet our needs.

Indian Day School, No. 519.\n\nIt has been decided to increase the salary of Mrs. C.R. Harbord, teacher of the above-mentioned school, from $17.50 to $25.00 a teaching month. Consequently payment should be made to her at this rate from September 1, 1944. I enclose copy of letter approving this increase.\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept' of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to report that yesterday I visited and inspected the Jack River C of E Combined White and Indian Day School.\n\nThere were 16 Treaty Indian pupils on the roll, 13 of whom were present. This, however, was the first day this quarter that so many had been present, the average to date for this quarter being 6. There were 23 non-treaty pupils present, making a total attendance for the day, of 36. The register was marked up to date.\n\nThe school building and furniture were in good condition, but I would recommend that the inside of the school be painted during the holidays this summer. The two toilets were in need of repair, and I authorized the resident missionary, Rev. C.R. Harbord, to have the repairs done, and the toilets moved to another location, at a cost not to exceed $15.00. I trust that this will be approved. Payment for this work can be made from the accountable advance on hand at this office.\n\nThe pupils were clean and well clothed, and the discipline very good. Their work on the blackboard and in their books was very creditable, there being one or two pupils who are doing outstanding work. The teacher, Mrs. C.R. Harbord, is very efficient and keenly interested in her work.\n\nThere is need for at least 10 more double desks at this school, as some of the pupils were sitting on boxes, and using other boxes for desks. As this school is operated partly under the auspices of the Province of Manitoba, it is suggested that the Department endeavour to have the Province provide at least half of the desks required, as there are many more Provincial pupils attending this school than Indians. The school building is owned by the Indian Affairs Branch, and if we provide the building, and we have already provided most of the desks now in use, it is thought that the Province should not object to providing a few more desks.\n\nP.G. Laze nby\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 21, 1945.\n\nMr. F. G. Lazenby, Indian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to the Jack River Combined School. It is noted that this building is owned by the Department and consequently your action in having the toilets repaired, at a cost of $15.00, is approved.\n\nAs you state in the second paragraph of your letter, the attendance of Treaty Indian children was much larger on the date you visited the school than it had been for some time previously. If this attendance continues, there will, of course, be necessity for supplying new desks. However, we feel that the Department of Education for the Province of Manitoba should supply the desks for the non-treaty children. I am writing to Inspector Hamilton in connection with this matter, but owing to his absence on duty at the present time, I do not expect to receive a reply from him for some time.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, June 21, 1945.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Indian Agent Lazenby, in which he states that he visited the Jack River Combined White and Indian School on May 17, at which time there were 16 Treaty children on the roll and 13 were present. There were also 23 non-treaty pupils present, or a total attendance that day of 36.\n\nThe building is owned and kept in repair by this Department. We also allow an amount of $25.00 a teaching month to the teacher as part payment of her salary.\n\nMr. Lazenby states that 10 more double desks are required at this school, to accommodate the large number of pupils that are attending. I feel that the Department of Education for the province of Manitoba should supply some of these desks, in view of the large number of non-treaty pupils who have taken advantage of the school. It would be appreciated if you would discuss the matter with the Provincial Authorities and let me know how many desks you feel we should supply.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Your file 123-7-1, dated June 21st.\n\nAs you are no doubt aware, Mr. Hamilton is out of town and will be until about August 16th.\n\nI understand that he visited the Jack River School about June 16th and will no doubt be making a report on this when he returns to a Post Office.

No further payment of salary should be made to her.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nOttawa, 17th August, 1945.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Bishop Lofthouse:\n\nI have noted from your letter of the 9th instant that the services of Mrs. Harbord will not be available at the Jack River Combined Provincial and Indian Day School for the academic year 1945-46.\n\nLet us hope you will find it possible to nominate another teacher.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRt. Rev. J. Lofthouse, D.D.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nBishopstowe,\nKenora, Ontario.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI wish to submit the following report on the schools of the Norway House Agency, inspected in June, 1946.\n\nJack River Indian Day School\n\nMrs. Harboard is in charge at this school. The roll calls for 20 and June average was 10.6.\n\nThe school is in good repair; but some paint is needed. The new doors supplied some time ago are still not painted.\n\nThe yards were clean and well kept. The new flag pole erected recently adds to the surroundings. The out toilets were clean and in good condition.\n\nThe school books seen would indicate that the children are making fair progress.\n\nThere are 28 non-treaty children enrolled and I understand ten new seats are on order. These certainly are needed.\n\nRossville Indian Day School\n\nMrs. Scott is the teacher in charge. The roll calls for 31 and I found 25 present. The grades are as follows:\n\n| Grade | Roll |\n|-------|------|\n| 1     | 21   |\n| 2     | 8    |\n| 3     | 2    |\n| 4     | 2    |\n| 5     | 2    |\n| 6     | 2    |\n\nThe average attendance is good. There are not enough seats. Some single seats of different sizes should be provided. The floor is painted. The walls are covered with V-joint and painted. This school is a very old building but in fair condition.\n\nMrs. Scott is doing very good work. The children read out well and appear to be well along in their different grades. She also teaches handicraft work and some of the work seen was indeed quite good.\n\nJack River R.C. Indian School\n\nOne of the Sisters is in charge and from the exercise books would judge the pupils are making fair progress.\n\nThere are 18 boarders and 3 day pupils. I understand the boarders are considered part of the Cross Lake School and are included in their school returns.\nJack River R.C. School (contd.)\n\nThe building is old, but fairly well arranged and the pupils are well cared for and well supervised. The classroom is especially bright and cheerful and the pupils appear very happy. The day pupils live quite close to school and are fairly regular in their attendance.\n\nCross Lake Indian Day School - United Church\n\nMiss K. Neufeld is in charge, but she did not expect to return. There were 9 Indian children and 10 non-treaty enrolled.\n\nI was at the reserve on Saturday so did not see the children in class. I understand Miss Neufeld has done very good work.\n\nThe building is made of logs and the inside is lined with ten-teak. The outside is covered with siding and presents a fair appearance.\n\nAnother day school is needed as there are about 40 pupils for which no provision is made. I would refer the Department to previous correspondence as submitted by Agent Lazenby.\n\nCross Lake R.C. Indian Boarding School\n\nThere are 26 pupils enrolled and all but the Cross Lake pupils had left before my arrival.\n\nThis was my first visit to the new school and I was greatly impressed with the very excellent building.\n\nThe dormitories were spotless, well aired and very bright. The beds were quite close together but with all the windows I am sure the children have plenty of fresh air. The bedding was clean and there was abundant.\n\nThe classrooms were very bright and the walls nicely decorated. The desks, although in use for some years, were almost without a scratch. I am certain from the books seen that the Sisters do very excellent work in the classroom.\n\nI examined the work done in the sewing-room and must admit that the girls do splendid sewing. They make dresses, knit all kinds of garments and do very excellent patch work and darning.\n\nThe kitchen and dining rooms were in excellent order and the girls receive a good training in cooking and baking. The children seem were in good health and I am sure are well cared for and well fed.\n\nThis school is situated in an isolated area and the Rev. Father is greatly concerned and rightly so about his engine and generator. If the engine should fail at any time the school would be without light or water - in fact, it could not continue to operate. I think a second unit should be installed. There is plenty of room, consequently no additional expense will be required for building purposes. The total cost would be for the engine, generator and water for someone to see that it is properly installed. I think the Department should give this request serious consideration. If the school were closer to town I would not make the recommendation; but a bad break in equipment at this isolated point would be serious and perhaps repairs could not be secured for weeks. There are often weeks when communication to the outside is impossible and this is especially bad at freeze-up and again in the spring during break-up.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6237, file 519-1, part 2)\nCross Lake Boarding School (contd.)\n\nThe hot water tank which hangs by the furnace also must be renewed. I understand Mr. Lazenby has the particulars and is submitting the necessary requisition. This should be ordered and sent forward at once.\n\nThe school has a large garden; which this year was planted late and of course was not up when I was there. The Rev. Father keeps some very fine Holstein cows, a flock of hens and some pigs. The school is under excellent management and the children appeared very happy. The operating of such an excellent school in this remote area is a great credit to the Church and Government. The Rev. Father Trudeau is interested in his work and is assisted by an excellent staff of Sisters.\n\nGod's Lake U.C. Day School\n\nThe school building is small and is the property of the United Church. It is a log building and in fair repair. The teacher last year was Miss Elsie Hiebert. The grades are as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| 1     | 14     |\n| 2     | 4      |\n| 3     | 6      |\n| 4     | 1      |\n| Total | 25     |\n\nThe attendance for the June quarter was 65. I noticed six pupils had not attended at all during the quarter. There is no teacher's residence in connection with this school and the teacher must board with the Missionary. I understand Miss Hiebert has resigned.\n\nThese Indians are trappers and hunters and so are away from the reserve for weeks at a time. It seems impossible to operate a day school with any degree of success under such conditions.\n\nOxford House U.C. Indian Day School\n\nMrs. Deuck was in charge but she had already left.\n\nThis is a log school and I found it in fair condition. The building needed interior painting as the walls were dark.\n\nI did not see the register. I understand there are at least 40 children for which there is no classroom accommodation.\n\nIsland Lake U.C. Indian Day School\n\nThe teacher, Miss E. Loewen, had left before I arrived. The roll showed 42 - three in grade 2 and the balance in grade 1.\n\nThis is a log school. Some repair is needed to the roof and the floor needs painting. The material is on hand, I understand, and the work will be carried out during the summer.\n\nIf we had a school residence I would recommend that a married couple be engaged and that they do social and welfare work, as well as teach. They should be hired by the year with, say, a month's holidays. They could then supervise a good garden and help in the...\nIsland Lake R.C.Day School (contd.)\n\norganization of social groups. The women could instruct and help the Indian women in the sewing clubs and social organizations. A married couple interested in the work would be a great help to the Agent and could do very excellent work. There are about 160 United Church children of school age. If these are to be accommodated in day schools we would need three more schools. These Indians are trappers and I doubt if day schools can even be considered as an answer to the great need. The parents cannot remain on the reserve in the winter and trap, and the children cannot be away with their parents and attend a day school; consequently there appears only one solution and that is more boarding schools.\n\nIsland Lake R.C.Day School\n\nMr. J.M. Blackburn is in charge of the school at Maria Portage. He is doing very excellent work.\n\nThe building is in fair condition and the school work seen was good.\n\nI understand there are about 54 pupils enrolled with an average attendance in June of 30. There are 27 in grade 1; 13 in grade 2; 7 in grade 3; 4 in grade 4; 3 in grade 5. The teacher and his wife live in a nearby house, the property of the R.C.Mission, and for which the Department pay to the Mission a yearly rental of $75.00.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nOttawa, September 12, 1945.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Bishop Lofthouse:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 6th instant, in which you state that you have secured the services of Mrs. Elizabeth M. Bennett and Mr. J. P. Mullan.\n\nThe Department has no objection to the latter going to Jack River; and, in this event, I presume Mrs. Bennett would be willing to take charge of Fort Alexander. Please let me know if these appointments are definite, in order that I may notify the agent concerned.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRight Rev. J. Lofthouse, D.D.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nBishopstowe,\nKenora, Ont.\nMr. A.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\n528 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nRe: Indian Affairs Branch,\nYour file 207-11 A.G.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nAs you probably know, Mr. Brisbin has moved from his position here to Brandon where he is undertaking the work of school inspection. So your letter of August 14th, re Jack River School, has gone unanswered until the present.\n\nAs you are doubtless aware, this Department has supported the Jack River School for many years in varying amounts, running as high as $466.00 in one year. In addition to the Jack River School, we maintain the Public School District of Norway House, which receives a large measure of provincial support.\n\nRecently in conversation with the teacher from the Norway House School, I gained the impression that this school is handicapped by the fact that a number of people who should be supporting it, are sending their children to the Jack River School, with the result that the Norway House School is inadequately supported. The hope at that time was expressed that a number of children now coming to Jack River would attend Norway House and bring additional support to this public School district. Before committing myself in the suggestion that the Department should supply some desks, I would have to know more about the situation at Norway House Public School. In other words, if they have accommodation there, and some of the children who are now attending Jack River would go there, that might be a solution to the problem stated in your letter.\n\nI am today writing the Official Trustee of Norway House School District in this connection, and hope to have...\nan easy reply so that I can advise you further.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"C.K.Rogers\"\n\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Jack River Day School\nNorway House Agency,\nYour file 123-7-1, June 21st.\n\nI contacted the Provincial Department of Education on receipt of your letter, but only received their reply on September 4th, a copy of which I attach.\n\nIf the seats now in use belong to our Department and meet our need, then I think the Province should provide seats for the outsiders. If there are no seats provided then they can hardly be accommodated. If I receive further word from Mr. Rogers it will be forwarded at once.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\n\nEncl.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to recommend that this school be taken over by the Indian Affairs Branch as an Indian Day School. That the teacher be paid the current basic salary paid to other Day School teachers in this Agency.\n\nMy reasons are as follows:\n\n1. The present arrangement whereby the Indian Affairs Branch and the Province of Manitoba each donate a pittance towards the teacher's salary and the maintenance of the school has proved most unsatisfactory.\n\n2. The building is the property of the Indian Affairs Branch. It is in good condition.\n\n3. I understand that the Government of Manitoba is building a new two room school to accommodate the white and non-treaty children of this district.\n\n4. There are 62 treaty Indian children who should be attending this school.\n\n5. This school is closed at present as there is no teacher, and under present conditions I doubt if one will be procurable, unless it is a missionary who would take over the school as a side line. This arrangement would be unsatisfactory and unfair both to the children and the Missionary.\n\nThere is no teacher's residence, and I further recommend that one be built, and that this be kept in mind when the post war building plan gets under way. I notice that no estimate has been made for such a residence.\n\nI trust that the foregoing will receive your sympathetic consideration.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to Bishop Lofthouse.\n\nE. B. Goodman,\nActing Indian Agent.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM RT. REV. J. LOFTHOUSE, D.D.,\nBishop of Keewatin, Bishopstowe, Kenora, Ont.\ndated October 10, 1945.\n\nI am sorry to have to inform you that for family reasons, Mr. J. P. Mullan withdrew from the appointment as Missionary-Teacher at Jack River, Norway House. He was to have gone from Winnipeg last week, and I was disappointed to learn by a letter written on the 1st inst. that he could not undertake the work. An effort was made to secure another man who is interested, but after consideration he also decided for family reasons that he could not accept the position.\n\nOur major difficulties at the Jack River School are that there is no teacherage, hence if the mission is vacant, as it is at present, there is no accommodation for a teacher, and even if we have a missionary in residence it may not be convenient to provide board and room for a teacher. Under present conditions we could not send in a lady teacher. The second difficulty is the smallness of the grant for a teacher, which makes it necessary for the Church to provide the major portion of a teacher's salary, even though it is at present a Combined School with an available grant of $320.00 per year from Manitoba Department of Education. If the school is to be continued it would appear that the Indian Affairs Branch should restore at least the former grant of pre war days.\nOttawa, 16th October, 1945.\n\nDear Bishop Lofthouse:\n\nI have your letter of October 10th in which you advise that Mr. J.P. Mullan has decided not to accept the appointment as teacher of the Jack River C.E. Combined School.\n\nI recently received a letter from the Indian Agent regarding this school and he also points out the necessity for the provision of a teacher's residence. It is our intention to further consider this matter when we are preparing our appropriation for the fiscal year 1946-47.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRt. Rev. J. Lofthouse, D.D.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nBishopstowe,\nKenora, Ontario.\nOttawa, 16th October, 1945.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMr. E.B. Goodman, Acting Indian Agent, Norway House, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 16th ultimo and while you did not state the name of the school to which you referred, I presume you mean the school that is known officially as the Jack River C.E. Combined School.\n\nIn paragraph three of your letter you state that you heard the Government of Manitoba intends to erect a new two-room school. Is this information definite? As late as September 1st, 1945, Mr. C.K. Rogers Superintendent of Education for the Provincial Government wrote Inspector Hamilton and made no mention of the erection of the school.\n\nIn paragraph four of your letter you state that there are 62 Treaty Indian children who should be attending the Jack River School. Do you mean that there are 62 children without educational facilities for the current academic year or do you mean that a number of them are attending Residential Schools and in your opinion they should be attending a Day School?\n\nWe have been in communication with the Right Reverend J. Lofthouse, D.D., Bishop of Keewatin, with reference to securing a teacher for this school and as yet he has been unable to make any nomination.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDiocese of Keewatin\n\nRt Rev J. Lofthouse, D.D., Bishop\nBishopstowe\nKenora Ont,\nOct 8th 1945.\n\nMr E.B. Goodman,\nActing Indian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\n\nDear Mr Goodman,\n\nThank you for yours of the 16th ult., enclosing copy of a letter you have written to the Indian Affairs Branch with regard to the Jack River C of E Day School.\n\nYour recommendation to the Branch have my fullest approval. Since 1940 when the Department seriously cut the grant for this school to a mere \"pittance\" we have laboured under difficulties, although we have tried to make it worth while for the wife of the missionary to teach school. On the resignation of the Rev. C.R. Harbord I advertised for a teacher for this school, and had there been a teacherage I could have engaged a lady teacher with due qualifications. I could not however send a lady teacher unless someone occupied the mission house who would provide accommodation, and as the mission was falling vacant that was not possible, and in any case we should have been required to provide the bulk of the salary, for even with the grant from the Province of Manitoba together with the small grant from the Indian Affairs Branch, the amount receivable would be altogether inadequate.\n\nI had an application from a Mr. J.P. Mullan who I hoped would go in as Missionary-Teacher. I arranged for an interview at our expense, and received approval of his appointment from Ottawa, I had considerable correspondence with Mr. Mullan, and awaited his final decision before replying to your letter which I had hoped to advise you of his coming to Jack River. Much to my disappointment he wrote me last week to say that for family reasons he could not take up the work. I then tried a local man who is interested, and who knows Norway House. He gave it consideration and was favourably disposed, but on account of a growing son who will soon be of school age his wife did not favour the move. This I learned only yesterday. This latter plan would have provided lay administration for the mission but would not have solved the teacher problem. Now I fear it is too late to get anyone in this Fall.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ Keewatin\nCertified True Copy\n\nOFFICE OF THE INDIAN AGENT\n\nCANADA\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n16th September 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to recommend that this school be taken over by the Indian Affairs Branch as an Indian Day School.

Hoey, Esq\nDirector Indian Affairs Branch,\nDep't of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nOn Sept 16th, 1945, I wrote a letter to the Indian Affairs Branch concerning the C of E Day School at Jack River, a copy of which I enclose. To date I have received no reply to this letter.\n\nI also enclose a copy of a letter I received from the Rt Rev J. Lofthouse D.D., Bishop of Keewatin.\n\nUnder existing conditions I doubt if it will be possible to procure a qualified teacher for this school.\n\nThere are 62 Treaty Indian children who should be attending this school and the parents repeatedly ask me when this school is to be opened. I have had several requests that their children be allowed to attend the R.C. Jack River Day School, which is already crowded.\n\nOn Oct 1st I received a letter from Mr Phelan informing me that this procedure was contrary to the Indian Act and he drew my attention to subsection 2 of Section 10.\n\nWhile carrying out the Family Allowance Registration for this agency I took a census of children of school age; that is, of children born between 1929 and 1939. There are 852 children of school age. There is school accommodation for 510 children, leaving a balance of 375 children for whom there is no school accommodation. This figure does not include the 62 children of the Jack River C of E Day School which is closed.\n\nThe need for new schools in this agency is desperate. Several of our Day School buildings now in use are old, of log construction, inadequate and unsuitable, and should be condemned.\n\nIs there any indication as to when this Post-War Building Plan as outlined for the Norway House Indian Agency will be commenced.\n\nE.B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 6th November, 1945.\n\nMr. E.B. Goodman, Indian Agent, Norway House, Manitoba.\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo with further reference to the Jack River C.E. School. By this time you have no doubt received my letter of October 16th in reply to yours of September 16th.\n\nWe are quite prepared to operate this school for Indian children exclusively but due to the shortage of teachers I regret it does not seem possible to secure a teacher for the current academic year.\n\nI discussed with Mr. Hoey yesterday the contents of your letter. Possibly you could let me have an estimate of the cost of building a teachers residence at the Jack River C.E. School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER RECEIVED FROM J. KEEWATIN\nDATED NOVEMBER 17th, 1945.\n\nOriginal on file # 135-5-1\n\nRe: Jack River School, Norway House.\n\nMr. J.F. Mullan who by your letter of September 12th was approved as teacher for Jack River combined Indian Day School at Norway House, was at that time unable to take up the position. His difficulty has now been removed and he is prepared to go by plane at our expense in December.\n\nCould you inform me if such would be satisfactory to your Department, and what would be the amount of the grant from the Indian Affairs Branch. Early in the war the grant was greatly reduced as part of the policy of economy. May I be permitted to urge that an adequate grant might now be made by the aid of which we can maintain the work of the school. For the past five years we have had to greatly augment the salary and thus keep open the school. The people at Jack River are pressing us to send in a teacher and we hope Mr. Mullan will be able to go in and open the school shortly.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI have to hand two letters d/Oct 16th and Nov 6th respectively, dealing with the Jack River C of E Combined School. These letters, I received today, the 26th November.\n\nI am sorry that in my letter of the 16th Sept, I omitted to name the school to which I referred. This was an error in typing, the letter should have been headed re Jack River C of E Combined School.\n\nIn your letter of Oct 16th, Para 2, you asked by what authority I state that the Government of Manitoba intends to erect a new 2 room school. I received this information from Mr Durant, who is the official trustee of the Norway House Public School #1917. He informed me that an inspector of the Dept of Education for Manitoba had come to Norway House this fall and had looked over the territory for the purpose of obtaining a site for a new 2 rooed Public School.\n\nIn para 3 of the same letter you question my statement that there are 62 Indian Children who should be attending the Jack River C of E Combined School and you ask if I mean that there are 62 children without Educational facilities for the current academic year, or do I mean that a number of them are attending Residential schools and in my opinion should they be attending a day school? In my second letter to the Branch d/Oct 30, I think I made this point quite clear. In case I did not, there are 62 Treaty Indian children whose names and ages I obtained from Mrs Harbord before she left. These children live within 5 miles of the school and are not and never have attended any Residential School. It was a simple statement of fact and not an expression of opinion. These children will be without educational facilities for the current academic year.\n\nWith reference to the 3rd paragraph in your letter of Nov 6th, I have discussed with Mr Stevenson our engineer, the possible cost of building a teacher's residence at Jack River C of E Combined School. He thinks that, by using our lumber wherever possible, it would be feasible to build a residence similar to the one he now occupies, and of which you have sketches and photographs on file at Ottawa, for $3,500.00, which figure includes labour.\n\nE.B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 19, 1945.\n\nDear Bishop Lofthouse:\n\nI regret very much that no reply was previously sent to the latter part of your letter of the 17th ultimo, in which you stated that Mr. J.

Acknowledgement of your letter has been delayed on account of my absence from my office on a visitation of our northern missions as far north as Churchill, Manitoba.\n\nI am painfully conscious that we have not at present a teacher for this school, but I trust advertisements which I have inserted in the Winnipeg Daily newspapers will bring forth applications. With the present demand and short supply of teachers as also of missionary clergy, we have much difficulty in securing the services of suitable persons for Indian Missions and Schools.\n\nWe shall do all possible to secure a teacher for Jack River, and shall hope in due course to be able to forward to you a nomination.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Lofthouse, D.D., Bishop of Keewatin, Bishopstowe, Kenora, Ont., dated August 29, 1946.\n\nMay I say that I have advertised for a week in the two daily newspapers of Winnipeg for teachers for Jack River and Hollow Water River Day Schools in separate advertisements, and though two weeks have passed I have not received any applications. Through this portion of Western Ontario, and throughout Manitoba, there is a definite shortage of rural teachers, and it is increasingly difficult to secure teachers for remote areas.\n\nOur Missionary at Big Trout Lake informed me a week or so ago that the Indians at that centre and also at Windigo Lake have asked him to appeal to me for schools and teachers. There are also other bands, such as Cat Lake, and also Duck Lake, 175 miles north-west of Churchill where we should have schools.

Obviously she has opened the school, and as such is much to be desired, it is urgent that necessary provision be made for her salary.

Salaries for principals in Manitoba available to me range from $1800.00 to $2200.00, and I feel therefore that I could not accept less than the above in connection with your work.

It is noted on Mr. Poole's application form that he has had one year's experience in teaching Indians. This would entitle him to a starting salary of $1,620.00 in our schools. Next year he would be entitled to $1,680.00, the year after that, $1,740, etc. As you are also aware, we provide a free furnished teacherage.

The single fare by boat would be $35.00 which I assured him would be paid, and I expressed the hope that the Indian Affairs Branch would reimburse us if we had to provide it. Could you advise if this latter would be possible.\n\nI have today received a further letter from Mr. Poole wherein he states that he will be glad to accept the position on terms specified in Mr. Neary's letter and mine. I may say that I quoted your letter to him, and guaranteed his travelling expenses from Winnipeg as above mentioned. He would teach until the end of June.\n\nHe now enquires as to what additional furnishing they will require. In order to provide this information I am wiring Mr. Agent E. B.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nMy reference to travelling expenses of Mr. Poole as per letter of this date enclosed brings to mind further expenses entailed during the past summer on Indian work.\n\nOn July 4th I chartered a Norseman Aircraft out of Sioux Lookout for an extended visitation of our missions in the Big Trout Lake area, the round trip costing $946.92. On the incoming trip I took Mr. Harold Garrett who was to teach school for the summer at Trout Lake. This latter was service for the Indian Affairs Branch, for Mr. Garrett had no other means of getting in to Trout Lake. Such a trip for Mr. Garrett would have cost at least $100.00.\n\nOn July 28th I left Churchill by chartered plane to Duck Lake, Caribou Post, to minister to our Chipewyan Indians. At the request of the R.C.M.P., who act for the Indian Affairs Branch, I took in a supply of medicines for the Indians, and on return I brought out a sick woman and her child for hospitalization at Churchill. That trip cost $191.25.\n\nI had of course to take these trips in the performance of my duties, and I rejoice to be of service to our Indian people. I feel that the Department should know that the Church renders such service where and whenever possible thereby saving some expense for the Department. In view of the above I hope it may be possible for the Indian Affairs Branch to at least pay the travelling expenses of the teacher proceeding to Norway House.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am rated highly as a disciplinarian without friction and I always get along excellently with students.\n\nI should know your wishes as soon as possible.\n\nThe previous letter gave salary of $250 for my qualifications.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neary\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your Army Signal regarding Mr. A. E. Presley going to Norway House - I contacted Mr. Presley by telephone, and I am attaching hereto a reply received from him this morning.\n\nWhen I visited Mr. Presley in Brandon a week or so ago, he asked if there were any other schools to be opened in the near future, and I mentioned The Pas School. He seemed very much in favour of this school, and he has mentioned it in his letter.\n\nMr. Presley has a nice little home in Brandon and no doubt it would take him some time to dispose of it. I believe that if we can get Mr. Presley's services, he would make a very good teacher. Would you please write to him direct.\n\nH. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nRSD/ES\nMr. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Affairs\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSince our telephone conversation I had a discussion with an agent, auctioneer etc., to dispose of my property. They figured two weeks' time wasn't enough unless I was willing to take some drastic cuts. Therefore I better not take Nelson Home School. I am quite satisfied with the offer, Mr. Davis, only it's in too big a rush.\n\nMrs. Presley and myself decided to wait and take the unfinished school at The Pas. We will apply for that school in May, to have enough time to dispose of our property in Brandon. I will have time to transfer my Civil Service rights from Post Office to Indian Affairs Dept. We both will go to summer School this coming summer in Winnipeg if our application will be accepted for The Pas in spring. I am very sincere about this application for The Pas and I want to make good when I am on the work.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6237, file 519-1, part 2)\nI do wish you can see through my plan. Summer School will do me a lot of good and also raise my certificate. If I get one of your High schools I want to stay at it till I retire.\n\nHoping this letter explains you my present and future plan. I will communicate with you in May.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. E.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 25th ult. with reference to Mr. Cranston and the above school.\n\nSince early in September I have been in communication with Mr. Cranston. All seemed to be in order and he was to have arrived at Jack River at the end of September; indeed I wired Norway House to that effect. Then several delays occurred; first a car accident, and later an attack of dysentery and still further delay. I have a heavy file of letters and telegrams as between Mr. Cranston and myself. By the time he was ready to proceed, passenger boat service from Winnipeg to Norway House had stopped.\n\nThe only possible way of reaching Norway House was by way of the Pas, on to Wabowden, the winter route. Of this I advised Mr. Cranston, and on November 6th he wrote to say he was leaving at once, which I presume he did. He said \"you will hear from me from Norway House as soon as I get settled. I regret the delay and shall try to make up for it later.\"\n\nHe may have been delayed awaiting freeze up after arriving at Wabowden. I have not heard further from him.\n\nMuch time and effort was expended to assure an early arrival of the teacher at Jack River, and the repeated delays have been disturbing, particularly after I had given assurance of his arrival in late September, as a result of which assurance, a number of children and some parents met the boat at the mission dock, but the teacher was not on the boat. I trust he has by this time arrived.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6237, file 519-1, part 2)\n7 December, 1949.\n\nMr. J. D. Minnis,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\nJack River Indian Day School.\n\nI have just had a letter from Bishop Lofthouse, indicating that Mr. Cranston has been delayed, first due to a car accident and secondly due to an attack of dysentery, from proceeding to his teaching duties at Jack River. By the time he was ready to proceed, passenger boat service to Norway House had stopped.\n\nMr. Cranston advised the Bishop on November 6th that he was leaving by way of The Pas for Wabowden.\n\nCould you please advise whether Mr. Cranston has contacted you en route or whether he is now teaching at Jack River. I would appreciate a reply by telegram as we have no Income Tax forms completed by Mr. Cranston as yet. These were sent on October 3rd to the Norway House Agency and if Mr. Cranston is at the school, they should be completed and returned here by air mail.\n\nBernard F.

There were no forms on hand when I came to Norway House on 1st October.\n\nThis return is the first that Miss Cope, the present teacher, has made out, and some errors were made which I have endeavoured to correct.\n\nIt will be noted that the names of 11 pupils that are not Indians, have been included in the return. I have advised the teacher to write in only the names of Indian pupils, and to note in the Remarks column, how many non-treaty pupils there are attending the school in addition. Half the pupils attending this school at the present time are not Indian children.\n\nI have made out a specimen return for the teacher, for her future guidance.\n\nI trust that the instructions I have given Miss Cope, as above noted, will be approved.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

The Church authorities found it impossible to secure a teacher for the academic year 1940-41, but the school re-opened on October 1, 1941, and has been in continuous operation since that date.\n\nAs this is a combined white and Indian school, it is operated on a ten-month basis and consequently payment of salary for the following period is now due:\n\nOctober 1 to December 31, 1941 - 3 months\nJanuary 1 to June 30, 1942 - 6 months\nSeptember 1 to December 31, 1942 - 4 months\n\nTotal - 13 months\n\nThis makes the amount due 13 x $17.50 = $227.50. The cheque should be drawn in favour of the teacher, Mrs. Charles Harbord, and should be sent to her at Norway House, Man. Previous to her appointment as teacher of the Jack River C.E.

Simmons,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThis might be contrasted with possible local prices about as submitted:\n\n12 wooden Desks at $3.00 each equals $36.00\n\nThe boughten desks are made of birch and would last for ten years.\n\nThe locally built desks would be of pine and would need renewal in three or four years.\n\nMy own mind would favor the desks made of birch and iron.\n\nIn order that you may know the style of desk sold by Mr Leslie I inclose a cutting showing the double seated one asked for. Please note the size of the iron frame.\n\nIt will only be possible to send this desk forward by team or steamer but if directed I will purchase and forward by first chance.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nOntario\n\nCANADA\n\nOur New Desk Top Joint\n\nThis represents a section of our school desk tops showing the double wedge joint we are now using, which on account of the extra glue surface obtained and the gluing of the pieces together makes a joint fully seventy-five per cent stronger than the old plain joint still in general use.\n\nGuard against trouble with joints of tops opening up by purchasing our school desks.\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the desks required at the Jack River Day School Norway House Indian Reserve - Church of England, and your enquiry re local manufacture, I beg to reply as follows:\n\nThere is no Carpenter at Norway House who is at all professional. There are some wood butchers who might produce work which would neither be a credit to themselves or the Department. I could not recommend local manufacture. Seats would not have either appearance or durability and the cost would nearly equal the cost of good ones purchased here. Still I am bound to report that the local cost would be about $2.50 per seat to $3.00.\n\nThe cost at John Leslie's Winnipeg would be as follows:\n\n| Seat No | Children from | Price |\n|---------|---------------|-------|\n| No 4    | 10 to 16      | $4.75 |\n| No 5    | 8 to 12       | $4.50 |\n| No 6    | 5 to 8        | $4.50 |\n\nThe number asked for is 12 and these might be classified as follows:\n\n- 4 No 4 seats at $4.75 equals $19.00\n- 4 No 5 seats at $4.50 equals $18.00\n- 4 No 6 seats at $4.50 equals $18.00\n\nTotal $55.00\n\nTo this must be added the cost of freight say each seat weighs 50 lbs this would make 600 lbs at $.50 or $3.00.\nOttawa, December 1st, 1909.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo quoting prices at Winnipeg for desks for the Jack River School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may purchase twelve desks of the sizes mentioned in your letter at a cost of $55.00 and have them forwarded to the school on the first convenient occasion. The account in duplicate for the desks and freight should be forwarded to the Department in the usual way.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J.

The most suitable property is being used by the Church and they may have title. This matter should be looked into before building operations are commenced.\n\nR.T.F.\nBishopstowe\nKENORA, ONT.\nMay 23rd, 1923.\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nLast fall in an interview I had with Mr. Russell T. Ferrier I brought before him the need of a new building for the day school at Jack River, Norway House. This small building was erected more than twenty years ago and has been steadily used for school purposes for the Indians of the Anglican Mission with excellent results. The building is now really unfit for use without considerable expenditure being made upon it which could hardly be justified. This is, I believe, admitted by the Indian Agent and by Mr. Ferrier who has seen the building. Our Missionary Rev. J. F. Marshall has written me asking me to bring the matter before the Department with a view to securing, if possible, immediate action. The school building is on Mission property which is the most convenient location for the children and also for the teacher who is able to board with the Missionary, which is most important especially when, as for some time past, the teacher is a lady. In case any difficulty should arise in the Department putting a school upon Mission property, we would be quite willing to give such rights to the department in respect to the property used for the school as might be necessary.\n\nI may say that I was much impressed when visiting the Mission last August to find practically all the young people able to understand and speak English and I understand this has been largely due to the good work done in the school during the last twenty years.\n\nMay I ask your kind consideration to this request. Provision should be made for suitable accommodation for the children when the school re-assembles after the summer vacation, and if this is to be done the work should be put in hand very soon. Should it be decided that a new building cannot be provided this summer, an expenditure of from $75 to $100 will be required to make it usable for next winter.\n\nAs I leave shortly to visit Trout Lake, York Factory, and other northern missions and will be away all summer, any communication re this matter should be made to Canon Lofthouse, Kenora, Ont.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6237, file 519-5, part 1)\nOttawa, May 30, 1923.\n\nDear Canon Lofthouse:\n\nI have His Lordship's letter of the 23rd instant, relative to the need of a new building at the Jack River Indian Day School, near Norway House.\n\nI regret to inform you that we were unable to provide for this cause in the appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year. The Superintendent of Indian Education assures me that the Rev. Mr. Marshall has done exceptionally well and should be encouraged, and I shall make a special effort to have funds provided for a new school building next year. It would be advisable for you to arrange for the transfer of a site, in view of the fact that the most convenient location for the school building is on the mission property. This, however, could be attended to when building operations commence. I have noted that the building can be made fairly habitable for another winter by an expenditure of $75.00 or $100.00. I have instructed that favourable consideration be given to any accounts in this connection which are forwarded from the office of Mr. Indian Agent Gordon at Norway House.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nVery Rev. Canon J. Lofthouse,\nKenora,\nOnt.\nJuly 26th, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nUnder date of May 30th, 123-7-5 you wrote me in reference to a proposed new building at the Jack River Indian Day School, near Norway House. While the Department was unable to provide for this cause during the current year, you state that it would be advisable for us to arrange for the transfer of a site as a special effort is to be made to have funds provided for a new school building next year.\n\nI am advised by the Rev. Mr. Marshall that the property of the Jack River Mission was separated from the Indian reserve in 1910 by chief surveyor McLean. In 1916 this property consisting of about 33 acres was surveyed on the request of Mr. Marshall by Mr. Beams, D.L.S. No titles have as yet been granted in that district and we seem to hold the land only as squatters. We have spent considerable money on a splendid Mission House and Church building; would it be possible to secure the title to this property? We should be obliged if you could advise us what steps should be taken to this end, or if there is any possibility of the title being granted. If we held title to the land we should be pleased to arrange transfer of a site for the school building.\n\nMr. Marshall is anxious to have repairs made to the present school building before another winter. He advises that no local authority has as yet been given for this work to be done, and he cannot proceed with the repairs until Mr. Agent Gordon has been authorized to make the necessary expenditure. Perhaps instructions have gone forward covering this matter; if not it would be encouraging to Mr. Marshall and his work if they could be sent forward as soon as possible, in order that the work may be completed before the school re-opens.\n\nYours very Faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary-Treasurer.\nOttawa, July 31, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that His Lordship the Bishop of Keewatin has drawn our attention to the advisability of making some minor repairs on the Jack River Indian Day School, before the coming winter. I should be pleased if you would communicate with the Rev. Mr. Marshall and arrange for an expenditure, if necessary, not exceeding $150. The Department contemplates arranging for an appropriation for the purpose of erecting a day school at this point, during the coming fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nWm Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House,\nMan.\nOttawa, August 1, 1923.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, referring generally to the Jack River Indian Day School. I have to inform you that, immediately upon receipt of this communication, Mr. Indian Agent Gordon, of Norway House, was authorized to expend the sum of $150 on minor repairs to the building.\n\nIn reply to that portion of your letter with reference to the title for the property held by the Jack River mission, I wish to advise you to make official application to M. O. Cote, Esq., Controller, Land Patents Branch, Department of the Interior. You should intimate to him how long this property, which should be described as Lot 61, Norway House Settlement, T. 57, R. 3, W. 1, comprising 32.7 acres, has been occupied by your mission. You may support your application, which should be for a free grant, by referring the Department of the Interior to this Department. Our Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Indian Education, knows the property in question, as he visited the Jack River mission last summer.\n\nI have noted that, if you secure title to the land, you will arrange the transfer of a site for the new day school building, which is contemplated for the coming year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nVery Rev. Canon J. Lofthouse,\nSynod Office,\nDiocese of Keewatin,\nKenora, Ont.\nNovember 14, 1923.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nHis Lordship the Bishop of Keewatin visited the Department today and informed me that the Church Authorities were arranging for title of the mission lot at the Jack River Indian Day School. They are prepared to transfer a site for the new school building, which should be erected early in 1924.\n\nRev. Mr. Marshall, the Missionary, is, to my personal knowledge, a competent carpenter and builder, and, when arrangements are being made for the new structure, I believe it will be well to have it done by day labour, with him as foreman. Mr. Indian Agent Gordon could purchase the materials and supervise the activity.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier\nThe Right Reverend\nLord Bishop of Keewatin\nKenora, Ont.\n\nMy dear Bishop,-\n\nI am forwarding plans and specifications that I procured from Dr. Fletcher of one of their one-roomed schools, highly recommended and approved by the Manitoba Educational Department.\n\nThe best figures I could get on the lumber alone was $1875.00 f.e.b. at Selkirk. The other materials were too jumpy to be able to get a definite estimate, but I was speaking to a contractor who was building the same school with the exception of the porch and who said he only made wages on erecting it for $3000.\n\nI would rather the Indian Department allowed us the privilege of building this school so that we could utilize in the building itself the amount that usually goes as the contractor's profit. We also could use a number of our men, the majority of whom are willing to put in part time gratis if we are given the building of it.\n\nI would also recommend that the foundation be carried down to make a proper basement which could be used as furnace room and place for the children to have their dinner as they are served a hot meal at noon.\n\nIf we are allowed to build we could turn in all accounts to the I.D. office so that it could be seen that every dollar was used in the building, as we sorely need the building and would do all in our power to get it. We are now trying to make accommodation for 38 and there are more to come along as soon as the river becomes safe. It is not a fair proposition to the children, teacher, or the mission workers to ask them to carry on in the present building when it has been condemned by the Department's own men for years.\n\nI know you will do what you can to obtain the school for us.\n\nI remain\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Signed) John F.J. Marshall.\nBishopstowe\nKENORA, ONT.\nDecember 20th, 1923.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy dear Sir,-\n\nUnder another cover I have sent you plans and specifications of schoolhouse proposed for Jack River Mission as supplied by the Manitoba Department of Education.\n\nWe have now received title to the Mission property and are taking steps for the transfer of a site for the school. We are waiting for a description of the portion to be transferred and as soon as this comes to hand the papers will be made out and forwarded. Will you please have the proper official notify me as to the proper name in which to make the transfer.\n\nI am attaching a copy of a letter from Rev. J.F.J. Marshall in reference to the erection of the building. This as you will remember I spoke about to you and you were kind enough to approve, arrangements being made through your agent. I am sure this will be a great advantage.\n\nI trust the Department will see to it that all necessary arrangements are made so that the building of this school may be proceeded with next summer.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6237, file 519-5, part 1)\nOttawa, Dec. 29, 1923.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 20th instant and, under separate cover, plans and specifications for the proposed new Jack River Indian Day School, near Norway House. I have noted that you have secured title to the mission property and are taking steps for the transfer of a site for the school. The transfer should be made to \"His Majesty as represented by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\"\n\nI am pleased to inform Your Lordship that the Deputy Superintendent General and the Honourable the Superintendent General have approved of a new school building for Jack River, and, when the deed to the site is in hand, authority will be given to Mr. Indian Agent Gordon to have the building erected, by day labour, under the supervision of the Rev. Mr. Marshall. The plans and specifications, submitted by you, have been approved by the Department Architect and will be directed to Mr. Indian Agent Gordon, for his guidance.\n\nMay I offer Your Lordship the Compliments of the New Year.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

His Lordship the Bishop of Kewatin has pressed for a new building at this school for some time and the Superintendent of Indian Education, who visited Jack River in 1922, agrees that a proper school is necessary without delay.\n\nThe proposed site is at present Church of England property, but the Department is now in communication with Bishop Dewdney and title to a 200' x 350' lot is being granted to the Crown, gratis. The papers in this connection are now being prepared.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Marshall, the local missionary, is a competent carpenter and builder and he has forwarded to the Department plans prepared by the Manitoba Department of Education. Our Architect has approved of these plans and I am forwarding them to you under separate cover, with the suggestion that you send them to Mr. Indian Agent Gordon. Our representative, with the Rev. Mr. Marshall, can prepare a list of materials that are necessary and arrangements should be made for the purchase and shipment to Jack River as soon as possible. The building should be erected by day labor under the supervision of Mr. Indian Agent Gordon. Mr. Marshall has signified his willingness to assist and I believe should be appointed foreman. Some of the Indians interested have agreed to give part time gratis to the activity. It has been proposed to make a proper basement, which can be used as a furnace room and as a place for serving a hot lunch at noon.\n\nThe shipping season is short for this area and I should be pleased if you would arrange for this building at Jack River as soon as is convenient.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

These plans have not come to hand.\n\nIn this connection I may inform you that I have already obtained a plan for this school from the Saskatchewan Government. This plan has been approved by it and is followed in the construction of the schools throughout this Province. I have also prepared a list of material, and have general arrangements for the construction of this school well under way. This plan, I consider, will admirably fill the requirements at Jack River. I am arranging to send competent, reliable men to do the work. I am not favorably disposed to appointing Rev. Mr. Marshall, the local Missionary, to the position of building foreman. I do not know Mr. Marshall and therefore do not feel like taking the responsibility for work done under his supervision.\n\nI certainly object to having anything to do with Mr. Indian Agent Gordon. This man has not been a success at anything he has undertaken. He has no business ability, is incompetent, and if any responsibility is placed with him, I know we will have trouble. If I am to undertake, and be responsible for the erection of this school, I do not want Mr. Gordon to have any say or authority in the matter whatever.

It is not improbable that the plan you mentioned prepared by the Saskatchewan Government is similar to the one prepared by the Manitoba Department of Education, but unless one is a decided improvement on the other we should use the one of which we had approved.\n\nMr. Marshall is a competent builder and erected his own house which is a well-constructed and comfortable dwelling. He is a practical builder and fully qualified to supervise this construction. However if you do not wish to accept the responsibility of giving him the work, you may adopt whatever course you think advisable.

They are both Provincial Government plans; there is a little difference but not much.\n\nI had already made out bills of material required and got prices from various lumber dealers, and the whole thing is worked up to the point where it is just left to place the order. In view of this I do not think it is necessary to make any change.\n\nI will inquire more about Mr. Marshall and get him to submit prices without delay, and if he is dependable and a competent builder and his price is right he will be given the work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

(RG 10, Volume 6237, file 519-5, part 1)\nJack River Mission,\nNorway House, Man.,\nJune 17th, 1954.\n\nMr. Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Minister of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy dear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am writing this from the Mission House at Jack River, Norway House.\n\nThe Rev. J.F.J. Marshall has shown me correspondence he has received in connection with the erection of the new school.\n\nThis correspondence raises two questions. One has to do with the plans, the Commissioner having submitted a plan used by the Education Department of the Province of Saskatchewan in place of that used by the Education Department of Manitoba which you notified me had been approved and adopted. Except in a few minor details which could be easily adjusted there is little to choose between as to the plans. The principal question is whether, in view of the proposal to ask the Manitoba Education Department for a larger proportion of grant for the yearly maintenance of the school, it is wise to reject their plan for that of another province.\n\nThe more important question has to do with the request which the Commissioner has made of the Rev. Mr. Marshall to submit a tender in competition with regular contractors. Mr. Marshall is not in a position to submit such a tender, nor am I prepared to permit him to take the position of a contractor. He is a missionary, whose practical ability and experiences as a builder is well known. He knows the conditions. He wants the school to be well built and that all the money spent in connection with it shall go into the building. There will be no contractor's profits to be provided for, nor the cost of bringing in outside labour. Native help can be used in a way an outside contractor could not use it and the Indians would have work provided them in a slack season. The Mission also has equipment such as barge, horses etc., used in the erection of our own buildings which would be available if Mr. Marshall erects the building.\n\nMoreover acting upon your decision to have Mr. Marshall carry on the work under the oversight of your agent at Norway House; I have brought in a Divinity Student, who is preparing for Indian work, to assist Mr. Marshall in any way, whether with the mission work or the building so as to make it possible for him to undertake this work without prejudice to our Missionary interests.\nJune 26, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nWith reference to the proposed building of the day school at Jack River, I am in receipt of a letter from His Lordship the Bishop of Keewatin of which this is an extract.\n\n\"The more important question has to do with the request which the Commissioner has made of the Rev.

The only reference to Mr. Marshall's prospective connection with these operations was made in my letter of May 3rd.

John F.J.

The plan is one which has been obtained from the Saskatchewan Government and is used by them.\n\nPlease let me have your quotation for the labour at the earliest possible moment, as I am anxious to proceed with the work without delay.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nRev. J. Marshall,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nYou informed me in your letter of April 17th that the matter of constructing certain buildings in the West was to be left to my judgement to carry out the work as economically as possible.\n\nShortly after receiving this letter you wrote to me regarding the work of erecting a Day School at Jack River in the Norway House Agency, pointing out that there was an item of $4000 for the school. You went on to say that the missionary, Mr. Marshall, was a competent carpenter and builder, that he had forwarded to the Department, plans prepared by the Manitoba Dept. of Education, that your Architect had approved of these plans and then you forward them to me.\n\nI do not think it was fair in the first place to ask me to take charge of the work and then say to whom it was to be handed over. However, I wrote Mr. Marshall and a copy of my letter and also a copy of his reply are attached herewith. I do not judge from his letter that he is all you say he is; in fact he might possibly be what is ordinarily known as a handy man at carpenter work, and a person would be taking a great risk in placing the work in the hands of a man of this kind.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Mac.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI have already sent the material required for the building to Norway House. You will note that Mr. Marshall, the missionary, is quite clear and emphatic about the fact that he should be paid for handling it, that is unloading it from the boat. This is for you to decide whether he should or not.\n\nHad I not received your letter I would have had a man on the job today; as it is the work is being held up. Do you wish me to put this work in the hands of Mr. Marshall, and will the Department pay the accounts for construction. There will be no limit. Mr. Marshall was asked to submit a price and has not done so. I can build a school for less than $800.00 and keep under the amount authorized by the Department.\n\nIt is regrettable that this delay has taken place.\n\nI would judge from your letter regarding the Birtle School that you had the same impression.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., July 2nd, 1924\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to the building of the Jack River Day School, quoting an extract from a letter from the Bishop of Keewatin on this subject. I note from this extract that the Bishop objects to Mr. Marshall submitting a price for the work in connection with erection of the building.\n\nIt is really disappointing to get such a letter from you. In the first place I am given to understand that utmost economy is to be practiced this year in connection with our building programme and I am given the responsibility of erecting certain buildings; on the list is a Day School at Jack River. Later on you write me under date of May 3rd in connection with this matter as follows:\n\n\"The Rev. Mr. Marshall, the local Missionary, is a competent carpenter and builder and he has forwarded to the Department, plans prepared by the Manitoba Dept. of Education.\"\n\nBy the time I received this letter I had already taken action by getting prices from the various lumber Companies, so that there would be no delay. I also had plans on the way to you for approval, which plans were practically the same as the ones later supplied by Mr. Marshall. There is surely no grounds for finding fault here. I objected strongly to Agent Gordon having anything to do with the work for good reasons. I pointed out that I did not know Mr. Marshall and did not feel like taking the responsibility for handing the work over to him without first knowing what the building would cost.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs\nOTTAWA.\nWas not this wise? How was I to know whether the building under this arrangement might not cost twice as much as it should, leaving it to Mr. Marshall, a man whom I did not know; it was not business. Being a competent carpenter, and as your letters distinctly said he would take over the work as foreman, and knowing that there were none other than Indian workmen at Norway House, I naturally thought he was going to work himself, as it would be absurd to have a man looking on at possibly two Indians or half-breeds working and not taking a hand himself.\n\nSummed up the circumstances are as follows,-\n\nYou placed the work of erecting this building in my hands. Later you advise me that Mr. Marshall, the Missionary, is a competent carpenter and that you believed he should be appointed foreman, and Agent Gordon to supervise. I objected to Gordon simply because I know the man's qualifications better than anyone in the Department. Your letter to me would indicate that it was your wish that I should hand the work over to Gordon and Mr. Marshall. I thought this unwise, and still think so. I wanted to find out where we would be in the matter of price and I wrote to Mr. Marshall, and it now turns out that His Lordship objects to Mr. Marshall tendering on the work only; there was no general contract.\n\nIf the matter had been left with me, as I think it should have been, I would have sent in a competent man to do the work, who would have had an understanding with me before he left, and had this arrangement been carried out the responsibility would have been placed with me where it was intended it should be, I would have had the building under way, the Bishop would have been satisfied and all would have been well. Is it business to place the responsibility of erecting buildings and then tell me whom I am to employ?\n\nYou say it was never contemplated in any instance to ask for tenders for any of these buildings. I understand this, and tenders are not being asked for the buildings. The regulations of the Purchasing Commission are being carried out. Lumber and material is bought after asking all dealers for prices. Plans are shown to carpenters and they give us a price for the completed work. Surely this is in line with regulations. I believe the lumber is now on the ground.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6237, file 519-5, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHon. Charles Stewart -\n\nWhen we decided to erect a new day school building at Jack River for the Anglican Mission, we wrote Rt. Rev. A. D. Dewdney, Bishop of Keewatin, and told him it had been decided to erect the building and that the work would be done under the supervision of the resident missionary, Rev. Mr. Marshall, also that authority would be given to Mr. Agent Gordon to have the building erected.\n\nWhen we placed all building work in the Western Provinces in Mr. Graham's hands, I sent him a special letter in connection with this matter and told him Mr. Marshall was a competent builder, and might be given the work. Mr. Ferrier, who visited this point two years ago, is able to certify to the ability of Mr. Marshall, who erected his own house, a commodious and comfortable dwelling at the Mission. Mr. Graham did not approve of this as he stated he knows nothing of Mr. Marshall and has no confidence whatever in the Indian Agent. However he asked Mr. Marshall for a tender for the work, but Bishop Dewdney happened to be at Jack Head at the time and would not allow Mr. Marshall to go into competition with regular contractors. The Bishop writes me under date of June 17th, stating:\n\n\"The more important question has to do with the request which the Commissioner has made of the Rev. Mr. Marshall to submit a tender in competition with regular contractors. Mr. Marshall is not in a position to submit such a tender, nor am I prepared...\"\nto permit him to take the position of a contractor. He is a missionary, whose practical ability and experience as a builder is well known. He knows the conditions. He wants the school to be well built and that all the money spent in connection with it shall go into the building.

Native help can be used in a way an outside contractor could not use it and the Indians would have work provided them in a slack season. The Mission also has equipment such as barge, horses, etc., used in the erection of our own buildings which would be available if Mr. Marshall erects the building.\n\nI find that His Lordship in anticipation of Mr. Marshall doing this work had sent in a student to assist him. Mr. Graham has purchased and sent in the lumber and I think under the circumstances as the Bishop has made these arrangements that we should allow Mr. Marshall to erect the building. The point is so remote, being north of Norway House on Lake Winnipeg, neither Mr. Graham nor any of his Inspectors can give personal supervision.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nJuly 9, 1924.\n\nDR.

Indian Affairs\nJack River Mission,\nNorway House, Man.,\nJuly 16th, 1924\n\nJno. R. Bunn\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Bunn:\n\nI received your letter of June 7th and the material for the school building has come to hand by degrees. We have unloaded it and carefully piled it. The cement we have placed well under cover on the site. The plaster material, since it will be some time before it is needed, we have put into our shed, together with the windows and doors and other hardware. We have the old school building ripped down and everything ready to start as soon as we get word to go ahead. As you are well in touch with circumstances and conditions around this part you will understand that sand will be needed for the foundations, and our nearest sand is eight miles away. We have a barge belonging to the Mission and we are hauling sand this week to put under the old school which we intend to erect and use as a parish hall. If we had word as to what the Commissioner intends to do we could have hauled sand for the school foundations but since he has allowed things to go so late into the season, having time will be coming on and we will be using the barge and horses at the hay meadows. As you are aware, but as others are not, there are only the Indian Agent's barge and our own in this part of the country, and the Agent's barge is at work every day getting in cordwood when the weather permits. Most of our men will be back at the end of this month as fishing has been very poor and the fish companies are shutting down. We could utilize the work of these men who are good carpenters under supervision in helping to push on the erection of the school. I do not understand the ball-up on this school affair. We had instructions from the Superintendent, Mr. Duncan Scott in a letter to the Bishop to go ahead with this work using our Indians and with myself looking after the work. Then on the same mail we had another from Ottawa saying that the matter had been referred to Commissioner Graham, and on the following mail we had one from Commissioner Graham asking me to submit tenders for the labour. As you know, that would be an impossibility for me, breaking both the rules of the Church and those laid down for men working in the Indian field, but as was stated to Mr. Scott by the Bishop, I was perfectly willing and am yet to carry on the work under the former plan of day labour, thereby giving our own men the benefit of the employment and also saving the Department a considerable amount of expenses of higher paid men brought in from outside.\nIn regard to the building, the plans were changed and there was no provision made for the excavation of a basement. We have a team here at the Mission which could take out sufficient for the furnace room, though the plans submitted call for a basement under the whole school which was to be used for the children getting their dinner as we supply them with a hot meal at noon, the cooking being done in our own house. This was to save dirtying up the school-room but as it would be useless to try and present the matter at the present time to the Commissioner, I made the offer to you by the Doctor that we take out sufficient earth to make a furnace room and this would save in the heating plant by putting in a pipeless furnace in the basement. I have made enquiry from every teacher coming in here in the last two years re the heater in the schoolroom and they have all said that they see an absolute failure. One staying here at the present time from a consolidated school west of Winnipeg says that they see ripping them out and putting a furnace plant in the basement. This was a school built only five years ago. You cannot force heat down.\n\nAs you know, the season here is getting on, and I would like you to look into these matters as I am almost sure that the Commissioner at Regina has overlooked or forgotten us altogether. I am awaiting his reply before writing to him again. I answered his letter in June and I judge that he might think it impertinent if I were to write him again.\n\nI know that you have our welfare at heart and I can trust you to do your best for us in the matter. If anything important turns up, if you telephone to Col. Stevenson of the Forestry Department he would send a message through by wireless.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJohn F. J. Marshall\nWinnipeg, 26th July, 1924.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nREGINA, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter that has just come to hand from the Rev'd, J. F. J. Marshall of the Jack River Anglican Mission at Jack River in Norway House Agency, with reference to the new day school building that is to be erected there.\n\nI cannot make any comment, the letter explains the situation fully from Mr. Marshall's view-point.\n\nI have replied to Mr. Marshall that I have placed the matter before you for the action you will decide be best.\n\nIf you can assist in any manner, please direct me and I will do my best to carry out your wishes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJno. R. Bunn\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK. July 29th, 1924\n\nDear Mr. Scott:-\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter that I received from Mr. J.R. Bunn, also copy of one that he received from Mr. John F.J. Marshall, missionary at Norway House. Mr. Marshall's letter is a lengthy one and you will see from it that he is dissatisfied with the way in which the matter is being handled. This dissatisfaction is entirely due to the Department, and had there been no interference after giving me the instructions the building would have been well under way. As it is I do not think that there is much ground for Mr. Marshall's complaint, as I believe it was about this time last year that we were first notified as to the building programme from Ottawa.\n\nIt seems to me that the general feeling towards this office among the missionaries is one of dissatisfaction; first the Presbyterians and Methodists, and now the Anglicans are complaining. They arrange to have buildings put in the estimates and later on we find they are not necessary, consequently there is dissatisfaction.\n\nI certainly am not satisfied with the way in which my instructions have been interfered with. You give me a programme to carry out and distinctly tell me that I am to have charge of it and then it is stopped. Personally I have no desire to work under these conditions, and there will have to be a change if we are going to get anywhere.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAugust 5, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nIn reply to your letter of July 29th, I have to confirm my telegram of the 17th of July, as follows:\n\n\"Kindly carry out your arrangements for erection of Jack River School.\"\n\nI presume that on receipt of this telegram you proceeded with whatever arrangements had been made for the erection of the Jack River School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nKenora, Ont.\nAugust 5th, 1924.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner\nRegina, Sask.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter in reply to mine of the 28th ultimo, re schoolhouse at Jack River Mission, Norway House. I note that it is your intention to send a competent foreman builder up there and that you expect the work will be completed in a workmanlike manner before cold weather sets in. I trust this will be the case, though, owing to the quite inexplicable delay that has already taken place, the re-man opening of the school will be greatly postponed and the best time in the year for school attendance will be missed.\n\nI think it only right to point out that had the plans been carried out adopted by the Deputy Supt. General, of which I was advised, as I was also advised of the suggestion passed on by him to you that the work should be done by day labour with Rev. Mr. Marshall as foreman, the work would by now have been well advanced and the proposed additional cost of sending in a man to do work, which would be well done by a man on the spot, would have been avoided. Whatever the mix-up may be to which you refer neither the Church nor Mr. Marshall are responsible. We have done all we could to expedite matters and Mr. Marshall, with my full approval, has been ready to give his services, and as I pointed out I have had a man there for a month and a half for the express purpose of helping in the Mission work or as might be desired that Mr. Marshall might be free to do the work, for which he is quite competent although, as you say, you do not know him personally.\n\nHaving decided to send in a man, I hope there will be no further delay. Mr. Marshall has been waiting for six weeks for some word as to what was to be done. I think it only fair to him that you should acquaint him of your decision and give him some idea as to when he may expect your foreman builder. It will be necessary for you also to take up with him the question of remuneration for the work he has done in receiving and caring for the materials which he was asked to receive and store.\n\nThanking you for the promptness of your reply, I am,\n\nMost faithfully yours,\n\n(Sgd) A. D. Keewatin.\nMy Lord:-\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, regarding the erection of a school at Jack River, Norway House, Manitoba.\n\nI exceedingly regret that there has been a mix-up over this matter.\n\nI received instructions from the Deputy Superintendent General informing me that it was the intention to erect a Day School at Jack River, and instructing me to proceed with the work. In this letter he mentioned the fact that Mr. Marshall would be willing to undertake the supervision of the work.\n\nI had a certain amount of money allowed for this particular school. I bought the material after getting quotations from the various lumber dealers in Winnipeg and Selkirk. This material was shipped on my instructions to Norway House and addressed to Rev. Mr. Marshall. I wrote to Mr. Marshall with the intention of finding out what the actual labour on such a building would cost. Unfortunately the word \"contract\" was used in the letter. He replied to my letter saying he could not undertake any contract but that he would supervise the work.\n\nWe have in our employ competent foremen builders; men who are capable of building anything in that line, and it was my intention from the beginning to send one of these men up to do the work. It is still my intention to do this and I can assure you that the work will be completed in a workmanlike manner before cold weather sets in.\n\nI regret that there has been a mix-up in this matter, but it is through no fault of mine whatever. I do not know Mr. Marshall personally and I do not feel that I could send a competent builder up there and ask him to take instructions from Mr. Marshall, in view of the fact that these men are entrusted here with responsibilities five and ten times as great as the work that we are to do at Norway House.\n\nI can assure you that the interests of the school will be well looked after and hope that you have not been caused any very great inconvenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) W. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\n(I have done the underscoring. It is obvious that Mr. Graham never intended to give the work to Mr. Marshall, and it was inexcusable not to have so informed him long ago.)\nBishopstowe\nKENORA, ONT.\nAugust 5th, 1924.\n\nRev. A. D. Dingman, D.D.,\nBishop of Kenora,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nMy dear Mr. Scott,-\n\nI regret to trouble you, but I have not received any answer to my letter of June 17th, written from Jack River Mission, Norway House, re the proposed schoolhouse. Nor has Mr. Marshall, up to the date of the last Mail just out, had any word from the Commissioner at Regina to whom he wrote the same date as I wrote you. I have however received a letter from Mr. Graham in answer to inquiries I made of him about a week ago. I enclose a copy of his letter to me and of my reply.\n\nIt is evident that the plan you adopted to build the school by day labour with Mr. Marshall as foreman and which you suggested to the Commissioner has been altered for some (I suppose) sufficient reason. Whatever the cause I am very sorry, but have no desire to go back of the facts. I am however confronted by a situation arising out of the change. Acting on your decision to use Mr. Marshall I engaged a student for the summer to act as his assistant that he might be free to do the work as proposed. Naturally I expected Mr. Marshall to pay him out of his stipend as Missionary while receiving wages as foreman. As things have proceeded the season is half gone and so far, until I received the Commissioner's letter today, we received no word, official or unofficial, as to what was to be done, leaving us in uncertainty but with financial obligations incurred in good faith, I consider that in some way or other compensation should be given to Mr. Marshall so that some part if not all of the cost involved in the engagement of this assistant should be provided. A good deal of work has been done in removing the old building, clearing up, and some excavation in preparation for the work on the school site. There was no intention of making any charge for this work had your plan been carried out. As almost everywhere in Indian work our men are ready to do far more in the interest of the Indians than is ever paid for. It is not fair that they should be out of pocket or that the Church should be out of pocket in trying to carry out efficiently the plans of the Indian Department. I have felt it only right to bring this matter to your attention, assured that your fairness of mind will lead you to do your best to meet the situation in a reasonable way.\n\nAwaiting your kind attention and reply, I am,\n\nMost faithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6237, file 519-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr. Scott:-\n\nI am in receipt of a long letter from His Lordship, the Bishop of Keewatin, with regard to the building of the Day School at Jack River, Norway House Agency.\n\nThe Bishop is undoubtedly under the impression that this work was going to be handed over to the Rev. J.F.J. Marshall, his missionary at that point, and is naturally disappointed with the action I took in the matter. The Department are entirely to blame for giving such an impression to His Lordship, as I was given to understand that there was so much money set aside for the building of this school and the work was placed in my hands. It is true you mentioned that Mr. Marshall was up there, and that he was capable of doing the work and willing to undertake it. I did not know anything about Mr. Marshall; I do not know anything about him today. He might possibly be only a handy man or he might be an experienced builder. However, in view of your letter stating that he was up there I took the matter of building up with him and asked him what he would charge to perform the labour, we to supply the material. This was necessary in order to get competitive prices and to know what the building would cost before we started operations. It appears that this did not meet with the approval of His Lordship the Bishop, or Mr. Marshall.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nWas it your idea that I should let this work go to a man I did not know, who could not even tell me beforehand what the building was going to cost, or where the cost would end. As a matter of fact, Mr. Marshall did not intend to do the work himself.\n\nMight I ask what was the idea of placing the work in my hands if it was not for the purpose of curtailing expenses, and how can expenses be curtailed if the work is taken out of my hands?\n\nWe have had several examples of late where the recommendations of the church authorities to the Government have been acted upon and have been very costly. I quote you the stables at Round Lake and at Portage la Prairie, both of which would have been built had I not advised against it. The extravagance practised in connection with the barn at the Edmonton School. This should show the Department that it should have some control over expenditures instead of leaving it to the church authorities, who are very often impractical.\n\nI might say that I cannot carry on under existing conditions, nor can economy be practised if I have no control. I am criticized by the church authorities, as I told you some time ago I would be, simply because you place me in the awkward positions that you do.\n\nOnly a few minutes ago I received a telegram from you asking what arrangement I had made for the painting at Fort Alexander School, and stating that if nothing had been done you would take the necessary action. What position am I in regard to this particular matter? I get the work started and then it is taken out of my hands, for what reason I do not know.\n\nIn connection with this matter I would draw your attention to the fact that on the 2nd of June, letter #125-1-5 you informed me that only the exterior of the main building of this school was to be painted this year. On the 5th of June you reiterated these instructions. Before I undertook the work I sent Inspector Christianson up to Fort Alexander to make an examination of the building, as I did not feel like incurring expenditure without having first hand knowledge as to what was required. I was not surprised to get a report from the Inspector, saying that\nthe main building had only recently been painted and was in good shape. He said, however, that some of the outbuildings might be painted at a cost of $200.00, and some interior work at a cost of $300.00. This work not being mentioned in your letter to me, and in view of your previous instructions to me that you only intended to paint the exterior of the main building, I did not proceed with the work further, but wrote to you fully on the 23rd of June asking for instructions at once. To this day, August 5th, I have not even received a reply to this important letter, but I might say that I was somewhat surprised to receive your telegram this morning above referred to, taking the work out of my hands, for what reason I do not understand.\n\nWhen I was in Ottawa the Minister assured me that all this kind of work was going to be left for me to deal with, but you seem to be of a different opinion. It was only last week that the Minister reiterated the instructions that he gave me in Ottawa.\n\nI think there should be a thorough understanding now, as no business can be carried on successfully and be mixed up in this way.\n\nIt appears from the actions of the Department that they have no desire to assist me, but rather to complicate matters by bringing in outsiders whose advice is taken before that of your own officer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nAugust 11th, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI have your letter of the 5th August with reference to the day school building at Jack River. My letter of the same date to you confirmed my telegram of July 17th, and I wish to say nothing further than to request you to proceed with your plans for the erection of a school building. I will undertake to correspond with the Rt. Rev. the Bishop of Keewatin. The letter which gave His Lordship the impression that Mr. Marshall was to do this work was written before there was any thought of putting these matters in your hands.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nAugust 11th, 1924.\n\nRight Reverend and dear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 5th August with reference to the erection of the Jack River day school. There has been an unfortunate complication in this matter owing to the fact that after I wrote you on December 29th, all building operations in the Western provinces were placed in the hands of the Indian Commissioner. There were, therefore, two lines of action which we failed to reconcile.\n\nHeadquarters must no doubt take a due share of the responsibility in this matter. I have no intention of allowing you to be out of pocket for any work or arrangements that you may have made at Jack River. It would be particularly the Minister's wish that I should guard against such a contingency. If, therefore, you will get Mr. Marshall to make out a voucher on a basis of wages, or any other method that insures fair payment, of what he and his assistant have done, I shall be glad to honour it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nRt. Rev. A. D.

Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJack River Mission,\nNorway House, Man.,\nAugust 5th, 1924.\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Minister of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing a file of correspondence re Jack River Day School which, if you have a little time to read it, will give you some idea of the way things are being done and some of the difficulties in connection with the erection of it.\n\nWhen this matter was first taken up between the Bishop of Keewatin and yourself, there were a number of things taken into consideration which I have reason to believe have not been passed on to Commissioner Graham or are being completely ignored by him.\n\nI am not ignorant of the difficulties between Ottawa and Regina but do not see why we should be made the bone of contention as it is easily to be seen in the hospital that is being erected at Norway House and the way we are being left without a school which should have been ready by Sept. 1st. We have already taken down the old one to clear the site for the new. We have maintained a school here for twenty-five years and asked nothing towards upkeep and as soon as we ask for a grant or a new one (which met with your approval and which we appreciated very much and which only means an outlay of four or five thousand dollars) our whole proposition is turned down, but when the school at Gross Lake want about thirty-five thousand, the whole contract is handed over to them without even a government inspector.\n\nAfter spending fifteen years working with these people and always upholding the government to them as being right, and in assisting in every way possible the Indian and other Departments, one's confidence is broken by such treatment. I am not sore; I am beyond that but it makes one wonder if the Indian Department cares at all for the people who are doing the actual work among them.\n\nOur plans which you approved of and which others rejected have not even been returned and I am responsible for them to the Manitoba Educational Department. There has been no provision made in the new plans for a basement which was to be used for a\nfurnace and a place where the children could have their dinner. (This is a hot meal prepared and provided at the Mission, not a lunch.) We had promised to have the excavation taken out by our own team, which is already done, but on the order are only seventy-five bags of cement, sufficient only for a floating foundation which you will note in my letter to Mr. Bunn.\n\nI was not asking for the erection of this school to be given into our hands for personal gain but that our people might have the benefit and experience; but all government seems to be given into the hands of outsiders and some not desirable citizens, foreigners, and the Missions and the Hudson's Bay Co. are the only ones who use native labour when building. A good many of our men were willing to give two days each gratis, and then again what is the use of Missions teaching our younger ones carpentry, when, as they say themselves, when there is a board building to be erected they do not get a chance to hammer a nail.\n\nThere are privileges enjoyed among ourselves which cannot be obtained by money and which go a great way towards keeping an isolated community together. At the present time I am using the Hudson's Bay Manager's gasoline boat for towing the barge and have hauled some sand expecting to continue with the building. I cannot use this boat to haul sand for a contractor.\n\nAs you will see in Mr. Bunn's letter I am asked to see that all material is cared for, and Commissioner Graham states in his that he would be glad if I hauled the sand to the site, but in neither letter is mentioned where I am to get the money from to pay for this work. Up to the present I have carried out as far as I can their requests but I have come to the end of my own resources. We could have been using the men's time, my own, and the funds on rebuilding the old school, as we anticipate doing for Parish Hall, and we would then have had a place for the children when the term begins. As it is now there will be extra labour trying to arrange some place for them.\n\nAs you will note any men who could arrive here now, could not possibly come before next boat, August 13th, and then sand has to be hauled, weather permitting. One could not pull out for the lake this week with the high winds blowing. What I have done already for my own use has been done at night.\n\nI hope, sir, that you will not count this forwardness on my part, but as you know we are the ones who have the most at stake. It is our life's work, and with all previous\nThe whole community would be glad to see you, if you wish to spend a week's holiday. It would be a great change for yourself and a benefit all round.

Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nMy dear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 22nd in reference to the erection of the new school at Jack River.\n\nI am a missionary and not a contractor; and having some knowledge and experience in building it was suggested that I should undertake the direction of the building operations. I was willing to do so because I am interested in having the school well built, and, knowing the conditions and being able to utilize the native help, I felt that the contractor's profits being eliminated, it would be to the advantage of the Department as well as of the school.\n\nActing on instructions from Ottawa the Bishop has provided me with a student as assistant for the summer season to enable me to undertake this work. He is prepared to allow me to carry on the work but not to act as a contractor.\n\nI have received through Inspector Bunn your request that I take in charge the materials you are shipping from Selkirk. This I will do, expecting that if an outside contractor should be sent in to erect the school, I shall receive full reimbursement for all work and such charges as a contractor would be liable to in connection with the landing and care of these materials.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nVery obediently yours,\n\n(signed) J.F.J. Marshall.\nJack River Mission,\nNorway House, Man.,\nJuly 16th, 1924.\n\nJno. R. Bunn,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Bunn:\n\nI received your letter of June 7th and the material for the school building has come to hand by degrees. We have unloaded it and carefully piled it. The cement we have placed well under cover on the site. The plaster material, since it will be some time before it is needed, we have put into our shed, together with the windows and doors and other hardware. We have the old school building ripped down and everything ready to start as soon as we get word to go ahead. As you are well in touch with circumstances and conditions around this part, you will understand that sand will be needed for the foundations; and our nearest sand is eight miles away. We have a barge belonging to the Mission and we are hauling sand this week to put under the old school which we intend to re-erect and use as a parish hall. If we had had word as to what the Commissioner intends to do, we could have hauled sand for the school foundations; but since he has allowed things to go so late into the season, having time will be coming on and we will be using the barge and horses at the hay meadows. As you are aware, but as others are not, there are only the Indian Agent's barge and our own in this part of the country; and the Agent's barge is at work every day getting in cordwood when the weather permits. Most of our men will be back at the end of this month as fishing has been very poor and the fish companies are shutting down. We could utilize the work of these men, who are good carpenters under supervision, in helping to push on the erection of the school. I do not understand the ball-up on this school affair. We had instructions from the Superintendent, Mr. Duncan Scott in a letter to the Bishop to go ahead with this work, using our Indians and with myself looking after the work. Then on the same mail we had a letter from Ottawa saying that the matter had been referred to Commissioner Graham, and on the following mail we had one from Commissioner Graham asking me to submit tenders for the labour. As you know, that would be an impossibility for me, breaking both the rules of the Church and those laid down for men working in the Indian field, but as was stated to Mr Scott by the Bishop, I was perfectly willing and am yet to carry on the work under the former plan of day labour, thereby giving our own\nmen the benefit of the employment; and also saving the Department a considerable amount in the expenses of higher paid men brought in from outside.\n\nIn regard to the building, the plans were changed and there was no provision made for the excavation of a basement. We have a team here at the Mission which could take out sufficient earth for the furnace room, though the plans submitted call for a basement under the whole school which was to be used for the children getting their dinner, as we supply them with a hot meal at noon; the cooking being done in our own house. This was to save dirtying up the school room but as it would be useless to try and present the matter at the present time to the Commissioner, I made the offer to you by the Doctor that we take out sufficient earth to make a furnace room and this would save in the heating plant by putting in a pipeless furnace in the basement. I have made enquiry from every teacher coming in here in the last two years re the heater in the schoolroom and they have all said that they are an absolute failure. One staying here at the present time from a consolidated school near Winnipeg says that they are ripping them out and putting a furnace plant in the basement. This was a school built only five years ago. You cannot force heat down.\n\nAs you know, the season here is getting on, and I would like you to look into these matters as I am almost sure that the Commissioner at Regina has overlooked or forgotten us altogether. I am awaiting his reply before writing him again. I answered his letter in June and I judge that he might think it impertinent if I were to write him again.\n\nI know that you have our welfare at heart and I can trust you to do your best for us in the matter. If anything important turns up, if you telephone to Colonel Stevenson of the Forestry Department he would send a message through by wireless.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Signed) J.F.J. Marshall,\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCommissioner's Office,\nRegina, Sask., July 29th, 1924.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nMr. Bunn has forwarded me your letter of the 16th of July addressed to him with regard to the school that it is proposed to build at Norway House; and in reply I may say that the building programme is not late, and so far as Norway House School is concerned, is not being lost sight of.\n\nIn a short time one of our building foremen will proceed to Norway House with the idea of erecting this building. In the meantime I would be glad if you would have sufficient sand brought to the site, so that there will be no time lost after the foreman arrives on the spot. He will take from here one man and possibly engage a couple of others if he can do so; the building to be completed in every respect before he leaves.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. John F.J. Marshall,\nJack River Mission,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\n(Signed) W.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nJohn R. Dunn Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr. Dunn:\n\nAn enclosing copy of letter received August 3rd, mail received by the fishing tug Carry. Some people fully understand conditions and school will be open September 1st.\n\nWe already have excavated for basement. In the excavation there is solid rock that is 6\" from ground level running at right angles to the back wall for a distance of 12', and on the west end at 40' from the other rock, there is rock from 18\" to 2' from surface. Both of these rocks can be used for wall. I have tested the other parts with 5' auger and in places can get down from 3' to 5' with good outlet for drain. I should like to suggest that we make use of this to make almost a full basement so that we could have a proper place for the children to have their dinner. If you will recall the order, there are only 75 bags of cement and would judge that they had in view what is commonly called a floating foundation, and with a little extra cost for more cement we could have the foundation to rock on almost all four sides, which is greatly needed in this country owing to the heaving of the ground.\n\nAs you will see by the enclosed copy the Commissioner would be glad if we hauled sufficient sand to the site. We can get the sand from the banks of Sandy Islands but he does not state a word about other banks we might draw on to pay the men and up to the present have paid from my own account for work already done, but do not feel like risking too much nor have I the funds to continue. I have appealed to Mr. Gordon for funds even for the unloading expenses and he stated that there were no instructions to pay out for the above work, nor had he the money on hand to do it.\n\nI have already saved the Department over one hundred dollars by using a little judgment, taking advantage of the wind, which had been blowing for three days and had raised the water sufficiently, to float the Northern Fish Co.'s freight boat to the rocks close to the school site. The water had not been as high in the last four years as it was those three days. The captain would not believe it until I went out in a skiff and measured the depth. At the present time one could scarcely float a canoe in the same place. The material if landed at our dock which is 16' long would have to be carried by man power to the land and tanned afterwards to the school site, which of course some had to be as it was landed at the dock on other trips but the bulk of the material happened to be on the day of high water.\nJack River Mission,\nNorway House, Man.,\nAugust 5th, 1924\n\nJohn R.

They were both very competent and conscientious in their work and have rendered every assistance possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Signed) John F. Marshall.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of August 15th last, introducing Mr. Henry George, I may say that I regret that I have been unable to render any material assistance to Mr. George, as the distance between the Agency and Jack River Mission, while not great, is considerable by our method of travelling. I did, however, send my boat to assist in hauling some sand.\n\nI may say that I have seen the school today, and consider it a very suitable and satisfactory building. The basement and furnace have added much to the convenience and comfort over what was provided in the original plans. I was surprised to find it so nearly finished.\n\nMr. George, I consider has done good work, and has pushed the work with energy, in the face of bad and unfavorable weather.\n\nRev. Mr. Marshall, the missionary, has also done a great deal of work, in preparing for the building, handling and providing material, excavating, securing men to assist and working himself on the job.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) Wm. Gordon,\nIndian Agent.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI wish to bring to your attention the fact that the day school at Jack River is completed in every detail and is now ready for occupancy.\n\nI would point out that Mr. Henry George, our building foreman left Winnipeg on the 18th of August to start this job, and he was back in the City of Regina on the 16th of September. Taking from this six days for travelling up and down, he completed the whole job in three weeks time, including the installation of the furnace. Mr. George carried back with him letters from the Agent and the Missionary, copies of which I am enclosing herewith.\n\nI may say for your information that the Rev. Mr. Marshall, who is a handy man, was employed by Mr. George as a carpenter on this job and was paid for his work by Mr. George. He may, however, have some little bill against the Department for handling material before Mr. George arrived.\n\nThis building was kept within the amount authorized.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nW. M.

(RG 10, Volume 6237, file 519-5, part 1)\nOttawa, December 12th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nIn August, last, you purchased a quantity of Duroplate blackboard, with chalk trough and moulding, for the use of two schools in the Norway House Agency. Accounts for this material in favour of T. A. Thorburn Co. Ltd., Winnipeg, were forwarded as per your vouchers No. 3038 and No. 3039. Voucher No. 3039 to the amount of $54.82 is for blackboard material for the use of the Jack River Indian Day School, and voucher No. 3038 for an equal amount has also been paid. I shall be pleased if you will state what school the blackboard material on this latter voucher was sent to. As both vouchers are for the same amount, it is difficult to decide whether they are duplicates or for material supplied to two different schools.\n\nYour early reply will oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. R. Bunn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nChambers of Commerce,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nWinnipeg, 15th December, 1924.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:-\n\nRe Duro-plate Blackboard.\n\nI have your letter, number and date as given above.\n\nRe Vouchers #3038 and 3039, these are for two lots, and both went to Jack River Day School.\n\nThe first lot was ordered on the 21st of August from Messrs T.A. Thorburn Co., and then on the 23rd I received a letter from the Rev'd J.F. Marshall, re Black-board, which is as follows:-\n\n\"Also more blackboard, Mr. George says he will need more blackboard, as he only figured for the front of the room and will require some for the side. 3 x 8' lts.\"\n\nOn receipt of this I duplicated the order, and that is how the two vouchers are the same. I got both orders on the same boat.\n\nMr. George was the foreman who figured out the quantities of the materials, and I accepted his requisitions for any materials, and submitted vouchers accordingly.\n\nI hope this will clear up this matter.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nJack River Mission\nNarway House, Man.\nDec. 8, 1924.\n\nRight Reverend\nLord Bishop of Keewatin,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nMy dear Bishop,\n\nHaving been delayed in getting out the following statement, I have made the same act in itemized form giving date of work and hours of labour.\n\nThe Work and Time sheet includes the work of eight different Indians, the labour being done when it was possible to get these men and weather permitting. The last item is my own time for actual work done at the school while these men were under my supervision.\n\nItem 9 on the statement is gasoline bill enclosed. This gasoline was used on the gasoline boat when towing sand.\n\nItem 10 is cement that was borrowed from us which we had for our own use, and which when replaced would\nbe too late for us twice and am therefore sending Mr. Nooker's bill and freight account item. And ten are charged in my own account and therefore responsible for paying them.\n\nIt was fortunate we had the cement on hand as it took considerably more than had been figured on the estimates owing to the size of wall and thickness having to be increased to get a footing on account of the rock.\n\nNow as to student expense, I may say board in this country is high, even the people who keep the inn are not making as much as expected at $3.00 per day and we have charged him $2.50 a meal which only covers the food and are making no charge for lodging.\n\nI think all the other items explain themselves and may state here we have made no charge for use of barges, gasoline boat or other equipment that was used in connection with the building of the school.\n\nAll of which I have the honour to submit.\n\nI am sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJohn F. J. Marshall\nBishopstowe\nKENORA, ONT.\nDecember 20th, 1924.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Supt. General, Ind. Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nI have just received from the Rev. J.F.J. Marshall, Jack River, Norway House, the enclosed statement of costs incurred by him in connection with the erection of the new school at that point. The explanations given in the covering letter to me which I am enclosing will, I think, be ample for the purpose. If you should desire any further explanations I shall be pleased to do my best to provide the same.\n\nI hope you will expedite the payment of the account as Mr. Marshall has advanced payments made for labour, etc., and has had to overdraw his account in the Diocese. The student also has only received a portion of the amount to which he is entitled for his summer's work, and I would again remind you of our correspondence in that connection.\n\nAwaiting your kind attention,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nMost faithfully yours,\n\nA.D.

Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Rev. W. H. J. Walter, the missionary in charge of the Anglican Mission at Jack River, Norway House, has recently written to us in reference to the Day School at Jack River.\n\nFor a number of years the former missionary, the Rev. J. F. J. Marshall provided a hot meal for the children of the school at midday on each school day. This has been of great benefit to the children, according to testimony received during the incumbency of Mr. Marshall, and as seen in the good health of the children.\n\nThe Rev. W. H. J. Walter now writes, stating \"it is necessary for the children to have something hot at midday\", but, \"he cannot afford to feed these children\".\n\nThe grants from the Department of Indian Affairs and the Department of Education of the Province of Manitoba are paid in full as salary to Miss Bagshaw, the teacher, and the Rev. W. H. J. Walter and his wife, on their limited income, have thus far, provided and cooked the meal as above.\n\nWould it be possible for the Department to make an additional grant of $100.00 per year to the Jack River school for the purpose of providing this midday meal for the children, thus making the annual grant $750.00, this additional $100.00 to be paid by us to the missionary?\n\nAs the matter stands at present, the missionary receives nothing whatever from the Department, and it is obvious that he cannot be expected to provide the \"necessary\" meal as above unless some financial provision can be made.\n\nTrusting this will receive your favourable consideration,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6237, file 519-5, part 1)\nOttawa, February 16, 1927.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, relative to the providing of a midday meal to the pupils of the Jack River Anglican Indian Day School and requesting that the Department make a grant of $100 per year for this purpose.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will instruct the local Indian Agent, Mr. Wm. Gordon, at Norway House, to supply the teacher with the necessary food supplies for the serving of the meal. We prefer to have the agent arrange for the purchase of these supplies rather than to make an additional grant towards the teacher's salary, as requested by you. The agent will be informed that he may incur an expenditure during each teaching year for the purpose of purchasing the supplies necessary to an amount not exceeding $100.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nVery Rev. Canon J. L. Boffhouse,\nSynod Office,\nKenora, Ont.\nOttawa, February 16, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nA request has been received from the church authorities under whose auspices the Jack River Anglican Indian Day School is conducted that a hot meal at midday be provided to the pupils. We understand that the teacher and the wife of the missionary, with the assistance of the older girls in the school, will arrange to prepare and serve the meal.\n\nI have, therefore, to request that you will arrange to purchase and forward as soon as possible the supplies necessary for the midday meal, such as tea, sugar, coconuts, condensed milk, beans, rice, salt, etc. The Department will approve of a total expenditure for the purpose not exceeding $100 for the period from March 1, 1927, to March 1, 1928. You may have the supplies forwarded from time to time - it being considered that a few months' provisions at a time would be satisfactory.\n\nPlease forward properly certified accounts covering the expenditure incurred after each purchase by you at various times during the year. Should any utensils be required by the teacher in the preparation and serving of this midday meal, you may also arrange for their purchase and delivery. The Department will rely on you to see that no unnecessary expense is incurred. I have to request that you will have the first shipment of the above mentioned supplies forwarded as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nWm.

It is noted that both these types of desks are at present in use in the school. You should request the above firms to quote their prices F.O.B. the nearest point to the school.

Walter, Norway House, Man., for supplies for hot lunch, J.R.C.E.

(RG 10, Volume 6237, file 519-5, part 1)\nOttawa, February 14th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your Voucher No. 224, for $54.75, in connection with the midday meal served at the Jack River C. E. Indian Day School for the period September to December, 1932.\n\nOwing to lack of funds, the Department has found it necessary to reduce, as far as possible, the amount expended for midday meal purposes. In reviewing the account which you submitted, it is considered that the cost of the midday meal could be reduced and you should at once discuss the matter with the teacher with a view to effecting this result. The midday meal should be discontinued at the end of March.\n\nBefore the opening of the next school year on September 1st, next, you should communicate with the Department with a view to ascertaining what amount, if any, will be available for midday meal purposes for the academic year 1933-34.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter No.123-7-5, dated February 14th last, which was received here about the middle of March, would say that I immediately informed Rev. W. H. J. Walter, who is in charge of the Jack River Anglican Mission of your decision. As a consequence there will be no change on the Department for the June Quarter for issues to the children of this Day School.\n\nI have received a letter in reply to mine passing on the information to Mr. Walter, and I am pleased to forward a copy of the contents. It is pleasing when Mission workers appreciate the co-operation of the Department, and when the said workers are willing to co-operate with the Department in any help to the Indian people. The following is a copy of Mr. Walter's letter:\n\n\"Dear Mr. Gordon,\n\nI received your letter re stopping the allowance for meals for the school at the end of March. We are sorry, of course, but we would like you to convey to the Indian Department our thanks for the help that we have received in this way since we have been here. I have always found the Department very generous and common gratitude compels me to write this letter to you. Mrs. Walter and I have talked it over and have decided to give a meal of some sort as we have been doing.\n\nAgain thanking you\n\nI remain,\nYours truly,\n\nW. H. J. Walter.\"\n\nMrs. Walter has prepared these meals during the years they have been allowed, without any reward other than that which comes from the results of the work itself.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\n**SCHOOLS**\n\n| Description                                                                 | Quantity | Unit Price | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|---------|\n| Freight, Biscuits & supplies to inland posts                              |          |            | $350.00 |\n| General repairs, Oxford House Day School                                   |          |            | $50.00  |\n| Painting, Jack River, C.H.

Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nAttention Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter 123-7-4 of July 31, 1933, I would say that the window blinds are very necessary for the Jack River Church of England Day School. Good blinds may be purchased at $1.25 each.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWm Gordon\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 23, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 15th instant, I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of six window blinds, of the dimensions required, for the Jack River Anglican Indian Day School. It is noted that the cost will be $1.25 each. After the purchase has been made, please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House,\nMan.\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nI beg to submit a report on the Jack River Church of England Indian Day School, visited August 9th, 1933.\n\nMrs. E. Gall is the teacher in charge, and holds her second class permanent certificate.\n\nThere are forty-two children enrolled but the attendance is very poor. I would refer the Department to Mr. Dunlop's report in connection with attendance.\n\nThe interior wall of the school is very dirty. It was erected some nine years ago, and no interior decoration has yet been carried out. The school is also badly in need of exterior painting. The original coat of paint has almost entirely disappeared. The blackboard is badly pitted and should be repainted. This repair should be carried out this fall if at all possible.\n\nThe building is heated by a furnace in the basement, and I understand the building is quite comfortable. Biscuits and soup are served the children at noon.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector,\nManitoba Inspectorate.\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nthe aggregate attendance at the Roman Catholic School for the past year was more than twenty per cent greater than that of the United Church School.\n\nSince the Jack River Roman Catholic School will be receiving a per capita grant for 20 pupils there will be very few Treaty Day School pupils and I can supply the Cross Lake R. C. Day School with biscuits from the surplus allowed for Jack River School.\n\nIf funds will allow I would recommend that the supplies asked for as above be purchased by Inspector Hamilton and shipped to Norway House at as early a date as possible so that I may have opportunity to forward to Cross Lake and Oxford House by canoe before the close of navigation on the inland waters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWm Gordon,\nIndian Agent.\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn conformity with your instructions in the closing paragraph of your letter No. 123-7-5 of February 14th last I am asking what may be permitted for mid-day meal purposes for Day Schools for this Agency for the Academic year 1933-34?\n\nI would suggest that the following be supplied:\n\nJack River Church of England Day School\n\n| Item       | Quantity |\n|------------|----------|\n| Cocoa      | 30 lbs.  |\n| Sugar      | 100      |\n| Beans      | 200      |\n| Rice       | 100      |\n| Salt       | 10       |\n\nOxford House United Church Day School\n\n| Item       | Quantity |\n|------------|----------|\n| Sugar      | 100 lbs. |\n| Beans      | 100      |\n| Rice       | 100      |\n| Salt       | 10       |\n| Plates, granite | 6 only   |\n| Cups, granite | 6        |\n| Kettle, 6 quart | 1       |\n\nCross Lake United Church Day School\n\n| Item       | Quantity |\n|------------|----------|\n| Cocoa      | 20 lbs.  |\n| Sugar      | 100      |\n| Beans      | 200      |\n| Rice       | 100      |\n| Salt       | 10       |\n| Kettle, 6 quart | 1 only   |\n\nCross Lake Roman Catholic Day School\n\n| Item       | Quantity |\n|------------|----------|\n| Cocoa      | 80 lbs.  |\n| Sugar      | 150      |\n| Beans      | 200      |\n| Rice       | 100      |\n| Salt       | 10       |\n\nWith regard to the Cross Lake R. C. Day School, the Rev. Father Trudeau has asked that he be supplied for this year with the same supplies as the other Day Schools. I have asked for a slightly larger quantity than for the United Church Day School at Cross Lake as\nOttawa, September 2, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th ultimo, regarding midday meal supplies for the four Day Schools in the Norway House agency, the Department regrets that you did not reply at an earlier date to official letter of February 14th, last. Our funds this year are so limited, that it is only possible to consider authorizing supplies for midday meal purposes from November first to April first. In view of the quantity of biscuits already shipped to you, it is considered that, for the period mentioned, the quantities of supplies requested in your letter of the 24th ultimo are excessive. Instructions are therefore being issued to Inspector Hamilton to purchase the following:\n\n- 100 lbs. Cocoa,\n- 6 Plates,\n- 200 lbs. Sugar,\n- 6 Cups,\n- 20 lbs. Salt,\n- 2 - 6 quart Kettles.\n- 500 lbs. Beans,\n\nWhen you receive the above supplies, you may distribute them in the best manner possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nOttawa, September 2, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to request you to purchase the following midday meal supplies for the Jack River, Oxford House, Cross Lake United Church, and Cross Lake R. C. Indian Day Schools:\n\n- 100 lbs. Cocoa,\n- 6 Plates,\n- 200 lbs. Sugar,\n- 6 Cups,\n- 500 lbs. Beans,\n- 2 - 6 quart Kettles.\n- 20 lbs. Salt,\n\nThe above should be forwarded to Wm. Gordon, Indian Agent, Norway House, as soon as possible, in order that he may have an opportunity to forward the supplies for Cross Lake and Oxford House by canoe before the close of navigation on the inland waters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, September 13, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to official letter of the 2nd instant regarding midday meal supplies for the schools in the Norway House Agency, I beg to say that Reverend Father Trudeau visited the Department yesterday and requested that biscuits be supplied to the Cross Lake R.C. School in the same manner as they are to the other schools in your agency.\n\nIf you have not sufficient biscuits on hand to give the Cross Lake R.C. School a reasonable supply, you should at once communicate with Mr. Inspector Hamilton and arrange with him to purchase some additional biscuits and forward them to you. It is understood that the last boat on Lake Winnipeg will leave Selkirk about the 9th proxime.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nWm.

C. Indian Day School:\n\n5 - No. 2 Single Rear Seats\n1 - No. 4 Single Desk\n\nYou will remember that you were authorized by official letter of September 18th, 1928, to purchase desks, etc., for this school and you secured same from the Western Seating Company. You should, therefore, purchase the rear seats and desks mentioned above at as reasonable a cost as possible from the same firm and arrange for their immediate shipment to William Gordon, Esq., Indian Agent, Norway House. You should submit to the Department a certified account, in duplicate, covering the cost of these, to which you should attach receipts for the payment of freight.\n\nThe Department understands that navigation on Lake Winnipeg will close soon and I trust that you will give this matter your immediate attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn R. Bunn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCommercial Bldg.,\nSt. Boniface St.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6237, file 520-5, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that on the 17th instant I inspected the Roman Catholic Indian Day School on the Jack River.\n\nThere are 15 pupils on the roll at this school, 7 of whom are non-treaty, and the average attendance is fair.\n\nThe pupils were all very clean and well clothed.\n\nThe teacher, Reverend Sister St Patrick, is new to the work among Indian children, but is very keenly interested in it and is doing well. The discipline was very good indeed.\n\nThe school building was perfectly clean in every part, and all the equipment well cared for.\n\nDuring the summer of 1934 a new dormitory was completed in the upper floor of the building, with the idea of having resident pupils, and the Principal, Rev; Albert Chamberland O.M.I. requests the approval of the Department to the use of this dormitory, and thus making this school into a Residential School.\n\nFor the better information of the Department, I am attaching hereto a rough sketch of a cross section, and the floor lay-out of the dormitory in question. The area of the floor, excluding the dormer windows, of which there are four, is 27'-0\" X 38'-0\" and the height of the ceiling is from 31'-0\" at the walls, sloping up to 7'-0\" as the maximum height.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.;\nThere are 13 beds installed in this dormitory at the present time, but I understand that the idea is to have 20 beds eventually.\n\nThere is a toilet built into the wall near the stairs, which is a very small place, being no larger than a fair sized packing box. There is a small ventilator installed in the ceiling of the toilet, leading to the outside through the roof.\n\nI may say that I have been discussing this matter with Dr Turpel, and he expresses the opinion that there is not sufficient space in this dormitory to accommodate 20 pupils and keep the air in it as fresh as it should be kept, especially when the tendency of these Indian children to T.B. is taken into consideration.\n\nI should be glad if the Department would advise me of its opinion in regard to this dormitory.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 11, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st ultimo, reporting on your inspection of the Jack River R. C. Indian Day School and enclosing a sketch of a dormitory that was contemplated to be built on the upper floor of the building, with the idea of having resident pupils. The Department is pleased to note that the day school is making progress and that the building is in good condition and all equipment well cared for.\n\nRegarding the new dormitory, I would say that, from the information and sketch which you forwarded, the Department is not favorably disposed to the use of same as sleeping accommodation for Indian children as there is considerable fire hazard. Please furnish further particulars regarding the stairway leading up to the dormitory and state if you consider same to be satisfactory in allowing the pupils easy access to and from the dormitory. You should also furnish full particulars as to the fire escape arrangements. It is noted from the sketch that there are double doors leading to a platform, with pole fire escape.\n\nFrom the dimensions given of the dormitory, it is noted that there would be air space available for approximately ten pupils. In the event of the dormitory being used, it is doubtful if the Department would have any funds to provide a grant towards the maintenance of any number in excess of the present number for the children attending the residential school at that point. As you may be aware, the Department provides a per capita grant for 30 pupils, approximately 10 of whom are at Gross Lake and 20 at Jack River.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your opinion regarding the suitability of the dormitory on the upper floor of the day school building from a health standpoint, also regarding the fire hazard and fire escape arrangements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nP. G. Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nNew Dormitory\n\nFirst Floor\nBasement\n\nJack River R.C. Day School\nNorway House Agency\n\nShowing Fire Escapes from new dormitory.\n\n28-2-35\nNorway House, Man.\n28th February 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that today I visited the Jack River R.C. Indian Day School, and made another inspection of this school, particularly in connection with the new dormitory, in accordance with instructions contained in your letter No; 123-10-5 of the 11th instant.\n\nThe whole school throughout, was in very clean and orderly condition. There were 29 pupils present in the classroom, all clean and well clothed, 22 of whom were in residence in the building. The classroom register was marked up to date.\n\nWith regard to the stairway leading up to the new dormitory from the floor below, I beg to say that this is a 'closed' stair well in the upper half. The distance between the walls of this stair well, is but 27 inches, with the stairs between, which is extremely narrow of course. There are 15 steps, the lowest three or four turning at a right angle into the corridor of the floor below the dormitory. The ceiling of the dormitory is only about 5' 4\" above the top step of the stairs, so that a grown person must stoop down when going on to the stairs from the dormitory, in order to avoid knocking the head against the ceiling. After descending two or three steps however, one can walk upright the rest of the way down the stairs. If there were 20 pupils sleeping in this dormitory, (as requested by the Principal), and a fire should occur in such a way as to block access to the fire escape pole, these stairs would, in my opinion, prove very inadequate to evacuate the pupils from the dormitory, especially if any panic should occur.\n\nWith regard to the fire escape arrangements,\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont;\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6237, file 520-5, part 1)\nas shown on the sketch I forwarded with my letter of the 21st January last, there is a double door at one end of the dormitory in question, which leads on to a small platform. There is a hole in this platform, through which there is a 1\u00bd inch pipe pole, descending to a similar platform at the floor below, from which there is a 2 inch pipe pole to the ground. At the time of my January inspection of this school, the double doors leading from the top (new) dormitory to the fire escape platform, were frozen so that they could not have been opened in case of a fire, excepting with the use of an axe. These doors were frozen again today, but not so badly, as they were opened with a little extra exertion. Both the Principal and the Sister Superior informed me that the pupils are all adept in sliding down the fire escape poles, using them as means of reaching the ground at any time, instead of going down the stairs.\n\nThere are three hand fire extinguishers, of about 2\u00bd gallon capacity, in the building, one in the basement, one in the kitchen, and one on the first floor. There is no extinguisher on the floor where the new dormitory is located. There should be, I consider, at least two more extinguishers of 2\u00bd gallon capacity, and about 6 small ones on the walls of this building, located in various easily reached positions, as there is no water system for fire protection. The risk of fire from the chimneys is, I consider, very small. There are but two chimneys; one from the kitchen and one from the fires in the boiler room. Both chimneys are well built of stone and brick, and both are located outside of the building.\n\nConsidering the new dormitory from the standpoint of the health of the pupils, I cannot think that it is suitable, owing to its very low ceiling, and the great tendency of these children to Tuberculosis. I may say also, that I have consulted with Dr Turpel, and he agrees with me in this. There are 13 beds in this dormitory at the present time.\n\nI may mention that the Reverend Principal informed me.\ninformed me, while discussing the matter of this new dormitory today, that last year, the Department had promised the Rev. Father Lajeunesse, that the grant for this school would be increased, if a new dormitory were provided to accommodate additional pupils.\n\nI am attaching hereto, a rough sketch, which shows the fire escape poles to reach the ground from the new dormitory.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. La\u00dfenby\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 31, 1944.\n\nMr. P.G. Lazenby, Indian Agent, Norway House, Man.\n\nA request has been received for a grant to enable a midday lunch to be served to the pupils of the Jask River R.C. Day School.

By Rule 10 the average attendance is found by dividing the total number of days attendance of all the pupils by the number of school days in the Quarter and by Rule 5 all authorized holidays are allowed and will be paid for. The number of school days in the Quarter was 65,- School open 40 days, authorized holidays 25, aggregate attendance 197,- deducting the 25 authorized holidays from the 65 days in the Quarter leaves 40 school days, which divided into 197 gives 4.92 average for the Quarter. The Department would like you to see that the average is calculated in this manner by the teachers of all schools in your Superintendency.\n\nAs the wording of Rules 5 and 10 is somewhat conflicting it will be changed so that no doubt may exist as to what is meant by the average attendance for the Quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

I am informed that owing to a further reduction ordered to be made in the Estimates at Ottawa, it was found necessary to strike out the $100 allowed there for the new School House referred to.\n\nAs the building at present in use is so dilapidated that the\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nSchool will have to be closed if there is no fund to build a new one.\n\nI beg respectfully to request that the amount struck out from the Estimates for 1895-96 be re-estimated for the fiscal year 1896-97.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Ind. Agencies\nSir,\n\nIn answer to your letter of the 9th Instant, enclosing another one addressed to Reverend George Bruce from Councillor Watson, asking for a Protestant teacher to be appointed at Red Creek to teach the subscribed Protestant children there, I have the honour to report that after enquiries made in the matter I find that there is good reason to believe that it was upon the suggestion of the Reverend George Bruce himself, through William Warkman, a non-treaty Half-Breed, old Watson's son-in-law, living next to the Lake Manitoba Reserve, at Dog Lake Valley, who is anxious to have a Protestant school close by his own place for the benefit of his own\n\nC. McColl, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg,\nMan.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6237, file 521-1, part 1)\nChildren; hence that the 1st councillor Wattensent said document, he who wrote the letter is Mr. McRee, interpreter, the interpreter being the said William Monkman, but I have to remark that the chief interviewed two of those whose names appeared on said paper who told him positively that they had given their assent sense of putting their names to said request for the only purpose of begging from the Department the building of a new school house but nothing else. So was it with their father Wahkese, the 2nd councillor, for it is his two sons, Pabawie and Nipopinai whom he met. Further, it was stated by reliable and trustworthy persons that Wahwahgweish and Chobin now absent, had told them that they had consented to have their names put on Wattensent's letter for no other purpose but to beg from the Department the building of a new school house solely on the main\nmain road, and nothing else, as they are quite satisfied of the present schools, and George Bone denies emphatically having authorized any one to use his name for any purpose whatsoever.\n\nReferring to those eleven children of the Bones mentioned in Watson's letter, who are non-treaty Half-Breeds and living next to the Reserve at Garden Point, I would beg to suggest that they would apply to the local Government for a school and not interfere with our affairs thereby wishing to put the Department to that excessive expense of starting another school for their own benefit, when they are not its wards.\n\nI have also to remark to you the following glaring childish falsehood contained in that letter addressed to the Reverend George Bruce. The Priest was never in the way of the school teacher, but having a separate room to teach those willing to learn them the first principles.\nprinciples of the Catholic faith; the pagan children being taught the daily school routine in the school house proper.\n\nThe present school teacher has never traded and I believe never will, therefore the school house was never used as a store.\n\nMoreover it was not mentioned of late, to my knowledge, that the school house be built farther South; but, on the contrary, I heard that if the Department granted Wattam's request another application would be made for funds to build the new one further North at Ootruki (Wahpepenais) and Chepence promising to move their old residences at that place, trying at the same time to entice all those they could to do the same, which would mean the breaking up of the present school which functions to the satisfaction of the majority of the Band, and I may add, to the satisfaction of every one in that Reserve, till lately when...\nwhen, owing to the under-\nhand work of some known\noutsiders, the harmony and\ncontentment reigning between\nthem was suddenly disturbed\nto which matter the chief\ninforms me he has already\nhad the honour to draw\nyour attention.\n\nI would beg of you to\nlet me know as soon as\npossible if the Department is to\nmake any change that is\ndesigned to prevent school\nteachers or continue herein her\nwork which latter course I\nfervently hope the Department\nshall follow as it would be\na crying injustice to dismiss\na person who thoroughly\nfulfills her duties, as can\nbe seen by the progress\ndone by the children\nsince their appointment.\nIn conclusion I beg to state\nthat this request should\nnot be entertained by the\nDepartment, in so far\nthat there is only one protestant\nchild aged nineteen,\nMary Sheppard, therefore\nnot of school age, living\ntowards Dog Creek, and\nlately.\nlately baptized by Reverend George Bruce about two months ago, this being his first visit on this reserve for an indefinite period. Consequently I do not see for what reason another teacher should be appointed, when the present one is competent in every way and professing the same religion, Roman Catholic, as the majority of the people of this Reserve.\n\nTherefore I hope you will take this important affair under your consideration and give us you always did, a just and impartial decision in the whole matter.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nM.M. [Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nEnclosed please find copy of a protest signed by self, and by the third and fourth councillors of the Band against a request sent to you concerning some of the most vital interests of the Reserve. I am completely ignorant of the contents of said request although I know what they are for. I am sorry to say that meetings were rarely held, resolutions passed and proceedings taken hence without my knowledge and approval; whereas the fact that I was of use to help one to have any authority upheld and respected in the Reserve. I am also sorry to add that these understandings were based upon the advice of outsiders who far from having at least the welfare of my people at heart, too anxious to secure any means to throw around among them provided their personal aims are attained and their ambition satisfied.

(RG 10, Volume 6237, file 521-1, part 1)\nI first visited the Lake Manitoba School on the 8th of July, 1897; the attendance was very small, and the children backward in their work. Miss Goulet was acting as teacher for her Father. The explanation given by the teacher for the condition of affairs was that the School was disorganized at the time owing to the removal from the old school building to the new. The explanation appeared reasonable. The following day I met the Indians in Council and they complained of the School not being satisfactory. I also noticed that the relations between the Indians and Miss Goulet were not very friendly.\n\nMy next visit was on the 5th of Aug., 1898; the attendance on this occasion was 20 with an average for the previous quarter of 16.84/100. The School work was under the charge of the Misses Goulet, and was an improvement on the previous year, but still left room for much criticism. The Indians had no complaints to make, and nothing was said by them in regard to the School.\n\nThe past year I visited the School on the 19th of Aug., and was informed by Mr. Goulet, after waiting some time, that he could not get the children together, and he informed me that there had been no school for some time as the parents would not send the children. The attendance for the previous quarter as per the returns was 5.60/100. I requested Mr. Goulet to let me see the School register, and he informed me that it was not in the School but thought it was in the Church. He further stated that he was completely discouraged and wished to resign.\nthe Indians were not friendly to him and would not send their children to the school, I informed him that I thought it was the best thing to do under the circumstances and suggested to him that he might send it in to me to take effect as he might desire, at the end of the Sep't or December quarter, later in the day I met the Indians in Council, I spoke to them about the condition of the school, and lack of attendance, an answer one of the Councillors stated that when they sent their children there was no teacher at the school, Mr. Coulet in reply stated that there was no use in going to the school when they would not send their children, I informed the Indians that if they did not send their children that I would recommend the Department to close the school as it was useless to provide a teacher in they did not take sufficient interest to send their children, I further told them to start sending them at once and Mr. Coulet or some other teacher would be on hand to teach them, their reply was that they wanted an English Teacher and that Mr. Coulet did not teach the children properly, I told them that the matter of a teacher was largely in the hands of the Church and that they should know best the kind of teacher required, I further told them that Mr. Coulet intended to resign shortly, and at his request I asked them to treat him and his family kindly, and as the winter was approaching to allow him to remain on the reserve if he wished until spring, and render him all the assistance they could.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6237, file 521-1, part 1)\nOn my return home I waited some time before making my report for Mr. Coulet's resignation but it did not come to hand.\n\nI might further state that the Rev'd Father Choseau was present at the time of my visit representing the R.C. Church and he was not at all satisfied with the state of affairs and told me there would have to be a change of teachers.\n\nOn behalf of Mr. Coulet I would like to say I think he was quite competent to teach the School but owing to the difference existing between him and the Indians, and the sectional differences between them in regard to him which he was unable to heal, his usefulness was gone, and he quite freely admitted it. In my intercourse with Mr. Coulet I always found him a Gentleman. I was simply trying to do my duty in my official capacity in recommending a change.\n\nOn the 14th of November I received a letter from Mr. Coulet asking to be re-instated, and I hereby attach my reply.\n\nI also attach a copy of a telegram received from Mr. John A. Macdonell M.P., re the matter, and my reply.\n\nYou will notice that Mr. Berkenauer requests an early answer to his letter, and no doubt would like to have an explanation of why he has been deposed.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.R.

For a number of years the band has not worked well together and it seems that the most desirable party needed under the circumstances would be one who would pull well with every member of the same.

The average attendance is five owing mostly to sicknesses of the pupils and parents taking their children away for the summer with domestics for the purpose of fishing, trapping, hunting, and visiting friends. The school has been kept with a very poor attendance so much so that the teacher has decided to resign, if the Indians do not send their children regularly to school in future; in consequence, the pupils are only advanced to Standard II, and a few in Standard III. The school is of the Roman Catholic denomination. The school-house, which is new, is comfortable for the pupils, and is well supplied with material, books and biscuit. The progress is very slow in many cases. The discipline and behaviour are good.\n\nHas there been any correspondence in this matter?\n\n(Page 81 Annual Report)\n\nIndian Affairs.

In 1907 I arrived from Ottawa too late to take advantage of the annuity payment trip up the lake, and in 1908 I was sent to make the payments in the Kenora and Savanne Agencies and at Osneburg.

He told me that the teacher of the school is away, having closed it up on account of so many of the band being away with their families. He also tells me that the teacher is now boarding off the reserve with a family named Stevenson, about six miles from the school. The band often want medicines but cannot get it from the teacher as he is too far away.\n\nI visited the school house and found it locked up tight. A former teacher named Martell, a brother of the present teacher, broke up a garden close to the school, had it nicely fenced, and it was a credit to the reserve. At the time of my visit the garden was a mass of weeds and most of the fence was broken down. This speaks badly for the present teacher and is a very bad example for the Indians and in fact shows this teacher is not fit for his position. There are living quarters above the school.\nDear Sir,\n\nI hereby beg to tender my resignation as school teacher to the Siksika Indian Reserve.\n\nOwing to the lack of interest displayed by the Indians relative to the school, it makes it impossible for me to work there, to the satisfaction of both parties, and further the attendance does not warrant a school teacher.\n\nTrusting you will give this matter your immediate attention,\n\nI am yours respectfully,\n\nR.O.

It takes in sections 1, 2, 11, 12, 13, 14, 23, 24, etc., if I am informed correctly. In the remaining portion of this township there are some Scotch half-breed families. I understand there are several families by the name of Monkman and one or two named Spence. It has been said that a number of these people receive treaty.\n\nThe question of school accommodation for the community is now before us. A district is being formed which will include the land upon which these people reside. They are too far from the school on the reserve and it occurs to me that if they are receiving treaty your Department may be prepared to co-operate with us in the establishment of a school for them.\n\nI shall be glad to know if any of them do receive treaty, and if so, whether or not you will be prepared to join with us in the expense of providing education for them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

The average attendance dropped to four for the last quarter the school was open and the majority of the Indians live three or four miles from the school.\n\nLast August Mr. Fletcher was informed that the Department was not prepared to re-open the school on this reserve, and that it had no funds available for a building.\n\nMr. Fletcher, in his letter above referred to, states that the white settlers are about to form a school section and that he understands that there are several half-breed families whose children could attend the school, and he mentions one by the name of Monkman and another named Spence, who are receiving treaty. I could find no trace of Spence on the pay list, but there is a Mrs. Monkman who draws treaty, but she has no children on the list. If a school were established in the locality referred to by Mr. Fletcher it would be of no use to the Indians on the reserve.\n\nWe have little or no information about these Indians and I would suggest that, before giving a definite answer to Mr. Fletcher, Mr. Agent Ogletree be asked for a report.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Martel.\n\nThe present school building is in fair condition and it is not necessary to obtain another building for winter use, this building should be papered and sided on the outside and the foundation fixed up, for it is very cold in winter. I cannot recommend a great expenditure on this school, as my experience in the last few years, we had a teacher, was that the children would not attend.\n\nIn the summer time most of these Indians leave this Reserve with their families, and in the winter time, they claim it is too cold for the children to go two or three miles to school.

He is being informed that his resignation is accepted.\n\nYou will be good enough to consult the Roman Catholic Church authorities with a view to obtaining a suitable teacher to begin duties, if possible, upon the reopening of the school after the Easter holidays. The name, age, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated for this school should be forwarded for the consideration of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. Ogletree, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nget married and assured me he would devote himself most earnestly and constantly for the interests of the Indians.\n\nNow, as he is married and his wife has been teaching previously for many years, no doubt he would carry out his promises, he would give complete satisfaction. As there is no more opposition from the part of the Indians, consequently, I recommend him and I ask you to appoint him at once, teacher of the Dog Creek Indian Reserve School, as Mr. H. S. Springer has resigned at the end of March.\n\nNow, the question of a residence for the teacher has not been solved yet, although you promised to do so, as per your letter No. 116758/1, you must understand it is almost impossible for me to find a reliable teacher, if he has to take his residence in a corner of the school house, as did Mr. H. Springer last winter, especially if he is married and has a family. Therefore, I ask you to give at once to the matter your most earnest attention, and provide for a residence intended for the teacher, either as suggested by me, or in any other way you deem the most convenient.\n\nThe school attendance has been very good last winter, most of the parents have made their duty in this respect, sending to school their children at any time, sometimes from a long distance. This fact should justify and prompt the Indian Department to make the expenses for a residence for the teacher in order to assure to the Indians of Dog Creek Reserve the just benefit of instruction to which they are entitled and which they appreciate so much.\n\nHoping you will comply to my request,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nInd.

McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find a letter of Moise Paul, Chief, requesting you to kindly appoint R. Martel as teacher of the Lake Manitoba Indian Reserve (Dog Creek) and stating that his nomination would be approved by all the Indians of the reserve, who have children.\n\nHe points out the reason of his protest sent to you last summer, as to avoid trouble he was anticipating, owing to the fact that John McLem and Paul Otchipwe, of the Dog Creek Indian Reserve, who had personal griefs against Mr. R. Martel had induced the Indians to share their animosity not because he had any serious griefs against him, as it was said in the protest. Now, the Indians have come to a better understanding, they are no more opposed to the nomination of Mr. R. Martel, at the contrary, they are unanimous in requesting his appointment at once as teacher of their school, and they will cheerfully send their children to the school under his charge.\n\nI was sorry when you informed me that you had to cancel his nomination on account of the protest of the Indians knowing that the griefs were false, being the result of a plot against him, and injuring the reputation of Mr. Martel to great extent. The Indians had nothing to say against him when I informed them of my intention to recommend him for the position of teacher. And also I could see besides the school a nice spot well fenced, intended for garden, which Mr. Martel put up at his own expenses. It was a good object lesson for the Indians and children and an evident proof he had taken a great interest to his work.\n\nAt the time he applied for the position, Mr. Martel informed me of his intention\nDog Creek, Indian Reserve\nMarch 15th 1920\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn regard to the protest against the nomination of Paul Martel as teacher of the Indian school at Dog Creek, which I sent to the Indian Department some time last summer under my signature, I beg to say that I did so because I was anticipating trouble on the reserve, owing to the fact that two members of the Band, John McLean and Paul Lee Otehipwe, who had personal griefs against Paul Martel had succeeded in inciting the Indians to entertain prejudices and animosity against him. I must say that the griefs did have been exaggerated to a great extent, and whatever they have been in the past, they have no more effect for the present, considering the fact that Paul Martel is married since to a good woman who has been teaching previously. Therefore, all the Indians except perhaps John McLean and Paul Lee Otehipwe but they have no children themselves have no more reason to be opposed to this.\nnomination as teacher of the Dog Creek Band from whom at the contrary, they are assured, that his services will be much appreciated, especially, if the Indian Department builds beside the school, a house intended for a residence for him and his wife, as it has been promised. I therefore request you to appoint him at once teacher, and authorize him to take charge of the school at the beginning of the next quarter commencing April 1st, at the place of H. Spring in who is to resign at the end of this month.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nChief - Moise Paul\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE\n\nPartage la Prairie, Man.\n\n9th April 1920\n\n535318\n\nSir,\n\nEnclosed find recommendation from Rev.
