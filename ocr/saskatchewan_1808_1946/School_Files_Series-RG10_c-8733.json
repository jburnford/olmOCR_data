The proposed agreement covers a five year period but subject to cancellation by the Department upon 90 days' notice. Since forwarding the agreement I have given further consideration to the matter and I should like to suggest that it might be as well not to sign a contract with the Kyle Taxi Co. extending beyond the end of the present school year. It is intended to review the Consolidated School administration at the close of the term in June, and the question of transportation could then also be reviewed as well and a change made if considered desirable.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

All of this correspondence, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nIn a letter to Indian Agent R. H. Moore, dated September 13, 1939, Mr. J. A. Kyle, Proprietor, Cowichan Valley Bus and Taxi Service, expressed willingness to enter into a contract to supply a thirty (30) passenger bus service for a six months' period - January 1 to June 30, 1940. The same offer was made by the Vancouver Island Coach Lines, Limited. It was felt, however, that the period was somewhat short, even for experimental purposes, and in my memorandum to you dated November 8, 1939, a period of approximately 18 months was suggested. However, the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia - Major D. M. MacKay - in a letter dated January 15, 1940, copy of which is enclosed, suggested that in view of all the circumstances, in his judgment it would not be advisable to extend the contract\nwith the Kyle Taxi Company beyond the end of the present school year (June 30, 1940). It is, apparently, the intention of the Commissioner to undertake a complete review of the operation of this school, including the transportation facilities, at the end of the present academic year.\n\nI can see no serious objection to the Department entering into a contract for the longer period, provided a 30 day cancellation clause is inserted in the contract. The period was changed on the recommendation of the Indian Commissioner.\n\nDirector.\n\nRAH\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, January 15, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn January 11th a draft agreement covering the transportation of the Indian children to and from the new Cowichan Consolidated Day School was forwarded to the Department. The proposed agreement covers a five year period but subject to cancellation by the Department upon 90 days' notice. Since forwarding the agreement I have given further consideration to the matter and I should like to suggest that it might be as well not to sign a contract with the Kyle Taxi Co. extending beyond the end of the present school year. It is intended to review the Consolidated School administration at the close of the term in June, and the question of transportation could then also be reviewed as well and a change made if considered desirable.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd. D. M. MacKay\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, 11th Jan. 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th ultimo, regarding transportation of pupils to the new Cowichan Consolidated Indian Day School and acceptance of the offer of the Cowichan Valley Bus and Taxi Services, for the ensuing six-month period, which you stated you would prefer to cover a longer period unless there were reasons to the contrary, I would advise that I had the Inspector of Indian Agencies go into this matter when he was in Duncan recently, and he found that the Duncan School Board was employing this firm on a five-year contract, and securing their copy of the agreement, he drafted a similar agreement modified to meet our conditions, also inserting a clause (Section 17) enabling the Department to cancel the contract on ninety days' notice. While it is considered that the Department's interests are fully protected, it would be appreciated if the proposed contract receives careful consideration. Meanwhile, the transportation of the children is fully arranged for until the end of this term, in June, in accordance with your instructions of the 5th ultimo.\n\nThe proposed contract would expire on 30th June, 1945, and would, therefore, be effective for five and one-half years, including the present term. The signature of the contractors was secured, as it was anticipated that any changes in costs would tend to be on the increase than otherwise, under conditions that are likely to prevail for some time.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.) D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 5, 1939.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of October 4 and my reply of November 8 in connection with the transportation of pupils to the new Cowichan Consolidated Indian day school.\n\nIt has been decided to accept the offer of the Cowichan Valley Bus & Taxi Services in accordance with their tender dated September 19, 1939, a copy of which is enclosed. The offer of the Cowichan Valley Bus & Taxi Services mentions a period of 6 months. The Department prefers to have an agreement with this firm for a longer period unless you are aware of some reasons why such a contract should not be made. I should, therefore, appreciate it if you would arrange with them to handle this work on the basis specified in their contract for the period January 1, 1940, to June 30, 1941.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nOttawa, November 8, 1929.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Cowichan Consolidated Indian Day School,\nCowichan Indian Agency, Electoral\nDistrict of Nanaimo, B. C.\n\nProvision for the erection of this school was made in the current year's appropriation and it is expected that the building will be completed for the middle of December.\n\nAs the majority of the children attending the school live at a considerable distance from it arrangements will have to be made for their transportation.\n\nIndian Commissioner MacKay has given the matter very careful consideration and has submitted two propositions, one for the purchase of a bus by the Department and its operation by a man engaged by us or transportation by one of the local motor transportation companies.\n\nCommissioner MacKay, after carefully considering both the above alternatives, writes, in part as follows:\n\n\"Even if it should finally be established that the cost of operating a Departmental bus would actually be less than herein shown there is still the very great responsibility involved in the transportation of a large group of children to be considered. Careful consideration of the various angles of the transportation problem confronting us based on the information gathered leads me to...\"\nconclude that it would be safer, more satisfactory and as economical for us to make arrangements with one of the transportation companies for the transportation of the children.\n\nCommissioner MacKay has submitted quotations for this service from the following firms:\n\n1. Cowichan Valley Bus & Taxi Service, Duncan, B. C.\n2. Vancouver Island Coach Lines Ltd., Duncan, B. C.\n\nEach of these companies quotes the same price; namely, 35\u00a2 a mile for a bus that would contain 30 passengers. The bus would have to travel 16 miles in the morning to pick up the children and the same distance in the afternoon to return them to their homes.\n\nBoth companies offer the same terms as regards insurance protecting the passengers in the case of accident.\n\nI should appreciate it if you would advise me as soon as possible with which company you would prefer our completing arrangements. I might add that it is our intention to arrange for the service for the period January 1, 1940, to June 30, 1941.\n\nH. W. McGill,\nDirector.\nCOWICHAN VALLEY BUS & TAXI SERVICES\n\nDuncan, B. C.,\nSeptember 19, 1939.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your memo of Saturday last and our conversation of this morning, I checked the mileage on the proposed school route for Indian children and find same to be sixteen (16) miles, making a total of thirty-two (32) miles per day, or one hundred sixty (160) miles per school week.\n\nI am prepared to contract for a thirty (30) passenger bus for this work for six (6) months at the rate of thirty five cents (.35\u00a2) per mile or a school week price of Fifty-six ($56.00) Dollars which would bring the price for the six (6) months period to One Thousand Three Hundred and Forty-four ($1344.00) Dollars.\n\nInsurance carried will cover Five and Twenty Thousand ($5/20000) Dollars Public Liability for any one accident and One Thousand ($1000.00) Dollars for Property Damage and the Indian Department can be shown on the Insurance Policy so as to clear them of any Liability while children are in transit. It would also be understood that any day the service did not operate no compensation would be claimed.\n\nHoping to hear from you at your convenience,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd.) J. A. Kyle,\n\nProprietor, Cowichan Valley Bus & Taxi Services.\nVANCOUVER ISLAND COACH LINES Limited\n\nDuncan V. I., September 20, 1939.\n\nR. H.

I.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your enquiry regarding the establishment of a school bus service to cover the new Cowichan Day School and the Koksilah Day School, we are pleased to submit herewith our tender as follows:\n\nWe are to provide one thirty passenger bus each school day. This bus would hold up to 36 children, would comply with the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act of British Columbia governing the operation of school buses.\n\nThis coach to leave the White Bridge on the Somenos Reserve at approximately 8:05 a.m. and proceed to the new Cowichan Day School. From that point to proceed to the Koksilah School via the White Bridge and thence to the Cowichan Day School via the Tzouhalem Road. This route to be reserved in the afternoon at approximately 3:10 p.m.\n\nAny contract entered into to go into effect on the first school day after January 1st, 1940, and to be for a period of six months expiring June 30, 1940, with an option of renewal.\n\nFor your information, we wish to advise that we carry insurance on every piece of equipment we operate for Public Liability in limits of $20,000.00 for death or injury to one person and $100,000.00 for death or injury to two or more persons in any one accident and a limit of $5,000.00 for property damage. This insurance coverage would apply to any or all buses operated by us on this proposed school contract.\n\nFor the above service, we hereby tender in the amount of $11.20 per day or $56.00 per week.\n\nWe wish -\nWe wish to thank you for allowing us the opportunity to quote on this contract, and trust that we may be favoured with your further instructions herein.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nVANCOUVER ISLAND COACH LINES LTD.\n\nAgent.\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\n6th February, 1940\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\n\nRe - Bus Service - Cowichan Day School.\n\nA complaint has reached this office that the term of the proposed contract with the Cowichan Valley Bus and Taxi Service is being reduced from four years to six months.

A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDuncan, B.C., Feb. 2, 1940.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR MONTH OF JANUARY 1940.\n\nThe new Cowichan Indian day school opened on the 8th of the month, and while it was more or less of a makeshift during the first few weeks, owing to lack of seating arrangements, equipment, school supplies etc. etc. nevertheless the Teachers did a very good job of it on the whole, although they were certainly working at a great disadvantage. The mud that was carried into the school was inches thick and the dust got all over all the nice painted woodwork causing a lot of damage and spoiling the appearance generally. The floors have not been helped by the mud either, and if I had known as much one month ago as I know now I would have advised keeping the school closed until the grounds were fixed or dried up.\n\nR. H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: Indian Day School,\nCowichan Reserve, B.C.\n\nFurther to my memorandum of the 6th ultimo forwarding a report regarding certain improvements suggested for the school grounds at the above, Mr. Webb in a recent letter writes as follows:\n\n\"Last week while on Vancouver Island I had an opportunity to visit the new Cowichan Indian School which we have recently completed near Duncan.\n\nThe school itself has been well built and has a pleasing appearance. The finishing both inside and out including the paint job is entirely satisfactory. The grounds, however, are in an appalling state with about two or three inches of mud everywhere surrounding the building. The School was put in use almost immediately it was finished and the mud is being daily tracked into the building which is altogether unfortunate.\"\n\nIt is felt that the Indian Affairs Branch should take up this matter with the Indian Agent and that temporary walks should be provided to protect the School until arrangements can be made for the required improvements to the school grounds.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ.

Sister Mary Mark, Provincial Superior of St. Ann's Academy, Victoria, B.C.:\n\n\"I am in receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant with reference to the Cowichan Consolidated School.\n\n\"Regarding domestic science supplies you might advise Agent Moore regarding the probable expenditure which you consider should be made for the purchase of necessary articles between January 1 and June 30, 1940. He will write to the Department for the necessary authority and will later advise you the amount that we can allow.\"\n\nWe do not appear to have received any correspondence from you regarding the amount you consider should be allowed for the purchase of materials for midday meal purposes. We are, however, in receipt of a report from Inspector Barry regarding his visit to the school on January 11 in which he suggests that the sum of $10.00 a month be allowed for this purpose. You may, therefore, expend this amount monthly but if you do not consider it sufficient you should so advise and make a definite recommendation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. R. H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B. C.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 22, 1940\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letters of the 11th and 15th ultimo and my reply of the 22nd ultimo in connection with the transportation of children to and from the new Cowichan Consolidated Day School.\n\nRepresentations have recently been made to the Department suggesting that the five-year contract be accepted by us.\n\nThe contract has been reviewed by the Senior Solicitor of the Department and I enclose, for your information, changes which he suggests might be considered.\n\nIs the contract which you forwarded and a copy of which is being returned with this letter exactly the same in all particulars as the one in use between white school boards in the Province of British Columbia and firms transporting children to white schools?\n\nPlease discuss the changes suggested by the Solicitor with the Cowichan Valley Bus & Taxi Services and advise me as soon as possible if they are prepared to make the changes suggested by the Solicitor. If so, the Department considers that it would be advisable to enter into the five-year contract.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRe - Bus service Indian Day School,\nCowichan Reserve.\n\nI have examined the draft agreement between the Crown and Kyle Brothers with regard to supplying the above service. The following items should, I think, be considered -\n\n1. Page 2, section 3. The service is described, near the end of the paragraph, as \"thence north to Koksilah Mission near the Koksilah Indian School\". \"Near\" seems to be rather vague. I am not aware of the particular circumstances but I should think that the term should be more carefully defined.\n\n2. Page 4. I am not clear as to the need for this clause providing non-ownership liability insurance as there is no legal liability on the Crown and the Insurance Company would probably raise this defence if an action were brought. If we made payment on compassionate grounds we could not collect the insurance but Mr. Finlayson would be better qualified to advise on this than I am.\n\n3. Page 5, end of paragraph 9. In the 4th line from the bottom the second word is \"or\". Is not this a typographical error for \"while\"?\n\n4. Page 5, paragraph 10. I would suggest that the words \"and assistants\" be inserted after the word \"drivers\" in the first line of the paragraph and putting the words \"at once\" after the word \"and\" in the second line.\n\n5. Page 7, paragraph 17. I would suggest that this paragraph be amended to provide that \"if any of the conditions in paragraphs 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 are not complied with by the contractor the contract shall terminate forthwith without notice and no action for damages shall lie against His Majesty.\" Violation of some of the conditions in the above cited paragraphs\nwould be very serious from the Department's point of view and if we could not enforce their rectification except by giving a 90-day notice the results might be very serious.\n\nA point worth bearing in mind is this. If notice to cancel the contract was given at the beginning of June in any year while the contract would terminate at the end of August before the beginning of the next school year, under clause 13 we would only pay to the end of June as July and August are vacation months.\n\nSenior Solicitor.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO:** Jo E.

Catherine's Day School is very unsatisfactory and I, therefore, presume that draining and levelling will be necessary at some future date. No funds for this purpose are available at the present time. However, if it is possible to secure gravel I thought that possibly a few loads of this could be used to make walks from the road to the school and in this way avoid tracking some of the mud at least into the school. If the gravel can be obtained you may make the necessary arrangements at once.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. R. H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B. C.\nOttawa,\nMarch 1, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Cowichan Indian Day School\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of February 27 in which you advise that the total expenditure to this date on the above-mentioned school has been $11,969.66.\n\nDirector.\nFebruary 27, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Indian Day School,\nCowichan Indian Reserve, B.C.\n\nFurther to my memorandum of the 17th ultimo regarding the cost of the above, I may say that the total expenditures on this project to date are as follows:\n\nPayment to Contractor $10,472.07\nEngineer's expenses to January 9, 1940. $245.40\nAdvertising Costs $32.24\n\nAdditional Accounts (to be paid) for additional work requested after contract was awarded.\nElectric Light Fixtures $198.45\nPlumbing Work $175.00\nWater Supply $707.50\n\n$1,080.95\n\n$11,830.66\n\nDay Labour Work authorized and under way\nAdditional outside toilets, Estimated Cost $139.00\n\nEstimated total expenditure, Vote 76-64, 1939-40 $11,969.66\n\nFrom information received in this office a total car mileage of 240 miles was incurred in connection with the supervision of this work. This, together with mileages incurred on other projects carried out for the Indian Affairs Branch under the supervision of Mr. Webb, have been charged by our Treasury Office to Vote 79-23-195. This mileage, therefore, has not been included in the expenditure shown for this School.\n\nDirector.\n**Purchase Order**\n\n**Hillcrest Lumber Co.

(RG 10, Volume 6388, File 807-5, part 4)\nDuncan, B.C., March 1st, 1940.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON COWICHAN AGENCY FOR FEBRUARY 1940.\n\nConditions at the Cowichan Consolidated day school were very bad during the month on account of wet grounds and a sea of mud and water around the building. Its most serious effect was on the health of the children who really suffered a great deal from wet feet, with the resultant colds and Flu. At one particular time there were 30 children from once class room absent on account of being sick with colds etc. some of them having to be sent to the hospital. To my mind these colds were the direct result of wet feet. We are hoping that within the next two or three weeks the grounds will dry up enough to allow the children to get outside during the recess periods.\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nRe: Your File 182-22-5, Cowichan Indian Day School.\n\nI thank you for your letter above noted and dated February 28th, 1940, regarding graveling a part of the grounds of the above school to prevent the tracking of mud into the School.\n\nIn this connection I wish to state that I have taken action in this matter but instead of putting down the gravel I got some rough planks from the local lumber yard to make walks from the school to the toilets. These planks will just be laid end to end, not cut up at all, so that the pupils can walk on them. The walk from the road to the building itself has been gravelled for some time so that it is quite alright, but between the building and the toilets is by far the worst and as the ground there is so loose, gravel would not do much good as it would go out of sight in a very few days, then it would be impossible to get a truck with a load of gravel on to the grounds as the whole place is so soft that it would get bogged. Furthermore, if and when the grounds are graded the gravel would be lost while the planks will be always useful and can be utilized for some other purpose after grading has been done, and finally the cost of the planks will not be any more than gravel would cost. I might say in closing that I discussed this with the Indian Commissioner and he felt that the planks would be more satisfactory, especially as the cost would not be any more. Trusting that these arrangements will meet with your approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary;\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nOttawa.\n\nc.c. to D.M.McK.\n\nAttention: Mr. Hoey;\n\n(R.H.Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nMEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT made this Nineteenth day of December in the year of our Lord One thousand nine hundred and thirty-nine BETWEEN: HIS MAJESTY THE KING IN THE RIGHT OF CANADA AS REPRESENTED BY THE DIRECTOR OF THE INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES hereinafter called \"the Department\" of the one part and J.

H. Moore of February 28th. I also have the agreement between the board of school trustees of the city of Duncan and Mr. Kyle which was sent as a sample and the new draft in which you have incorporated the result of my suggestions and subsequent correspondence, all of which I return herewith.\n\nI have carefully gone over the new draft agreement in the light of the comments and explanations which have been made and I am of opinion that it is now satisfactory from the viewpoint of the Department and may properly be executed.\n\nSenior Solicitor.\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 152-22-1.\n\nReplying to your letter of the 22nd instant with reference to the contract for transportation of children to and from the new Cowichan Consolidated Indian Day School, I would advise that the suggested amendments have been submitted to the Cowichan Valley Bus & Taxi Services and Mr. Kyle, representing the Company, has signified his approval of same as per Mr. Agent Moore's letter of the 28th instant enclosed herewith with the contract forwarded by you. It is noted that representations have been made suggesting that the Department accept the contract.\n\nI am also forwarding the contract made by the Board of School Trustees of the City of Duncan (Consolidated) School District with this Company, on which the contract with the Department is based, with various necessary changes to bring it into line with our requirements, which alterations are as follows:\n\nSection 4 on page 3 was changed in order to permit any required variation of the time of closing the school in the afternoon to be put into effect by the Agent on the authority of the Department. To this section should be added \"and shall proceed forthwith to transport and shall transport each of them to his or her destination along the route.\"\n\nSection 12 on page 6 varies from the School Trustees contract by the addition in the 16th line of \"Provided always that in the event of the circumstances prescribed -- Schedule\" to permit us to modify the contract in this respect if it became necessary to do so.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSection 14 ...\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter above noted with reference to the matter of transportation of Indian children to the new consolidated Indian Day School and the Koksilah Indian Day School, I beg to submit herewith a further report on the matter.\n\nFirst of all, I interviewed Mr. Kyle and after discussion he declared that he had no objection whatever to the proposed amendments as pencilled by you in the original draft copy of agreement. The fact that the Koksilah mission is mentioned in the Agreement is not vague, in any sense of the word as suggested by the Department, but a definite location the legal description of which is as follows: S.W. Corner of Sec. 15, Range 7, Quamichan District. As a matter of fact that is the only way to get to the school, the site of which was purchased from the mission some years ago by the Department.\n\nI got copies, on loan, from the secretary of the Duncan Consolidated School District of the Agreement, and Renewal, of the School Board and the Cowichan Valley Bus and Taxi Service, (Kyle) which they were kind enough to loan me to forward to yourself and the Department for comparison.\n\nPlease note that the Secretary asked that these be returned as soon as you are finished with them, or rather as soon as the Department are finished with them. I am sending this letter with the enclosures immediately on account of your request for immediate action. If I were to wait until I had copies made of these contracts you could not possibly get them before the end of the week.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nD.M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nVancouver, B.C.\n\n(R.H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nSection 14 on page 6 was modified in order to maintain the rate payable pro rata to that set out in Section 12 rather than make it subject to arbitration, and this is further protected by Section 15 by removing the rate of compensation from becoming a matter of arbitration.\n\nSections 16, 17 and 18 on pages 7 and 8 were added for obvious reasons indicated in the respective clauses. The City of Duncan School Board have requested early return of their contract, consequently it would be appreciated if this could be done as soon as it has served the Department's purpose.\n\nWith reference to the Senior Solicitor's comment in paragraph 1 of his Memorandum of the 23rd instant regarding the description of Koksilah Mission being near to the Indian Day School, I would advise that the Mission is a definite point on the route and is the unloading point for children destined for the Indian school, which is a short distance from the Mission but impossible to reach by road.\n\nI am unable to give an opinion regarding the necessity of protecting the Department by insurance against non-ownership liability as set out in Section 9 on page 4, but no doubt this is a matter that can be determined by the legal branch of the Department. If it is superfluous it could be omitted.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M.

A. Kyle, Proprietor, Cowichan Valley Bus & Taxi Service, was submitted to the Departmental Solicitor, Mr. K. R. Daly. In memorandum dated February 22 he submitted certain changes which he considered should be made in the agreement. These proposed changes were forwarded to Indian Commissioner MacKay who discussed them with Mr. Kyle and in a letter dated February 29 Commissioner MacKay stated that Mr. Kyle was willing to accept the changes suggested by Mr. Daly. A new agreement was then prepared embodying the changes and was again submitted to Mr. Daly who, in a memorandum dated March 13, advised as follows:\n\n\"I have carefully gone over the new draft agreement in the light of the comments and explanations which have been made and I am of opinion that it is now satisfactory from the viewpoint of the Department and may properly be executed.\"\nThis new agreement has been forwarded to Indian Commissioner MacKay for the signature of Mr. Kyle. It has not yet been returned but in view of Mr. Kyle's previous decision to accept the amendments suggested I have no reason to doubt that he will sign it.

(RG 10, Volume 6388, File 807-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa,\nMay 4, 1940.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI return copy of agreement with J. A. Kyle in connection with the transportation of children to the Ste. Catherine's School.\n\nFor your information I attach a copy of a letter which is being directed to Indian Agent Moore. This letter explains itself and I should appreciate your discussing the matter with Inspector Barry with a view to determining if the system outlined by the Department to check the number of pupils carried in the bus is satisfactory to all parties concerned.\n\nAs stated in the enclosed letter it is evident that the company is basing the charge on the average number carried and they have worked this out at over 30. I feel that we are going to have a great deal of difficulty in having the accounts approved by the Treasury Branch unless a very definite statement is attached showing the number of pupils transported each day. In my letter I am suggesting that this statement be signed by the Principal of the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nCopy sent to Major MacKay\n\nOttawa,\nMay 4, 1940.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 1st instant with reference to payment of bus transportation for school children proceeding to the Ste. Catherine's School.\n\nThe Department is aware that the rate is 35\u00a2 a mile when the number of pupils is 30 or over and 40\u00a2 a mile when the number exceeds 30.\n\nWhat arrangements have been made to check the number travelling in the bus? Apparently from the accounts received the firm is charging us for over 30 pupils every day. It was distinctly understood that pupils living within one mile of the Ste. Catherine's School would not be transported and consequently the Department requires very definite information regarding the method that has been adopted to make certain that the bus company will not overcharge us.\n\nIn future the monthly account should be accompanied by a statement signed by the Principal of the school showing the number of pupils brought to the school each day in the bus.\n\nNo promise was made by the Department for transportation of children to the Koksilah School. The agreement, as far as we were concerned, simply covers the Ste. Catherine's School. While we have no objection to children living over a mile from the Koksilah School being transported to that school if there is room in the bus, at the same time when preparing the voucher you should only mention the Ste. Catherine's School.\n\nMr. R. H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B. C.\nI, therefore, find it necessary to return the accounts for the months of January, February and March. The account for the month of April has not yet reached us.\n\nWith regard to the January account why was the bus engaged for three days to transport children to the Koksilah School? We do not appear to have any record of having authorized this because, as stated above, the transportation by bus was arranged primarily for the children attending the Ste. Catherine's School and consequently the bus should not have been put in operation until this school was open. A new voucher should be prepared for the month of January and only the Ste. Catherine's School should be mentioned.\n\nThe February account appears in order provided that you consider that on each of the twenty-one days more than 30 pupils were transported. A new covering voucher, however, should be prepared for this as you should only mention the Ste. Catherine's School.\n\nIt is doubtful if the March account is correct. We are not paying on the average attendance but on the number actually transported each day. If the average for the fourteen days on which transportation was supplied during the month of March was only $31.13/14 it is quite likely that on some of the days at least the number transported was 30 or under and consequently for those days we are entitled to the 35\u00a2 a mile rate.\n\nWhen returning these accounts you should forward separate vouchers with the accounts attached for each month and you should, as suggested in the first part of this letter, attach a definite statement showing the number of pupils transported each school day.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training\nSir:\n\nMr. J. A. Kyle of the Cowichan Valley Bus and Transportation Service has just called in connection with non-payment of his accounts for services rendered covering bus transportation of the school children to and from the St. Catherine's and Koksilah Indian Day Schools here.\n\nThis service has been running since January last and Mccounts have been submitted regularly at the end of each month, but to date no cheque has been received from the Department, and there is now approximately $1000.00 due to Mr. Kyle, this includes his account for April last, which has not yet gone forward.\n\nYou will readily understand that the non-receipt of this money due to Mr. Kyle - of the Cowichan Valley Bus Service, is placing him in a most embarrassing position, and I sincerely trust that a cheque can be sent to him at once, by air Mail if possible, covering his outstanding accounts.\n\nMr. Kyle further drew my attention to the fact that he has not yet received his copy of the Contract, that was forwarded on to the Commissioner in March last.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[R. H. Moore]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6388, File 807-5, part 4)\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 152-22-5.\n\nWith reference to your letter of March 14th, I beg to forward herewith agreement, in duplicate, in connection with the transportation of children to and from Ste. Catherine's School, signed by the contractor, Mr. Kyle, as requested.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n-HN\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, which was in reply to mine of the 1st inst., relative to the transportation of the children to the St. Catherine's and Koksilah Indian Day Schools. I must admit that I am amazed at the apparent misunderstanding that has developed in connection with the transportation system, in spite of the fact that I have been sending complete and detailed reports in duplicate through the Indian Commissioner ever since last fall. In fact the first one was dated September 24th last and was in reply to Mr Hoey's letter of September 2nd, addressed to Major MacKay who sent me a copy of it asking for information, which I supplied by way of a long written report in duplicate, as well as letters in duplicate from two local Bus Firms which explained the route taken and which they were quoting on. In fact it was from those letters that the Department eventually decided to give the contract to Kyle.\n\nPlease understand that up until now nearly all correspondence has gone through the Commissioner from the Department, he in turn writing to me and I replying through him in duplicate. Only once or twice have I actually received copies of your letters to the Commissioner, he generally advised me that the Department wished to be informed on certain points to which I replied, and always in duplicate.\n\nAs soon as it was decided in Ottawa last December that Kyle should have the business, the Department asked that the term of the contract be increased to five years instead of six months as originally tendered on by Mr Kyle. That information was given to me over the telephone by the Indian Commissioner last December during the time that Inspector's Coleman and Barry were in this Office and Mr Kyle was asked to call at the office and discuss the whole situation with Inspector Coleman, which he did, the result of that consultation being the Agreement which was drawn up and forwarded to the Department for approval. I might say that this Agreement was signed by the Company and forwarded by me to the Commissioner in duplicate under date of November 22nd, last. Nothing further was heard of it until February 1st, when the Commissioner wrote me stating that the Department did not consider it advisable to sign the Contract at that time but wished to carry on as heretofore, which to me was hard to understand as there had been no heretofore with this Company. At all events I notified the Company of this under date of February 2nd. The on February 27th, the Commissioner wrote me point out that the Contract had been reviewed by the Senior Solicitor of the Department when certain small changes were suggested, and I was again instructed to interview Mr Kyle and discuss the proposed changes.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nMines & Resources.\nOttawa.\nThe Secretary:\n\nchanges with him and ascertain if he had any objections to them. This I did, and replied to the Commissioner's letter under date of February 26th, in duplicate forwarding a copy of the Contract between the Duncan School Board and the Contractor transporting the white children to their schools. The document I asked to be returned as soon as the Department had finished with it. Then on March 18th I received another letter from the Commissioner's Office enclosing the Contract between the Department and the Transportation Co. for the latter's signature with instructions to return it as soon as possible for the signature of the Department. (At the same time the loaned copy of the Agreement between the Company and the Duncan School Board was also returned.) This was returned duly completed by the Transportation Co., and returned by me to the Commissioner under date of March 21st, last. Nothing further being heard about it and Mr Kyle not having received his copy of the Contract, I wrote you on May 1st, instant to which your letter of the 4th, am in reply.\n\nThe above is a detailed report of the whole affair up to now insofar as I have connected with it. From here on I will confine myself to replying to and explaining the various points mentioned in your letter.\n\nRe, the third paragraph of your letter: No pupils within a radius of one mile is being carried on the Bus, that is within a radius of one mile of the School, of course. The driver of the Bus keeps a daily record of the children carried one way to the School, as well as the total number carried each day. At the end of each month the original statement is turned in by the Company attached to their monthly accounts, this statement is kept on our copy of the Voucher in this Office. I can assure you that no attempt is being made by the Bus Company to overcharge us.\n\nRe, fourth paragraph of your letter: It would appear as if the Department is not fully aware of the geography of the Cowichan I. R., of how the transportation of the children is being handled, or of the route taken, otherwise you would readily see that when the Bus leave the Somonos Indian Village in the morning that it has a full load of children sometimes as high as 50, half of which unload at St. Catherine's School, the balance staying in the Village proceeding on through the Reserve until the end of the trip where they get off and walk the rest of the way to the Koksilah School. There the bus turns round, and returns back to the St. Catherine's School picking up the children en route. You will see from this therefore that on the first trip to the St. Catherine's school only about one third of the pupils in the bus actually get on the school bus during the Koksilah School, in other words the load is divided between the two schools so that it would hardly be fair to ask any of the teachers to certify that a certain number of children were in the Bus at one time or on one trip. However, there is certainly no reason why the Principal of St. Catherines' School cannot keep a record of the total number of children carried each day by the Bus, if the Department so desires, and I will ask her to do that as from this date.\n\nRe, fifth paragraph of your letter: The statement you make in this paragraph is hard to understand, especially in view of the fact that we have been paying for the transportation of the children attending the Koksilah School since long before I came to this Agency. However, if you so desire, the Koksilah School will not appear on the Voucher in future.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You will see from this therefore that on the first trip to the St. Catherine's School there is about one third of the children who go to Kokkilah, yet off the balance going on to the Kokkilah School, in other words the load is divided between the two schools so that it would hardly be fair to ask any of the teachers to certify that a certain number of children were in the Bus at one time or on one trip. However, there is certainly no reason why the Principal of St. Catherines' School cannot keep a record of the total number of children carried each day by the Bus, if the Department so desires, and I will ask her to do that as from this date.\n\nRe: fifth paragraph of your letter: The statement you make in this paragraph is hard to understand, especially in view of the fact that we have been paying for the transportation of the children attending the Kokkilah School since long before I came to this Agency. However, if you so desire, the Kokkilah School will not appear on the Voucher in future.\nThe Secretary:\n\nRe: sixth paragraph of your letter: Newly made out Vouchers are being submitted herewith covering the months of January, February, March and April, which will show in detail the exact number of pupils carried each day on the Bus and the rate charged. This method will, I hope, give you all the information you desire.\n\nRe: seventh paragraph: The reason the Bus was engaged for the first three days to carry pupils to the Koksilah School, was because the School was open and the St. Catherine's school was not owing to the fact that it was not ready, being entirely without equipment of any kind, and as there had been transportation facilities provided for the children of the Koksilah School prior to the opening of the St. Catherine's school, I saw no reason why this service should be discontinued without definite instructions from the Department. As I understand the situation the Bus service is not a venture but rather a change over to a larger Bus than the car previously used for this work by the Rev. Father L. LeClair, and which he used to carry the children to both the Old Cowichan Day School and the Koksilah Day School. However, as stated above a new Voucher will be submitted for January and the Koksilah school will not be mentioned although we are in duty bound to pay for the transportation of the children taken to the Koksilah School on January 3rd, 4th, and 5th.\n\nIn reading your letter carefully I cannot but feel some concern about the attitude of the Department towards the Koksilah School, which to my mind does not appear to be favourable and I wish to be perfectly frank and outspoken in the matter now so that no misunderstanding may arise later through lack of any definite statement on our part on the subject of this School. To my mind the Koksilah School is the best managed and best run school in the Agency, and I feel that I am safe in saying that the pupils there are deriving more actual benefit from their schooling than any any of the pupils attending any of our other schools. I make that statement believing it to be true, and I think that it would be a calamity were the services rendered this School by the Department over a period of years now curtailed by cutting out or curtailing the transportation service.\n\nIn view of the apparent ignorance of the Department as to just what route the Bus takes and how the Cowichan I. R. is served by the Bus service, I am sending you a Blueprint of the Reserve, with the Route marked in Red, which will show the point at which the Bus leaves in the morning and the measured distances between the various points. However, this is the only Map I have of this Reserve in this office and so I am asking you to be kind enough to return it as soon as you have finished with it. If there happens to be anyone out in this Province this year from Head Office I would like him to visit me here so that I could actually take him over the route travelled. In the meantime I hope that the blueprint will suffice. Sorry to trouble with such a long-winded report but I feel that I ought to cover the whole question in detail and my only concern is that this report will be understandable.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(R.H.

In this connection I would refer you to the fifth paragraph of my letter of May 4 addressed to Indian Agent Moore and a copy of which was sent to you on the same day. It was simply that we wanted the vouchers to read \"Ste. Catherine's Day School\".\n\nThe copy of the agreement forwarded to you should be sent to the Cowichan Valley Bus & Taxi Company. We have retained a copy on file here.\n\nThe accounts have been re-submitted to us and have been prepared on the basis of the number of pupils carried each day and not on the average over a given period. This is the correct procedure and a cheque in payment of the months of January, February, March and April has gone forward.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 152-22-5.\n\nI have to refer to your letter of May 4th enclosing copy of agreement with J.A. Kyle in connection with the transportation of children to the Ste. Catherine's School. As Inspector Barry is not due to return from the north until mid-June, I took advantage of the opportunity on Friday last, while in Duncan to discuss the subject matter of your letter with Mr. Indian Agent Moore.\n\nAlthough there is no mention in the agreement of the Koksilah Indian Day School, I am satisfied that it was the intention to include those pupils of that school living over a mile from the school in the group to be transported by the Cowichan Valley Bus & Taxi Services. I am sure the Department will not approve for obvious reasons of our Protestant school children walking to school while Roman Catholic children on the same route were being transported by bus under Departmental arrangements.\n\nThere should be no need to include any reference on the voucher to the Koksilah School. It will be necessary, however, to secure from the Rev. Principal of Ste. Catherine's and Miss Perry, of the Koksilah School, a certificate showing the number of pupils carried by the bus each day to their respective schools; otherwise I cannot see how a satisfactory check can be obtained. It was understood from the outset that payment would be made on the basis of the number of pupils carried each day and not on the average over a given period, and the accounts are to be submitted accordingly.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI...\nI should appreciate being advised if the copy of the agreement forwarded to me is for the Agency records, the Cowichan Valley Bus & Taxi Company or to be returned to the Department.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

(RG 10, Volume 6388, File 807-5, part 4)\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Ste. Catherine's Consolidated Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department will no doubt have received from the Surveys and Engineering Branch the report of Mr. G.H. Whyte dated December 22nd, 1939, on the improvements necessary to the grounds of the marginally noted school. The estimated cost of these improvements was placed by Mr. Whyte at $1035.00 but as the first item in the summary of costs, \"toilets at $114.00\", has been provided, the estimate should be reduced by this amount, making the total required to carry out the proposed work $921.00.\n\nAs the rainy, unsettled weather ordinarily commences in the latter part of September, the work of clearing and levelling the grounds, and providing the walks and fence protection as well as graveling certain areas around the school to prevent mud being carried into the building by the pupils, should be proceeded with at the earliest possible date.\n\nI should appreciate being advised if funds have been provided for these improvements and, if so, when it is proposed to have the Engineering Branch undertake the work.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 29, 1940.\n\nRe: Ste. Catherine's Consolidated Indian Day School.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 16th instant, in which you seek departmental authority to proceed with certain improvements to the grounds surrounding the above noted school.\n\nI find it exceedingly difficult to even suggest what should be done to the grounds of this school, in view of the engineer's recommendations, the limited funds at our disposal and the difficulty experienced last year by the members of the staff when the pupils were continually carrying clay on their boots into the classrooms.\n\nIt is, as you know, comparatively easy to be wise after the event, and I am convinced that in future, when an Indian day school is constructed, it should be constructed on the understanding that the contractors will not only construct the school but will provide the lavatories that may be necessary, the fence surrounding the grounds and any improvements required to the grounds. I feel it is somewhat misleading to inform the Minister of Parliament that a certain school has cost so much and then be compelled to spend approximately $1,000 the next year in the improvement of the grounds surrounding the same school.\n\nIn the estimates of this year the sum of $580 was set apart for the repair of Indian day schools in the Cowichan agency. Of this amount approximately $282 has been spent to date. You can readily appreciate, therefore, that the funds at our disposal are scarcely sufficient to even make start on the work outlined by the engineer, in connection with the Ste. Catherine's School. I have been wondering if it would be possible to spend the sum of approximately $500.00 on the improvements that may be absolutely necessary. I have in mind the sidewalks, drainage, etc., and in regard to the fence recommended by the engineer I have\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nbeen wondering if it would be possible to have this constructed by Indian labour, under the direction of the manual training instructor. In any event, it is simply unthinkable that we should spend a sum exceeding $500 on the Ste. Catherine's School this year, in view of the fact that we have been unable to open a large number of Indian schools in the outlying districts of the Dominion.\n\nI should like to have any comments you may care to offer on these suggestions. In the meantime I agree with you that the work should be undertaken at once and you should so advise the Agent.\n\nI am anxious to know if you have a copy of Mr. Whyte's report.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Catherine's Consolidated Indian Day School.\n\nI have received your letter of August 22nd, your file 152-22-5, regarding the improvements recommended to the grounds of the marginally noted school.\n\nI had an opportunity to go carefully into this subject with Mr. Indian Agent Moore yesterday, who happens to be in the city in connection with the Cowichan Agency display at the Vancouver Exhibition, and it is felt that the sum of $500 should cover the costs of the most needed improvements, which are sidewalks, levelling, gravelling, drainage and fencing. All the fencing need not be done if the amount provided is not sufficient to do so. The janitor and Manual Training instructor could both assist in the fencing. The former would be particularly useful in this connection as he has had considerable experience as a rough carpenter. It is intended to employ Indians on the work as far as possible, and any materials required which Indians are in a position to supply will be purchased from them provided the prices are reasonable.\n\nI gather from your letter that the sum of $500 is available for this work and that it will be in order for me to instruct the Agent to proceed. I should appreciate being advised of the number of the Encumbrance Requisition set up against which materials and labour costs are to be charged. It is difficult to estimate the cost of labour, but Mr. Moore considers $200 will be required for this purpose.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

Catherine's School was being discussed that we operate our own bus, I might say that personally I was not in favor of the proposal. My objection at the time to such an arrangement was simply that it would be placing a responsibility on the Department which I considered should not be assumed if other satisfactory arrangements could be made.\n\nMr. Corcoran as an employee of the Government would, in my opinion, involve the Department if he were to take on the additional duties as suggested, and this, apart altogether from other objections, is the main reason for my opposition to the proposal. It is just possible, of course, that the Department might favorably consider the application and I am therefore referring the matter to Ottawa for consideration.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter above noted with reference to the application of Mr. P. J. Corcoran to be allowed to drive the School Bus which takes the Indian children and from the Indian Day Schools on the Cowichan I. R.\n\nYour objections mentioned in the second paragraph of your letter are noted, but I would point out that the very fact that Mr. Corcoran is operating the Bus means that he would have the children under Supervision one hour longer each day than if someone else did it. The Bus would be kept at the School all day so that from the time the children arrived, and until they left, Mr. Corcoran would be there.\n\nYour statement in the third paragraph is not quite correct as you will please note if you refer to Dept. Circular Letter of April 24th, 1939 #710-871 which states that unless the employee is receiving salary in excess of $1200.00 annually this ruling would not apply. Furthermore, it is very doubtful whether or not this man could be termed a full time employee, in the broad sense of the word, as he is only employed by this Department two thirds of a year and his salary amounts to $760.00.\n\nThere is no question of Mr. Corcoran resigning to accept Mr. Kyle's offer. The plan suggested of this man driving our Bus, or at least the bus which we hire, is (to my mind at least) a good one and one which I would ask be reconsidered. If you will please refer to previous correspondence in connection with the Bus service I think you will find that when it was suggested that we operate our own bus one of the arguments in favor of it was the additional interest which the driver, who by the way was also going to be the Manual Training Instructor? would take in seeing that the children came regularly to School.\n\nD.M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(R.H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Commissioner's Office,\nVancouver, B.C., Sept. 23, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 21st instant with which you forward and recommend an application from Mr. P. J. Corcoran that he be permitted to operate for Mr. Kyle the St. Catherine's and Koksilah School bus service.\n\nI would draw your attention to the fact that Mr. Corcoran is now being paid by the Department for his work as Boys' Supervisor and Manual Training Instructor on a whole-time basis on the assumption that his work involves full-time employment. It would appear obvious that if Mr. Corcoran is operating a school bus away from St. Catherine's he could not at the same time take proper charge of the boys at that school.\n\nIt is hardly necessary to remind you that full-time Departmental employees are prohibited from receiving compensation for work from outside sources.\n\nI regret that it is quite impossible for me to recommend to the Department that Mr. Corcoran's application be favorably considered. Should he desire to accept Mr. Kyle's offer, it will be necessary for him first to resign his position as Boys' Supervisor and Manual Training Instructor at St. Catherine's School.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. Mackay.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed you will find Copy, in duplicate, of a letter received from Mr. P. J. Corcoran, Supervisor for the Boys' and Manual Training Instructor at Ste. Catherine's Indian Day School, in connection with offer he has received to drive the school bus, and asking for Departmental approval for him to do this.\n\nPersonally I would like to recommend this arrangement for approval, as I consider that he would naturally take a greater interest in the supervision, etc., and in checking everything that an outside driver could do.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[R.

Corcoran, employed by the Department as Boys' Supervisor and Manual Training Instructor, has applied to Mr. Indian Agent Moore for permission to accept employment with the Cowichan Valley Bus and Taxi Service driving the school bus engaged in the transportation of Indian children attending Ste. Catherine's and the Koksilah Indian Day Schools. Enclosed for the Department's information are copies of an exchange of correspondence between this office and Mr. Moore regarding the matter.\n\nI am not prepared to recommend the application for the reasons set out in my letters of September 23rd and October 5th to Mr. Moore. The Department's views on the subject would be appreciated.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nWork of levelling the grounds around the St. Catherine's school was commenced during the latter part of the month, and good progress was made. However, we will not be able to do all that we hoped, or expected, we could which can be accounted for by the mess of rocks, roots and stumps of trees which were covered by the earth out of the basement outside the building. Naturally it was not known what was under all the earth at the time the estimate for the work was given. Stumps were big and green (instead of small and rotten) while there is a small rock quarry directly in front of the school building. All this meant longer to do certain parts of the work and at a higher cost.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Webb, District Chief Engineer, Dominion Water & Power Bureau, forwarded to his Branch in Ottawa a report by Mr. H.G. Ramsden on the heating and water supply system at the marginally noted school.\n\nEngineer Ramsden recommended the installation of two door closers of the Corbin type No. 3 at a cost of $25 to conserve the heat in the school building, and the provision of a small structure with open gable ends over the existing trapdoor of the well to provide the protection and ventilation considered necessary. The cost of materials for this small building was placed at $25, construction to be undertaken under the supervision of the Manual Training Instructor.\n\nThese improvements are considered necessary and if funds are available I would recommend that the Department authorize the expenditure of $51 involved.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nVancouver, B.C.,\nDecember 10, 1940.\n\nMemorandum to Mr. Webb,\n\nRe: Heating and Water Supply Systems at St. Catherine's School,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nSir:\n\nFurther to my memorandum to you dated October 5th, 1940 with reference to complaints about the heating and water supply systems at the above mentioned school, I now submit a final report on these matters.\n\nThe complaints as given to me verbally by Mr. Indian Agent Moore and outlined in his letter dated September 15th, 1940 to D. M. MacKay, Esq., Indian Commissioner for British Columbia were:\n\n1. The drinking water has a most disagreeable odour.\n2. The heating system fails to heat the building adequately.\n\nHeating System:\n\nI revisited the school on November 28th, 1940 and found that the heating system was functioning satisfactorily as the Indian Janitor now appears to have grasped the correct ideas of the manipulation of the hot air distributing controls.\n\nI would strongly recommend that an automatic door closer be attached to one door of both the\nfront and rear entrances as it is difficult to keep these doors closed in a school. Mr. Indian Agent Moore suggested that the door closers could be installed by the manual-training teacher. The two door closers of the Corbin type No. 3 can be supplied at the school for $12.00 each, a total of $26.00 complete. These were not provided for in the building specifications of this school.\n\nWater Supply System.\n\nAs was noted in my previous memorandum, this well was dug in July, 1939, and was deepened, cribbed, capped and had an electric pumping unit installed in December of that year. The water subsequently developed a disagreeable taste and odour in the spring of 1940 and this condition was intensified during the summer when the well was not in use. Such was the condition of the water on my visit of September 26th, 1940, but on the following day, the well having been pumped out in the interval, the water, which had accumulated, was found to have the same flat mineral taste, but practically no odour. Inside the well the disagreeable odour remained, the venting originally provided being insufficient as there was no indication or local experience to indicate such a condition of gaseous evolution arising.\n\nA bacteriological test of the water, dated October 11th, 1940 made by the Provincial Board of Health shows the water to be free of faecal bacteria and therefore indicates that there is no pollution. A copy of this report is attached.\nA chemical analysis of the water was obtained through the Sanitary Inspector's Office of the Provincial Board of Health and done by the Provincial Department of Mines.\n\nAttached is a copy of the Chief Sanitary Inspector's letter dated November 28th, 1940 interpreting the results of the chemical analysis, dated November 18th, 1940, a copy of which is also attached.\n\nIt will be noted that the Chief Sanitary Inspector states that the water appears to be of good quality, and the figure of total solids, 12.6 grains per gallon is not excessive, that the water would be classed as hard, but is not harmful to the health. Further he notes that while the sulphur content of the water is nil, the description of the well indicates there is probably H2S present in the water at the well, but as this gas passes off rapidly in the presence of the atmosphere it would not be present in the sample reaching the laboratory and hence by the time the water is used for drinking purposes, the smell of H2S is gone, it is not harmful to health.\n\nIn view of the foregoing reports, both bacteriological and chemical, it is safe to say that this well water is satisfactory for human consumption.\n\nHowever, as the well has a disagreeable odour and there will be a continued evolution of H2S gas, the following suggestion should prove a simple and inexpensive\nway to ventilate the well, if it is desired to do so. That a 4-foot by 4-foot structure 6 feet high, with open cable ends be built over the existing trap-door in the present well cover and bolted down to the cover in order that it may be removed should the cover have to be raised to allow maintenance work to be performed on the electrical pumping unit.\n\nIt is necessary to raise any such ventilation opening above the reach of the children, otherwise extraneous matter will be getting into the well. A fence would prove ineffective. The present hatch would be left open, but would remain attached so that in cold weather it could be closed if freezing-up of the pumping unit is feared.\n\nThe cost of materials for this structure is estimated at $25.00 and according to Mr. Indian Agent Moore could be erected by the manual-trainer. Should Indian labour be employed to erect the structure the cost of such labour would be $15.00. A suggested plan of the structure is attached.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. T. Ramsden.\n\nAPPROVED:\n\nIndian Affairs.

Webb,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water and Power Bureau,\n739 Hastings Street,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease find enclosed a copy of the Chief Analyst's report on the sample of water from the Indian School at Duncan.\n\nThis water appears to be of good quality due to this report and the former bacteriological reports. The figure for total solids is not excessive. Most of the solids is made up of calcium bicarbonate, which is also known as temporary hardness. This causes the formation of deposits and may cause a white precipitate (calcium carbonate) in the kettle. It may also cause a milky appearance at times. This is not harmful to health, although it would be classed as a hard water.\n\nThe Na Cl and K Cl is about the usual for well waters.\n\nThe sulphur content is nil, but from a description of the well, there probably is H2S (hydrogen sulphide) present in the water at the well. However, this gas passes off rapidly in the presence of the atmosphere, and it would not be present when the sample reached the laboratory. The hydrogen sulphide is probably due to decomposing vegetation in the swampy land near Duncan.\n\nSince, by the time the water is used for drinking purposes, the smell of the hydrogen sulphide is gone, it is not harmful to health.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed)\nR. Hovering\nChief Sanitary Inspector.\nDecember 19, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nRe: Cowichan Indian Day School, Duncan, B.C.\n\nHerewith is a report, in duplicate, covering the inspection by Engineer Ramsden of the heating system and water supply at the above school.\n\nYou will observe that since the Indian caretaker has been instructed on the proper operation of the heating plant, it is functioning satisfactorily.\n\nWith regard to the water supply system, Mr. Ramsden reports that after bacteriological and chemical analyses by the Provincial Board of Health, the water has been found to be free from pollution. It would be classed as hard but is satisfactory for human consumption. It appears, however, that the water contains a trace of H2S (Hydrogen sulphide) which, in the covered well, creates an unpleasant odor. To lessen this odor Mr. Ramsden recommends the erection of an inexpensive ventilating structure over the top of the well with openings within the reach of the school children, as indicated on the sketch accompanying the report. The existing covering would be retained, and except when danger or freezing existed, the trap door would remain open. The estimated cost of materials for this structure is approximately $25.00.\n\nMr. Ramsden has also recommended the installation of two door closers, one for each entrance to the school. These were not included in the contract for the erection of the school, and are estimated to cost $13.00 each.\n\nIt is understood that both the well ventilating structure and the door closers could be installed by the manual training instructor at the school, without expense to the Department, thus restricting the total necessary expenditure to $38.00.\n\nMr. Ramsden's suggestions are considered essential, and the cost is reasonable. It is recommended, therefore, that the Indian Affairs Branch be advised that the work should be undertaken as soon as possible under the supervision of the Indian Agent at Duncan, B.C., and utilizing the services of the manual training instructor at the school.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.M.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nJanuary 7, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nI am forwarding herewith, for your information, the following documents covering an inspection by Engineer H.T. Ramsden, of our Vancouver staff, on the heating system and water supply system of the Cowichan Indian Day School at Duncan, British Columbia:\n\n- Memorandum from the Chief Engineer, dated December 19, 1940.\n- Report of Mr. Ramsden to Mr. Webb, dated December 10, 1940.\n- Blueprint of ventilating structure over well.\n- Bill of Material for the latter.\n- Report on water by Provincial Board of Health.\n- Analysis of water by Chief Analyst.\n- Letter from Provincial Sanitary Inspector to Mr. Webb at Vancouver, dated November 28, 1940.\n\nYou will note that the heating plant was functioning satisfactorily at the time of the inspection and that insofar as the water supply is concerned, it is safe for human consumption; also that the unpleasant odour can be relieved by the construction of ventilators, at very small cost. This work, together with the installation of two door checks, would give a total expenditure, recommended by our Engineer, of $51.00.\nOur Chief Engineer recommends that this work be authorized and that it be undertaken under the supervision of your Indian Agent at Duncan, British Columbia.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nStatement re school children transported by Cowichan Valley Bus and Taxi Services (Kyle) as for the month of December, 1940.\nLoad checked - from Duncan Indian Village to St. Catherines Day School.\n\n1940\nDecember\n\n| Date | Passengers |\n|------|------------|\n| 2    | 34         |\n| 3    | 44         |\n| 4    | 50         |\n| 5    | 47         |\n| 6    | 48         |\n| 9    | 56         |\n| 10   | 53         |\n| 11   | 55         |\n| 12   | 61         |\n| 13   | 61         |\n| 16   | 62         |\n| 17   | 68         |\n| 18   | 68         |\n| 19   | 68         |\n| 20   | 67         |\n\n3 days not over 30 pupils = 11.80 per day = $35.40\n12 days over 30 pupils = 12.80 per day = $153.60\n$189.00\n\nCertified correct\nCowichan Valley Bus & Taxi Services (Kyle)\nDuncan, B.C.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPAY TO: Cowichan Valley Bus & Taxi Service.\n\nADDRESS: Duncan, B.C.\n\nAuthority Commissioner MacKay\nNo. 15/3/2994\nDec. 13th, 1939.\n\nDATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT\n---|---|---\nTo transportation of pupils to and from St. Catherine's Indian Day School, for the month of December, 1940. | $187.20\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct; that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 506\n\nVoucher No.: 759\n\nDATE: Dec. 30, 1940.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6388, File 807-5, part 4)\nSt. Catherine's School,\nDuncan, B.C.\nJanuary 17, 1941.\n\nMr. R.H. Moore, Indian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Moore:\n\nIt is my duty to inform you that this morning an accident occurred to one of the boys of the Primary Class, Roy Harry. As Mr. George May, the Bus driver, took on one of the school children, Roy, who sat in the front seat, unthinkingly placed his fingers right in the door. Not noticing this, the driver slammed the door, catching the index finger of Roy's right hand. Immediately upon his arrival at the school, Mr. Pat Corcoran brought the boy in Chris Camute's car to the Doctor who decided to amputate the first joint of the finger. Thereupon Roy was taken to the Hospital where he is at present.\n\nFrom information gathered from the children who witnessed the accident, the driver is not at fault. Roy is a subnormal boy, who acts heedlessly without regard to consequences.\n\nThis mishap gives rise to the occasion of mentioning the risk taken by Mr. Kyle of continuing to run the school bus when it is no longer fit for the service intended. It is too small for the accommodation of the present pupilage of St. Catherine's School. Four or five children must daily sit in a seat conveniently large enough for two only. On three different occasions the bus broke down which forced them to walk to school twice and once they arrived at 9:15.\n\nYour immediate attention to this matter would be much appreciated by all concerned.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n\"Sister Mary Armella\"\nPrincipal.\nDuncan, B. C.\n\nJanuary 20th, 1941.\n\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith a letter just received this morning from Sister Mary Armella, Principal of the St. Catherine's School, relating to an accident which occurred to one of the pupils on the school bus last Friday morning which I trust you will find in order.\n\nI might say that this accident was reported to me within an hour after it occurred by Mr. Kyle, who explained that it was purely an accident and that it was impossible for the driver to notice the boy's hand being in the back of the door at the time it was being closed. I can quite understand this as a finger can be put in so quickly that it would be next to impossible to even expect any driver to see it.\n\nWith regard to the Principal's complaint that the bus is no longer suitable for the services intended, I might say that this is hardly correct otherwise a license would not be issued by the Police Department. As you will remember 35 to 40 pupils is all that the bus was engaged for but some days there are actually more than 40 pupils riding in it, which makes it rather crowded. However, Mr. Kyle informed me that his new bus should have been here at the beginning of the current school term, but that owing to difficulties in delivery it has not yet arrived from Seattle where it is being assembled, although it is expected daily.\n\nIt is quite true that the present bus broke down on three different occasions this term, but none of these breakages were of a serious nature and as a matter of fact, two of them were directly responsible to the poor condition of the road through part of the Reserve over which the bus has got to travel. In any case, the new bus may be in operation any day now which should relieve this situation. I might mention that the boy was out of hospital within a few hours after having had his finger amputated at the first joint. To my mind it was purely an unfortunate accident without blame to anyone.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(R. H.

A copy of the agreement made with the Cowichan Valley Bus & Taxi Service is on file in your office and quite likely a copy of it is in Mr. Moore's office. Mr. Moore should be instructed to make certain that this Company fully carries out what they agreed to do in their contract. If there are any further breakdowns or accidents the continuation of this contract should receive your consideration and any recommendations that you desire to make in this regard will receive our concurrence.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nr.o. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nFebruary 5, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith a file of correspondence with reference to the transportation of the pupils of St. Catherine's Indian Day School in the Cowichan Agency by the Cowichan Valley Bus & Taxi Service (Kyle).\n\nThe Reverend Principal's letter of the 17th ultimo reported that a pupil, Roy Harry David, had been injured in the bus, resulting in the amputation of a finger at the first joint, that the bus in use at that time was unfit for this service and subject to breakdowns, and was overcrowded. My letter of the 24th ultimo to Mr. Indian Agent Moore suggested that this boy should be compensated by the Company for injury and that they should pay any medical costs that would be a charge against this Department. Mr. Moore replied on the 27th ultimo that another bus had been put on this service and that he did not feel like making a claim against the Company.\n\nIt would appear from this correspondence that the service rendered by this Company for the conveyance of these children did not meet our requirements. Road conditions alone could hardly account for breakdowns and, on one occasion, loss of a wheel, the country being comparatively level and free of snow. In any case, the condition of the road does not enter into the matter insofar as the provisions of the contract are concerned.\n\nThe bus now placed on this run is that taken off the service for the Duncan School Trustees and has more accommodation, but it remains to be seen whether or not it will meet our requirements. I am of the opinion that Mr. Moore should keep in close touch with the service rendered and if there are further breakdowns or accidents the continuation of this contract should receive careful consideration and Mr. Moore so advised.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nRegarding the accident to the child, involving partial loss of a finger, the overcrowded condition of the bus would appear to be a contributory factor to this accident and I would appreciate advice as to whether a claim should be entered against the Company and, if the Department has any information on the subject, the usual rate of compensation paid in such cases.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter, date and file number above noted, in further reference to the recent accident to Roy Harry David son of the late Harry David of the Quamichan Band Cowichan I. R. #1, and Julia Jack of the Penelakut Band. Father has been dead for approximately six years and the mother deserted the boy about the same time and since then he has been cared for by his aunt, Mary K. Nechel of the Koksilah Band Cowichan I. R. #1.\n\nThe total Hospital charges in connection with the accident amounts to $1.00 and he was only in the hospital for a few hours before being sent home.\n\nIt is quite true that another bus has been put in service on this run but it is not the new one but one of the other buses used by this Company on the Public School run here until recently. So far as I am aware it is the intention of the operator to keep this bus on our school run indefinitely. It is certainly not his intention to use the new bus, and I don't blame him as the road is not suitable.\n\nI might mention that this bus broke a wheel the second day it was on the run, and if you could drive over part of the road which it has to travel you would understand why the breakages occur, in spite of the fact that it is level country. I might also state that the new bus has arrived and is being used on the Public School run to replace the one which is being used at present on our run.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\n(R.H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nJanuary 28, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 27th instant with reference to St. Catherine's School bus, I would request that you advise me, in duplicate, of the cost of hospitalization of the injured boy (whose name has not been given), and if he has been discharged from hospital.\n\nIt is noted in the last paragraph of your letter that another bus has been put in service in this connection and I would like to be advised whether or not this bus is to be kept on this run or if it is merely a temporary one until the new bus arrives, as set out in your letter of the 20th instant.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nR.H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\nDuncan, B. C.\n\nJanuary 27th, 1941.\n\nD.M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter, date and file number above noted, with reference to a report from the Rev. Principal attached to my letter of Jan. 20th regarding an accident to one of the pupils of St. Catherine's School while travelling on the school bus.\n\nIn few of the fact that the child who was injured is regarded as being sub-normal, I do not feel like making a claim against the Company unless definitely instructed by you so to do. No complaint has been made to me by the parents of the child since the accident occurred.\n\nRegarding the last paragraph of your letter, I am not in a position to state why the bus breaks down but I do say that if the bus was not in reasonably good repair the Police Department would not give a permit for its operation. To explain break downs is difficult especially when I am not the driver and have got to depend on what I am told by other people.\n\nFor your information I wish to say that another bus has been put in service this morning on this school run. While it is not a new bus nevertheless it is in good repair and has been used on one of the white school bus routes; furthermore it will handle between 45 and 50 children without over-crowding.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(R. H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nJanuary 24, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 20th instant with reference to your report of the Principal of St. Catherine's School regarding an accident which occurred to one of the pupils being conveyed by the school bus on the 17th instant, I would point out that Section 8 of the contract with the Cowichan Valley Bus & Taxi Service, dated December 19, 1939, makes the Company responsible for any injury to children who may be passengers in such vehicle. It appears to me that you could make claim against them on behalf of the child for compensation and also for any hospitalization or other medical expenses incurred outside of that given by the Medical Officer for the Reserve.\n\nIt is not understood why the bus, if it is in reasonable repair, should break down on comparatively level roads in the vicinity of Duncan notwithstanding the poor condition of the roads at the time. You should see that the Company provides proper transportation for these children and if they refuse to do so report to this office in order that the Department may review the matter of continuation of the Contract.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith in duplicate a letter from the Principal of the St. Catherine's School which I trust you will find self explanatory.\n\nNot knowing the policy of the Department in regards to the supplying of musical instruments for the use of Day Schools in other parts of Canada, I would respectfully point out that St. Catherine's is a four roomed consolidated school where everything that is taught in a residential school practically, is taught there, so that to all intents and purposes there is very little difference in the actual educational facilities\u2014in fact I personally feel that St. Catherine's is the better of the two.\n\nHaving this in mind, I assume that the teaching of music in the schools where the attendance warrants it, and suitable facilities exist, is encouraged by the Department but to what extent I naturally don't know. I would therefore respectfully request that I be informed if the Department would be good enough to consider purchasing a piano for the use of this School.\n\nI note that the Principal asks for a second hand piano and I may say that if favourable consideration can be given to the request, I know of a splendid instrument which cost $500.00 about two years ago and which is in excellent condition, in a private home all the time and well cared for, which can be purchased now for $250.00 as the lady who owns it plans on moving into an apartment and has not got the room for it.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nThe Secretary;\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nMines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\n(R.H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nSt. Catherine's School,\nDuncan, B.C., June 3, 1941.\n\nMr. R. H. Moore, Indian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Moore:\n\nSince the opening of St. Catherine's School, January 1939, Sister Superior from St. Ann's School, Duncan, has, gratuitously, lent us an organ for the vocal education of our Indian charges. It was found necessary to remove the organ, leaving the school without a musical instrument, so much needed for the general development of the children. Voice culture has formed an important part in their training, and their response has been most gratifying.\n\nWhat a pity for the pupils and a drawback for the school, were we obliged, owing to the absence of a musical instrument, to discontinue voice and dramatic training?\n\nWe would urge you, therefore, to kindly request a piano from the Department of Indian Affairs for St. Catherine's School. A second-hand instrument will be quite satisfactory.\n\nTrusting to receive a favorable reply,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nSister Mary Amella,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nJuly 5, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th ultimo you may expend an amount of $5.41 in purchasing the articles shown on the attached list for use at the St. Catherine's Day School.\n\nI am also in receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo with reference to purchasing a piano for this school. It is not our usual practice to supply either a piano or an organ to an Indian day school. However, as you point out, the St. Catherine's School is somewhat different from the ordinary Indian day school. The price which you quote for a second hand piano appears very high as practically any large piano firm in any of the cities usually has on hand quite a large selection of second hand pianos any one of which can be secured for approximately $50.00. You might make further inquiries in Vancouver and write to me again about this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. R.H.

If requests for regular repairs reached us at that time I am of the opinion that a great deal of correspondence, particularly air mail correspondence, would be unnecessary. In any event it seems to me sound policy to insist that all repairs at our schools should be undertaken during the months of July and August if at all possible. It is my earnest hope that our Indian Agents will co-operate with us next year in the attempt we intend to make to have our repair programme started early in the season.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith an application from Mr. Indian Agent Moore requesting authority to expend the sum of $40.00 for gravel for the entrance to the school and additional planking for sidewalks. No provision was made in the current year's estimates but it is considered that these improvements should be carried out and, if funds are available, I would recommend that the expenditure involved be authorized.\n\nPlease let me have an early reply.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDuncan, B. C.\nSeptember 12th, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to apply for permission to expend the sum $30.00 in doing additional graveling on the driveways of the St. Catherine's School. This will permit 20 loads of gravel at a cost of $1.50 per load. The water in the river is quite low now and it is an excellent time to get the kind of gravel that is most suitable from the river bottom. An early reply will be appreciated. It is expected that I will be able to get an Indian with a truck to haul the gravel. I would also like to get 10 more 20' planks for walks at a cost of $10.00.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nD.M.

It was found at that time that we did not have a suitable tool for this work and as the tools for the Manual Training Department had not been received it was necessary that this drill with bits be procured and later included in the requisition for the tools. However, for some unknown reason the Manual Training Instructor at that time omitted to include the brace and bits in his requisition and I did not notice the omission, the result being that we have had this particular tool for a year and a half now and it has not been paid for.

(RG 10, Volume 6388, File 807-5, part 5)\nOttawa,\nOctober 22, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant you may expend the following amounts for midday meal purposes:\n\nSt. Catherine's Indian Day School - $10.00 a teaching month\n\nKoksilah Indian Day School - $2.75 a teaching month\n\nI regret that the funds at our disposal will not permit any increase in the above amounts which are the same as were allowed last year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. R.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to apply herewith for the usual grants for the Indian Day Schools in this Agency for the Cocoa and hot drinks for the children during the noon hour.\n\nSt Catherine's Indian Day School. $10.00 per school month.\nKoksilah Indian Day School. 3.00 \" \"\nTsartlip Indian Day School, already applied for.\n\nThe considered opinion of the teachers of all the schools, and my own as well, is that this hot drink in the middle of the day is really a god-send to most of the children who bring their lunch to school, as oftentimes their lunch consists of bread and jam and the odd apple. Funnily enough it is the children who come from the poorer homes who are the most regular attendants at school and I believe in giving them every encouragement. In fact I believe that the hot drinks are responsible to a large extent for the lack of colds and minor sickness among the children and surely an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure.\n\nI honestly believe that during the five or six months in the fall and winter that the Department would be well advised to arrange to have the teacher in the Day Schools serve hot soup each day at noon to those children who don't go home for lunch. It would not mean a large expenditure, about an average of $5.00 per month per school for soup bones, (and the children could bring the vegetables for it) but what a blessing to the children it would be as well as an excellent tonic of the kind that the Indian child does not get enough of.\n\nIf you would be good enough to give me the necessary authority to get the cocoa etc. as requested above, I would be greatly obliged.\n\nThe Secretary:\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nOctober 17, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nVery strong representations have been made to the Department from time to time by the staff at the St. Catherine's School requesting that an organ be supplied. We have not felt in a position to authorize this expenditure but in August we wrote to Indian Agent Moore and advised him that if he could secure a piano or organ for approximately $50.00 the Department would provide funds for its purchase. I am now advised by Indian Agent Moore that the Order to which the Rev. Principal of the St. Catherine's School belongs has a piano which they will sell us for $50.00. If you consider this a good purchase you may secure it and place it in the St. Catherine's School. When forwarding the account you should attach copy of your purchase order.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.

If the offer of the Sister Superior of St. Ann's School for Boys is acceptable to the Department I would thank you for the necessary authority to purchase the piano referred to.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nH.

So far I can find none worth while that could be procured for the sum of fifty dollars.\n\nIn my dilemma I have spoken to Sister Superior of St. Ann's School for Boys who has a piano for sale. This piano would sell for at least seventy-five dollars or more but seeing the transaction is between schools, Sister had condescended to let the instrument go for fifty dollars, it being understood that St. Catherine's School pays for the transportation.\n\nTrusting that the Department will approve the transaction and have the instrument installed as early as possible, I am,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sister Mary Sheila)\nPrincipal.\nSt. Catherine's Indian Day School,\nDuncan, B.

It is understood, of course, that he will not even be employed on a temporary basis.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOctober 1, 1941.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Transportation, St. Catherine's Indian Day School.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a letter received from Mr. Indian Agent Moore recommending that permission be granted to Mr. P. Corcoran, employed as Boys' Supervisor and Manual Training instructor at St. Catherine's Indian Day School, to drive the bus used in transportation of children attending this school until such time as the Cowichan Valley Bus & Taxi Service can secure the services of a regular driver for this purpose.\n\nIt will be recalled that this question of the part-time employment of Mr. Corcoran as bus driver for this Company was before the Department last year and on that occasion the application was not approved. My objection to this proposal, even as a temporary measure, is that such an arrangement places a responsibility on the Department which, in view of the existing contract, should not be assumed. As pointed out previously, Mr. Corcoran is an employee of the Government and would, in my opinion, involve the Department if he were to take on the additional duties suggested. For this, and other reasons, I am not prepared to recommend the application. The Cowichan Valley Bus & Taxi Service should not depend on employees of this Department to assist them to the extent suggested to carry out the terms of their contract.\n\nThe suggestion that the morning sessions begin at ten o'clock does not meet with the Inspector's approval as the change would probably result in a decrease in attendance.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Bus Transportation for Day Schools on Cowichan I.R.\n\nMr. J.A. Kyle has approached me in regard to the possibility of our Manual Training Instructor at the St. Catherine's School being permitted to drive the School Bus on account of the shortage of Class A drivers, most of whom are in the Armed Forces.\n\nThis matter has been referred to the Department on a previous occasion but Ottawa did not consider it advisable to give the necessary permission. However, at that time the shortage of \"Class A\" men was not acute but it certainly is now and I am given to understand that the same condition exists all over this Island\u2014viz., the impossibility to get qualified drivers.\n\nUnder the circumstances I would recommend that the Department be again approached on this matter with a view to getting them to permit Mr. Corcoran to drive the School Bus owing to unusual circumstances, as described above.\n\nThe only other alternative is that the Schools do not open until 10 a.m., so that the pupils can be handled in the Bus after it returns from the local public and high schools. The only objection to that is the lateness of the hour that the School would get out which would mean that it would be dark before the children go home and the light in some of the schools would be very poor for the last half hour of school, i.e., from 3:30 until 4:00 p.m.\n\nYour early consideration to this matter will be appreciated, and it is understood that the above arrangement only lasts until Mr. Kyle can get a full time driver, with the necessary qualifications.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nMajor D.M.

At present water has to be heated in kettles on the stove and a small reservoir attached to the stove, which by no means provide the ordinary requirements of the School.\n\nThere is no doubt as to the real need for proper facilities for heating water for a school the size of St. Catherine's for use in the kitchen, for keeping the floors and woodwork cleaned, and by the pupils, and I would strongly recommend that the purchase of the necessary equipment be authorized. The cost of materials, including a new hot water jacket for the stove, would be approximately $49.00. The installation can be carried out by the Manual Training Instructor without cost to the Department.\n\nAn early reply in connection with this matter would be appreciated.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

The children attending the Cowichan Indian Day School, who reacted positively to the skin test were brought to St. Catherine's School for plating.\n\nDuring the course of my visit to St. Catherine's School, I noted that no drinking fountains have as yet been installed either in the School building or outside adjacent to the play grounds.\n\nIn my opinion when possible the \"common drinking cups\" should be replaced by drinking fountains to avoid the direct transfer of infection from one or more unsuspected open cases of tuberculosis to children who have not as yet contracted the disease.\n\nDuring the time I was in this School, I saw six or eight children line up at the top and drink one after the other, from a common drinking cup.\n\nThe drinking water at St. Catherine's School is pumped from a well by an automatic pump, so that there would be no difficulty in obtaining the required water pressure to operate drinking fountains.\n\nI would recommend that two drinking fountains be installed within the school building, one in the common play room, and the other in the manual training room. A third fountain should be installed outside at a convenient point adjacent to the play grounds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.L.

This means that the bus had to make a detour of 8 miles up the bench road and round by Cowichan Bay both going to Kokanish and returning, a total of sixteen extra miles.\n\nThe detour had to be made in the morning when the children were being taken to school, but by afternoon the highway had been cleared.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(R.H.

The cleaning of the chimneys at the Kuper Island Residential School should be handled by the school management.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M.

The cleaning of the chimneys of the other schools might be undertaken although it is felt the janitor of St. Catherine's Indian Day School should be able to reduce the cost some by cleaning the pipes. He would not have the equipment for cleaning the rather high brick chimneys.\n\nYour advice will be appreciated.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor D.M.

C.\n\nRe: Heating at St. Catherine's Indian Day School\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs requested by you some time ago we have made a survey of the Hot Air Heating as installed at the above school and set out below some of our observations.\n\nA. The furnace is a No.229 Good Cheer made by Clare Bros. It has a 28\" diam. fire pot and is rated by this firm at 60,000 cubic feet heating capacity.\n\nB. There is four class rooms each being supplied by a 22\" diameter Hot air pipe having a 12\" branch taken off in basement to heat the two lunch rooms and manual training shop. Each of the four class rooms have one 12\" x 24\" Hot Air opening and one 12\" x 18\" Return Air grill. From practical experience this is not a good set up for a gravity Hot Air heating system, particularly considering the position in which each has been placed.\n\nC. At the time this school was being figured, we were asked to put in a tender for the heating. We were not satisfied with the plans and specifications then submitted and could not see our way clear to give the guarantee asked for on the proposed gravity system, we did however, submit plans, specification and a price on a forced air circulating system and were advised that it could not be considered by the department at that time.\n\nD. We are of the opinion that if the hot air pipes are fitted with adjustable dampers and that the return air ducts are connected to a 15\" fan properly housed and fitted to the furnace you can make the present system efficiently heat each class room to an even temperature, if properly operated. The heating of the lower rooms would possibly be sufficient but we could not say that they would in the coldest weather reach a high temperature.\nE. We are pleased to recommend that a 155 Chinook 15\" fan or equal be installed including Housing of same and making all return air duct and furnace connections, electrical work for Furnacestal to control operation of the fan, at a cost of $330.00\n\nThe installing of a fan on this job will greatly add to the life of the furnace.\n\nF.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI beg to report that the Rev Principal of the St. Catherine's Indian Day School has reported to me that the electric iron at the school has gone out of commission owing to a thermostat in the mechanism going out of business. I spoke to the local electrician and he told me that this was the trouble and that it would cost approximately $3.50 for a new thermostat and about $1.50 for labor, or a total of $5.00 to put it back in working order again.\n\nIn discussing the matter with the Rev. Sister I wanted to know why it was necessary to have an automatic iron when the ordinary housewife got along with the customary electric iron without any automatic cut-off, and she stated that on account of several children using the same iron at several different times during the course of a day, there was always the chance that one or other of them would leave it on when they were finished with it and do serious damage; and that was the reason why the automatic type was purchased.\n\nMay I have your authority to have this iron repaired if-and when-a thermostat can be procured?\n\n(R.H.

C. Warren of the Dominion Water and Power Bureau dated the 18th instant, in connection with which Mr. District Chief Engineer Webb informed me on the 18th instant that when the pumping equipment was installed his Bureau recommended that it be placed in the basement of the school and that Mr. Warren's recommendations now appear to substantiate this.\n\nThe matter was taken up with Mr. Indian Agent Moore and I enclose his letter of the 25th instant herewith recommending a change of location of the pump and pressure tank to inside the school building, the cost of which it will be noted will amount to $225.00.\n\nConsiderable trouble has been experienced with this pump due to the motor, etc., burning out through dampness and I would recommend that the Engineer's recommendations be carried out if funds can be found for the purpose.\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your above noted letter, with attached copy of report from Mr Warren in connection with the proposed change in the location of the water pump and pressure tank at the St Catherine's school.

The location mentioned in Mr Warren's report would appear to be quite satisfactory. This letter going forward in triplicate.\n\n(R.H.

HERR:\n\nRe: Cowichan Bay School\nWater Supply System\n\nIn company with the Indian Agent, Mr. Moore, I inspected the water supply system at the above institution on October 7. It had been reported to this office by the Indian Commissioner that difficulty had been experienced in keeping the plant in operation.\n\nI found the pumping plant to be operating satisfactorily but was informed by the caretaker that he did not allow the plant to work automatically as intended as he was afraid of something happening. Consequently the pump is started manually when the supply of water in the pressure tank becomes low. There does not appear to be any particular reason why the plant should not operate as intended.\n\nIn reviewing the repairs effected to date, I noted as follows:\n\nThe plant was installed in December, 1939. In July, 1941 the motor starting coil burned out and had to be removed. In January, 1943 the motor burned out and had to be removed. In June, 1943 pressure switch ceased to function and had to be replaced. The local electrician who has repaired the equipment on several occasions, informed me that he believed that the pressure switch had been frozen at some time as the diaphragm was found to be badly distorted. This of course could only occur in the winter and if so may have been the cause of the motor burning out in January of this year.\nThe type of motor repair required would appear to indicate an overload on the motor at times but none of the factors likely to cause overload appear to be present - line voltage is normal and the pump functions well when the motor runs, the pump being of non-overloading type.\n\nIt appears to me that if difficulties are to be avoided in future the well head shelter will have to be rebuilt to provide better protection from the weather or the pumping equipment will have to be moved into the school. I am very much in favour of the latter. In my mind there is little doubt that excessive moisture in the pump house is mainly responsible for the breakdowns and it may be that dampness cannot be entirely eliminated by reconstruction of the well head shelter.\n\nIt is estimated that the cost of rebuilding the shelter would amount to $95.00.\n\nTo move the pumping equipment into the school is estimated to cost $225.00. The equipment could be located in the storeroom now used for manual training tools, etc. This room will not be required when the partitioning of the large basement room now under way is completed.\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.E.

The Principal, however, pointed out that equipment of this kind would take quite a long time to make and would engage almost the entire attention of the manual training instructor, leaving little time for general instruction in manual training to the boys taking this course. She also explained that Mr. Morrison was, at present, employed on flooring part of the basement of the school and building a partition, work that required skill and care in order that it would be similar in quality to the surrounding construction and, consequently, very little of it could be entrusted to the boys who had received very little instruction to date in proper use of tools. The Principal's contention is simply that the manual training instructor should be free to carry out the program set down for the manual training division and not engaged on work, the major part of which he has to do himself, without any resulting benefit to his pupils.\n\nEquipment along the lines suggested is necessary and it probably would be as well to purchase part or all of it if funds are available and I would so recommend. The Department's decision in this matter at an early date would be appreciated.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nDuncan, B. G.\n\nNovember 15/43.\n\nMajor D.M.

We instructed Major MacKay to do so and in reply he suggests that the work should be given to your Branch and that necessary instructions should be issued by you to Mr. C.E.

E. Webb, District Chief Engineer of the Vancouver office of the Branch, as it is considered that the work should be carried out under the supervision of one of their Engineers, preferably Mr. W.C.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 30th ultimo, the Department approves the expenditure necessary for framing the pictures of the King and Queen. I agree with you that one framed picture of the King and Queen in each of the four classrooms should be sufficient at the St. Catherine's School.\n\nThe Department also approves the expenditure required for purchasing material for framing the pictures of the King and Queen in the other schools in the Cowichan Agency.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith a requisition dated the 1st instant, and a letter dated the 24th instant received from Mr. Indian Agent Moore requesting authority to expend $25.50 for the framing of six pictures of the King and Queen, and two Proficiency Charts for the St. Catherine's Indian Day School, and also advising that it will require an additional eight frames for other schools in his Agency which, I understand, would cost about $5.50 each making a total of $35.50.\n\nI am of the opinion that St. Catherine's School could get along with one framed picture of the King & Queen for each of the four class rooms.\n\nIf funds can be provided for this purpose I would recommend approval of the application.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nIn reply to your letter above noted with reference to the cost of material with which to make picture frames for St. Catherine's Indian Day School. I beg to advise that it will be quite in order to send the frames as described, as it will certainly save making them especially as the cost be less even with the express charges.\n\nThese frames are all for St. Catherine's school. Six of them are for pictures of Their Majesties, The King & Queen, (one set in each class room) while the smaller frames are for other pictures in the school.\n\nI will require another eight frames for the other day schools to accommodate the pictures of Their Majesties, so if you could get eight more frames of the large size at Spicer's you might please have them all shipped at the same time and when the accounts are being charged for payment the names of the various school to which they were supplied will be shown, and which are outside of St. Catherines: One set of two frames for each of the following schools: Koksilah, Songhees, Nanaimo, Tsartlip & Saanich. Since these pictures were received we have another Day school in the Agency viz: Saanich, so they should have a set of these pictures as well. If we cannot get the two extra pictures I will only require frames for seven sets, 14 altogether.\n\n(R.H.

However, as it was considered advisable to have a ladder at the school, Mr. Moore was requested to secure details or materials required for the construction of one in the manual training shop. From the information now received, it would appear that the materials would cost almost as much as a factory-made ladder.

I wish to advise that this has been on order since the authority was received but unfortunately delivery has not yet been made, and Mac & Mac's traveller tells me that he is not sure just when we will be able to get it.\n\nIn the meantime the cove troughs at the school had to be attended to as the weight of water and coal dust in them caused them to bend in the middle to just about the breaking pint and consequently to avoid greater expense it was necessary for us to get a ladder in a hurry and the cost of this, largely on account of the delivery charges both to and from the school, was $2.50. Voucher in payment of this is attached hereto and I would ask you to be good enough to approve it and forward to the Department for payment.\n\nThe total mileage involved for the two return trips is ten miles.\n\n(R.H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 152-22-5\n\nWith reference to Mr. Hoey's letter of November 2nd authorizing the purchase of an extension ladder for use at the St. Catherine's Indian Day School, I enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Moore's letter of January 29th wherein he advises that he has to date been unable to secure a ladder and, consequently, was forced to rent one to clean out the eave troughs at the school.

That we obligated ourselves and purchased a new bus for this run.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver,\n\nI beg to submit herewith a letter, and copy of same, which I trust you will find self-explanatory.\n\nIn this regard I might say that this Company has given us really good service during the past five years and as the contract was originally drawn up and entered into on the understanding that it covered a period of 10 months annually, this in fact has not been the case, for with the exception of the last two years we have only had an eight and nine month school year, which has really not been quite fair to the operator\u2014especially as he had to go to the expense of getting a new Bus.\n\nI would recommend that the contract be renewed for another five years on the same terms and conditions. Mr Kyle has been very good in giving extra services to the pupils of this school at various times such as at Christmas, when he has run special bus to take the children to and from the school after they have put on their annual school concert. He has also taken the children to various sports events without cost either to the children or their parents, which I feel was very good of him.\n\n(R.H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Moore's letter of March 3rd and enclosure referred to therein in connection with the proposed renewal of the contract with the Cowichan Valley Bus and Taxi Service for transportation of pupils to and from St. Catherine's Indian Day School. The present five year contract expires June 30, 1945, and in view of the Agent's recommendation and the excellent service given by the Company, it is recommended that the contract be renewed for a further five years on the same terms and conditions.\n\nD.M.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, with reference to Domestic Science equipment requisitioned for the St. Catherine's Indian Day School. On reviewing the list of pupils who are taking the Domestic Science course, it is noted that only ten of them attend school over one hundred days. In other words, not more than ten of these have been present much more than half the school year. This means that the daily attendance at the Domestic Science work is by no means large.\n\nWith the above in mind it is felt that equipment costing not more than $50.00 should be sufficient and authority is granted for the expenditure of the amount stated.\n\nIf the Domestic Science class increases during the coming academic year and if the pupils in the class attend regularly more equipment might be necessary. In this event you can make a further application.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Moore's requisition of April 27th, 1945, for domestic science equipment for St. Catherine's Indian Day School amounting to an approximate cost of $150.00, together with a copy of my enquiry of the 14th ultimo to Mr. Moore and his reply of the 18th instant from which it would appear that the Agent has not modified his original recommendation contained in the requisition.\n\nI consider the requisition excessive and an expenditure of $30.00 to $40.00 for this material should be ample. It would be appreciated if the Department would advise what they consider a satisfactory list for this school with the limited number of domestic science pupils as set out by Mr. Moore.\n\nD.M.

Until the equipment is provided nothing can be done anyway so until we get the equipment what is the use in asking for money to buy supplies that there is nothing to cook them in.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver\n\nYou will please remember that we discussed the drainage from the kitchen or domestic science room at the St. Catherine's Indian School during your last visit there and I showed you just how it operated, simply draining through soil pipes about 100' from the building and spilling out on the top of the ground.\n\nSometimes the odor from the outlet is most obnoxious, not to mention the other drawbacks to such a system of disposal, and so I decided that it would be advisable to have the caretaker dig a hole 6 feet deep\u2014which it is thought will get us into gravel\u2014and four feet square on top, then fill this hole with rocks or small boulders from the river to within about a foot from the top, carry the water from the outlet down by soil pipes to almost the bottom of the hole and the rocks, then refill the top of the hole with earth for about a foot in depth which will bring it up level with the surrounding ground.\n\nThis will require an expenditure for rocks to be hauled from the river of $12.00 to $15.00 plus the cost of pipes amounting to about $1.00 or a total maximum of $16.00.\n\nI would also like authority to expend the sum of $10.00 in having gravel and sand hauled to place under the swings etc., at the same school as there are holes being dug now and it becomes very wet and muddy during the wet rainy weather. Your kind attention to this at your early convenience.\n\n(R.H. Moore) Indian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Moore's letter of September 26th wherein he requests authority for an expenditure of $26.00 for improvements at the St. Catherines Indian Day School. The expenditure would appear to be necessary and I have authorized Mr. Moore to proceed with the work, which action I trust will meet with your approval.\n\nD.M.

It is understood that this extra cost is due to the condition of the road, caused by one of the bridges being closed for repairs.\n\nIt is further noted, from Indian Agent Caldwell's letter, that the extra payment will be required for approximately 12 days.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Acting Indian Agent Caldwell's letter of November 30th in connection with transportation of children to the St. Catherine's Indian Day School.\n\nIt will be noted that the capacity of the school bus is exceeded to the extent of 10 or 12 pupils and that Mr. Kyle, the operator, is carrying the extra children by taxi at an additional cost of $3.00 per day. This condition is apparently caused by the Clemclemaluts bridge being closed for repairs and is unavoidable; in view of which it is recommended that the Department authorize the additional expenditure until such time as the bridge is repaired.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDuncan, B. C.\n\nNovember 30th, 1945\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nFurther to our letter of May 21st last regarding the Contract for transportation of school children on the Cowichan I.R., I beg to advise that the Operators of the Bus have informed me that at the present time their Bus is overcrowded to the extent of 10 to 12 pupils. Its capacity is 50 persons and there are over 60 wanting transportation to and from school.\n\nMr Kyle has offered to carry the extra children in his large Taxi at a cost of $1.50 per trip which would mean a total expenditure of $3.00 per day. Pending your approval to this request I have authorised Mr Kyle to use his Taxi at the above rates.\n\nThis condition is expected to continue until the Clamclamutz Bridge is repaired and which is supposed to be completed in another week or ten days.\n\nJ.D.

Also the first section of the Fire Pot is burnt out. The second section is cracked and we found the feed pouch to be badly warped.\n\nIn view of the fact that it would cost a great deal to repair this furnace in such a manner that it would give satisfaction, we respectfully submit that some thought should be given to the purchase of a new one. We suggest that an all steel Heavy Duty Furnace which could be installed at a cost of $350.00 (Complete) would in the long run prove more economical than having the old furnace repaired. These all steel heavy duty furnaces have proven themselves and we can assure you that they give entire satisfaction.\n\nTrusting that you will give this matter your consideration and that we may be favoured with your instructions, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nManager.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI have to refer to my Night Letter of February 5th as follows:\n\n\"Indian Agent Moore reports furnace at St. Catherines school beyond economical repair Stop Estimated costs of repairs two hundred and fifty dollars and no assurance when necessary parts can be secured Stop School closed Stop Recommend purchase new all steel heavy duty furnace now available at three hundred and twenty dollars completely installed stop Wire reply.\"\n\nMr. Indian Agent Moore's letter of February 5th in connection with this matter is enclosed herewith for your information and files. Your telegram approving the purchase of a new furnace at a cost of $320.00 has been received and Mr. Moore has been requested to have the new furnace installed as soon as possible.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nFebruary 5th, 1946.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nI beg to attach herewith in duplicate a letter received from the local Plumber relative to the present condition of the furnace of St. Catherine's Indian Day School, and which I trust you may find self-explanatory.\n\nOn the 1st inst. it was reported to me that the inside of the fire box of this furnace had broken down and the janitor was unable to put any more fire on. I got in touch with the Plumber and asked him to go out and examine it and advise just what was wrong. Owing to the fact that the fire was still on and the furnace hot he could not make a proper inspection until the following day, and on which I did not receive his report until yesterday.\n\nMr. Griffiths recommends the installation of a complete new furnace at a total cost of $320.00 installed, and which it is expected he will be able to procure almost immediately from Victoria or Vancouver. He considers that the old furnace is so badly used up that it would not be economical to make the necessary repairs, even providing we could get the required parts in a reasonable time\u2014which he explains might take two months at least judging from his recent experiences in getting parts. However, to find out all the parts that would have to be renewed it would mean the complete dismantling of the furnace. Going on estimated costs of the known parts that will be required, plus the labor costs involved in making the repairs, it would appear as if the difference in the price of these repairs and the new furnace would be about $70.00, and then with the warping of some of the parts that might not need to be renewed it is extremely doubtful if we would ever have economic operation.\n\nAs explained to you over the telephone, the school is closed, although I managed to arrange for the senior grades to receive their class room work in the adjoining\n\n(over)\n| DATE   | ITEMS          | CHARGES | CREDIT | PAY LAST AMOUNT IN THIS COLUMN |\n|--------|----------------|---------|--------|--------------------------------|\n| JAN 2  | 22 LBS SUGAR   | 180     |        |                                |\n| 30 TINS MILK    | 3 05       |         |        |                                |\n| 10 LBS COCOA    | 1 75       |         |        |                                |\n| 24 TINS SOUP    | 2 40       |         |        |                                |\n| SODAS           | 45         |         |        |                                |\n| 5 LBS SYRUP     | 55         | 10 00   |        | 10 00                          |\n\nCowichan Valley's Shopping Centre\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is required now so that it can be hauled before the school reopens and may have a chance to settle a little so that it will not be carried into the school on the feet of the pupils.\n\nI would also ask for authority to engage an Indian with a team for two days to cut the grass on the school grounds within the next week or ten days before it has a chance to dry up and become a fire menace not only to the grounds and surrounding bush but to the building itself. It is customary to cut and haul this grass and weeds off the grounds entirely to the dump and last year it took two days to do it. The cost for this will be $10.00 per day or a total of $20.00.\n\nR.

The Indian Agent comments correctly, therefore, when he says \"there is no room at present in the School building even for the installation of toilets for the staff\".\n\nTo arrange for flush toilets, it would be necessary to carry out major structural alterations to the building, provide a larger pump and pressure tank, build a septic tank, and install a sewage disposal bed. Toilet fixtures could not be accommodated in any existing space and appendages to the building added for the purpose, which could only be reached through Classrooms, would definitely spoil the attractive appearance of the building. These added rooms would, of course, even in British Columbia require some heating and the present hot air system of heating is not large enough to carry any extensions.\n\nIt is felt that Indian Affairs would not be prepared to spend the necessary funds for the items involved which, under present circumstances, are very roughly estimated to be in the neighbourhood of $5,000.00.\n\nUnder these circumstances, no purpose would be served in sending an officer to Duncan, and it is recommended that the School be allowed to remain as at present. Unless instructed to the contrary, therefore, this Service will take no further action on the matter.\n\nT. S. Mills.\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ. M.

C.\n\nI wish to advise that there is another transportation problem for school children on the Cowichan I. R. No. 3, which has cropped up.\n\nThere are seven children, between the ages of 13 and 7, residing on this Reserve, who should be at school. Their names and particulars are as follows:\n\n| CHILD'S NAME | AGE | PARENT OR GUARDIAN | BAND AND NUMBER |\n|--------------|-----|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Clarence WILSON | 13  | Albert Wilson      | #77 Cowichan Band |\n| Nelson WILSON   | 11  | Albert Wilson      | #77 Cowichan Band |\n| Cloero AUGUST    | 7   | Edward August (G.P.) | #47 Somenos Band |\n| John Baptiste JACK | 7   | Frank Jack         | #35 Clowemelmut Band |\n| Barbara DICK     | 11  | Robbie Daniels (G.P.) | #1 Kilpaulus Band |\n| Ronald DICK      | 10  | Robbie Daniels (G.P.) | #1 Kilpaulus Band |\n| Richard DICK     | 8   | Robbie Daniels (G.P.) | #1 Kilpaulus Band |\n\nThe three last named belong to the West Coast Agency but, as their Mother died some one and one-half years ago, they have been cared for by their grandparents.\n\nThere is no room for any of these children to attend any Residential School and the parents can look after them satisfactorily.\n\nMy recommendation is that we arrange for their transportation from Cowichan Bay to the Tennis Court corner, a distance of two and one-half miles, (which is about half way along the South line of the Cowichan I. R. #9) where they could board our regular bus and go to their respective schools -- either Eoksishal or St. Catherine's. The transportation would be arranged by Taxi from Cowichan Bay in the a.m. and then it would pick them up off the road in the afternoon about 3:40 p.m. The total distance travelled by Taxi -- two trips daily -- would be ten miles, at a daily cost of two dollars and fifty cents ($2.50). The operator of this Taxi is fully ensured and is most reliable.\n\nI hope this may receive your early, and favourable, consideration.\n\nR. H. MOORE\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is presumed that there is room available for these children at either Koksilah or St. Catherine's School, but pending receipt of information from Mr. Moore to this effect and further details with respect to the proposal, I would recommend that the Department approve in principle the provision of transportation for these children.

Sister Mary Sheila was notified, by letter, that the sum of ten dollars ($10.00) per month had been authorized with which to purchase materials to provide a hot drink for the pupils at St. Catherine's Indian Day School each day.\n\nOn September 30th I received a letter from the Rev. Sister asking that at least another two dollars ($2.00) per month be granted.\n\nOn October 1st Sister Sheila was authorized to expend the sum of ten dollars ($10.00) per month for cooking supplies.\n\nAbout one week later, I told the Rev. Sister that, as I had applied on August 20th for twelve dollars ($12.00) per month for supplies for hot drinks and only ten dollars ($10.00) had been authorized, I could not see the necessity of applying again, particularly as the attendance at that time was not any more than 50 or 60 pupils and the school was already receiving another $10.00 per month for cooking supplies.\n\nI now wish to attach a copy of a letter recently received from the Rev. Sister which I hope may be found self-explanatory.\n\nPersonally, I feel her comparison with the amount Koksilah school is receiving is unfair. The average attendance at St.\nCatherine's school during the last quarter of the 1946-47 Academic Year was less than 20% of her pupilage and this should have allowed her to get a little ahead in her supplies. Furthermore, the same facilities for the economic preparation of the hot drinks do not exist at the Koksilah Indian Day School. Some of the children in attendance at the Koksilah School have to leave home earlier in the morning and they get home later in the evening than those at St. Catherine's Indian Day School.\n\nYour kind consideration to this request from the Sister will be appreciated.\n\nR.

C.\n\nRe: Letter of Sept. 29th on cocoa allowance.\n\nDear Mr. Moore,\n\nUp to the present date I am still waiting for a reply to the above mentioned letter.\n\nThe Koksilah School is allowed $4.00 per month for an average of an estimated 25 pupils. St. Catherine's is allowed $10.00 for an average of 75 pupils. For the past month we have served an average of 87 and our enrollment is not yet complete.\n\nAs I stated, in my last letter, with the rise in cost of living $10.00 is inadequate to meet the demands, and we will need an increase of at least $5.00 per month since our average attendance has increased also.\n\nUnless the above is granted cocoa will be served while the supply lasts.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned \"Sister Mary Sheila\"\nPRINCIPAL.\n\n(EL)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour file 132-28-5 (WT 1)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of July 28th approving an expenditure of $125.00 for minor repairs at the St. Catherine's School, and an amount of $500.00 for improvements to the school grounds, Mr. Indian Agent Moore has requested assistance from the Surveys and Engineering Branch with respect to the work necessary on the grounds and that has been arranged.\n\nNo information has as yet been received from the Agent regarding the minor repairs necessary but Mr. Moore has recommended an expenditure of approximately $205.00 for the purchase of materials for a wooden floor in the domestic science room. Mr. Moore, in his letter attached intimates that Mr. Doucet is familiar with this proposal and in the absence of District School Inspector Davey and providing Mr. Doucet concurs, I would recommend that the necessary expenditure be approved, the work to be carried out as a manual training project.\n\nfor D.

In one case, on the 24th of November, there were 64 children carried from the above mentioned areas; on four occasions 55 have been transported, on one trip 58, and on another 59. Remainder of the 15 trips above-mentioned varied with loads of 52 and 54.\n\nYou can appreciate our position in the event of an accident of any character during the time the bus was overloaded, and we cannot at the present time, allow a larger load than 50 to be carried on the bus at any one time.\n\nThe only solution to the problem at present is that a sufficient number of pupils from the Stone Church area be transported by other means to the extent that the overloading be obviated.\n\nThanking you for your past co-operation and assuring you of our continued service and co-operation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCowichan Motor Transport (Kyle) Ltd.\n\nSigned \"Howard V.

C.\n\nI wish to attach, herewith, in duplicate, a copy of a letter recently received from the Cowichan Valley Bus and Taxi Services (Kyle) regarding the overloading of the School Bus.\n\nPending consideration of the matter by yourself and the Department, I have authorized the bus to make a return trip from the school to the Stone Church on the mornings there are over fifty (50) children to be carried. This will raise the charge by approximately $1.60 per day or eighty cents (80\u00a2) each trip -- extra trips to be kept track of by the school principal.\n\nIf I had not done this now it would mean that approximately eight children would not be coming to school as most of the eight who are picked up at the stone church, each day, have already had to walk one and one-half to two miles from their homes, at Khenipsen village, across the Dyke.\n\nYour instructions in this regard will be appreciated.\n\nR. H. MOORE\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6389, File 807-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Transportation St. Catherines Indian Day School\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Indian Agent Moore's letter of December 1st and enclosure referred to therein regarding over-crowding of the St. Catherine's school bus. You will note that the bus is authorized to carry 30 passengers only, but that on many days the number of children to be transported is in excess of 30 and on one day reached a total of 64. Our present agreement with the Company provides for payment of 3\u00bd per mile per day over a 32 mile route, both return trips included, for up to 30 children, an average cost of 37\u00bd per child. If the number to be transported is in excess of 30 the agreement provides for payment of 40\u00bd per mile per day over the 32 mile route on an average cost of 25\u00bd per child for 30 children.\n\nThe proposed payment of $1.60 per day for the extra trip necessary to transport children over and above the 30 which can be carried on the first trip will, assuming there is an average of 55 children per day, result in an approximate cost of 28\u00bd per child which is not unreasonable. I would recommend that Mr. Moore be authorized to submit accounts at the rate of 35\u00bd per mile per day for up to 30 children transported, 40\u00bd per mile per day where the number is in excess of 30 and not over 50, and 40\u00bd per mile per day plus an additional $1.60 when the number is in excess of 50.\n\nD.

It was desired to inspect the playgrounds with the view of enlargement and drainage.\n\nOn November 29, 1947, levels were taken in the area in question, to determine slopes and low points. The area under consideration is the playground located behind the school building, as shown on attached plan.\n\nThe chief difficulty with drainage lies in the fact that there is a slight hollow in the centre of the playground which holds the water and causes the ground to be muddy for several days after a heavy rain. The playground slopes to the west, and it is recommended that a 4-inch agricultural tile drain be laid from the low spot mentioned above and be connected to the 6-inch tile pipe leading from the school house. About 80 feet of 4-inch pipe would be required. This pipe would afford drainage of this low point in the centre of the present baseball diamond.\nIt was thought that the grounds could be extended toward the south boundary, by clearing out brush and small trees. In this connection, some earth could be backfilled into low points on the grounds from the cleared area, as the grounds have a gentle upward slope toward the south boundary. This latter suggestion does not obviate the necessity of installing the tile drain, as a certain amount of artificial drainage is necessary in any case. Appended to this memorandum is a topographical plan showing proposed clearing and drainage.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe work mentioned above might be carried out under the supervision of the Agent. The estimated cost is as follows:\n\n- 80 lin. ft. 4\" agricultural tile @ 10\u00a2 ft. $ 8.00\n- Ditching and laying above 80 ft. @ $1.00 ft. 30.00\n- Bulldozer for grading, 3 days @ $75 per day 225.00\n- Contingencies 15% - 47.00\n\n$360.00\n\nA.V.

From the figures he gave me of the cost -- in accordance with the report submitted by the Engineer -- it will be about $130.00 more than estimated by Mr. A. V. Gallon.\n\nThe bulldozer will be required for five days instead of the three estimated, which makes up the difference, less contingencies.\n\nIn view of the soil texture and the trees that have to be moved, it was considered best to postpone doing the job until early in March, next, when it is hoped that the clay soil will be more workable than during the wet season.\n\nR.

If so, you may purchase the linoleum required.\nHowever, if you feel that the wooden floor should be in-\nstalled, we approve an expenditure of $205.00.\n\nIt is noted that the work could be done as a manual\ntraining project. It is hoped that if this is carried\nout, that the work required of the children will not be\nexcessive, otherwise we are bound to receive some com-\nplaint.

Mr. Moore has requested, however, that the matter be left in abeyance until early in March when it is hoped that the clay soil will be more workable than during the wet season.

Father L. LeClair that I apply to the Department for permission to allow the Reverend Sisters, who are employed as teachers at St. Catherine's Indian Day School, to use the school building one evening each week for educational and social purposes for the teen-age girls of the Cowichan Band. These girls will be, to a large degree, present pupils of the school, as well as older girls who have left school.\n\nThe proposal is that short talks will be given the girls by appropriate speakers. Pictures of some educational value will be shown, and occasionally a social evening will be held when senior or teen-age boys will be invited. The ages will be from thirteen to nineteen or twenty years.\n\nI realize that this proposal is rather unusual, and may be fraught with some misgivings. However, these teen-age youths are a cause of concern to me, as far too many of them are getting into difficulties, largely on account of the fact that there is no provision made for their recreational or social activities, for the long winter evenings, either during the time they are attending school, or after they reach the age of 16 years. The fact that these meetings will be attended by the Sisters should, I hope, be sufficient guarantee that they will look after the school and the furnishings, as well as the girls, so that so far as the Department is concerned, no great damage may be expected to either building, or contents. If such a thing should happen, the authority -- if given -- could be cancelled.\n\nI would recommend, however, that the club or organization, do the required cleaning up themselves after each meeting instead of leaving it to the Caretaker. In other words, any arranging of desks or furniture -- either before or after the gathering -- be the responsibility of the club, and not the Caretaker.\n\nAs you know, the Cowichan Band has not a Community Hall or meeting place of any kind for their members, other than these iniquitous \"Big Houses\", in which they hold their Indian dances and which, if I had my way and could do it legally, would be burned down.\n\nYour early consideration of this request will be appreciated.\n\nR.

BURKE,\nIndian Agent.\n\nCC to Indian Commissioner.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing Mr. Indian Agent Moore's letters of February 5th and March 2nd and a memorandum from District School Inspector Davey in connection with the proposed installation of a telephone at the St. Catherine's Indian Day School.\n\nYou will note Mr. Moore's reasons for recommending this installation and in view of the large enrolment at the school and the small expenditure involved I believe that the installation would be justified and would recommend that it be approved.\n\n- EW\n\nEnc.\n\nS. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTO: The Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nFROM: The District School Inspector.\n\nRe: Telephone-St. Catherines Day School\n\nI refer to the request of Mr. Indian Agent Moore for the installation of a telephone at the above mentioned school as contained in his letters of February 5th and March 2nd.\n\nThe reasons for this request are set out quite clearly in Mr. Moore's letters and I would only add that the enrolment at the time of my visit at the school on Friday, March 5th was 120 pupils. Considering the number of pupils involved I think that the request for a telephone is warranted and I would recommend its installation.\n\nIt will be noted that the cost of installation is $4.00 and that the minimum monthly rental is $2.50. There is no reason why the minimum should be exceeded as there should be no occasion for long distance calls being placed over the school phone. The value of a telephone is certainly in excess of the small cost involved.\n\nR.F. Davey,\nDist. School Inspector.\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nPost Office Box 70,\nVANCOUVER, B. C.\n\nIn reply to your above noted letter, re telephone for St. Catherine's Indian Day School, I wish to advise as follows:\n\n1) Total Cost of Installation --- 4.00\n2) Minimum monthly Rental ------- 2.50\n\n6.50\n\nR. H. MOORE\nIndian Agent.\nMr. W. S. Armstrong,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nPost Office Box 70,\nVANCOUVER, B. C.\n\nI have received a request from the Principal of the St. Catherine's Indian Day School that a telephone be installed at that school.\n\nApparently inconvenience occurs quite frequently when transportation problems crop up -- as well as other matters of school administration, such as illness of pupils, minor accidents to the children while out playing, necessity of getting calls through to the Nurse, Doctor, or the writer.\n\nIf there were any telephones close to the school -- where calls could be made from or to -- the problem would be solved but, unfortunately, this is not so.\n\nI do not know what the policy of the Department is in this regard but, if the request could receive favourable consideration, I feel that it would be a forward step.\n\nR.

Moore\nIndian Agent.\n\nRH:EL\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Feb.29/48  | To cartage charges on four cartons of school supplies delivered to the St. Catherine's Indian Day School. | 1.50   |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

C.,\nMay 18th, 1948.\n\nPlease refer to your above noted letter in which you authorized an amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for improvements to the grounds of the St. Catherine's Indian Day School. As you know, four hundred fifty dollars ($450.00) of this amount has already been expended while the remaining fifty dollars ($50.00) will be required to put down about fifty feet of tiled drain so that the water from the school building may be carried underneath the ground rather than on the top -- as at present. However, I am awaiting the arrival of one of the Engineers, from Vancouver, who is expected here this week on another project. I hope to take advantage of his visit to get some advice on just where the drain will do the most good.\n\nI shall also require:\n\n20 lbs. of red-top grass seed @ 26\u00a2 per lb. ------- 5.20\n40 lbs. of perennial rye @ 28\u00a2 per lb. -------------- 11.20\n\nTotal --------- 16.40\n\nI should like to have authority to purchase the above from the Breckman-Ker Milling Co., Ltd., New Westminster, B.C.

However, the same conditions will be required, as at the Kispiox Day School, namely that the staff of the school be responsible for the payment of monthly telephone charges. The Department feels that an overwhelming proportion of the calls made upon such a telephone are of a personal nature and that the cost of the phone should be met by the staff of the school. If there were parents with telephones installed in their homes it would be an entirely different matter, as we could then understand that calls would be required, checking on the attendance of children, etc.\n\nBernard F.

C.\n\nDear Mr. Moore:\n\nAs the sun hits the two back classrooms facing directly south from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. it is necessary to keep the blinds up the whole school day. Hence we cannot get a breath of air in the hot weather and have to turn on the lights in order to work. The heat becomes so intense from lack of air that the children wilt and are incapable of effort. We have tried the window shades being pulled down and now have them working from the bottom, up. They are worn out from incessant use and have to be renewed.\n\nI have priced awnings. Enclosed find quotations. I have also made out requisition forms for same. The initial output is quite steep but I feel sure that the satisfaction received will outweigh the cost. Personally, I would advocate the ten windows having separate awnings 3'6\" instead of 7'6\" covering two windows in spite of the extra cost, because it would be easier to handle them in taking them down and storing them during the winter months. They will then last over a period of years.\n\nI would certainly appreciate this matter receiving a little consideration as the children will work more advantageously under these favourable conditions.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nI would suggest we have them supply quotations for winter blinds.\nJune 24, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nThe attached requisitions received from\nthe St. Catherine's Indian Day School amount to $118.15.\nYou may authorize the purchase of the various articles\nrequested on these three requisitions at the cost\nmentioned above.\n\nBernard E. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nJune 25, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nEnclosed for your information is a copy of a requisition received from Superintendent Moore.\n\nColonel Neary and I discussed this request yesterday and we feel that it would be inadvisable to supply awnings. So many things can happen to them and if they are not taken down when the weather becomes bad they will soon be of very little use.\n\nWe are inclined to feel that venetian blinds would answer the purpose and we would appreciate it if you would make inquiries and let us know the cost of supplying them to the St. Catherine's School for the windows on which they would be actually required.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nPP/EM.\n**DAVID SPENCER LIMITED**\n\n**VICTORIA, B.C.**\n\n**DOMINION GOVERNMENT**\n**INDIAN DEPT**\n**DUNGAN B.C.**\n\n---\n\n**LUNCH ACCOUNT**\n\n| Item                  | Date | Amount |\n|-----------------------|------|--------|\n| 22 LBS SUGAR          | MAY 9| 2.10   |\n| 3 LBS COCOA           | MAY 9| 2.36   |\n| 24 TINS MILK          | MAY 9| 2.90   |\n| TIN SYRUP             | MAY 9| .65    |\n| CARTON SODAS          | MAY 9| .55    |\n| 12 TINS SOUP          | MAY 9| 1.44   |\n\n**MAY 9**  \n**10.00**\n\n---\n\n**ACCOUNTS ARE PAYABLE ON OR BEFORE THE 10TH OF EACH MONTH.**\n\n**A CREDIT BALANCE IS SHOWN IN RED**\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. 3-11-1 dated Oct. 28/47.\n\nVoucher No.: 825-25(WT) 06/25/47\n\nDATE: June 16, 1948\nReplying to yours of above date and file I would advise that I asked four different local contractors to give me a price for labor costs on the construction of a wall between two class-rooms at St. Catherine's Indian Day School but only one has acknowledged my request.\n\nAfter a thorough inspection of the grounds and school building with Mr. Joe Garner, a local construction contractor, it was considered advisable to submit a quotation on the entire job necessary with the opening of the extra class-room.\n\n1) Building the wall complete and in accordance with the existing walls, installation of blackboards, etc. ---- $528.00. It was considered that the original estimate of materials shown on the requisition of March 1st, last, was totally inadequate.\n\n2) To lay the floor in the Domestic Science Room -- materials already there -- and covering same with Battleship linoleum, etc. ---- $520.00.\n\n3) It was found that, after the playing field was levelled and graded, the water did not drain away from the upper end of the field as was expected. This condition was partly explained in your letter of May 13th, last, when I asked for fifty dollars ($50.00) to lay about 50' of tile drain which it was thought would be sufficient. However, the contractor claims that proper drainage can not be carried out unless we put down 200' -- the total cost of which will be $78.00. This is $28.00 more than authorized in your letter of the 9th instant, file number 3-11-3.\n\n4) With the present enrollment at this school the existing outside toilets are not sufficient to take care of the pupils -- particularly the girls -- and, after discussing the matter with the Reverend Principal, we felt it advisable to get another twin unit the same as the present ones at an estimated cost of $117.00.\n\nI hope the foregoing may be understood -- as well as the letter attached in duplicate. I know this seems to be a lot of money to expend at one time but, if the grounds had been fixed when the school was first built, it could have been done for twenty-five per cent of the outlay which we have made in small amounts each year.\n\nReverting to your letter of the 17th ultimo, file number 3-11-4, authorizing the construction and erection of new permanent swings for this school, I would advise that there has been a great deal of discussion as to where these should be erected so that they might be within constant view of the staff during recess and noon hour and, at the same time, be on firm, well drained ground. Here again the advice of the contractor was asked for and given as follows:\n\n1) The place where the swings are to be placed (which will be within the view of the teachers at all times) should be raised up above the level of adjoining or surrounding areas so that, at no time, will the water lie either between the swings or in their immediate vicinity.\n\nHaving seen the small children playing on the present swings at this school with water lying in puddles at each one, it causes me to recommend that this be done before the new swings (now under construction) are erected in their permanent location. Total cost being $75.00. It would be too bad to put up these new swings and not make a real job of them.\n\nI would recommend that the foregoing receive favourable consideration -- as well as the attached letter, in duplicate.\n\nS. H. Moore, Superintendent, Cowichan Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: St. Catherine's Indian Day School\n\nI am enclosing Superintendent Moore's letter of June 2nd having reference to various expenditures necessary as set out below:\n\n(1) Conversion of the present sewing room for use as a fourth classroom. Mr. Moore's original estimate of the cost of this work is now far too low. The cost of this work completed in accordance with tender supplied by Garner Brothers, Ltd., attached, will be $528.00.\n\n(2) Completion of the floor in the domestic science room. Materials for this work were purchased previously and we had contemplated having the senior pupils in the manual training class provide the necessary labour. It is doubtful if this would be advisable, however, and to ensure proper completion of the work, particularly laying of linoleum, it is considered advisable to have it completed by experts. Garner Brothers quote a price of $520.00 complete.\n\n(3) Installation of drainage tile on playing field. In your letter of June 1st, file 152-22-5 E.1, an expenditure of $66.40 was authorized for this work, which amount apparently has now been found insufficient for the purchase and installation of the quantity of tile necessary. The cost is now estimated at $78.00.\n\n(4) Provision of an additional outside toilet - $117.00. It is anticipated that there will be an enrolment of approximately 120 pupils at St. Catherine's school during the next year and the present facilities are inadequate.\n(5) Improvements to the site of the proposed new swings, reference Mr. Phelan's letter of May 14th, file 152-22-5 E.l, - $75.00.\n\n(6) Painting and redecorating St. Catherine's school. This matter was the subject of correspondence last year, reference Mr. Neary's letter of July 28th, 1947, at which time it was considered advisable to defer redecorating of the interior and exterior until this year. The estimated cost of the work at that time was $1379, and Mr. Moore in his letter of June 26th attached suggests that the cost will not have increased to any extent at this time.\n\nThe total expenditure necessary for completion of the improvements above mentioned is approximately $2700. All the improvements referred to are undoubtedly necessary and should if possible be carried out this year. Please advise what funds can be made available so that if insufficient we may arrange to have the improvements carried out in order of priority.\n\n-W.S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nPost Office Box 70,\nVANCOUVER, B. C.\n\nPlease advise if authority will be granted this year to have the painting and redecorating of the St. Catherine's Indian Day School done during the Summer Holidays -- as requested in the Estimates submitted last year.\n\nWe received a quotation for this work as submitted to your office on July 14th, 1947, and it is not expected that the cost will be any higher now.\n\nI should like to be informed of this as soon as possible so that I may know whether or not to include it again in my Estimates of this year.\n\nR.

This room should be provided with a w.c. and running water. As it is the sisters have to travel back to their own home at a considerable distance and annoyance at times.\n\nYour immediate attention to this matter would certainly be very much appreciated.

As it is anticipated that the repairs at the school will cost a considerable sum of money, it is not anticipated that we will be able to consider the installation of running water this year.\n\nWe have already had some correspondence with Reverend Father L.

I would ask that separate tenders be obtained for the interior painting and for the exterior painting.\n\nIn view of the amount already spent for this school would it not be possible to have the interior painting carried out by the janitor and the manual training instructor with the Department providing the materials and paying these two men on a day labour basis.\n\nBernard F.

C.\n\nYou will remember recent authorization to erect new swings at the St. Catherine's Indian Day School (see your letter 3-11-43, May 17/43). So far, these have not been erected owing to the difficulty in obtaining suitable pipe but it is hoped we will have them completed by the time school reopens.\n\nWhen I was at this school a few days ago I had a good check-up made on the old swings and it was found that the timbers, above ground, are quite good and, by cutting off the rotten portions of the uprights and braces, we would still have two sets of swings suitable for one room schools.\n\nI therefore recommend that we move one set of four swings to the Koksilah Indian Day School and have them properly set up. The other set of six swings to be moved to the Nanaimo Indian Day School and set up.\n\nI received a quotation to do both jobs and am submitting same, in duplicate, for your consideration.\n\nI believe we can do this work much cheaper than if we erected new swings at both the Koksilah and Nanaimo Indian Day Schools -- which will have to be done as there is no playground equipment at either school.\n\nR.

H. Moore,\nSuperintendent,\nCowichan Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa\n\nWith reference to Supt.

(RG 10, Volume 6389, File 807-5, part 8)\nFebruary 1, 1949.\n\nTo the Fire Marshal:\n\nRe: Inspection\nSt. Catherine's Indian Day School\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nAs instructed by you, an inspection was made of this school on January 26, 1949. This is a two storey frame building containing four rooms and a non-standard furnace room in the basement and four classrooms on the main floor. The furnace is located directly under the main hallways and adjacent to the fire escape rear doors of the building. Should an emergency arise there the available means of egress from all of the rooms would be effectively cut off. First aid fire fighting equipment is 2 - 2\u00bd gallon soda and acid extinguishers located one on each floor.\n\nIt is recommended that the following changes and additions be carried out to afford reasonable safety to life and property:\n\n1. Install a standard fire alarm system comprising one 10\" vibration gong and break glass switch on the upper floor and one 10 inch vibration gong and break glass switch on the lower floor, located so as to be audible to the four classrooms on each floor.\n\n2. Install a standard furnace chamber as described in Regulation of the Chimney Regulations.\n\n3. Install a CO\u2082 extinguisher in the Domestic Science Classroom. Install a 5 gallon water pump can on each floor.\n\n4. The smoke pipe which at present passes from the Domestic Science Classroom through a partition into the furnace room to be insulated and protected as required by Regulation 22 of the Chimney Regulations.\n\n5. Install a secondary exit from each of the classrooms at the ends of the building. The exits from two classrooms combined to allow a single stairway to grade from each of the rooms.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHKJ/JW\n\nC. to W.S. Arnell\nIndian Commissioner For\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6389, File 807-5, part 8)\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nPost Office Box 70,\nVANCOUVER, B. C.\n\nRe: Fire Alarm System - St. Catherine's Indian Day School.\n\nKindly refer to your above mentioned letter relative to the subject matter stated.\n\nI discussed this question at some length with the Proprietor of the Electrical Firm which has given me the quotation and now I am in more of a quandary than ever.\n\nIf you can recall the plan of this school you will remember that, to get out of the building, it means that the pupils will have to come out of the class-rooms to the hall immediately over the top of the furnace room (where any fire might be expected to start) then down the short flight of stairs to the entrances at either side of the school. This would mean, of course, that the children would have to walk through the very worst part of the fire as the flames would, naturally, be forced out each side door of the furnace room and up the stairways -- blocking both exits.\n\nIn considering this matter I am inclined to believe that the Alarm System might be satisfactory -- providing fire-proof doors were installed at either side of the furnace room which, if kept closed during school hours, would confine any fire originating in the furnace room to remain there long enough to allow the pupils to get out of the building. In other words, install fire-proof doors at the same time the Alarm System is put in.\n\nAs this suggestion is simply an idea of my own I should not like to say that it would be sound without getting an opinion from the Engineering Branch which was responsible for the construction -- but not the plan -- of the school.\n\nYou will note that the quotation for the Alarm System totals approximately sixty-five dollars ($65.00). Your observations to the foregoing will be appreciated.\n\nR. H. MOORE\nSupt., Cowichan Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nRe: Fire Protection - St. Catherine's Indian Day School\n\nFollowing Superintendent Moore's letter of December 14th, 1948, attached, we endeavoured to ascertain what will be necessary to meet fire protection requirements at the above-mentioned School and as a result, were able to secure the attached report, dated February 1st, 1949, from the Provincial Fire Marshal.\n\nIt will be quite costly to meet the Fire Marshal's recommendations and I should appreciate being advised to what extent the Department feels we should be guided by the recommendations of the Provincial Fire Marshal. It is presumed that funds for all or part of the changes and additions recommended will not be available until the next fiscal year.\n\nfor W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\n22nd February, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nI would appreciate it if you would read letter dated 17th February, 1949, on this file with regard to the St. Catherine's Indian Day School.

Moore's letter of April 30th attached, in view of the lateness of the season I have authorized Mr. Moore to purchase 100 lbs. of grass seed at an approximate cost of $45.00 and to incur an expenditure of $20.00 for seeding the playgrounds at St. Catherine's Indian Day School.\n\nW. S. Arneil\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMr. W. S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVANCOUVER, B. C.\n\nAlmost a year ago, I was authorized to purchase a grass mixture suggested by Breckman and Kerr Milling Co., Ltd., to sow on the play grounds at St. Catherine's School. For one reason or another, this seed was not purchased as I was not impressed with the mixture for the particular soil on which we would sow it.\n\nI also heard about a new mixture that Breckman and Kerr brought out which, in my opinion, would be far more suitable and so I checked on it and find that it appears to be ideal for our requirements. It is called \"Play green mixture\" and sells at forty-two cents (42\u00a2) per lb. to us F.O.B. New Westminster.\n\nI would, therefore, ask that I receive authority to purchase one hundred lbs. (which is the amount recommended for two acres) at the above price and amounts to forty-two dollars.\n\nIt will cost us approximately twenty dollars to seed the ground as it will have to be disced, harrowed and rolled several times and I would like authority to do that as well.\n\nR.

MACKAY\n\nRe: St. Catherine's Indian Day School\n\nOn Saturday, June 18th, I visited the Mother General of the Sisters of St. Ann, and discussed with her the various problems concerned with the operation of Indian day and residential schools in which the Sisters of this Order are teaching.\n\nShe is very concerned over the lack of toilet facilities for the teachers at the St. Catherine's Indian Day School, Duncan, B.C., and is most anxious that this condition be remedied. I would appreciate hearing from you concerning your views as to the installation of a separate toilet unit at this school.

Box 70,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nPlease find attached voucher No. 637, amounting to ninety-five dollars ($95.00) covering the cost of discing, harrowing and seeding the play ground at St. Catherine's School.\n\nIn explanation of why the labor costs are so much out of line with what I originally estimated in my letter of April 30th last, I would remind you that these grounds were graded and levelled last year, the result being that in places, all the top soil was gone and I felt it unwise to plough, so disced the whole ground at least ten times in every direction, thereby spreading some top soil on, where none existed. Then it was harrowed six or eight times with the result that we got a pretty good seed bed. After the seeding was done, we harrowed it twice more and all we need now for a good catch, is some rain.\n\nIf I, myself, had thought of the condition of the ground at the time I wrote last month, I would have known that the labor costs would be high, but it slipped my memory entirely.\n\nR.

C.\n\nYou may remember that a couple of years ago there was considerable correspondence regarding a proposed rest room and other facilities for the teachers of St. Catherine's Indian Day School. I forget just what the outcome of that proposal was, but I think it had to be dropped on account of the structural features of the building which would have to be overcome, and which presented some difficulties and considerable expense. In fact an addition to the building, Dr. Tennant also recommended the installation of inside toilets for the Sisters, but, of course, he was not aware of the existing difficulties.\n\nThe Reverend Principal has again brought the matter to my attention, suggesting that I \"push\" the Department so that some place, with a degree of privacy, may be made available for use of the teachers. Certainly she has plenty of reasons why such accommodation should be provided but it is difficult for me to recommend anything, except an addition on the 3rd side of the building, which should be large enough to provide a rest room and possibly a sewing room, on the same level as the present class-rooms. On the ground or basement level, another room would be provided for any purpose considered necessary or advisable by the School Inspector, or Engineering Branch. You will, of course, appreciate the fact that any addition will entail a different heating system and indeed, run into six or eight thousand dollars.\n\nI realize this is not the right time to mention this, but will include an item in the Estimates so that the Department may decide just what can be done.\n\nR.

Please advise Mr. Moore that naturally there is deducted from this sum the amount of the funds expended on the schools since 1st April, 1949. For example your PO13642-C covers certain repairs to these schools.\n\nIt is presumed that we will receive further requisitions for the paint required at St. Catherine's and Nanaimo Schools, or that contracts will be let for the painting. As I previously advised we prefer to buy the paint and have the work performed on a labour basis only.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFN: MMoN\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI have an inquiry from Superintendent Moore with regard to the amounts available in the current estimates for repairs to school buildings, Cowichan Agency and the purchase of equipment. The information is required by Mr. Moore so that he can determine what provision he should make in his 1950-51 estimates.\n\nThe following is a list of the items which we feel should be attended to this year:\n\n1. St. Catherine's School - Interior painting - $1200.\n   Insulation - 400.\n\n2. Songhees Day School - Purchase of playground equipment - 50.\n   Repairs - 200.\n\n3. Nanaimo Day School - Interior decoration - 500.\n   Emergency repairs - 150.\n   Playground equipment - 60.\n   Fencing - 150.\n\n4. Kokailah-Day School - Repairs - 200.\n   Fencing - 250.\n   Playground equipment - 30.\n\nWe would like to be able to advise Mr. Moore if funds for any of the above items are not available so that he may provide for them in his next year's estimates.\n\nW.S.

Would you please review your drawings of this school and advise whether it would be possible to add toilet rooms to the present structure. We would also appreciate being advised as to the approximate cost of these additions. There are some 110 children in attendance at this school, with five teaching Sisters and one male manual training instructor.\n\nDirector.\nAugust 12, 1949.\n\nMr. W. S.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOttawa, September 9, 1949.\n\nRe: St. Catherine's Indian Day School,\nCowichan Indian Agency, B.C.\n\nWith reference to Major MacKay's memorandum of August 12th which bears your marginal notation of the 15th instant in connection with the above, you are advised as follows:\n\nThe policy governing the design of this building allowed no provision for the installation of inside toilets then or at any future time, as existing arrangements were considered to be satisfactory.\n\nAs a consequence, major structural alterations to the building would be required in order to install the necessary toilets on the first floor, which is the most desirable location.\n\nIt is quite a different matter to make changes in a layout as was done at the Mount Elgin School during construction, to what would be necessary in this case.\n\nIf the toilets were installed in the basement, valuable space would have to be taken from assigned academical areas and it can be safely assumed that a sewage pump and sump pit would be necessary, in addition to the provision of a sewage disposal field.\n\nIf this school had been in an area served by sewers and water mains, such a pumping installation might not be required, depending of course on the relationship of the basement floor slab to the sewers. No matter how the installation were handled, it can be stated that the work could not be done without extensive structural changes; and that such operations would not be economical.\n\nR.A.

Thorne,\nCowichan Band Council.\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nSeptember 13th. 1949.\n\nDear Chief,\n\nRe: Cowichan Indian Day School Building.\n\nYou may remember that on June 13th. last I wrote you regarding the above building and the offer made by the Department, through me to the Council, relative to the above building and acquiring of same by the Band.\n\nSome time later we had a Council meeting at which the matter was brought up and the eventual acceptance of the Department's offer by the Council to acquire the building in a legal manner. It was also decided by the Council that they would arrange to have the building checked by a qualified person to see just what repairs were required to put it in a habitable condition and preserve it from further deterioration.\n\nTo date nothing further has been heard from the Council and I would urge you to take immediate steps to have this matter attended to so that the building may be repaired and acquired from the Department before we get along to the rainy season when costs of repairs will increase and further damage to the structure like to occur.\n\nKindly give this matter your early attention, for in my opinion there is no reason why it should not have received attention long before this. The Band will hold the Council responsible for the unnecessary delay in bringing the question to a satisfactory conclusion.\n\nYours truly;\n\nR.H. Moore\n\nIndian Affairs.

I regret to advise that I overlooked applying again this year for the usual grants for this purpose, and took the liberty of informing some of the schools a few days ago that they might figure on the same amounts as previously. I hope that my action may be condoned and official approval given.\n\nI am having my troubles with the Rev. Sister Sheila at St. Catherine's who is continually after me about getting the amount of $10.00 doubled for her school, the reason being that the present amount is considered totally inadequate for the number of pupils in attendance, almost 90 now and expectations of 120 to 130 later on, likely next month when the children return to their reserve with their parents from fishing, canneries and the U.S.\n\nThe Agency Nurse, Miss Fletcher, has also requested on several occasions that the actual supplies\u2014which the amount granted buys\u2014should be doubled if any good is expected to accrue to the children. I showed her your letter written last year which I felt would explain, better than I, the policy of the Department. However, she came back at me with a new argument, which I had not thought of before, and is this: Some of the children attending this school have to leave home about 7.30 a.m., to be in time to catch the bus as they have to walk a couple of miles, occasionally they don't get up in time to have a lunch prepared at home and go without, while others who don't have to leave so early often go without lunches too due to laziness on the part of the parents to put it up. These pupils have to get something to eat, and the Sister sees that they do. It is to try and offset heavy drains of this kind on the supplies that we think the amount to this school should\nMEMO.

Apparently the heat from the furnace is such that some damage has occurred and some fire hazard exists which might be reduced by fireproofing over the furnace and placing of sand on top.\n\nThe total expenditure involved for equipment and in connection with the furnace is $164.00 and I would recommend that Mr. Moore be authorized to have the work proceeded with.\n\n-W.J.

Comment now advanced by the fire marshal covered by Sections 22 and 26 of the B.C. Fire Marshals Act, is to the effect that:\n\n(a) The furnace room walls should be of brick or concrete construction or alternatively of laminated plank construction, covered with 1/2\" of plaster on metal lath each side.\n\n(b) A smoke pipe from the domestic science room range now carried through the existing partition, requires additional insulating covering.\n\nAdditional comment advanced but not covered by the regulations referred to, was as follows:\n\n(c) Electrically operated fire alarm system with vibrating gongs and break glass switches, should be installed at each floor level, located so as to be audible to all classrooms.\n\n(d) An extra fire extinguisher should be installed in the domestic science classroom and a 5 gallon water pump and container should be placed in a convenient position on each floor.\n\n(e) Secondary exits from groups of two classrooms with stairs to grade for each, should be installed.\n\nFollowing receipt of the data we requested from Indian Commissioner Arneil, the fire marshal's remarks were discussed with Col. Neary of the Indian Affairs and the following comment furnished. The items are dealt with in the same order as above.\n\n(a) To construct furnace chamber walls to conform to B.C. standards in place of the existing walls built of 2 x 4 studing sheet each side with 7/8\" shiplap and 1/4\" gypsum board, would be expensive and inconvenient, but could be carried out without major alterations to the building, preferably during a holiday period at a cost of approximately $1,000.00.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nWe assume that the fire marshal's comment regarding the smoke pipe from the domestic science room, is coupled with his objection to the nature of the furnace chamber walls and the cost of rectifying would be negligible.\n\n(c) The installation of a fire signal system is a necessity. This was not included in the original design since wiring was not to have been installed. Wiring for lighting and water supply only, was requested by Indian Affairs as an addition to the contract during construction operations and no alarm signal was requested at that time. Indian Affairs were furnished by the local Superintendent, with an estimate for installing this unit amounting to approximately $75.00.\n\n(d) The supply of additional fire extinguishers and water pump with container are items that Indian Affairs will handle as supply maintenance.\n\n(e) There is no inexpensive way of providing additional exits from the main floor classrooms for this building. The design approved by Dr. McGill then Director of Indian Affairs placed the furnace room in the centre of the basement, the only position from which satisfactory hot air distribution to the classrooms could be made. Two sets of stairs were provided, one at each side of the building, easily accessible to all classrooms and by means of which all pupils in the school could be evacuated quickly and safely.\n\nThe basement rooms are only occupied periodically however, when certain groups of pupils are receiving manual training or domestic science instruction. The upper floor pupilage is reduced by approximately 50% at those times. Basement windows are only 30\" from the floor with sills practically at grade level. These with the stairs provide ample escape routes in an emergency. All the upper classroom window sills are only 91\u00bd\" from the ground. There is little likelihood of both sets of stairs being cut off at the same time in case of fire, and it is felt that if a 6 foot step-ladder was made available for each classroom, evacuation of all pupils could be safely effected.\n\nTo carry out the fire marshal's suggestion to provide additional exits and stairs, would necessitate extensive structural alterations and would cost in the neighborhood of $2,000.00.\n\nWhen the report was discussed after receiving the Provincial regulations, both Col. Neary and Mr. Buck, while recognizing that the letter of these regulations had not been followed, formed the opinion that there was no cause for alarm and with the exception of providing the fire signal system, adding the recommended number of extinguishers and providing ladders, no drastic action was necessary.\n\nIn a telephone conversation with Col. Neary this morning, that officer stated he had not yet discussed the matter with his Director and would do so on receipt of this memorandum and advise us of the action Indian Affairs wished to have taken.\n\nChief, Engineering and Construction Division.\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Sept. 16th | To freight prepaid on shipment of janitor supplies for                   |        |\n|            | the St. Catherine's Indian Day School.                                  | $5.64  |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nSt. Catherine's Indian Day School\n\nPlease find attached a copy of the report which has been received from the Lands and Development Services Branch with regard to the fire marshal's report made on this school.\n\nI believe Inspector Davey will agree with me when I say there are many provincial schools in which conditions are much worse than at St. Catherine's. I feel that if we provide the following items we will be providing sufficient to meet our requirements at this school. Naturally, if this were a residential school, we would be prepared to meet the other requirements.\n\n(a) Fire alarm system.\n(b) Extra fire extinguishers.\n(c) Secondary exits in the form of ladders.\n(d) Additional insulation for smoke pipe from Domestic Science range.\n\nYou can proceed to have a requisition prepared for the additional fire extinguishers and water pumps. Have Mr. Moore submit a tendered price for the installation of the fire alarm system as required. You can also purchase locally the six foot step ladders suggested by the engineers.\nI intend to discuss this school further with Inspector Davey particularly with regard to the provision of toilet facilities. As it is identical with the Mount Elgin school where toilet facilities have been added, I feel similar action should be taken at St. Catherine's next year.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSt. Catherine's Indian Day School\n\nPlease find hereunder a report of the Lands and Development Services Branch concerning the fire marshal's report on the above school.\n\nI agree with Mr. Buck that there is no cause for alarm at this school as after all it is a low building and only a day school. I feel there must be many Provincial schools in which conditions are much worse than at St. Catherine's.\n\nI can not see that we need do anything but provide a fire alarm, the recommended number of extinguishers and the ladders required.\n\nBernard F.

Additional mileage each day was eight miles; and the Company has made an extra charge of 40\u00a2 per day. Under the circumstances this is quite reasonable.\n\nIn addition to the above, restrictions were placed on load limits on buses and trucks during the thawing period in order to reduce breaking up of the roads as much as possible. In order to keep within these restrictions it was necessary for the Company to run a taxi as well as their bus for several days during the month of February. Their taxi account for this period is less than had they charged for the usual overload.\n\nI would recommend that the account be paid as submitted.\n\nR.H.

However, the teachers want these installed in the school building and, no doubt, will not approve of this suggestion.

The same painter estimated that it would take 515 man hours to do the job at $1.50 per hour. However, that is considered high by the writer, and I believe that if the paint is supplied, we can have the labour done for approximately $600.00.\n\nAs you know, this school has not been redecorated inside since it was built in the fall of 1939, and in my opinion it should be done this year. An amount was included in the current year's estimates for the purpose.

Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nFollowing our verbal discussion in regard to our tendering for the bus service on your Indian School and following the general outline as laid down by you. We hereby tender for the above route in the following manner.\n\nOur route in the morning would be leaving the Somonos Reserve on the Highway at the White Bridge, then northerly to Trunk Road, easterly on Trunk Road to St. Catherines School. Continuing on Trunk Road to the intersection of Trunk Rd., and alternate No. 1 Highway (Tennis Court Corner) thence westerly on alternate No. 1 Highway to Highway intersection of Highway No. 1 to Koksalah Indian Mission Road. Easterly along the Indian Mission Road to the Mission School. Turning at this point and reversing direction of travel over route, dropping children at St., Catherines School and return to Duncan. The routing in the afternoon would be the same as in the morning to take the Children home.\n\nMileage to be operated on the above mentioned route would amount to 32 miles per day, at a daily cost to your Department of $16.00 per school day operated.\n\nTo provide this service we would provide a Coach with a carrying capacity of 45 pupils from grades 1-7 and 35 pupils from grades 8-12 or a number of both worked out on this basis.\n\nOur schedule will be worked out with the approval of yourself and schools concerned to give the most satisfactory results in getting the pupils to school and home as promptly as possible.\nVancouver Island Coach Lines\nLimited\n\nDuncan, B.C.\nJuly 20th, 1950,\n\nMr. R.

Kyle, this letter will confirm that this Company is willing to enter into a contract for a five year term with your Department to transport school children from Somenos Reserve to St. Catharines Indian Day School and Kekulah Mission School and return to St. Catharines Indian Day School.\n\nThe basic rate to be 55\u00a2 per mile on a thirty-two mile route allowance subject to a mutual check of the route mileage. In addition there will be a similar rate of 55\u00a2 per mile for extra mileage run due to overloads and detours due to road and/or weather conditions.\n\nWhilst it may appear to the Department that the rate quoted is above the average, we wish to point out the low mileage operated on the run in view of the large number of pupils carried during the complete run. Further the route operates mostly over secondary roads subject to haphazard and uncertain maintenance work. And further, other than uncertain income from outside charter work, the school run would be the only source of revenue for the maintenance of the piece of equipment to be used and which is a much better\nCowichan Valley Bus & Taxi Services (Kyle)\nBUS AMBULANCE TAXI\nDUNCAN, B.C.\n\ncontd:-\n\ntype of bus than is normally used for school work.\n\nThe Company would be willing for the contract to contain a two year Review Clause as to operating costs.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCOWICHAN MOTOR TRANSPORT (KYLE) LTD.\n\nper\nG.

This was found to be a loose connection of the stand pipe outside the wellhouse proper, and which is used by the children to drink from during play hours or recess hours.\n\nI had a plumber go out and investigate, and after some discussion we decided that the best thing to do would be to take out the stand pipe entirely and install three drinking fountains, two within and one outside the school building.\n\nThe attached quotation in duplicate covering the cost of these, plus labour, comes to $102.59.\n\nFrom the point of view of sanitation, these are much better than the old tin cups that the children have been using for the past several years, and I would recommend that the quotation submitted be accepted and the expenditure approved.\n\nR.H.MOORE,\nSuperintendent,\nCowichan Indian Agency.\nDept.

Day School on March 24 the Department approves your purchasing a set of tools as recommended by the Inspector. He states that these can be secured for $25.00 and no doubt you can choose the tools in Vancouver and have them shipped to the school.\n\nAn expenditure of $15.00 may also be incurred for the purchase of lumber for the manual training class.\n\nInspector Barry also suggests employing an Indian woman for one hour a week to instruct the girls in carding and preparation of wool which could be knit into Cowichan sweaters. Provided a capable woman can be secured at a cost of $1.00 a week as suggested by Inspector Barry you may authorize the Indian Agent to make the necessary arrangements.\n\nFrom time to time the Department authorizes small quantities of lumber for manual training purposes. Would it be possible to secure used packing cases. The material in such cases could well be used at the day schools at least. It would mean less expenditure and probably mean that more lumber would be available. Please let me know if you consider the suggestion feasible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 8,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nExtract from Inspector Barry's report of March 24, 1938:\n\nVocational Training:\n\nI have explained in detail what is required for the forthcoming Arts and Crafts Exhibition in Vancouver. The teacher wishes to be informed on a number of points and these were explained. The school will send a small exhibit.\n\nI would recommend that a good single set of tools for woodwork and not to exceed a cost of $25.00 be authorized for this school. Some lumber material not to exceed $15.00 would also be required. The teacher can instruct in simple Manual Training and there are a number of repairs now very necessary at the school, steps to front doors and cupboards in the halls, etc., which the boys could undertake if they had some tools, which will otherwise cost the Department just as much or more if carried out in any other manner.\n\nI particularly wish to see this Simple Manual Work introduced here.\n\nI would also recommend that an Indian woman be employed two afternoons in the week for one hour each time to instruct in carding and preparation of local wool, which the girls could knit into Cowichan Sweaters etc. under her direction. A sum of $1.00 per week would not be excessive and this would not amount to more than $35.00 per year. This money would in my opinion be well spent in the starting of Vocational Training in this school.\n\nThe local Missionary the Rev. Father Lauzon discussed this matter of the establishment of some work in Manual Training under the present teacher, and of the teaching of the girls to prepare wool and knit Cowichan Sweaters etc., and stated that he could no doubt suggest a suitable woman. He seemed anxious to have this sort of work started in the Cowishan Indian Day School as it had proved so successful in the other local Indian Day School at Koksilah.\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe your letter 152-8-11 of the 13th instant.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of the above-mentioned letter, I am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of a letter from the Inspector of Indian Schools in connection with the kind of lumber to be used for Manual Training purposes. The enclosed letter will be self-explanatory.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nG. S. Pragnell.\nFor D. M. MacKay.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nWith reference to Departmental letter No. 152-8-11 of the 12th instant, in paragraph 4 of which Mr. R. A. Hoey suggests the possible use of old packing cases where lumber for Manual Training is required in Indian Day Schools, would say that in British Columbia packing cases of any large size cannot be obtained free from the stores, but must be purchased. The cost is usually well in excess of that of the lumber from which they are made.\n\nIn addition I may say that most of the packing cases coming to this Province are constructed from different kinds of white wood, which is very soft and useless for Manual Training purposes.\n\nIn the instances where I have recommended the supply of small quantities of lumber for Indian Day Schools, I have intended that this should be ordinary fir, which in the rough state and in short lengths can be purchased for around $15.00 per M.\n\nUnder the circumstances, I cannot possibly recommend the purchase of packing cases, as suggested by the Superintendent of Welfare and Training.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools for B.C.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP. O. Box #8,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\nDuncan, B. C.\nApril 8th, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nOn behalf of the Cowichan Indian Day School I would like to make application covering an expenditure of $75.00 as follows:\n\nFor a single set of tools for woodwork 25.00\nLumber material .................. 15.00\nWool work instruction ............ 35.00\n\n$75.00\n\nThis expenditure is recommended, in accordance with School Inspector Barry's report, page 2 following his visit to this school on March 24th, 1938.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J. D. Caldwell)\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n| Item Description                          | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|------------------------------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| STANLEY JACK PLANE                       | 1        | 4.20       | 4.20        |\n| DO BLOCK PLANE                           | 1        | 1.55       | 1.55        |\n| HACK SAW FRAME                           | 1        | 1.05       | 1.05        |\n| COPING SAW                               | 1        | 14.70      | 14.70       |\n| HAND RIP SAW                             | 1        | 5.70       | 5.70        |\n| CROSS CUT SAW                            | 1        | 31.25      | 31.25       |\n| HACK SAW BLADES                          | 6        | 9.80       | 58.80       |\n| LOOP END COPING SAW BLADES               | 1        | 14.07      | 14.07       |\n| STANLEY BIT BRACE                        | 1        | 2.30       | 2.30        |\n| DISSONS TIN SAW                          | 1        | 26.25      | 26.25       |\n| STANLEY CLAW HAMMER                      | 2        | 9.24       | 18.48       |\n| IRWIN PATTERN AUGER BITS                 | 1        | 2.65       | 2.65        |\n| WOOD LEVEL                               | 1        | 1.45       | 1.45        |\n| BENCH SCREWS                             | 1        | 3.80       | 3.80        |\n| BOXWOOD RULE                             | 1        | 14.60      | 14.60       |\n| COM G CLAMPS                             | 1        | 2.55       | 2.55        |\n| HICKORY MALLET                           | 1        | 7.95       | 7.95        |\n| SOCKET CHISEL                            | 1        | 7.65       | 7.65        |\n| SCR DRIVER                               | 1        | 9.20       | 9.20        |\n| STEEL SQUARE                             | 1        | 5.40       | 5.40        |\n| TOY SQUARE                               | 1        | 1.60       | 1.60        |\n\nIndian Affairs.

Catherine's Indian Day School was forwarded by you under date of March 12 last.\n\nImmediately following receipt of your communication a thorough search was made of the files here in an attempt to find, if possible, the requisition referred to in your communication. I regret to state, however, that we have not succeeded in discovering the requisition or any evidence that would indicate that it ever reached this office. In our letter of March 18 to which you refer it was noted that the requisition was coming forward but there is nothing to indicate that it arrived. It is just possible that this requisition was lost in the train wreck that took place about that date.\n\nIn view of the urgency of the matter and the delay that has already taken place would you please forward the requisition to Commissioner MacKay and have him make the necessary purchases. I am sending forward a copy of this letter to the Commissioner for his information and guidance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. R. H.

Catherine's Indian Day School, but to date no authority has come to hand covering the purchase.\n\nReverend Sister Mary Armella the principal of the school advises that the purchase of same is absolutely necessary to carry on the domestic science class.\n\nIn your letter of March 15th, last you authorized an expenditure of $5.00 per month for supplies required for the domestic science class, and in the last paragraph of this letter, you note that a requisition was coming forward for the necessary pots and other cooking utensils, and as mentioned above this requisition went forward under cover of letter dated March 12th.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(R. H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 25, 1940.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd instant you may purchase the manual training tools etc. for the Ste. Catherine's School from approved sources of supply in Duncan, B. C.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 152-22-11.\n\nWith reference to your letter of September 9th authorizing the purchase of manual training tools, etc., for St. Catherine's School, I should like confirmation of your instructions with respect to purchase from the firms mentioned in Nanaimo.\n\nThe purchase in Nanaimo would necessitate transportation charges on these materials from that city to Duncan, and as St. Catherine's School is within a mile or two of the latter place and these supplies are obtainable there from approved sources of supply, it has occurred to me that your instructions for purchase in Nanaimo might have been issued in error.\n\nI should appreciate the return of the copy of the requisition forwarded to the Department for these stores as I find it necessary to compare same with the copy on my file.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 9, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th ultimo, enclosing requisition for manual training tools for the Ste. Catherine's Day School, I enclose copy of the requisition.\n\nThe hardware and paint may be obtained from McKenzie, White & Dunsmuir, Nanaimo, and the last eight items of lumber from Inkster and Thompson, or Central Lumber Company, both of Nanaimo. When forwarding the account you should mark on it -- \"Charge to B.C. Special\".\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nMemorandum\n\nDr. H.W. McGill\n\nWith reference to your requisition for hardware, tools, and lumber, for Manual Training Classes at the St. Catherine's Indian Day School, Duncan, B.C., I would suggest that this material be purchased under the direction of Commissioner Mackay.\n\nThe hardware and paint may be obtained from McKenzie, White & Dunsmuir, Nanaimo, and the last eight items of lumber from Inkster and Thompson, or Central Lumber Company, both of Nanaimo. Such an arrangement for local purchase will insure having the supplies delivered promptly, so as to be of maximum use during the current school term.\n\nW.M.

Sister Mary Armella and you are both fully conversant with the requirements of the school as well as the work which they have been doing at the school during the past and present term, so that it is unnecessary for me to elaborate on the matter to any extent.\n\nIt is quite true that more work can be done by the use of the carding machine than by carders and the actual cost is less when the requirements of the school are taken into consideration. On the other hand I have heard that better carding can be done by hand than with the machine, although I must confess that I have never seen a carder as efficient looking as the one shown in the attached price list, or catalogue sheet, as put out by the \"Spin-well Woolen Mills Co., Ltd., of Sifton Manitoba,\" so that it is quite possible that the carding machine is essential for good results in an institution of this kind. The Spinning machine of course is definitely needed.\n\nIf the Department would approve of these articles I feel that it would be a step in the right direction.\n\nD.M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(R.H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nSt. Catherine's School,\nDuncan, B.C., Feb. 10, 1941.\n\nMr. R.H. Moore, Indian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Moore:\n\nAs you have personally observed, we have seriously begun the Indian knitting industry. We are handicapped, however, in not having the necessary equipment towards a successful issue of said industry. Indian Commissioner, Major D.M. MacKay, as well as School Inspector, Captain G.H. Barry have suggested that we requisition a spinning machine from the Department.\n\nIf you consider it feasible, we should appreciate your asking the Department for a carding and a spinning machine. We are requesting a carding machine instead of carders because six pairs of carders would be necessary for this school, and the small difference in price is not worth the strenuous work involved in the use of carders. Several Indian families are using carding machines which are proving most satisfactory. One Indian mother told us that it took her, her husband and three children two days to card the same amount of wool by hand that she carded alone in one hour on the carding machine.\n\nUpon inquiry, we find that a spinning machine can be purchased from an Indian for ten dollars ($10), but it is crude, while for the same price a modern spinning machine can be bought.\nEnclose please find advertisement for the two machines which we think would serve the purpose.\n\nTrusting to receive a favorable reply,\n\nI remain,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nSister Mary Arnolda\n\nPrincipal.\nQuotation - Material for St Catherine's School.\n\n| Item Description | Quantity | Unit Price |\n|------------------|----------|------------|\n| 100 lin ft - 1/2 x 4 No.1&2 Clear Fir S4S | 33 | $1.22 |\n| do - 1 x 2 do do | 14 | $1.50 |\n| do - 1 x 4 do do | 33 | $1.22 |\n| do - 1 x 6 do do | 50 | $2.00 |\n| 200 do - 1 x 8 No.1 Com., Shiplap. | 133 | $2.40 |\n| 150 do - 1 x 12 No.1&2 Clear Fir S4S | 150 | $2.25 |\n| 100 do - 2 x 2 No.1 Com., Fir S4S | 33 | $1.69 |\n| 100 do - 2 x 4 do do | 66 | $1.39 |\n| 50 do - 4 x 4 do do | 66 | $1.45 |\n| 100 do - 1 x 12 Clear Pine.

No boys were shown in either Grades 5 or 6. A careful study of the manual training supplies previously placed in this school indicates that they should have all the supplies required, especially in view of the very small number of boys who are capable of benefiting by this instruction.\n\nYou may, however, purchase the following articles:\n\n| Articles                  | Supplies                          |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Tenite knobs              | Screws                            |\n| Hat & coat hooks          | Yankee drill points               |\n| Stove bolts               | Paint, white                      |\n| Strap hinges              | \" cream                          |\n| Common nails              | \" nile green                      |\n| Finishing nails           | Light oak stain                   |\n| Shoulder hooks            | Clear varnish                     |\n| Cup hooks                 | Outside white paint               |\n| Friction tape             | Grey enamel                       |\n| Paint brushes             | Cherry varnish                    |\n|                           | Turpentine                        |\n\nMajor D.M.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOctober 15, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe St. Catherine's Indian School\n\nAn application has been received from Mr. Indian Agent Moore for Manual Training equipment and garden tools for the marginally noted school. Quotations have been received from local sources of supply and these have been summarized by Inspector Barry whose letters of October 9th in this connection are attached hereto.\n\nIt will be observed that Inspector Barry suggests the deletion of wardrobe hooks, rafter square and bench vise from the list of Manual Training equipment, and the lawnmower from the list of garden tools applied for. I should think that a bench vise and rafter square could be used to very good advantage in the Manual Training Division. The wardrobe hooks are probably required in the school for cupboard and locker accommodation used for books and various kinds of equipment. Purchase of the lawnmower could, of course, be deferred until the Spring. Otherwise the applications appear in order and supply recommended if funds are available.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

As the quotations stand the totals are:\n\n$14.71 $33.35 $31.03\n\nI do not understand why a Lawn Mower should be required at St. Catherine's School at the present time, and would suggest that this particular item be taken off the list of articles to be supplied. In any case the 18 inch machine would in my opinion be too large for young boys to operate with success.\n\nWithout the Lawn Mower the comparative totals would be:\n\n$14.71 $20.25 $14.03\n\nthe lowest being that quoted by Messrs Gordon & Belyea, Ltd. There would however still be the great difference in the type of Whitewash quoted on by the three firms to be taken into account.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald H.

It is felt, however, that the 1/2\" width chisel is not needed. The Department is not prepared to approve the purchase of the Stanley rabbit plane. We doubt very much if any of the Indian boys will possess such equipment after they leave school.\n\nWhen submitting accounts covering the above you should mark them -- \"Pay from B.C.

C.\n\nDear Mr. Moore:\n\nThe spinning machine now in use at St. Catherine's School spins much too fine for the Cowichan Indian knitting and therefore we do not get the best results.\n\nWhen Major Mackay visited the school last November he noted that both the spinner and the carder were too small for the amount of work done. He told us to requisition a larger one of each.\n\nWe now have the opportunity of an Indian made machine, made by Mr. Georgson of Koksilah, complete for ($12) twelve dollars. We have had one in the school on trial for a couple of weeks and it has proved very satisfactory.\n\nWould you kindly requisition this from the Department for us, Mr. Moore?\n\nThanking you and hoping for a favourable reply I am,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 24th, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 19th instant, the Department approves the following expenditures for the St. Catherine's Day School:\n\n- Manual training supplies (lumber) ... $41.95\n- \" tools, etc. ........... 47.31\n- Playground supplies .................. 8.92\n- Domestic science & sewing supplies ... 28.56\n\nIn authorizing the above, you will note that we have deleted the two items of $8.25 and $15.70, or a total of $23.95.\n\nIn forwarding accounts, you should attach copy of your Purchase Order.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, with reference to a request that you have received for additional tools and material for vocational training purposes at the St. Catherine's Indian Day School.\n\nWe have carefully reviewed the information that we have on file regarding the tools already supplied and, for your information, I enclose a list showing the tools purchased for this school since 1938. It is evident from the list supplied by the teacher that many of these tools are missing. Possibly some of them have become useless owing to use, but at the same time it is felt that there are more missing than there should be.\n\nIn continuing the vocational training class at this school it is essential to have the necessary tools in order that the teacher may give proper instruction. With this admitted we feel that additional tools are necessary and the purchase of the attached list of tools and materials is authorized. With the supplying of these tools together with those already in the school there should be an adequate supply on hand for all practical purposes.\n\nWe are not authorizing the No. 45 Stanley plane. This is a difficult plane to handle and the only practical necessity for it would be for grooving. A grooving plane is much easier to handle but, as far as we are aware, cannot be secured at the present time and, therefore, this item should be dropped.\n6 Stanley No. 4 smooth planes\n4 1/2\" bench screws No. 61\n3 6\" try-squares, Stanley No. 20\n1 Rose countersink\n6 1\" socket, bevel-edge chisels No. 720\n6 3/8\" \" \" \" \"\n6 1/2\" 12-point back saws, No. 21 x 12\n12 Gimlet bits, (3 each) 3/32, 7/32, 8/32, 9/32\n1 Set auger bits, Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,\n12, 13, 14, 15 and 16.\n1 C 43\u00bd combination bench vise\n6 Stanley No. 51 metal spokeshaves\n3 Bradaws, assorted sizes, No. 5\u00bd\n3 Medium, half-round cabinet files\n2 Screw driver bits, No. 26S, \u00bc and 3/8\n4 4' bar clamps (Perfection)\n1 Tang butt, chisel handle No. 609\n6 Bench\n1 No. 77 mortise gauge\n1 Blackboard T square\n1 Each 60 degree and 45 degree blackboard triangles\n1 Blackboard compass\n6 Student's T squares, 24\"\n3 Doz. pin-end coping saw blades, No. 51\n\n1 Quire sandpaper No. 00\n1 \" \" No. 0\n1 \" \" No. 1\n1 \" \" No. 2\n1 Qt.

You will also please note that the drawing equipment asked for is for use in the manual training room as well as the blackboards.\n\nI find that the present Manual training instructor is very well qualified, and with proper and sufficient tools with which he can make more necessary equipment for class rooms and manual training room, his usefulness to the school generally will be greatly increased. For instance, work benches are badly required and with the proper tools these can be made right in the class room by the boys.\n\nI would recommend that favourable consideration be given these requests.\n\n(R.M. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nFebruary 26th, 1943.\n\nR.H. Moore, Esq., Indian Agent, Duncan, B.C.\n\nReplying to your letter of the 13th instant enclosing requisitions for tools etc., for the manual training division of St. Catherine's Indian Day School, I would advise that it is noted that the quantity on hand of some of these tools is shown by an X which it is presumed means \"nil\".\n\nOn checking over the files it is found that Purchase Orders, including tools in the items, were issued as follows:\n\n| No.   | Date          |\n|-------|--------------|\n| 26598 | June 12th, 1940 |\n| 29907 | Oct. 31st, 1940 |\n| 29972 | Jan. 15th, 1941 |\n| 2953  | Nov. 4th, 1941 |\n| 7674  | June 30th, 1942 |\n\nand I would also refer to my letter of January 14th, 1942 re Chisels and disapproval of the purchase of Stanley Plane, the latter item being again included in your requisition despite the fact that the Department has previously refused to consider the item.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Department previously questioned the supply of further manual training tools for the school, due to the low attendance, and that many of the tools already supplied did not appear to be on hand, I would request that you go over the Purchase Orders above mentioned and make up an inventory in quadruplicate which should also include the garden tools for outside use and those for the Janitor. You should then have these checked at the school and copy left with the Reverend Principal covering the tools actually on hand, another kept in your office, the other two being forwarded to this office in duplicate giving an explanation for the shortages, if any. On receipt of this inventory, together with a statement of the average number of pupils in attendance to be given manual training tuition, I will then take up the matter with the Department.\n\np.t.o.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C. P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nIn reply to your letter above noted, wherein you returned certain requisitions for additional tools for St. Catherine's Indian Day School Manual Training Division, I beg to submit herewith in duplicate\u2014as requested\u2014a complete list of all tools purchased for this school since it was opened, with a list of the Purchase Orders issued and the number of the Vouchers in payment of same submitted from this Office.\n\nIn many instances you will note that P.O.'s covered supplies as well as tools; naturally the supplies are not listed as they have been used or are in the process of being used, in various articles being made for use at the school. You are quite correct in your assumption that the \"X\" shown on the form as being on hand, means \"Nil\".\n\nI am quite well aware that the Department did not approve of the purchase of a Stanley Plane previously, but certain work is being expected of the Manual Training Instructor which it is not possible for him to do unless he has the proper tools, and I venture the opinion that if Inspector Barry had not recommended against the purchase of this article of equipment in the first place the Department would not have objected. However, if you will not recommend that it be procured please delete it from this requisition. I have mentioned many many times, the principal cause of the poor attendance at this school, viz: the lack of a Truant Officer, and until one is made available the attendance will always be unsatisfactory.\n\nI attach herewith a letter which I have received from the Principal which I hope will be found self-explanatory. If the tools asked for are supplied we may be able to have the squares, triangles and drawing boards constructed as you suggest. Requisitions are being returned herewith for your further consideration.\n\n(R.H.Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nFebruary 8th, 1943\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Manual Training Classes\n\nSt. Catherine's Indian Day School, Duncan, B.C.\n\nVOTE Allotment\n\nSHIP TO St. Catherine's Indian Day School, Duncan, B.C.\n\nManual Training Class-room equipment\n\nPurpose for which required\n\nNOTE:\u2014Requisition for non-consumable equipment, state if New Issue or Replacement.\n\nconsumable equipment and supplies use columns 1 and 2.\n\n| Quantity | Quantity on hand (1) | Quantity needed per month (2) | Unit Price | TOTAL |\n|----------|---------------------|-------------------------------|------------|-------|\n| 6        | Stanley No. 5, Jack planes | x                             | 70         | 28.20 |\n| 4        | 1\u00bd ins.

Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Moore:\n\nWe find it impossible to carry on the Domestic Science cooking class on $5.00 a month with cost of living as it is.\n\nWould you kindly inquire from the Department if they will increase the allowance from $5.00 to $10.00\n\nWe feel we could profit better of bargains if we were allowed to purchase as the need arises, paying cash for the articles and then submitting an itemized account at the end of the month. Would this be permitted?\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nOttawa,\nJuly 22, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant, the Department will allow an amount of $10.00 a month, during the academic year 1943-44, for purchasing material required for the cooking class at the St. Catherine's Indian Day School. You may allow the Rev. Principal of the school to purchase the supplies as the need arises.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Moore's letter of the 14th instant forwarding the application of the Reverend Principal of St. Catherine's Indian Day School requesting authority to expend an additional $5.00 per month for Domestic Science material in the cooking class, which would increase the allowance to $10.00 per month. Also that the Reverend Principal be authorized to purchase food, etc., as the need arises. I would recommend approval of the application subject to the Reverend Sister securing the usual receipt for expenditures.\n\nI do not appear to have received a copy of the Department's letter of March 15, 1940, referred to by Mr. Moore in his letter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nFord M.

This requires fine yarn and as our spinners turn out only the coarse yarn needed for the Cowichan Indian sweater, the children cannot attain their objective in spinning the wool fine enough to fashion the required articles.\n\nI am enclosing the advertisement from the Dupuis catalogue illustrating a specimen of the spindles they are using for fine wool in the Kenloge Indian Residential School.

It is regretted that I omitted to mention this to you when I first gave you the quotation on the materials required to put up the partition, but as a matter of fact it was not altogether my fault as I had asked for a quotation on these materials but Mr. Ormond omitted to give it to me and I overlooked it entirely at the time and until the floor was almost down, then we had to get it in a hurry so as to get the pipe laid underneath the floor before it was put down.

(RG 10, Volume 6389, File 807-11, part 1)\nREPORT ON COWICHAN INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY, 1944\n\nAs reported last month a meeting was held with the Chiefs of the Cowichan Band in regard to the then irregular attendance at St. Catherine's school, the outcome being that a meeting of the Teacher's of the School and the Councils was arranged when the matter was fully discussed and all phases of the school and the program of studies gone into and explained by the Teachers. This meeting apparently had a very beneficial effect on all concerned and no further complaints have been received from the Council members.

In this connection, I enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Moore's requisition of the 29th ultimo for two Singer Sewing Machines and six dozen boxes of white thread.\n\nThis school has already been supplied with two Singer Sewing Machines and in view of the quite small average attendance in the grades that would be taking sewing lessons I do not consider that we should supply more than one additional machine. It would also appear that an order of six dozen boxes of white thread is excessive although, no doubt, the surplus could be kept in stock at the school for future requirements.\n\nD.M.

This is the same amount as was allowed at the Tsartlip School. In connection with supplying science equipment to the Tsartlip School, I would refer you to the second paragraph of my letter of December 7, 1944, at which time we authorized the purchase of science equipment at Tsartlip.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D.

Our records do not indicate whether this machine was supplied or not.\n\nThe supply of science equipment to the St. Catherine's School has been the subject of previous correspondence, your letter of May 30, 1944, stating that \"careful consideration has been given to the request of the teacher for this equipment but the Department does not consider it advisable to supply it at the present time\". It would be appreciated if you would advise if the Department's policy in this connection has been changed in view of the fact that similar equipment was recently supplied to the Tsartlip School.\n\n(Sgd.)

I am informed that there are actually 22 girls in attendance at that school who are capable of using machines. Naturally another machine would make the work of teaching sewing a lot easier, but the school can get along without one.\n\n(R.H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's letter of March 29th (File 152-22-11) in connection with Inspector Plenderleith's report on his inspection of the St. Catherine's Indian Day School, and in particular to the proposed supply of another sewing machine, I enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Moore's letter of April 17th, from which it will be noted that there are now three machines at the school and that there are actually 22 girls in attendance who are capable of using machines.\n\nIn reviewing the Inspector's report it is noted that there was a total of 26 pupils in Grades 4 to 7 inclusive, 19 of whom were present, and presuming that one-half the enrolment are boys, there would be only 13 pupils to use the three machines now at the school. I could not, therefore, recommend the supply of another sewing machine until such time as the pupilage warrants such action.\n\nFor D. M.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd instant, you may purchase the supplies required for the manual training class at the St. Catherine's Indian Day School, with the exception of the Yale latches and the rules. The Department agrees with your statement, that serviceable articles could be secured at a much lower price.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Moore's requisition of April 27th, 1945, for manual training material amounting to about $39.10 for St. Catherine's Indian Day School, together with a copy of my enquiry of the 14th ultimo to Mr. Moore and his reply of the 18th instant.\n\nIt appears to me that the method of fastening the cupboards with a yale night latch at a cost of $3.50 each is somewhat more expensive than is necessary, and in the absence of information as to whether the supplies are to be used for manual training purposes it is open to question whether this item would be a proper charge against the B.C. Special Vote. Notwithstanding Agent Moore's remarks, I am still of the opinion that the more expensive fold rules are not satisfactory for a manual training class and the children do not have to carry these rules around in their pocket. Furthermore, as you are aware, they are extremely liable to break at the joints.\n\nSubject to the foregoing, I would recommend approval of the application.\n\nD.M. MacKay\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nFurther information is required in connection with a number of items listed on your Requisition of April 27th for manual training supplies and equipment for the St. Catherine's Indian Day School, as we wish to be sure that all items are a proper charge against the B.C. Special Vote and will not be used for maintenance of the school building. Please advise what use is to be made of the two Yale night latches, six cupboard locks, one set of ball-bearing castors and 2 doz. chair glides.\n\nI may say that I have some doubt as to the wisdom of supplying 2 ft. 4-fold rules as there would be more of a tendency to misplace these articles than there would a yard-stick or rigid rule of some kind.\n\nYou might let me have your comments on this point.\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\n-HN\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver,\n\nIn reference to your above noted letters I wish to advise as follows:\n\n1. Yale night Latches for storage cupboards for supplies.\n2. Six cupboard locks for domestic science kitchen supply cupboards, recently built.\n3. Chides for chairs made in school by pupils and for use there.\n4. For service waggon for serving cocoa and collecting dirty dishes. (castors)\n5. There has only been one rule misplaced since the school was built; the yard stick you suggest is too unhandy and would be broken within a week.\n\nPersonally, I have never seen a carpenter going round with a three foot rigid rule or yard stick, and I believe it would be a mistake to supply them to a manual training room.\n\n(R.H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a requisition dated May 1st for domestic science equipment for the St. Catherine's Indian Day School at an approximate cost of $100.00.\n\nVarious items of such equipment were supplied to this school last year and it is considered that if the items listed were secured the domestic science division should be well equipped insofar as this type of equipment is concerned for some time to come.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd instant, authority is granted for the purchase of lumber for the manual training class at the St. Catherine's Indian Day School at an approximate cost of $125.00.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI am enclosing herewith Mr. Indian Agent Moore's requisition dated October 1st covering the proposed supply of lumber for the manual training class at the St. Catherine's Indian Day School at an approximate cost of $125.00. The quantities and items asked for appear to be reasonable and the requisition is recommended for approval. A Purchase Order will be placed with the Stewart and Hudson Lumber Company Ltd., by this office if approved.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI am enclosing for your information Mr. Indian Agent Moore's letter of March 20th and resolution referred to therein, together with School Inspector Davey's memorandum of March 24th in connection with manual training instruction at St. Catherine's Indian Bay School.\n\nIt is anticipated that Inspector Davey will visit St. Catherine's School immediately after the Easter holidays following which his comments with respect to this matter will be forwarded to you.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMarch 24, 1947\n\nMemorandum\nTo: Indian Commissioner\nFrom: School Inspector\n\nRe: Manual Training\nSt. Catherine's School.\n\nAt the time of my inspection of the St. Catherine's School on January 20th and 21st, last I was not entirely satisfied with the type of work being done in the manual training classes. At that time I made certain suggestions to Mr. Morrison which he was to follow. I shall visit this school the next time I go to the Island and see if these suggestions have been carried out.\n\nConcerning the suggestion in the Cowichan Band Resolution that the pupils engage in drawing plans for buildings, I recommended at the time of my visit that a certain amount of elementary constructional drawing be given, but these pupils are not ready to undertake anything as ambitious as the resolution proposes.\n\nR.F. Davey,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools.\nMajor D. H. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nPost Office Box 70,\nVANCOUVER, B. C.\n\nI beg to attach, herewith, in duplicate, a Resolution from the Cowichan Band Council relative to a suggested change in the type of instructions which are being given to the children taking the manual training instruction at St. Catherine's Indian School.\n\nThis matter has been the subject of correspondence and recommendations from this office on several occasions as well as having discussed the question with Major Davey, who, no doubt, will give the matter attention during his next inspection of the school.\n\nR.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, the Department approves an expenditure of approximately $180 covering the cost of manual training tools and equipment for the St. Catherine's School. When forwarding accounts you should mark on them \"Pay from B.C. Special\".\n\nThe Department is not prepared to supply the rangette and the sewing machine at the present time as we feel that the home economics department is well equipped.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing a requisition dated May 1st covering the proposed supply of an electric range and a Singer sewing machine for the St. Catherine's Indian Day School, together with a memorandum dated June 30th from School Inspector Davey in this connection.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Davey considers the Home Economics Department of this school to be better equipped than any three-roomed Provincial school in British Columbia, and that in his opinion priority in the matter of the supply of such equipment should be given to other schools at the present time.\n\nI am inclined to agree with the School Inspector in this connection and I suggest that the requisition be held in abeyance until it is known to what extent the present Home Economics facilities at the school will provide for the enrolment next September.\n\nA copy of the other requisitions referred to by Mr. Davey covering the supply of Manual Training tools and equipment for St. Catherine's school, at an approximate cost of $150.00 is attached hereto and I would recommend that authority be granted to purchase the items from the best source available.\n\nD.

June 30th, 1947.\n\nRe: Requisitions for Vocational Training,\nSt. Catherine's Indian Day School.\n\nI am not prepared to recommend the installation of an electric range at the above-mentioned School nor the Reversew Singer Sewing Machine.\n\nThe Home Economics Department of this School is at present better equipped than any three-room school that I know either Indian or White in this Province. It is felt that the expenditure of this money, when supplies and equipment are badly needed at other Schools, is not justified.\n\nWith regard to the item \"10 prs. Triangles, Zylonite\" for the manual training Department, I suggest that wooden ones would be considerably cheaper and serve the purpose just as well.

Neary,\nChief Training Department,\nOttawa, Ontario,\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nI am very pleased to hear from you concerning the domestic science department. It is encouraging to know that you understand the problems we are facing.\n\nThe point you raise is one which was widely discussed with Major Davey, our School Inspector, on the occasion of his first visit to our school.\n\nFor reasons, which now seem clear to you, I strongly supported full time domestic science and manual training teachers so that there could be a proportionate integration of the above, with straight academic and other school activities.\n\nMajor Davey was given orders this time last year to cut down the manual training instructor's time. (I do not know on whose orders but these letters must be on your files.) Therefore the domestic science had to run on the same basis. As a result the domestic science and manual training activities have been the controlling factors with regard to the whole school curriculum.\n\nThe children who are desirous of continuing high school studies need more academic teaching, while those who do not intend going further than Grade Eight benefit more by extra vocational training. Under the present regime the class teacher has no other option but to group the classes for those departments.\n\nThe integration of studies would assuredly be easier if the teachers were on full time duty.\n\nAnother point for consideration is the steadily growing attendance.\nAfter due consideration of these facts I shall be glad to abide by your decision, and also to lay before you a detailed outline of what is essential to a well equipped domestic science department.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, November 10, 1947.\n\nReverend and dear Sister:\n\nReporting on his recent visit to the St. Catherine's Day school, Mr. Boucet of this Department writes as follows:\n\n\"It is regretted that the well equipped domestic science department was not in operation at the time of my inspection. I am of the opinion that domestic science is only taught for a few months during each academic year. I feel that it would be more preferable to integrate the domestic science with other activities and especially with the straight academic course.\"\n\nWhile there may be special reasons for the procedure that has been followed, we feel that the method at present in use involves a great loss of the educational value which is attached to such an activity.\n\nI, therefore, strongly recommend that the domestic science course be integrated with the academic studies. I would appreciate hearing from you that our suggestion is being put into immediate effect.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Heary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Sr. Mary Sheila,\nSt. Catherine's Indian Day School,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6389, File 807-11, part 2)\nMr. David reports:\n\n\"It is to be regretted that the well equipped domestic science department was not in operation. I am of the impression that this activity is a delight as a concentrated course for some months rather than integrating it with other activities even with the straight academics. I have discussed this fairly thoroughly with Inspector Davis.\n\nThere may be reasons for this procedure, if so kindly inform me.\n\nThe thought that this entails a great loss of educational values attached to the activities and the overall program strongly recommend that this activity be integrated with the academic studies.\n\nKindly let me know if you think this is possible. Should it not be possible please outline the reasons.\"\n| QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION                  | PRICE | AMOUNT |\n|----------|------------------------------|-------|--------|\n| 5        | Drawing Boards 12 x 17       | 1.60  | 8.00   |\n|          | Prepaid Charge               |       | 55     |\n|          |                              |       | 8.55   |\n\nShipped to: St. Catherines Indian Day School,\nc/o Mr. R.

Berkey\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI am enclosing a memorandum dated March 21st, from District School Inspector Davey, with regard to Domestic Science facilities at the St. Catherine's Day School.\n\nYou will note that consideration had previously been given to the installation of a large institutional range for the Domestic Science class, to replace the small standard range presently in use which is burned out beyond repair. It is considered by Mr. Davey, however, that it would be preferable to install two standard kitchen ranges which will necessitate the construction of an additional chimney on the west end of the present classroom.\n\nSuperintendent Moore, reference his letter of April 9th, attached, has secured two tenders on the construction of a chimney, the lowest of which amounts to $209.00. The two ranges required will cost approximately $360.00, a total expenditure of $569.00.\n\nThe erection of the new chimney and provision of two new ranges is recommended and I would ask you to please advise if funds can be made available.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMarch 21, 1949.\n\nRe: Stove - St. Catherine's Indian Day School\n\nOn the occasion of my recent visit to the above mentioned school I considered the possibility of installation of a large Institutional Range to replace the present kitchen stove which is being used for cooking classes.\n\nThere is no doubt that the stove of the Institutional type would give much longer service than the ordinary household range but I feel that it would be better to supply the type normally used in the home. The chief purpose of the home economics course is to try and develop among the girls a standard of housekeeping comparable to that found in the majority of white homes. We should therefore provide our Home Economics rooms with equipment of the type we wish our Indian homes to use.\n\nFor the number of pupils in the average cooking class at this school two ovens are required. I would recommend therefore that in place of a large two oven Institutional stove we provide an additional chimney on the west end of the present classroom and install two kitchen ranges.\n\nI might add that I have checked with the supervisor of Home Economics instruction for the Provincial Schools in B.C. and she informs me that the Home Economics rooms in the majority of the Provincial schools are provided with two or three such ranges.\n\nR.F. Davey,\nDistrict School Inspector.\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVANCOUVER, B. C.\n\nIn reply to yours of above date and file,\nI would advise that I received two tenders from local\ncontractors as attached, and would recommend that Oscar\nBrown be given the work as he has given us the better\nprice, viz:\n\nA 28' 8\" x 12\" flue lined chimney for two hundred\nfourteen dollars and fifty cents ($214.50) as against\nA 27' 8\" x 8\" flue lined chimney for two hundred nine\ndollars ($209.00),\n\nand his workmanship has always been satisfactory.\n\nR.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 13th instant enclosing a report from Inspector Davey with regard to the Domestic Science facilities at the St. Catherine's Day School. We are prepared to authorize the purchase of two stoves, provided it will not be necessary to construct a new chimney.\n\nFrom experiences we have had, we have found it possible to connect two stoves to the same flue, and therefore, we cannot see why an expenditure of $209.00 is required for a new chimney.\n\nIn the third paragraph of your letter you state that two stoves would cost approximately $360.00. This seems very high as we usually supply stoves costing approximately $90.00. Approval is granted for an expenditure of $180.00 for the two stoves.\n\nFor your information I may say that we have forwarded to the St. Catherine's School, 32 first year badges and two second year badges. However, we do not appear to have received any report from the Principal regarding the work actually carried out in the Domestic Science class.\n\nBernard F.

I have to request that you will give both Mr. and Mrs. Daly every assistance you can in their work.\n\nMr. Daly should prepare and forward a report on the forms for that purpose at the end of each quarter showing the attendance, days taught, etc., and Mrs. Daly should prepare a brief report showing the work performed by her.

I note that you require certain school supplies and I am requesting the Government Stationery Office to forward the following:\n\n- Chalk\n- Scribblers\n- Exercise Books\n- Lead Pencils\n- Drawing Paper\n- Blackboard Brushes\n- Ink Powder\n- Penholders\n- Pens\n\nRequisitions for supplies required should be prepared by you and forwarded to the Department through Mr. Mortimer's office. I feel certain that Mr. Mortimer will take early steps to assist you in every possible manner.\n\nA cheque for $90 in favour of yourself and one for $30 in favour of Mrs. Daly, covering salary for the month of September, are being forwarded to Mr. Mortimer who will, no doubt, send them on to you in the near future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, November 18th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nEnclosed is a letter which the Department has recently received from Mr. C. O. Daly, teacher of the Port Babine Indian Day School. You will note that his first complaint is the expense which he has to incur in order to secure his mail. Would it not be possible to arrange for delivery of his mail, say, once a week?\n\nYou will, also, note that he mentions that he has no supplies on hand. The only requisition the Department has received is one forwarded by you last month for readers, geographies, histories and arithmetics. These were forwarded on October 27th, addressed to the teacher at Topley, B. C. In view of the statement in his letter, I am today ordering from the Government Stationery Office a supply of chalk, scribblers, exercise books, lead pencils, drawing paper, blackboard brushes, ink powder, penholders and pens.\n\nAs pointed out in official letter of September 26th, the Department expects that you will give Mr. and Mrs. Daly every possible assistance and I would, therefore, appreciate your advising what action you are taking to overcome the difficulties mentioned in the enclosed letter, as it is the Department's wish to make these teachers as comfortable as conditions will permit.\n\nI might also advise that cheques covering the September salaries of Mr. and Mrs. Daly are going forward under separate cover.\n\nWhen replying to this letter, you should return Mr. Daly's communication to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B. C.\nFort Babine Indian School,\nBabine,\nVia Topley, B.C.,\n5 N. '30\n\nR. T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nDept. of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received your pamphlet, No. 150-39, of date October 3rd, addressed to teachers of Indian schools, and note therein that you intend sending me \"Teacher's Manual\" and other magazines. Before you do so I would wish you to understand that we have no mail service here. Babine is eighty miles from Topley, the nearest Post Office, and we have to pay an Indian runner for any mail that we get or despatch from here at a minimum rate of 50\u00a2 per letter. Newspapers and magazines cost more but we get very few as they are generally discarded along the trail when travelling conditions are bad.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6389, File 808-3, part 1)\nTaking into consideration that I had to pay $2.50 for pamphlet referred to, that I will have to pay the same for two letters and a like amount, maybe more, for any letter on the way to me, would it not be better not to send me any mail in future unless your department is willing to repay me for any expense incurred in getting same or until such time as the government was fit to establish a post office in Balme and so give us a regular mail service.\n\nAs regards school equipment with the exception of two maps and a half box of chalk there is nothing here. Sometimes there are as many as thirty pupils in attendance and they badly need readers, history, geography, scribblers, drawing paper, ink, pencils, black board eraser, etc. If your department supplies Indian schools with these necessaries I would like you to forward same as soon as possible - that is, of course, provided arrangement are made that I will not be charged for the freight on them. Without a proper supply of these things I am completely handicapped in my work.\n\nI am now in my third month here and, as yet, have received no cheque for my service.\nas teacher and janitor. I understand that I am to be paid extra for splitting wood, looking after the fires, and keeping school in order. Would it not be possible to send me a cheque every month as otherwise I am put to much inconvenience for want of ready money and have to pay interest on overdue store bills?\n\nYours truly,\nC.O. Daby\nSir,\n\nI respectfully beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 151-5-3, dated November 16th, 1930, with enclosure from Mr. C. O. Daly, Teacher of the Indian Day School at Fort Babine. I am returning Mr. Daly's letter herewith.\n\nI will first deal with the question of the mail service to Fort Babine. There is no mail service to Fort Babine, and the nearest Post Office is at Topley on the Canadian National Railway, about 100 miles distant. Mail is carried in to Fort Babine by Indians or white people if they are visiting Topley from that district on business. To arrange for Mr. Daly to get his mail weekly would be an expensive proposition as the return journey during the winter would take approximately a week to complete. During the summer months, mail reaches Fort Babine much more frequently owing to the fact that people are moving in and out, to and from Fort Babine almost daily.\n\nRegarding school supplies etc., when I visited Fort Babine in August last, I inspected the Fort Babine Indian School and found all kinds of school material such as scribblers, exercise books, pencils, chalk, ink and drawing paper, in fact the School was well supplied with material, left that way by the late Teacher, Mr. Morrissey. I was pleased with everything at the School except its lack of cleanliness; the floors, desks and walls might have been cleaner, however I have since instructed Mr. Daly, by letter, to have the walls kalsomined and the School thoroughly cleaned out.\n\nI anticipated Mr. Daly being at Fort Babine when I visited there in August, but he did not arrive until the latter part of September, 1930. Had he been at Fort Babine during my visit he would have got all information first hand. I have written several letters to Mr. Daly, but as Fort Babine is difficult of access at this time of the year, letters take considerable time to come and go.\n\nFor me to make a special visit to Fort Babine at the present time would cost considerable expense to the Department and I feel it is an unnecessary expense. However, Mr. Daly is being rendered every assistance by this Office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6389, File 808-3, part 1)\nOttawa, December 3rd, 1930.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your S20-8-316 of the 26th ultimo, in connection with the letter received by the Department from the teacher of the Fort Babine Indian Day School. The Department is pleased to note that you are giving Mr. Daly every possible assistance. He is being advised that the Department is prepared to consider payment of vouchers for a reasonable amount submitted through your office covering the disbursements he may make in connection with securing his mail.\n\nIn the event of your visiting Fort Babine at any time in the near future, the Department would appreciate your communicating, if possible, with the express agent and postmaster at Topley and, if there are any school supplies awaiting delivery to Mr. Daly, you might be able to take them in with you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

You should submit a statement in this regard at the end of each quarter to Mr. Mortimer, who is being instructed to forward it for our consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

The enclosed account, however, does not give sufficient information regarding the length of time mail was transported for the amount charged. If you consider this charge reasonable, you should submit a voucher, but such voucher should contain full details of the services performed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

I beg to state that owing to the manner in which our mail is delivered to us it is impossible for me or Mrs. Nally to submit an account except from the other as requested in your letter. The mail for both of us leaves Topley in one package and the Indian who brings it names his price before it is given into our hands. This also makes it very difficult for me to submit a statement in this regard to Mr. Mortimer as Mr. R.T. Ferres asked me to do. There would be the same trouble with the\noutgoing mail. Pending further instructions concerning this matter, I am submitting to you receipts showing, with two exceptions, the amount of money paid by me for dispatch and delivery of mail. The two exceptions referred to occurred in Oct. and Nov. I paid #2.00 in each case but have not been able to get receipts as the men are out trapping. Of course, if I had had your instructions earlier and if I had known that you were prepared to reimburse me for expenses involved, as you kindly now promise to do, I would have had vouchers covering all cases. In all six cases mentioned, four of which I hereby submit, there were letters, magazines, folders, etc., from your department. The total expense amounts to #16.00, which I hope your department will defray at the earliest possible convenience.\n\nYour truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6389, File 808-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nFoot Babine Indian Day School\nTopley, B.C.\n27-1-31\n\nR.T. Ferris, Esq.,\nDept. of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nOn looking up the Indian Day School Regulations I note that salaries are paid to teachers of such schools only quarterly and then only on receipt of quarterly returns.\n\nI would like you to take into serious consideration the inconvenience and expense that such a system entails on a teacher.\n\nTake my case for instance. I am now finishing my fifth month in Babine and all I have as yet received for my services is the September cheque for #90, which, by the way, was not issued from head office until the 18th November, if I remember rightly, and was not received by me until the 22nd December, so I had no opportunity until today of sending out the\nWay school returns, and as, according to our rule, no cheque will be issued in my favour until after their receipt in Ottawa, it will probably be well into March before I receive the salary due to me for the quarter ending the 31st December; and then another month will probably elapse before I get a chance of sending my cheque out to get it cashed. This means that I am compelled to endeavour to support a family for six or probably seven months on the paltry sum of $70, or $120 if the $30 received by my wife in December is included. As a result both my life insurance policies lapsed. I issued promissory notes to pay the premiums, plus interest, of course, on the 28th January, making sure that I would have received my salary by then but alas! now I have not a cent to meet the matured notes.\n\nBesides all this the lack of ready money, which would not often if our salaries were paid monthly, has compelled my family and myself to do without many things, clothes, etc., which we really ought to have had this winter.\n\nUnder these circumstances can you blame me for characterising this quarterly salary system as not only antiquated but positively unjust and\nNo firm or corporation, and probably very few government departments, would dream of inflicting such a ghastly anachronism on their employees nowadays.\n\nThis is merely a plain statement of fact and I hope that my plea in favour of monthly salaries will receive from your department the sympathetic attention that it undoubtedly deserves. Even in settled communities, in the light of modern economic conditions a monthly salary is a sharp necessity; but it is only one who has lived in the wilds can really form an adequate idea of what a boon and a blessing a monthly salary would confer on people, far from the outposts of civilization who are, to say the least, forced to undergo many privations of a vexatious nature at the best of times.\n\nYour truly,\nC.W. Walby\nOttawa, February 19th, 1931.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to payment of salaries of teachers of Indian day schools. In reply I beg to say that it is the practice of the Department to pay the salaries of teachers of Indian day schools quarterly. After the first of April, next, the Department will be prepared to consider giving you one advance each quarter on your quarterly salary on receipt of a request from you, stating the amount desired. Under separate cover, you are being forwarded a cheque for $300., covering your salary for the quarter ended December 31st, last.\n\nWith reference to payments for carrying mail, the Department is forwarding the receipts which you sent here to Mr. Agent Mortimer in order that he may attach them to proper voucher forms and submit same for payment. You will note from my letter of December 3rd, last, that your statement, with receipts attached, concerning expenditure incurred in obtaining mail, should be forwarded at the end of each quarter to Mr. Agent Mortimer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nC. O. Daly, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nFort Babine Indian Day School,\nTopley P. O., B.C.\nOttawa, February 19th, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI desire to refer you to official letter of December 24th, last, with which was enclosed a letter and account received from the teacher of the Fort Babine Indian Day School with reference to expenditure incurred in obtaining mail. No answer has yet been received to this letter and Mr. Daly has now forwarded to the Department the attached receipts covering expenditures made by him during the month of December. I would appreciate your forwarding a voucher for the charges which you consider are reasonable and you should attach to this voucher the enclosed receipts. As pointed out in my previous letter, this voucher should contain full details of the services performed.\n\nIf, in the course of your official duties, you happen to visit the Fort Babine Reserve at any time within the next few months, it would be well to discuss this whole matter fully with Mr. and Mrs. Daly and endeavour to reach a definite understanding regarding the amount of expenses which the Department will be expected to assume in regard to handling their mail. It would appear that mail service two or three times a month should be all that the Department should be expected to pay for.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B. C.\nOttawa, February 20, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nIn further reference to official letter of yesterday's date relative to providing mail facilities for the teacher of the Fort Babine Indian Day School between that point and Topley, the nearest post office, I have now to inform you that a communication has been received from the Post Office Department in which they state as follows:\n\n\"From the information obtained, an office at this point would accommodate only two families and six single men, white residents, and about fifty Indian families.\n\nThe revenue is estimated at $50.00 per annum, and the estimated cost of a service weekly from Topley by trail and water route is $1,000.00 per annum, but no offers have been received at this rate.\n\nThe District Superintendent further states that the only permanent white residents in the district which would be served by the proposed Post Office are the Proposed Postmaster and his wife, who are teacher and matron respectively at the Indian School, the manager of the Hudson's Bay Company's Trading Post and his wife, and a few single men. The Hudson's Bay Company arranges for its own mail service to and from Topley by freight boat in Summer, and by courier in Winter, and the District Manager of the fur trade Department states that he does not wish to have the Post Office at the Company's store, the only other site available being on the Indian Reserve.\"\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6389, File 808-3, part 1)\nThe mail for the Dominion Fish Hatchery is conveyed by private courier twice per month at a cost, it is understood, of $35.00 per trip. The postmaster at Topley, B.C., who handles all the mail for this district states that the total quantity of mail despatched by the residents in the Babine Lake District amounts to twenty-five or thirty letters per week at present.\n\nI have, therefore, to express regret that in view of the cost of the maintaining of an office at this point, and the small number of families to be accommodated, the Department cannot take favourable action.\"\n\nYou might consult the authorities of the Dominion Fish Hatcheries, and it might be possible to make some arrangement with them for the carrying of Mr. and Mrs. Daly's mail from Topley to Fort Babine. You should ascertain what extra cost they would charge for the service, and inform the Department, or you should give full particulars as to any other arrangement you can make.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nRe - Mail Facilities to Fort Babine.\n\nMarch 5th, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 157-7-3, dated February 26th, 1931 referring to mail facilities for the benefit of the Indian Bay School Teacher and the Field Matron of Fort Babine, I respectfully beg to report that I have made careful enquiries as to what possible means by which mail could be forwarded to the above mentioned parties.\n\nI interviewed the Inspector of Dominion Fisheries at this point and he informs me that the Dominion Fish Hatcheries secure their mail once per month, but that the Fish Hatcheries are quite distant from Fort Babine and, therefore, their letter carrier would be obliged to go many miles off his route in order to deliver mail to Fort Babine.\n\nThe only logical way for mail to be shipped to this point is by the Hudson's Bay Co.'s carrier from Toplay Station, which is also monthly. This system has been in operation for many years and apparently was satisfactory to both the Hudson's Bay Company and the late Indian Bay School Teacher, Mr. Morley. During my visit, I was able to speak to Mr. Morley regarding mail facilities to Fort Babine in winter time and he informed me that he had been receiving his mail, Departmental and otherwise, through the Hudson's Bay Company for the last sixteen years without any expense to the Department.\n\nOwing to the unprecedented mild weather in this part of B.C., only partial freezing of the Babine Lake has taken place this winter thereby rendering transportation much more difficult which, in all probability, will not occur again for many years. This has, no doubt, added to the cost of carrier services. During the spring, summer and fall, mail service is much more frequent than in the winter.\n\nAs the winter season is almost over, may I suggest...\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nI suggest that this matter be left in abeyance until I make my annual trip, when I will make arrangements for mail delivery for next winter.\n\nI confer with the District Superintendent of the Post Office Department that a Post Office is not necessary at Fort Babine at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG. H. Montimer,\nIndian Agent.\nFort Selborne\nSaskatchewan\nMarch 16th 1931\n\nA. L. MacKenzie\nSec. Indian Dep.\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that I have just, as yet, received my cheque for the quarter ending 31st December.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Ms.) M. H.

Ferris\nSup't. of Indian Educ.,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received your letter of the 19th Feb., with cheque for quarter ending 31st Dec. by same mail, and in reply beg to state that while I am very thankful to you for your kindness in extending to me the much-appreciated privilege of allowing me to request an advance on my salary each quarter, I have to admit to a certain amount of disappointment that your department has not, as yet, consented to pay teachers' salaries monthly.\n\nI feel compelled to reply again to the very late date of clearance of the quarterly salary cheque. The cheque for the Dec. quarter left Ottawa on the 19th Feb., a full seven weeks after it had been earned. I did not receive it until the 12th March and could not make use of it until today. The clearance of the Sept. cheque was equally belated. As a consequence I was...\nwithout money until now, Xmas and have had only $120\u2014the amount of the Sept. cheque\u2014to live on since I reached Barrie. If such is the usual procedure the summer months will be well nigh over before I receive the June cheque. I have no doubt that you will agree with me that this is unjust to a teacher. The only real remedy is a payment of salaries monthly. Until such a determination is reached might I be pardoned for respectfully suggesting to you that our cheques be issued on the first day of every quarter. Even at that, owing to lack of mail service, etc., the new quarters will be well advanced before those of us who are situated beyond the frontier receive them.\n\nI am thanking you for your courteous consideration of my father's request.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.R.
