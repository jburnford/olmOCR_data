As intimated in letter to you of the 13th September, the account should be attached to voucher form in duplicate and duly certified by you, after which it should be enclosed to the Department, and it will then be submitted to the King's Printer to be taxed, when the question of payment will be given consideration.\n\nWith reference to the payment made by Rev. Father Richards to the Pembroke Observer, I beg to remind you that the Department requires an account (which seemingly you did not forward) before the question of recouping Mr. Richards for the outlay incurred can be considered. In this case also the account should be in duplicate, and should have a clipping of the advertisement attached thereto, and should be attached to voucher form bearing your certificate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMurdoch McLennan Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n[Signature]\nAgent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The charge made on the 15th December for cleaning stove pipes and $1.50 for banking school have been allowed, which makes a total allowance of $8.75. From this amount $3.00, which was allowed in the teacher's account for September quarter, for supplying water and splitting wood, has been deducted. This has been done owing to the fact that a separate account for $5.00 was received from Miss O'Connor covering these last mentioned charges, which account was paid. The total payment therefore is $5.75 as per cheque enclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. McNabb Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste Marie, Ont.\n\nAsst.

This would give pupils new interest in school life and stimulate in them at same time more activity, physically as well as mentally.\n\nSgd. Annie O'Connor,\nTeacher.\nOttawa, April 17, 1916.\n\nMadam,\n\nReferring to your remarks on the return for the Goulais Bay School for the quarter ended March 31st, last, in which you suggest that the standing order still in Agent's hands for goods for Xmas tree last year, which was not used, be applied to providing games, books, blocks, sticks for construction work, etc., for children's use and to be property of the school I beg to say that the money authorized last year has now lapsed.

There is not any regular Boat running to this place and we have to ship our Freight on a Fish Boat, they do not issue any Bills of Lading or Shipping Bills. They carry our Freight just to accommodate us, they do not carry freight for anyone outside of the Government, they make nominal Charge.\n\nIn reference to an explanation for $1.50 added to Blanket, I have to say that I had the Merchant call me up when they were packing the Goods, I found everything all right excepting the Blanket, I thought that I should send a heavier pair to the Teacher and when I objected The Leader man said if you give $1.50 extra I will give you a Blanket that we are retailing at $10.00 I found it was a 7lb White Woolen Blanket well worth the Difference and I told him I would take it. If the Department objects to pay the extra $1.50 I will make it good myself to the Leader, Send him his Cheque less this amount and I will explain to him the reason of the shortage.\n\nHoping this explanation is satisfactory and that Cheque will be forwarded at once,\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ.

Bennett, Insp.\nOttawa, September 15th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Goulais Bay Indian Day School, has drawn attention to the condition of the building and to the repairs required, as follows:\n\n1. In building this school tongued and grooved clapboard was not used. Plain board overlapped was used. The whole building outside (every board) needs repainting. They are loosening and allowing the wind to get in.\n\n2. The front steps are broken. I saw three little lads climbing into school on hands and knees. This is too much 8 times a day.\n\n3. The whole interior walls are most forbidding. Muresco needed in classroom and paper in other rooms.\n\n4. The woodshed needs to be properly enclosed, quite a few side boards are off.\n\n5. The school needs rebanking badly.\n\n6. There is no cupboard or shelves to keep books and equipment.\n\n7. School should have proper locks and key left in responsible hands.\n\n8. Toilets in poor condition. Carpenter needed.\n\n9. Towelling, soap, pail, drinking cups, looking glass needed.\n\n10. Fifteen combs needed badly.\n\n11. Dutch cleanser needed to clean up utensils, etc.\n\nYou should arrange to have the repairs enumerated by the Inspector carried out and the building placed in a good state of repair before the extreme cold weather sets in.\n\nThe boards on the outside of the building should be nailed where required.\n\nThe front steps should be repaired.\n\nA. H. McNabb, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6135, File 396-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nThe interior walls of the classroom should receive one coat of muresco.\n\nThe woodshed should be repaired and the school building banked.\n\nA cupboard should be placed in the schoolroom in which to store books and other equipment, and proper locks with keys should be placed on the doors.\n\nThe repairs required to the toilets should be carried out.\n\nAny other work besides that enumerated above which you consider necessary should be done. It will be necessary for you to engage the services of a competent man to carry out the repairs required to this building. The Department will reply on you to see that the work required is carried out as inexpensively as possible. You should arrange for the purchase of any material required. It will, no doubt, be necessary for you to proceed to Goulais Bay to make arrangements for the carrying out of these repairs.\n\nYou should purchase and have delivered for the use of the schoolroom 6 yards towelling, 12 cakes laundry soap, 1 galvanized water pail, 4 drinking cups, 1 looking glass, 15 steel combs and 4 tins Dutch Cleanser.\n\nWhen all the repairs have been completed, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost of any material purchased, as well as vouchers, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the labour employed, and also for the supplies which you are authorized to purchase.\n\nThe Inspector states, regarding the school building, that it is hard to understand why it was allowed to practically fall to ruin, and that it is at present the most forbidding appearing school for any teacher to enter. It is considered that you should have reported the condition of this building early in the summer in order that the repairs required could have been carried out before the school re-opened. The Department will expect you to see that both the school building and teacher's living quarters are repaired and that the supplies which you are authorized to purchase are ordered at an early date and forwarded to the teacher.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear as to what arrangements you are making to carry out the above instructions, and the date you consider the same will be completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Marie,\nOnt.\nEXTRACT FROM INSPECTOR'S REPORT ON GOULAIS BAY SCHOOL.\n\nMAY 18, 1925.\n\nThe interior of building is positively dirty looking. The walls of classroom need to be washed and then murseco or something applied. Woodwork needs painting. Floor needs treatment. The teacher's living room and bed room need papering in the worst way. The bricks on the chimney are falling and need to be fixed as soon as possible.\n\nThe school roof is in urgent need of repairs also the woodshed. All buildings in fact need repairing.\n\nCarpet or something should be supplied for the bedroom 10' by 7'.\n\nFloor oil cloth is needed 10' 5\" by 10'.\n\nThe mattress and bed springs are needed badly; the teacher complains of them being most uncomfortable.\n\nTeacher's desk is falling apart. The desks and chair are needed as soon as possible. There are only two chairs in the whole building and would grace a miner's shack.\n\nMiss Peltier deserves credit for working under conditions in Goulais Bay that were as I supposed remedied last fall.\n\nIn case Mr. McNabb is not well enough to attend to the reconditioning of this school, can it be done some other way?\n\nClassroom desks are needed badly.\n\nJ. M. Bennett,\nInsp.\nOttawa, June 1, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Goulais Bay Indian Day School, has again drawn attention to the condition of the school building and classroom. In this connection I wish to refer you to official letters of September 15, 1924, and April 8, 1925, regarding this matter. You have failed to take any action and the Department must now insist that steps be taken by you during the coming summer to have the building repaired and placed in good condition. You should arrange to have the following work carried out:\n\n1. The walls of the classroom should be thoroughly cleaned and then murocoided.\n\n2. The woodwork should be painted and the floor should be thoroughly cleaned and then painted or oiled.\n\n3. The teacher's living room and bedroom should be repapered.\n\n4. The chimney should be repaired, as a number of the bricks have fallen off.\n\n5. The roof of the school building is in need of some repairs and also the woodshed.\n\nThe Inspector states that a rug and oilcloth are required by the teacher for her bedroom and living room, also that a new mattress and bed springs are required.\n\nThe Inspector further states that a new desk and chair are required for the use of the teacher and some chairs for the living quarters.\n\nPlease report as soon as possible whether you can arrange to have the buildings at this school placed in a good state of repair and cleaned, also if you can attend to the purchasing of a teacher's desk, chair and other furnishings mentioned. The Department will expect to hear from you at an early date as to what action you intend taking in having this work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA.

It is for supplies furnished for the use of the Goulais Bay Indian Day School. If you consider this account is in order, you should attach it to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and return it to the Department for payment. I may say, however, that this account should be in duplicate.\n\nWe note that payment has been made in the past for coal oil and matches supplied. We do not furnish these supplies for the use of teachers, and, after the end of the present school year, it is expected that the teachers will purchase articles of this nature themselves without expense to the Department.

Retint walls and ceiling, and repaint with two coats all doors, and windows, and wainscoting. Floors two coats of oil.\n\nRepaper ceiling and walls of living-room and bedroom.\nRepaint doors, windows, etc.\nRepair chimney. Put on new roof on woodshed, and replace four lights of glass, for the sum of Two Hundred and Ninety Dollars ($290.00).\n\nI further more agree to repaint outside of school-house with two coats of paint, for the sum of One Hundred and Seventy-five dollars ($175.00).\nPut on new shingle roof with British Columbia shingles, for the sum of Two hundred and forty dollars ($240.00).\n\nHoping to be favored with your contract, which will receive my careful attention, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have to say that I interviewed 3 different firms of painters and only one of them Mr Smit would go to the expense of going to look at the job. I told them the day I was going up there and that I would have a boat to meet them and take them across to the Mission. Mr Smit went with me and we looked over the building very carefully and I find that the outside as well as the inside needs painting. I find also that the building needs a new roof, there is no use in patching up the roof as it is no good. I had Mr Smit submit me figures on the roof also painting the outside of the School.\n\nI inclose his figures for the different parts, the figures may look big to you but we have to take into consideration the expense of getting the material on the ground. Mr Smit has done work for the Department hereto fore and he gave good satisfaction, and I would recommend that he be given the contract, as I am certain that we cannot get the work done any cheaper.\n\nAwaiting your further instructions,\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.

Marie, giving an estimate of the repairs, cleaning, painting and papering required to place the Goulais Bay Indian Day School and teacher's quarters in good condition.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, while the figures quoted appear high, the Department will approve of certain of the work being carried out during the coming summer holidays. You may arrange with Mr. Smit to repair all broken plaster in the schoolroom, living room and bedroom, retint walls and ceiling and repaint with two coats all doors, windows and wainscoting and give the floors two coats of oil; also to repaper ceiling and walls of the living room and bedroom and repaint doors, windows, etc. Also repair chimney, put on new roof on woodshed and replace 4 lights of glass. The cost of this should not exceed the estimate mentioned in Mr. Smit's letter, viz: $290. The Department will also approve of the roof being reshingled with a good grade of British Columbia shingles. The cost of this work, including material, should not exceed the sum of $240.\n\nThe painting of the outside of the school house will, owing to lack of funds and the cost of the other repairs, have to stand over until next year. The Department is not prepared to authorize any expenditure at the present time in painting the outside of this building.\n\nYou should arrange to visit this school and inspect the work before it is completed and see that it is being satisfactorily done, also that a good grade of material is being used. The Department will leave the repairs and shingling in your hands to see that the work is done during the summer holidays, and that it is finished in a satisfactory manner.\n\nWhen the work is completed, you should forward separate vouchers, in duplicate, stating therein the work carried out to the inside of the building, and a separate voucher, in duplicate, covering the cost of the shingles and labour in putting them on. It is understood that the above authorized amounts cover the cost of all materials, labour and freight charges.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA.

I would like to point out that there is only enough seating accommodation for 16 children at the desks, and it is necessary for the remainder to sit on boxes, with either boxes or a small table for writing desks, this tends to make the discipline a little lax. I do not think that the Department knows of the shortage of desks at this school, as I understand that there was more desks when the School Inspector made his visit last year, these have been broken and have not been repaired, parts of these are outside the school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n(Sgd.) F. A. Sampson,\ni/c Sault Ste. Marie Detachment.\nOttawa, June 8th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nIn a report received by the Department from the R.C.M.P. Officer commanding Western Ontario district, who visited Goulais Bay, he states that at present there are 25 children attending this school regularly. He also states that, as there are only 25 children of school age on the Reserve, and as there is seating accommodation for but 16 children, it is necessary for the remainder to sit on boxes, and recommends that desks be supplied.\n\nI have to request that you will state, if possible, the name of the manufacturer of the desks at present in use in this school, as it is necessary, if new desks are supplied, that they be of the same type in order to have uniformity in the seating arrangements. You should also state the number of new desks that should be furnished and the sizes required. For your information I may say that desks are manufactured in the following sizes:\n\n- No. 2 - Pupils 15-18 Yrs.,\n- No. 3 - 11-14 Yrs.,\n- No. 4 - 10-13 Yrs.,\n- No. 5 - 7-9 Yrs.,\n- No. 6 - 5-7 Yrs.\n\nWhen we have the information as asked for above, also full shipping directions, consideration will then be given to placing an order for the number required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

While there I made an inspection of the school building and find it in need of some repairs. Some of the plaster is off the ceiling, the walls are very smoky, and the outside is badly in need of paint.\n\nIn reference to your letter No. 13-4-5 of June 8th last re desks for school, I find that 6 single desks #4 and 6 single desks #5 will be sufficient, the Firm's name does not appear on the desks. The desks will have to be shipped to the Soo, and reshipped to Goulais.\n\nIn connection with the wood for the Goulais school I made arrangements with Joe John to cut 10 double cords of hardwood at $7.50 per cord and several cords kindling, he being the only bidder.\n\nI am going to Batchawana next week and will report on the school on my return. I have not as yet received from the Department any instructions re repairs to the Garden River R.C. school (my letter of June 21st last) as the holiday season is getting along, action should be taken at once.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant.\n\nJ.D.

Marie) would be prohibitive.\n\nIndian Agent, teacher and inspector discussed the situation and the teacher is willing to return to Goulais Bay a little earlier (after the summer holidays) and do the work herself.\n\nThe Agent and I agree that a reasonable business proposition would be for the Department to make the teacher a grant of, say, twenty or twenty-five dollars to have the work done. She would be expected to supply the material and pay for any assistance necessary.\n\nThe teacher would be willing to accept the arrangement, and such is strongly recommended as the most satisfactory arrangement possible.\n\nThe teacher's cutlery seems to have been badly abused in past years. It is suggested that the Agent be asked to consider replacing it.\n| DATE | AMOUNT |\n|------|--------|\n|      |        |\n\nAuthorized by Dept. letter No. 134 dated May 16/31\n\nJune 4 Supplies for Goulais Bay Indian School. 1.15\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nAgent\n\nFORM No. 189\n\nIndian Affairs.

Greening regarding his visit to the Goula\u00efs Bay Indian Day School on May 21, 1932.\n\nOriginal on File 13-4-6.\n\nParticularly meritorious is the work that has been done with the children in sewing and darning, and knitting will be taken up if materials are supplied. Unfortunately, however, there is little being done for the boys outside of purely academic work. There should be a school garden. While the Agent agrees, he is rather afraid to incur any expenditure in this connection. I, personally, think that one of the most valuable things we can teach is the desire and ability to be self-supporting, and as a means to this end, the study of agriculture has a very definitely high value in Indian Day Schools. If the Department agrees, perhaps Mr. Agent Sims might be encouraged to provide some suitable land for a school garden.\n\nI have instructed Miss Duff to requisition for some dozen or so thimbles, some knitting needles and wool for knitting and some mending yarn for darning. If the Department could, in addition, supply some material, say some flannel, for making up into undergarments, I am sure good use would be made of it.\n**INDIAN TRUST FUND**\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nTo: Michael Andrews, Goulais Bay, Ont.\n\n| DATE | AMOUNT |\n|------|--------|\n|      |        |\n\nAuthorized by Dept. letter No.: dated:\n\nJuly 29\n\nRepairing chimney, cleaning yard etc., Goulais Bay Indian School.\n\n6.00\n\n---\n\nTRIPPLICATE FOR FILE\n\nVoucher in duplicate detached for Accountant to pay.\n\n---\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nAgent\n\nFORM No. 109\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

In my opinion, a hole should be cut in the ceiling of the kitchen and a second hole cut in the brick chimney and the stove pipe run into it, as, at present, the pipe is led through a high attic-like space. It was in this space that the fire broke out this winter. The space cannot be reached except by breaking in through the roof. A change in the system of stove pipes is, I believe, imperative and the Agent has taken the matter in hand.\n\nThe stove at present in use in the kitchen is entirely worn out. The oven is practically useless. Even when efforts are made to protect the food (in the oven) with sheets of tin, ashes will still fall on it. Moreover, it is most uneconomical in regard to fuel. Miss Duff kept a careful record of wood burnt this past winter and, although eggs froze in the kitchen, the kitchen stove used up twice as much fuel as did the stove in the schoolroom.\n\nThe saving in fuel would more than pay for a new stove in a couple of years and a new stove would permit of more comfort for the teacher.\nOttawa, June 5, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Goulais Bay Indian Day School, states that the school building narrowly escaped being burned during the past winter, as a result of the poor system of stove pipes. He states that, in his opinion, a hole should be cut in the ceiling of the kitchen and in the brick chimney and the stove pipe run into it, as, at present, the pipe is led through a high attic-like space. The Inspector also states that you have taken the matter in hand. The Department considers that it would be advisable, during the coming summer, to have the alteration made, in order to prevent any danger from fire. This matter will be left in your hands, to have the work done at the lowest possible expense.\n\nThe Inspector also drew attention to the condition of the stove at present in use in the kitchen, which, he states, is entirely worn out and most uneconomical in regard to the amount of fuel consumed. Please inform the Department regarding the urgency for supplying a new stove for kitchen use, and give an estimate of the cost. Our funds this year are extremely limited, and unless you consider the supplying of a new stove to be urgent, favourable consideration could not be given to authorizing the expenditure. When you estimate of the cost is received, the matter of the purchase of a new stove will be given consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. H. Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie,\nOnt.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nSault Ste Marie, Ont.\nJune 29, 1933.\n\nSir;\n\nRegarding a cook stove for the Goulais Bay Indian School as per your letter No. 13-4-5 Of the 5th instant, I beg to say that I have secured prices and the most suitable stove for the school would cost $51.75 plus freight to Goulais Bay. It is the same make of stove that was purchased for the Batchewana school in 1930 which has given splendid satisfaction.\n\nAs stated by Inspector Greening the old stove is practically worthless, and I would strongly recommend that a new one be purchased.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir\nyour obedient servant.\n\nG. H. Smith\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 5, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, giving an estimate of the cost of a cook stove for use at the Goulais Bay Indian Day School. In this connection it is noted that the old stove at present in use is beyond repair.\n\nIn view of your recommendation, that a new stove be supplied, I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase, from a firm on the list to receive consideration, of a stove. This should be of a type which you consider satisfactory. The total cost, including freight to Goulais Bay, should be kept within the sum of $60.\n\nI enclose encumbrance certificate authorizing an expenditure to the above amount. Please obtain an account, in triplicate, covering the cost of the stove, and receipts covering the freight charges. These accounts, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. You should state on each copy of the voucher that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E.R. No. 742.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H.

The result is that we are to have a well drilled on the school property.\n\nThe point is the Indians think that the well is for their use too. They would use this privilege as an alibi to hang around the school premises any time of the night or day as time is no object to an Indian. This state of affairs would not assure the teacher's safety especially when they have been inbibing too freely.\n\nKnowing the Indians as I do the use of the pump by them would not favour the teacher's protection as regards sanitation.\n\nThen too they are very destructive and the pump would not last long if they were let use it.\n\nI would be very grateful to you Mr. McGoogan if you could arrange to have a notice put up that the pump is for the school only.\n\nThanking you I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Teacher)\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\nTo Greenwood Electric & Hardware,\nB.E.

In ordering textbooks only those authorized in this list should be requested.\n\nTo avoid delay teachers should give full particulars regarding each article required.\n\nThe name, series, number of grade, and name of author and publisher of all books required should be given as fully as possible.\n\nWhen ordering kindergarten material, the catalogue number of some well known firm should be given for each article required.\n\nOnly one item should be specified on each line of the requisition and no entry should be made under heading \"No. Authorized.\"\n\n| ARTICLES                        | No. ON HAND | DATE OF LAST RECEIPT | No. REQUIRED | No. AUTHORIZED | REMARKS                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|---------------------------------|-------------|----------------------|--------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dipper                          |             |                      |              |                | Last year the boys did some fairly creditable work with only Jack knives and coping saws.

The cupboard in the classroom is to provide storage facilities for books and classroom equipment, while the cupboard she requires in her living quarters is to provide storage space for her groceries, vegetables, etc.\n\nI would ask that you report regarding the cost of building two inexpensive cupboards which would be adequate to serve the purposes for which they are required. It is considered that if the material was supplied a competent Indian could build the cupboards. I should be pleased to have your report regarding the cost involved in supplying the cupboards.\n\nMiss Cazaly also requested that a small plot of ground be fenced next Spring for garden plots to be conducted by the pupils. I should like to have your views regarding this request, together with an estimate of the cost of the material and labour in fencing a sufficient quantity of ground for gardening purposes. You should also state if you consider that it would be advisable for the pupils to carry on gardening operations at this school next year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L.

I beg to say that the two cupboards required for school would cost approximately $47.00, for lumber, hardware, labour and freight.\n\nRegarding garden plots, I may say that I do not believe it would be advisable to incur this expenditure owing to the fact that the land is very light and sandy and would require considerable fertilizer to get even a small crop.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\nyour obedient servant.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.F.

The cost of these should not exceed $47.00 and, if possible, a saving should be effected.\n\nIn view of the information contained in the last paragraph of your letter, no action need be taken at the present time in connection with the proposed garden plots.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

W. J. GREENING,\nSEPARATE SCHOOL INSPECTOR, ON HIS INSPECTION OF\nTHE GOULAIS BAY INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\n- Original on No. 13-4-6. -\n\nThe school is a very isolated one, so that the teacher has little company but her own. Under these circumstances, the surroundings should be as cheerful as possible. It would be hard to find a school residence much more the reverse. The walls are dark in colour, and the woodwork painted in a very dark gray. The furniture looks as if its one reason for being purchased was its cheapness and unsuitability for anything else. It is cumbrous and cumbersome, dark and ugly.\n\nThe work that has always been the rule at this school since I have known it is the more remarkable in view of the living quarters provided.\n\nBecause of the financial stringency, I have refrained from bringing the matter to attention before, but would now strongly urge that the kitchen be painted in bright shades, (at least three coats will be necessary), and that a cheap \"Breakfast Room\" set of modern furniture be provided; the present furniture might be given to some of the Indians on the Reserve (if they will take it) or used for firewood.\n\nA set of furniture as recommended is not very costly. I discussed the matter with Mr. Agent Sims and he would furnish estimates.\nOttawa, January 11, 1937.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nInspector Greening's report regarding his inspection of the Goulais Bay Indian Day School has just reached the Department, and he considers that some new furniture should be supplied for the teacher's living quarters. Please let me know the approximate cost of the furniture that you consider necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG. H. Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste.

The roof is leaking in many places and needs reshingling and the outside of the school needs repainting as the paint is all worn off. The work should be done this coming Summer if at all possible.\n\nThe cost of these repairs would be approximately as follows:\n\n**ROOF**\n- Shingles, etc. $100.00\n- Labour 75.00\n\n**PAINTING**\n- Paint 50.00\n- Labour 75.00\n\nTotal - $300.00\n\nI omitted to put this amount in the estimates for this year as I did not at that time realize the school needed these repairs so badly.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.P.G.

However, I am inclined to feel that we will at least be able to handle the repairs to the roof. Early in May you should forward a requisition for the quantity of shingles and other material required in order that purchase may be made through our Purchasing Branch.

The quotation for paint was obtained from Greenwood Electric & Hardware, Sault Ste. Marie, and that on shingles from Beaver Lumber Co. Ltd., Sault Ste. Marie.\n\nSince my last visit to this school, the plaster on the ceiling of the kitchen has fallen down. The remainder of the plaster should be removed from the ceiling and plaster board substituted. It would require 160 sq. ft. of Plaster Board, three strips 1\" x 2\" x 12', and 60 ft. of Moulding to do this job. The cost of this extra material would be $8.00. In addition, the Siding on the walls should all be re-nailed as most of it has sprung.\n\nMr. McDonald states that to reshingle the roof, repair the kitchen ceiling, repaint the school, and renaill the Siding would take him 24 days, @ $6.00 per day.\n\nIn my last letter I omitted shingle nails and flashing for the roof. This material would cost as follows:\n\n| Item                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total   |\n|-----------------------|----------|------------|---------|\n| 36 lbs.

Original on 240777/4.\n\nThe teacher's quarters here are not fit for anyone to live in, though your humble servant has done so for 2 winters - was free from rheumatism and neuralgia when first took up my quarters here, now, I am a victim of both (a living barometer) did not affect me any till this last 5 or 6 months. It was a common thing to find the bed covering around where I breathed all night to be stiffened up in the morning with frost almost icicles. I fear my eyes shall, later on, feel the effects of it, as there were mornings I could scarcely open them they were so frozen together. Ottawa is like California compared with this country. Sincerely hope the Department will have the building fitted up more comfortably before another sets in as no one can live in it as it is. At the end of March, 1913, & made known to the Department the condition of the building thinking they would fit it up at once but they payed no attention whatever.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMiss Kehoe, teacher of the Goulais Bay School, states that some repairs are necessary to the teacher's residence.

She also states that screened approaches should be built to the closets.\n\nKindly submit an estimate of the cost of making the above improvements. You might also state what it would cost to renovate the inside of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA.D. McNabb, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste Marie, Ont.\nGaulais River, Ont. June 19/17.\n\nTo:\nMr. D. McNabb,\nIndian Agent.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe interior of this school needs a general cleaning. The walls are in a very smoky dark condition.\n\nI should think a good whitewash would be most sanitary. The paper on the kitchen has to be removed.\n\nThe cause of so much smoke escaping is, I think, due to the two openings in the floor being opposite each other at times we were obliged to stop work, for we were blind with the smoke. There should be a new floor or an opening made in the old one.\n\nMay I ask you for a woodshed and a new closet for teacher's use?\n\nI should prefer the closet to be built behind the woodshed and a door in the woodshed to lead to the closet. The closets for the use of the school-children are not well screened and are too far from the school.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6135, File 396-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nThe school-ground should be fenced also.\n\nPlease place this before the Dept as soon as possible.\n\nAssuming the Renovation will be completed during the holiday.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nAgnes Kelly\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose letter received from Miss X, XXI.\n\nAgnes Kelly, Teacher at the Coulais Bay school, in reference to repairs to School and Grounds.\n\nThis School being so far from the Sault and being so very difficult to get there it is almost impossible for me to get a close estimate of the cost of the repairs required.\n\nWoodshed would cost considerable more to build there than at the Sault as the cost of transporting the material would be a big factor. I think that $250.00 would do all the repairing and also buy a Cook stove for the Teacher. When Miss O'Connor was buying a Cookstove she bought an Oil Burner and it is simply useless.\n\nThere is also a Well required at this School. In my estimation $250.00 ought to finance the whole repairs.\n\nAwaiting your instructions in this matter.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ. D. McLean Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nOttawa, August 14, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo enclosing a communication from Miss Agnes Kelly, teacher of the Goulais Bay School, in reference to repairs to the school and grounds.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may expend a sum not exceeding $160.00 in the erection of a woodshed and closet for the teacher's use and in repairing and cleaning the school.\n\nYou may purchase a small cook stove for the teacher's use. In a requisition for supplies for this school the teacher asks to be furnished with linoleum for her bedroom. She gives the size of the piece required as 10\u00bd' by 7 1/8'. You may purchase the linoleum asked for by the teacher.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to authorize the digging of a well for this school at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

McNeill\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe following is my requisition list for school and appointments. I shall forward the list of books soon as I have the pupils classified. I must say the school and appointments were in a terrible condition when I arrived. I think it must have been open for things are not very inviting for any teacher to begin with; there is no bedclothing whatever, save a pair of blankets which will require covering; therefore, at an early date as possible forward one mattress, one comforter, p. of double blankets (one).\n4 pillow cases and one bed spread also 2 pans for baking layer cakes, 1 white table cloth for table 4 ft by 3 ft \u00bd dy each of spoons, knives and forks, one alarm clock, \u00bd dy. each of plates cups and saucers also 1 sugar bowl cream jug, butter dish and spoon holder, 1 cake plate. The ceiling and wall of school and 2 rooms will require whitewash. Windows will be nicely. The school room is about 20 ft square and the apartment about 20 x 12 ft. You can send enough for both places. 4 towels as well, 1 iron handle. 12 dy. dish towels, 2 hand towels, waste paper basket also table cloth for the floor of one room about 10 ft by 8. It will be impossible for me to get along, if the above is not\nhad in the near future.\n\nI purchased matches and coal-oil at store, had it charged to the school, so I forget to ask you about it. Have you let me know how much I would get a month, should I do the caretaking myself?\n\nAnd obliged,\n\nYours respectfully,\nAngela Jane [signature]\n\nP.S.\nKindly forward 2 boxes chalk, also clothes line with this order.\nSir,\u2014\nI beg to inclose letter received from Miss Angela Tomes, Teacher at the Goulais Bay School with a list of supplies required by her.

You may purchase the quantity of murescod required and two brushes for putting the same on the walls.\n\nBefore making the purchase of the above supplies, it will be necessary to obtain competitive prices, and the articles should be procured from the firm quoting the lowest price. While it is our desire to have serviceable goods supplied, they should be obtained as cheaply as possible and no undue expenditure incurred.\n\nYou will be good enough to have these goods bought as soon as possible, in order that the teacher can be made comfortable. Please have certified vouchers forwarded, covering the expenditure, accompanied by a memo showing the names of the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted.\n\nThe teacher states that she has purchased some supplies, such as coal oil, matches, etc. You will kindly obtain accounts for these purchases, certify and forward them to the Department for payment.\n\nIf Miss Toner will attend to the work of caretaking at this school, she will be allowed payment at the rate of $25 per annum, which will be paid quarterly on receipt of properly certified vouchers from you covering the amount due each quarter at the above rate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Will you kindly state whether these have yet been supplied by you or not.\n\nMr. J. M. Bennett, Separate School Inspector, states that the locks on the doors of the school and residence need repairing also that the wood shed leaks and destroys the value of the wood for fuel. He states that most of the hardwood is outside and that there is absolutely no kindling wood. He says further that the front door steps of the school have fallen away and are unsafe and that the foundation of the school on one side needs attention.\n\nI have to request that, besides purchasing the articles which you were authorized in the above mentioned letter, you will arrange to have the repairs made to the locks and the wood shed repaired in order to prevent leakage. You may arrange with an Indian to have the wood split to the proper stove size and have it stored in the wood shed. You should also arrange for the purchase and delivery of the quantity of kindling wood necessary and have it stored with the other wood. Will you also have the steps at the front of the school repaired and the foundation on one side properly banked. The Inspector states it is urgent that the above repairs be carried out and that the articles asked for by the teacher be supplied as soon as possible.\n\nThe Inspector further states that a cupboard is needed in the classroom in order to preserve the equipment and books. You should, if possible, arrange with a competent man to build a suitable cupboard in one corner of the room and have it fitted with a lock.\n\nWe are anxious to have this school and teacher's residence made as comfortable as possible before the cold weather sets in, and I have to request that you will give all the above repairs your immediate attention and also purchase and have delivered the articles which you were authorized to supply. No undue expenditure should be incurred. You will please have properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, forwarded, covering all the above purchases and repairs.\n\nThe Inspector states that the teacher is capable and earnest and that the attendance is good.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you at an early date as to the action taken regarding the above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The teacher arrived to find the living quarters\nin a most forbidding condition. The mattress on the bed\nwas not at all suitable. There wasn't a towel, or bed sheets,\nor pillow cases.

I feel that an Indian agent should at\nleast investigate & prepare for the opening school.\nWord for the Batterwood school teachers living quarters was\nmost attractive & dinner etc all clean, neat & in place,\nbecause Miss Peltier had seen it & left it in\nresponsible hands.\n\nThe Toulais Bay school hasn't proper locks. The\nreport will give you an idea of what is needed to be done.\nMiss Peltier told me she would have returned to\nBatterwood if there was a boat when she saw its conditions.\nI don't blame her. However I feel that she can see that\nthis place is put in proper shape if the Department will\nAs what it is done.\n\nThere is no suitable wood for the kitchen stove. There is only 1/2 cord of dry hardwood for the box stove.\n\nI trust that you will look into the matter of making necessary repairs and in making the living quarters of the teacher habitable, comfortable and attractive. This is a place difficult to reach or return from and the pupil attend well. The teacher deserves good living conditions.\n\nIn conclusion I would like to know whether or not you wish me to visit this school twice or once a year or whether only once in two years as I have done. Notice the travelling expenses in forming your decision. I reach it by any other means than I did means at least for 5 school days lost for two teachers. The cost is about the least I can get anyone to go for. Is it prohibitive? Sir Batchwood\n\nTravelling expenses also.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. M. Bennett\nOttawa, September 15th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Goulais Bay Indian Day School, has drawn attention to the condition of the school building and teacher's living quarters. It would appear that Miss Theror left the school and living quarters and furnishings of same in a very unsatisfactory condition, and that certain repairs and furnishings are urgently required. He recommends that the following be supplied for the use of the teacher's living quarters:\n\n- 1 New Mattress,\n- 1 Bed Spring,\n- 1 Can Enamel for Bed,\n- 4 Sheets,\n- 2 Pillow Cases,\n- Towelling,\n- 1 Bed Spread,\n- Oilcloth for Bedrooms (8'x10', 10'x11'),\n- 11 Yds. Table Oilcloth, 48\" wide,\n- New Window Blinds,\n- Clothes Line,\n- Water Pail,\n- Teapot,\n- 6 Bars Laundry Soap,\n- Potato Pot,\n- Double Boiler,\n- Bread Pan,\n- Sauce Pans.\n\nThe chimney also requires to be cleaned. There was no kindling wood and no wood small or short enough to use in the kitchen stove. The kitchen stove is in a dilapidated condition and a new stove is required.\n\nI have to request that you will arrange to have the supplies mentioned above purchased and forwarded to the teacher. Competitive prices should if possible be obtained. While serviceable articles should be purchased it is not intended that any expensive supplies be furnished. A good quality of oilcloth should be supplied. If considered necessary, you may purchase a stove for the kitchen. You should also arrange to have the chimney cleaned.\n\nIt would appear that certain supplies which were furnished for the use of the teacher's living quarters in the fall of 1922 have disappeared. It is considered that Miss Theror was very remiss in her duties by not seeing that the furnishings were in proper order, the living quarters in a cleanly condition and the building securely fastened and the key placed in the hands of a reliable person.\n\nD.

Tomorrow I have a meeting in reference to the Indian Strip, Saturday is a poor day to go, on Monday I have election for Chief and 2 councilmen on Tuesday and Wednesday is our Fall Fair, on Thursday I am submitting the Surrender for the Strip so that it will be the week after next before I get up there.\n\nI had the School Banked and the Steps fixed last year, I do not agree with the Inspector that the building is in a dilapidated condition or it must have deteriorated very much since July last. I believe in having the Teachers comfortable but some of them are very unreasonable and very hard to please, however I will get everything repaired.\n\nIn the matter of a Stove I may say that there are so many residents of this City putting in Gas Stoves that I can buy a nearly new stove only used a month or so much cheaper than a new one. Kindly give me your views on this matter. I will postpone my Holidays again until I get the Schools in shape.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

If you don't do this then hardwood floor should be put in.\n\n3. A teacher chair will cost $1.90. She needs a chair to sit on surely.\n\n4. That old Heat Picture mentioned can be sent to Mr. Mahon & he will frame it for $2.00.\nNotes on Goulais Bay.\n\nPlease note my report well.\n\n1. More desks (5) as needed.

McBurney\nAgent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, January 12, 1924.\n\nSir,-\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 7th instant, I beg to say that, as you are aware, the Department allows the Hiawatha School an annual grant of $300.00. Previously the Department paid this grant in four instalments of $75.00, each, at the end of each quarter.\n\nThere are ten teaching months in the school year and we consider the academic year to begin September 1st and end June 30th.\n\nCommencing September 1, 1923, the Department is paying all day schools on the ten months basis and, therefore, the Hiawatha school was paid $30.00 at the end of September and will be paid $90.00 at the end of each of the other three quarters in the school year. In other words for the school year 1923-24, they will receive $300.00, which is the same amount as has been allowed them previously.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

The Agent states that although the existing building is old it could be put in repair at a small cost and that their present council house is a good building, two stories high, 30 by 25 feet, the ground floor of which is rented to School Section No. 11 of the township of Otomabee.\n\nThe Rice Lake Indian school was lately closed and the children are attending the white school held in the council house, and when a definite arrangement is made with the Public School Trustees there will be no need to re-open the Indianschool.\n\nThe capital of this band amounts to only $21,000 and I do not think that there is any need to spend any of it for the above purpose. It would appear to me that it more a matter of rivalry between the Mud and Rice Lake bands than any practical benefit it would be to the Indians.\n\nOn No. 1 of this file Mr Agent McFarlane writes under date of the 3rd instant that the Trustees of School Section No. 11 wish the Department to contribute $100 a year towards the salary of their teacher in lieu of a per capita grant of 25 cents a month for every Indian pupil in attendance.\nThe Hiawatha, or Rice Lake school, was one of those taken over by the Department from the Methodist Missionary Society last July and closed in consequence of the arrangement made with the white school, and I think it would be better to accede to the Trustees' demand and contribute $100 annually towards their teacher's salary, than to re-open their school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The result of this is that the school section has made no levy for school purposes for several years. I would respectfully suggest that the continuance of the grant at its present rate be made conditional on some decided improvement being made in the school premises. I refer to the building. The grounds have been improved some and a half acre for garden has been added.\n\nSgd. Richard Lees,\nInsp.\nOttawa, June 14, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to call your attention to official letter of the 12th of March, last, in which you were asked to furnish a rough sketch showing how you would propose to enlarge the Hiawatha Day School, which is at present overcrowded. The Department would like you to furnish this information at once, as any improvements should be made during the summer holidays.\n\nYou will also be good enough to call the attention of the white trustees of this school to the fact that they have made no levy for school purposes for several years and if the Department is to continue the present grant the school board will be expected to provide accommodation for the pupils in attendance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

As you were informed in official letter of the 14th instant, no levy has been made for school purposes by the white trustees for several years and it is time that they should do so and make the building meet the Ontario school requirements as to accommodation, etc., for the number of children enrolled.

If the trustees were to refuse to grant the proviso the Department would either have to back down or to incur greater expense in providing another school for the Indians.\n\nThe Department understands that the legislative and municipal grants are paid to the school boards on the warrant of the Inspector and presumes that this warrant is given only when the conduct and equipment of the school is satisfactory. If these grants have been withheld it would appear to be sufficient to induce the trustees to meet the requirements of the school. If conditions are not such as call for the withholding of these grants the Department would not appear to have very substantial grounds for making its grant conditional on certain improvements. In any event it appears to the Department that if the equipment, accommodation, etc., is not satisfactory that it should be remedied at the instance\n\nR. Lees, Esq.,\nPublic School Inspector,\nPeterborough, Ont.\nof the educational authorities of the Province rather than at the instance of the Department. I would be glad to have your views as to the position taken by the Department in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to official letter No. 184237/6 dated June 24th, 1916, and also of the 16th inst., regarding the enlarging of the Hiawatha school house. I was to say that one of the trustees is quite anxious to have the improvement made, but is quite opposed to it, and the other is indifferent. I don't think there is any prospect of it being done. There are two wealthy old farmers in the section who are very much opposed to spending any money on the school and they rule the whole section pretty much. They have no children attending and they are too close fisted that they would not give anything to the patriotic fund. They are such determined old farmers that I really believe they would spend a thousand dollars on a lawsuit rather than be driven to it.\n\nThe reason I have delayed so long in answering was that the trustee who is favourable to the improvement has been urging me to delay my report in the hope that he could prevail on the others to consent.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nR.

Dept. of Education.)\n\nThere are fifteen Indian and eleven white children on the roll. The size of school room is 24 by 20 by 10 = 4800 cubic feet, number of pupils it should accommodate 4800 \u00f7 250 = 19. This is a very poor school, too small, no room for more seats. The school board should be notified that the school is too small for the number of pupils. The teacher has to put two children in single seats.\n\nThey have no well, have to get water from a farm.\n\nThe school garden was not planted this year on account of the wet weather. There should have been a drain across the wet side. They had the tile there last year, but one of the trustees borrowed them and did not return them.\n\nThe garden consists of one acre, which is entirely too much for such a small school. Half of it should be seeded down to Grims alfalfa as a demonstration of what good hay alfalfa makes.\n\nI would recommend that the money the Dept. pay the section for maintaining the garden, be withheld until the school board drain the land so the it can be planted.\nAug. 8th, 1916.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have before me two communications from the Dept. in regard to my report on the Hiawatha School. They bear No. 154237-6 and dates June 13th and July 6th.\n\nIn connection with the question of a grant to the school, permit me to call attention to a few facts.\n\n1. The grant from the Dept. of Indian Affairs was increased a few years ago from $150 to $300. In regard to that increase I was not consulted and do not know by what influence it was secured, but I do know that it was never merited. It was chiefly in consideration of that increase that I have been urging that the trustees should do something in return in the way of improved accommodation.\n\n2. As you are probably aware, the school, like every other public school derives a revenue of $300 from the township, a part of which is contributed by that section as this is raised by a uniform levy over the whole township. Other schools have to supplement this by, at least, as much more, but this school, owing to the generosity of the Dept. of Indian Affairs, has had to levy no section tax since the \"Indian Grant\" was increased.\n\n3. Until the present year, when the provincial grant was\nincreased owing to a change in the basis of distribution, it has been quite small compared with the grant from your department. This year it will amount to about $160. You will therefore see that up till now, at least, the withholding of this grant would not have had any great influence on the section.\n\n4. Then there is another consideration. Were this school for the white children of the section only, I should not be disposed to make much objection to the accommodations. But what do the trustees get the special \"Indian Grant\" for? Is it simply to purchase the privilege of sitting in the school and sharing in the instruction given the other children? I would suppose that when they are given a grant as large as is being paid this school, they would be expected to furnish something extra in the way of accommodation or instruction for the Indian children.\n\nIn my opinion, they ought to be made to understand definitely that unless they do something the grant will be cut down to say what it formerly was. If kept posted as to what is being done, I am perfectly willing to co-operate with the Department in any effort that may be made to bring pressure on the trustees to induce them to do what is right. I am of opinion that there is little fear of their severing their connection with the Dept. if they are dealt with reasonably.\n\nI have the honour to be Respectfully yours,\n\nRichard Lee.\nOttawa, August 16th, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of June 24th, last, in regard to enlarging the Hiawatha school, I beg to say that you should again interview the school trustees and point out to them the Department's desires in this matter.\n\nYou may, also, inform them that, unless they make the necessary improvements to the building, the Department will reduce its grant from the present amount, $300 a year to the previous amount, $150.00, a year.\n\nThe Department wishes to express the hope, however, that the trustees will feel disposed to act reasonably in this matter and that it will not be necessary to reduce the grant.\n\nKindly give this matter your immediate attention and inform the Department, at an early date, of the trustees' decision.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ.

The Department considers that it would be advisable to allow them a reasonable time to carry out their promises.\n\nI have to thank you for the interest you have taken in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

It was understood a year ago that some effort would be made to improve it but no action has yet been taken. I met the trustees and ratepayers a year ago and discussed the matter. The prevailing opinion then seemed to be that some improvement should be made and I was practically assured that it would be. The necessity is urgent now.\n\nIn consequence of failure to provide suitable accommodation the grants due the section under the Ontario Public Schools Act for 1917, amounting to about $147.00 are withheld. Similar pressure on the part of the Department of Indian Affairs might help.\n\nDate of Inspection, April 16th and June 7th.\nJune 14th, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to refer you to your letter of September 28th, 1916, in which you informed the Department that the trustees had decided to enlarge the Hiawatha school not later than the spring of 1917.\n\nApparently, nothing has been done as a report just received from Inspector Lees shows that the school is not in good shape.\n\nYou will be good enough to take this matter up at once and inform the trustees that a new building is an absolute necessity.\n\nThe Department will expect to hear from you in the near future as to what action you and the trustees have taken.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR.J. McCamue, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nKeene, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to File No. 154237-6 dated the 14th June, regarding the improvements to be made on the Hiawatha School building - Rice Lake Reserve. I say that owing to the difficulty in getting a contractor to undertake the job, the trustees of this school did not get the improvements made to the building they had intended in the spring of 1917 and since then they seem unwilling to lay this matter over till after the war. They are however doing some repairs now which will make it fairly comfortable in the mean time until such times as they get the permanent improvements made.\n\nI wish to say further regarding the matter in hand, that I have been cautious lest I should create a prejudice, but there is the children in attendance are Indians and the prospects are that there will be a gradual decrease in the white attendance for several years at least - and if I were too insistent, the Whites might feel...\nSir,\n\nThat they were building for the Indians, the trustees admit that the improvements are very necessary and that they must be made. They have always provided excellent teachers which is, after all, of great importance. In view of these facts and also of the fact that the initial move\u2014so far as pressure is concerned\u2014should come from the less the trustees do not think it wise to be too insistent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is frame about 13 years old but was never good. Some minor repairs were made recently but no amount of repairs can make a satisfactory school house of it. Now, that the conditions are becoming settled again, an effort should be made to reach an understanding between the Department and the section so as to secure a new and suitable building.\n\nDate of Inspection.\u2014May 23rd, 1919.\nOttawa, June 9, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Lee, in his recent report on the Hiawatha School, states that the building is poor and that some minor repairs were made recently, but no amount of repairs can make a satisfactory school-house of it.\n\nIn this connection I beg to refer you to your letter of the 27th of August last, in which you stated that, owing to the difficulty in getting a contractor to undertake the job, the trustees of this school did not get the improvements made to the building they had intended in the spring of 1917. Kindly advise the Department whether the trustees intend to make the improvements to this building during this summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J. McCamus, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKeene, Ont.\nOttawa, November 3, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Lee visited the Hiawatha School on the 12th ultimo and again points out that the building is still in need of repair, and also that an unqualified teacher is at present in charge of this school.\n\nThe Department has written you on several occasions within the last four years regarding the necessity of improving the school building at this point and you have frequently stated that it was the intention of the Trustees to do something in this regard. Apparently nothing has yet been done. The Department understands that the Inspector does not intend to issue an order for the Legislative grant to this school until something is done in the way of improving conditions.\n\nThe Department trusts that the Trustees will take immediate action and you will be good enough to point out to them that unless this is done this Department will also be obliged to consider withholding its grant.\n\nYou will be good enough to advise the Department of the decision of the Trustees as soon as you have laid the matter before them.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6136, File 398-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nIn reply to official letter of the Department No. 264235-5 dated the 3rd of November and also of a later date. Regarding the complaint of Mr. Inspector Lee that the Shiweta school was out of repair and an unqualified teacher employed I beg to say that the school house needs painting on the outside and the out buildings are in need of some slight repairs otherwise the building as it stands is in fairly good repair. The trustees engaged a man to do the work this last spring but he disappointed them. They fully intend having it done next spring. The school is warm and comfortable and quite large enough for the number of scholars in the section.\n\nI must say Mr. Lee is a hard man to understand. In 1876 he complained about the school being too small, not air space enough. I submitted a plan to enlarge namely to cut an opening in the south end 16' wide to build and addition 16'x14' taken down the clock records and put them in the south end of the new part and also move the stove into the new part. The Department approved of this and did act.\nSir,\n\nThe trustees but Mr. Lee would have none of it; he wanted the school enlarged and all the windows placed in the south. Again in 1918 after a good deal of persuasion I succeeded in getting the trustees to agree to this plan, which was to take off the roof, take out the west-side and add 16'x20' put on a cottage roof have the entrance in the east with all the windows in the south. We arranged a meeting at the school hall. Mr. Lee down showed him our plans but Mr. Lee said the school house was large enough, all he suspected at that time was that it be painted and a new system of ventilation put in. I explained to him the present system and in a few days after he wrote the trustees to say that the system of ventilation was all right that he had not understood it.\n\nAs for the other part of Mr. Lee's complaint the employing of an unqualified teacher, it must be borne in mind that it is not always an easy matter to procure a qualified teacher for the Hiawatha school owing to there being Indian children in attendance even were there an abundance of them, the great majority of teachers now available are young girls, and they shy off from an\nSir,\n\nIndian school. Certainly all the teachers we have had have enjoyed the work very much after they got to know the people.\n\nThe trustees always advertised and last midsummer they received two applications which they accepted in turn but the applicants took other schools.\n\nMiss Kylie our present teacher is teaching on a permit but I have no hesitation in saying that she is doing the best work of any teacher we have had since the late Miss Throop resigned in 1916. Miss Throop taught the school for several years and she was acknowledged to be one of the very best teachers in the county. Miss Kylie's manner and methods are very much like Miss Throop's. She is quite capable and her discipline I might say is perfect. Every child of school age on the reserve is in attendance and the parents well satisfied with her progress.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nIndian Affairs.

I was in error on the price as it was only $175.00.

This would seem to warrant the conclusion that the grant from the Department of Indian Affairs should be increased. In this connection it ought to be borne in mind that under the school laws and regulations of Ontario the school is at present securing a township grant of $600, and legislative grant of fifteen $500. If this is not done, then with the grant from the Dept. of Indian Affairs more than meets the cost for maintenance, so that no local school tax has been levied for some years.

It was never a good building. An unsuccessful effort was made some years ago to secure a better building, but the trustees made some repairs and improvements a few years ago that have greatly benefited the building.\n\nThe other buildings are poor.\n\nThe ground is only four acres. Some time ago half an acre was obtained adjoining the school grounds for a garden. It was too large and went to waste being merely a waste at present. At any rate, what I was assured that it was the intention of the trustees to remove the fence between them adding them to the grounds, clean it up and make it suitable for play ground. This will be a great improvement, I cannot say.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS\n\nUnder this heading the Inspector should report upon the general management of the school and offer any suggestions for improvement he may wish to make.\n\nI consider this school very efficient and all the indications were that the present teacher will fulfill our anticipations in standards.\n514 Gilmore St.,\nPeterborough, Ont., Nov. 7th, 1924.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Dr.\n\nTo Richard Lee,\n\nSept. 25.

Some minor repairs are now again necessary.\n\nThe grounds are not very satisfactory being too low. Some years ago half an acre was purchased adjoining the school yard for a garden. It proved too large and part of it remained unused after a few vain efforts to cultivate it. The weeds were allowed to grow. Now the best part has been made into a school garden of suitable size and I understand that it is the intention of the trustees to use the remainder and add it to the school grounds.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS\n\nUnder this heading the Inspector should report upon the general management of the school and offer any suggestions for improvement he may wish to make.\n\nAt present the teaching and internal management of the school are good.

We paid a visit to your office but were unable to return at a time when you might be in. I shall try to call more conveniently to you soon.\n\nYours most sincerely,\n\nC.A.F.

Adams, I visited this school on Tuesday, November 28.\n\nAs photographs later will show it is a small old-type building with windows on both sides. It is heated by a stove. Surprisingly it is well lighted electrically and has toilets of the type which we are putting into our latest schools. The desks are very much the worse for wear and tear and there are not enough of them. There is a piano but no radio or phonograph or electric visual aid apparatus.\n\nThe present teacher is Mr. Fred Plato. He has an Interim First Class Certificate and this is his first appointment. His salary is $1,900.\n\nThe school is under the management of the school board for Otonabee Township, the secretary being Mrs. Ralph Godfrey, R.R. No. 2, Keene, Ontario.\n\nThe Ontario School Inspector is Mr. K.O. Birkin, M.A., B. Paed., Court House, Peterborough, Ontario.\n\nThis school is the only one which is not included in the larger area for administrative and taxation purposes, although it is visited by the Manual Training instructor, Mr. McCall, on Tuesday afternoons between recess and dismissal.\nThe Branch has been paying a fixed sum per annum in respect of the Indian pupils but the sum is not adjusted on the basis of attendance as is done elsewhere. There is also some doubt as to what the school board should provide to the pupils. In the matter of text books, etc., the teacher reports that pupils have had to buy their own although the Ontario Department of Education has a system for providing these at the public expense. The Chief, however, suggests that any increase in the grant made by our Department would be attended by a reduction in \"the grant from Toronto\".\n\nIt seems appropriate that we should now attempt to improve the educational facilities provided for the Indian children at this school and I have drafted letters to initiate investigation.\n\nC.A.F.

We shall have better teachers and a better school. It will cost more as far as the Branch is concerned but will be worth it. There is no need to send supplies to these children, they come from the school area and are included in our per pupil cost.\n\nThere were thirteen Indian children present and they were making quite good progress. The comparison with the other children was favourable.\n\nN.B.\u2014ONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM TEACHER\n\nI.A. 401\n\n(Use reverse if necessary\u2014This end to be the top)\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Collins of Parry Sound and Mr. Indian Agent Daly visited the Department today. The Department has decided to allow a grant of $550.00 per academic year towards the current expenses of conducting this school. Will you please inform me to whom our grant should be paid and indicate to the official trustee that our cheques will go forward once every quarter, if returns showing the attendance and the days taught, are forwarded to Mr. Indian Agent Daly. This grant will be allowed from the first of the current academic year. The school will be recognized by this Department as a combined separate and Indian day school. I regret that the Department cannot assist in the matter of capital expenditure. I may add that we have promised to honour requisitions for texts, scribblers and similar classroom supplies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN,\nAust. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. H.

Black, who is secretary of this combined school, have been very satisfactory, and Johnson the teacher has been retained for the present term because of his satisfactory service there.

On reviewing it our officials found that none of the children mentioned on the list had Indian status. As a result, we wrote Reverend Father J.S.

The fine beautiful weather is too much for the Indian blood. There is no municipal organization of any kind here and they live as free and easy as any in remote sections of New Ontario.\n\nORDER, CLEANLINESS AND DISCIPLINE\n\nPUNCTUALITY... is good.\n\nCLASS ORGANIZATION... satisfactory.\n\nPRESERVATION AND ARRANGEMENT of Furniture... very little in the room.\n\nCARE OF MATERIAL... good.

Front door is off the hinges.\n\nCeiling of school yet to be put up.\n\nAll the work now done... (Carpentering etc.) was gratis. They deserve credit for that.\n\nThe building is the property of the trustees of #1 Baxter.\n\nBlack flies & mosquitoes entered and school had to be closed one day.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS\n\nUnder this heading the Inspector should report upon the general management of the school and offer any suggestions for improvement he may wish to make.\n\n1. Build a cupboard & look it to keep supplies safe over the summer.\n\n2. This is no place for a girl to teach... Try and engage a male teacher & he can live with caretaker of the tourists hotel at Honey Harbour, 1 mile away.\n\n3. The text books & supplies now in use were supplied by the Indian Dept.\n\nI recommend that ten double desks be furnished by the Dept., if 20 single ones could not be sent. They are certainly Indians. One half glance is sufficient & if these Indians are non-treaty than they should never have been allowed to become such to be a charge on a community for they will pay nothing to the support of this school and the Government grant of $525 will not pay teachers salary.\n\n4. Would the Indian Dept please send a Duplicate of this to Mr. Begley (see address on front) & delete what you don't want to send them.\n\nIndian Affairs.

MacKenzie.\n\n---\n\n\"Mrs. King in Kaboni School cannot teach beyond the Third Reader. As you know she is an educated Indian. She has been doing pretty good, but Kaboni has had able teachers and some white teacher should be here for many reasons.\n\nDon't you think that all these schools on this reserve should have white teachers? I am certain that many would like to come to these except Buzwah, as no proper house is there.\"\nOTTAWA, Sept. 17th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nComplaints have reached the Department regarding the lack of interest taken by you in the work of the schools in your Agency and the delay in carrying out instructions in attending to matters in connection with the schools, also to the delay in forwarding teachers' returns and requisitions and in forwarding them cheques for salaries, etc., received by you.\n\nIn this connection, I have to draw your attention to the importance of dealing promptly with all instructions received, and in assisting the teachers in every way that you can in their work, and, at all times, to use your best endeavours to persuade the Indian parents to send their children regularly to school. All requests made to you by the teachers should receive sympathetic consideration and be dealt with promptly. The conditions under which the teachers carry on work at these schools are, at the best, uncongenial, and it is desired that every assistance be given in order to ameliorate conditions in the performance of their duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

King, teacher\nExperience - 9 years\nSalary $500.00\nSatisfactory teacher is known to Mr. Lewis.\n\nThis is one of the best built and equipped day schools. I feel that an effort should be made to have some good teacher here. There are many English speaking girls that would be only too pleased to take this school. Mrs. King is all right for a school like Buzwah or South Bay but not for this school. She is not capable for work of the fourth class or Standard V. I would like the Department to try and keep this school in good hands.\n\nJ. M. Bennett, Insp.\nOTTAWA, Sept. 16th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Bennett, Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Kaboni Indian Day School states that it would be advisable to obtain the services of a qualified teacher for this school. He further states that while Mrs. King, the present teacher, is teaching fairly well, yet, she cannot teach beyond the Third Reader, and he considers that an effort should be made to secure a good teacher for this school. He states that Mrs. King would be satisfactory as a teacher for a school like Buzwah or South Bay, but not for this school.\n\nI will be pleased to have your opinion as to whether it would not be possible to transfer Mrs. King to Buzwah and obtain the services of a properly qualified teacher for Kaboni. If you can obtain the services of a qualified teacher it might be possible for you to arrange for the transfer of Mrs. King to Buzwah.\n\nI will be pleased to have your report regarding this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Addy of\nBuckingham, Que. for a position as teacher in an Indian\nSchool. She has a Model School Diploma with eight years\nexperience during which time she received the Government\ngrant twice for successful teaching.\n\nI quite understand that Mrs. King is not capable\nof teaching beyond the Third Reader, but at the time her\nservices were secured it was difficult to get a teacher\nfor this school and it was thought by the Rev. Father Artus,\nMissionary in charge, that she could teach successfully in\nthis school for one year, but as Mr. Bennett reports her\nteaching is not satisfactory as there are pupils too far\nadvanced for her education.\n\nI would most respectfully recommend that the\nservices of a qualified teacher be obtained to take charge\nof this school in place of Mrs. King in order that the\npupils may receive justice, but Mrs. King cannot be\ntransferred to Buzwah or South Bay schools as both schools\nhave better qualified teachers than Mrs. King.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOTTAWA, Oct. 5th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, regarding the appointment of a teacher for the Kaboni Indian Day School to succeed the present teacher, Mrs. King, whose services are reported to be unsatisfactory.\n\nIn reply I beg to say regarding the application which you received from Miss L. Addy, of Buckingham, P.Q., that she applied for the position as teacher of the Sagamook Indian Day School in August last and accepted the position. Later she stated that it was impossible for her to accept, and the Department, therefore, does not consider that her services would be available. However, you may communicate with her, and if she is in a position to accept, the Department would approve of her appointment. If she accepts, you should then inform Mrs. King that her services are not further required. Until such time as a qualified teacher can be secured, Mrs. King may remain as teacher in order that the school will not be closed.\n\nThe Department has no teacher in view, and if you can arrange with Miss Addy, or another qualified teacher, you may do so, but before making any appointment other than that of Miss Addy, whose qualifications the Department is already aware of, you should forward full particulars regarding the qualifications and experience which any other teacher whom you may secure possesses.\n\nYou should give this matter your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.

The present teacher, Mrs. King, is being retired at the end of the present month, January 31st, and, if you will accept the position, we would like you to be at Kaboni and ready to take up duties on the 1st of February, next.\n\nThe salary allowed will be at the rate of $650 per annum, plus the bonus provided by law, which, for the present fiscal year ending March 31st, next, is at the rate of $15.00 per month. Living quarters are provided in the school building.\n\nKaboni is on Manitoulin Island. The route from Ottawa is by the Soo line (C.P.R.) to Sudbury, thence by the Algoma Eastern Railway to Little Current.\n\nI will be pleased to hear from you upon receipt of this letter as to whether you will be prepared to accept the position or not, and, if so, whether you can begin duties on the 1st of February, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Addy, Buckingham, P.Q., and offered her the position as teacher to begin duties on the 1st of February, next. No reply has been received from Miss Addy and it has, therefore, been decided to retain Mrs. King's services for the balance of the present school year, viz: June 30th, next.\n\nIt is hoped that Mrs. King will consent to remain in order that the school will not be closed for want of a teacher, as we have no other teacher in view at the present time. You should take this matter up with Mrs. King and ascertain whether she will remain until the above date, after which time her services will not be required, and inform the Department of her decision. We will not attempt to obtain another teacher for this school until after the holidays next summer, unless Mrs. King decides to retire before June 30th, next. It is considered that her services will be quite satisfactory until that time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nfor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nR. J.

S. King to any other than the person holding the proper order to receive the same, or into Court, or I will be liable to repay it in case the Court or Judge so order.\n\nIt appears that Mrs. King, teacher at the Kaboni School, received goods from the J.C. Irving & Co. store to the amount of $165.70, and Mr. Irving has taken action to recover this amount.\n\nWould the Department kindly advise me if I should hand Mrs. King her salary cheques?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, 28th April, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th instant, No.1-36, with reference to the garnishee proceedings in Irving vs. King, and note your enquiry as to what you should do with Mrs. King's cheque.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you should notify Mr. Irving that these proceedings are irregular, because he cannot garnishee the Crown, and that if he does not withdraw them he will be liable for costs. If nothing is done by him toward the withdrawal of the suit, you should attend court in pursuance of your summons and ask the Judge on the instructions of the Department to have the garnishee proceedings dismissed with costs against Mr. Irving. In the meantime hold the cheque.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR.J.

I might say that as a teacher she has given great satisfaction, being well liked by the pupils, and also advancing them greatly in their studies.\n\nI would most respectfully recommend that the services of Miss Lavallee be secured to take charge of the Kaboni Day School at the re-opening of the school after the coming summer holidays.\n\nMrs. Chas. S.

The salary allowed her at Kaboni will be at the same rate as she is now being paid as teacher of the South Bay school, viz: $700 per annum, plus any bonus provided by law.\n\nIt is noted that you have informed Mrs. Chas. King, the present teacher of the Kaboni school, that her services will not be required after June 30th, next, the end of the present school year.\n\nBoth Miss Lavallee and Mrs. King should prepare their quarterly returns promptly at the end of the current quarter and forward them through your office in order that payment of salary and bonus due can be made.\n\nIt will be necessary to obtain the services of a qualified teacher to succeed Miss Lavallee at South Bay in time to begin duties when the school re-opens after the summer holidays, next, and you should keep this matter in mind.

The salary allowed will be at the rate of $650 per annum, plus bonus at the rate of $15.00 per month for each teaching month during the next fiscal year, which will end March 31st next. There is a teacher's residence in connection with this school, and it would be necessary, if you accept, that you do your own housekeeping.\n\nWe note by your letter applying for a position as teacher that you have had five years' experience, and hold a First Class Quebec Diploma.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will state as soon as possible whether you will accept the above offer and be prepared to begin duties at South Bay about the 1st of September, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the KABONI School\nMay 23, 1923.\n\nAt Wikwemikongsing must be at least 17 children of school age. Could not something be done for them?\n\nDifference between enrolled attendance and the number that should attend is due to the fact that about 17 live at Wikwemikongsing school too far away to attend. Could not something be done for these? Could a bus service bring them to this school for 6 months in the year? It would be cheaper than to open a school. It would hardly be worth while to open a school. Six months bus hire would only cost $40.00 or so per month. The children would thus learn something. One girl at present is daily walking six miles.\n\n(From Kaboni to Wikwemikongsing is a distance of 5 miles bus line.)\n\nMiss Lavallee cannot do the work she is capable of doing. I would recommend that she take charge of West Bay next year. This item, however, is confidential.\n\nJ. M. Bennett,\nInsp.\nOttawa, June 2nd, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Kaboni Indian Day School, states that there are at least 17 children of school age at Wikwemikongsing who are too far away to attend. He recommends that a bus service be arranged for after the summer holidays to take these children to and from their homes, which would be cheaper than re-opening the Wikwemikongsing school.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will make enquiry regarding the situation mentioned by the Inspector. You should state the number of children of school age at Wikwemikongsing who do not attend school, and you should give your views regarding the suggestion of the Inspector that arrangements be made for a bus service to draw these children to the Kaboni school. You should also state whether it would be possible to arrange with an Indian having the necessary team and rig for the purpose, and the cost per month that would be charged for the service. The Inspector is of the opinion that, if a bus service is installed for a period of, say, 6 months in each year, it would not cost more than approximately $40 per month.\n\nYou will be good enough to give this matter your consideration, and report your opinion to the Department, in order that, if it is decided to arrange for a bus service, the necessary steps can be taken to begin the work on or about the 1st of October, next, or the 1st of September, if you think it should start from this earlier date. Such an arrangement, if carried out, might be the easiest solution of providing educational facilities for the children residing at Wikwemikongsing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

There is an enrolment of about 27 pupils, and besides, living quarters are provided, where a teacher would have to reside and do her own housekeeping. We are of the opinion that Miss Fortin is too young and has not sufficient experience to be appointed teacher of this school.\n\nYou should endeavour to obtain the services of an older teacher having some experience and, if possible, the necessary qualifications.

This teacher had no professional training. I am not so sure that she would do better elsewhere. She will want to be changed. My preference if for Ontario seconds.\n\nMiss Sloan has managed the school as far as I know, in a satisfactory manner. Some Indian women called to visit me with complaints. They want their children to be as well educated as the white children. I told them I admired their ideal but they were told flatly that Indian children hadn't the intelligence or intellectual capacity for a very high standard in Education. I feel that some of these criticisms had better be checked on.\nSir:\n\nI wish to inform you that I resign Kaboni Indian Day school on Manitoulin Island Reserve.\n\nAlma Sloan.\n\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nMay 28th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a copy of a communication from Miss Alma Sloan to the effect that she has resigned her position as teacher of the Kaboni Indian School at the end of the school term, June 30th next, and it is her wish to apply for the position as teacher at the Buzwah Indian School for the next school term.\n\nI would most respectfully recommend that the resignation of Miss Sloan as teacher at the Kaboni School be accepted.\n\nR.

In June I am writing the Lower School examination in Agriculture, and also in Physical Training, hoping to do better work.\n\nI visited the Indian Reserve at Mackay a number of times, and am very much accustomed to the Indians as my father, the late Dr. T.

We are endeavouring to obtain the services of a teacher having a second class certificate, as it is considered this is the minimum qualification which the new teacher secured should possess. Besides, we would not be prepared to pay the salary asked for to a teacher having the qualifications which Miss Pleas possesses.

I know that the discipline problem in the junior room is rather difficult of solution, and I believe that the services of a more experienced teacher are desirable. There is an opening at the Kaboni Indian Day School, on Manitoulin Island. The Department maintains a partly furnished teacher's residence there. The teacher would have to live alone, as the school is 6 miles from the nearest other Indian school and an equal distance from Manitowaning, where the Agent lives. I could offer a salary of $85 per teaching month.\n\nThere is also an opening at the Congo Bridge Indian Day School, 2\u00bd miles from Maniwaki, Que. The teacher would have to live at Maniwaki. The best that I could offer for this school would be what you received last year, viz., $80 per teaching month.\n\nThe Department would be glad to hear from you in the immediate future and would like to have an expression concerning your wishes for the coming academic year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I come to thank once more for your great charity in desiring to yourself me about the teachers.\n\nI am now rejoiced by the hopes of a school in Skegwanish\u2014!!\n\nConcerning Gaboni school, as it is not in my district, I am not able to assist its teachers. For any occasion, I visit the schools every week, and use my utmost energy to stimulate the pupils and facilitate the success of the teachers. Miss Kerr is extremely grateful to you for giving her an opportunity to teach; but as Gaboni school is very isolated and very hard to reach, she would prefer\nWest Bay or Sheguiandah. For an outside teacher, it does not matter so much if she be a few miles further away from home. Could you not give the Colonie or other school to Miss Levallee? The poor girl is hard up, from working for a low salary, in Sudbury. She has faithfully served the Department by successful teaching, during several years. I would like to see her great wish fulfilled by her obtaining a school.\n\nHer trouble at West Bay was due mainly to the construction of the new class-room. The Indians wrongly blaming her for being the cause of the new building, became sore at her, without notice.\n\nHowever, I leave the whole affair to your long experienced wisdom, and assure you again of my very affectionate gratitude for your untiring kindness.\n\nEver more devotedly your obedient servant,\n\nEug.

I thank you for your kind consideration and appreciate your offering me the position at Kaboni.\n\nAt the present time I am not prepared to accept a position as far from the railway as Kaboni is.\n\nYours very truly,\nMary J. Lynch.\nManitowaning Oct.\nDec 1, 1929.\n\nImmediate\n\nDear Mr. [signature],\n\nYou have no doubt by this time received notice of my resignation. I'm awfully sorry it went through so soon, because conditions have changed since and I would now be able to keep on. Let me tell you the reason why I had given up, when the cold weather came on, and we had to have fires on. I tried to get a man to look after the furnace for me, well no one would take it saying that there wasn't enough pay in it, then it was left to me to do, and the results were that it took me right down again and I knew I could not keep it up. We have no shed no place to put the wood here, it is left outside in the snow and rain, and\nfew times, I had to bring in that heavy wood for the furnace myself. I am chronically affected & cannot do heavy work of any kind.\n\nI get no help whatever from the agent; it is now pretty cold and our storm windows are not on yet, there is also a window-pane broken and that is not fixed neither, it is a month since, I go to the office every week about it but nothing is done, the last time I mentioned it, I was told that Mr. Lewis was so awfully busy had a thousand things to do etc., but they would see that everything was fixed, that was as far as it went. These are the reasons why I had to give up, but since the Indians heard that I was leaving several came and asked me if I wouldn't stay, that they would see to the furnace, wood and etc., a young man has been\ncoming ever since and looks after the fire.\n\nNow Mr. MacKenzie if it isn't too late and you have not yet appointed another teacher, I beg of you to let me stay on till the end of the term. I love teaching and would like to remain on the staff.\n\nI am\n\nVery Truly yours,\n\nPriscilla Lavallee\nOttawa, December 5th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nThe department has received a communication from Miss Priscilla Lavallee, teacher of the Kaboni Indian Day School, withdrawing her resignation as teacher and requesting that her services be continued for the balance of the present school year. The Department is informing Miss Lavallee that it will approve of her remaining as teacher until the end of June next. She states the reason she forwarded her resignation in the first instance was because of the difficulty in obtaining the services of a man to look after the furnace and to bring in the fuel required. She states that she has now been able to arrange with the Indians to see that they will attend to the furnace and fuel.\n\nMiss Lavallee states that the storm windows are not yet on and that there is also a window pane broken. I have to request that you will at once arrange to have the storm windows put on and any broken panes of glass repaired. You will also be good enough to arrange to have any other repairs that may be required carried out in order to make conditions as comfortable as possible for the teacher during the present winter.\n\nThe question of the erection of a woodshed in which to store the fuel for the use of this school should be brought to the attention of the department early next Spring, at which time you should furnish full particulars as to the size and type of shed required, the cost of the materials and the labour in erecting same.\n\nMiss Lavallee has been informed of the department's approval for her to continue teaching until the end of June, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

We are informing Mr. Agent Lewis of the withdrawal of your resignation and the authority granted you to continue as teacher until the above date.

There were only three pupils in the classroom on the morning of my visit.\n\nAn epidemic of measles is prevailing among the children in the section of the Kaboni School. The doctor has placed a ban on all children attending school where there is a case of measles of any member of the family at home, therefore, very few can attend, which accounts for the small attendance. As soon as this epidemic ceases, the attendance will be at normal again.\n\nOn account of the very small attendance, I believe it would be well to close the classroom for a week or so until the majority of the children recover.\nOttawa, September 19, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your report for the current month on the Kaboni Indian Day School informing the Department of the small attendance owing to an epidemic of measles prevailing among the children, I have to say that it is hoped by this time the epidemic is subsiding and that the children will soon be able to resume attendance.\n\nRegarding the closing of the school, I have to say that, if considered advisable by the medical officer and yourself that this school be closed until the majority of the children recover, the Department will approve of the action considered advisable in having the school closed. If the school is closed, the teacher should, when preparing her report at the end of the present month, state definitely the dates between which the school was closed on account of measles.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

In this connection I would refer you to official letter of the 14th instant, informing you of the arrangements that have been made for teaching services at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning,\nOnt.\nDear sir,\n\nLast Spring, the inspector at his visit here, spoke of the closing of the Gaboni school. I come today to ask you the favour not to do it at least this year. After this visit there were 13 children present at school, this proves that there are enough children to keep it open, but the carelessness of the parents is the cause of the lack of attendance. I promise to remember to the parents the threat, because they are very much afraid of losing this school, what would be a very bad thing. It would be to send these children to the old time of wilderness, as none of them could reach the school of Wikwemikong. Spanish? I cannot place even the children of Spanish River Band Sagamok. Here at Wikwemikong I chosed those who are the farthest, and Spanish will not be able to receive half of them, there is no room for them all.\n\nI may say that the teacher of Gaboni have something to do with that lack of interest; so the one of last year, she may have done her best, but as she was sickly, every thing went the same way, and she one day told one Indian: I do not wonder that the children are not interested in such a state of health as I am. I would ask the Department to take the matter into consideration.\nI am told that at Garden River there is good teacher who was teaching at the public school and had to give up the teaching, she wrote to me then last winter, she probably would be glad to have this school of Gaboni.\n\nShall we have the pleasure to have a school soon at Sagamok Spanish River Band. It is too sad to see such a crowd of children deprived of instruction. I am trying to place some at Spanish, but there is vacancy enough for many. All those I want to place are between 9 and 13 years old. 25 at least are of age to go to school.\n\nI wrote to the Department last winter about this school, and I did not receive any answer, did I speak too hard? If so I apologize, because my intention was to impose, but to place the case before the Department, as I know that he is very anxious to see the Indians educated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC. B\u00e9langer, S.J.\nOttawa, July 11, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, regarding the attendance and teaching services at the Kaboni Indian Day School. In reply I have to say that it is not the intention of the Department to close this school for the coming academic year. The Separate School Inspector, who visited this school at the end of May last, reported as follows:\n\n\"I consider Miss McGregor a capable and energetic teacher, and although she seems to have worked hard, the pupils do not appear to have made any considerable progress. This is partly the result of irregular attendance. I cannot convince myself that much interest is taken in the school by either the pupils or their parents, nor do the children appear to evince any great desire to master the English language. It is now easily the poorest Indian day school visited by me and this in spite of the efforts of teachers really desirous of producing results. If Kaboni is kept open, Miss McGregor's re-appointment thereto for the coming school year is recommended.\"\n\nIt would appear that the results obtained at this school are due entirely to the indifference of the parents, who do not see that their children attend regularly. The Department will continue this school for the coming academic year, with Miss McGregor as teacher, and, if the results show that the parents do not take more interest and do not encourage a regular attendance, the question of closing the school at the end of the next academic year will have to receive serious consideration.\n\nMr. Agent Lewis is being written and requested to use every effort to encourage the parents to see that their children attend regularly. It may be necessary to enforce the compulsory clause in the Indian Act to compel a more regular attendance. Judging from the Separate School Inspector's report, Miss McGregor has done her best in her work but is handicapped by the irregular attendance of the pupils. I shall be pleased if you will continue to use your good influence with the parents and encourage them in every way possible to send their children to school regularly.\n\nYou will be written in a separate communication with reference to the school at Sagamook.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nReverend C. Belanger, S. J.,\nWikwemikong, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6137, File 400-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPoor Copy\nOttawa, July 11, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from the Reverend Father Belanger, Wikwemikong, regarding the Kaboni Indian Day School. It appears, from his report and also the report of the Separate School Inspector, that the Indian parents take little or no interest in the school and that their children attend very irregularly. The Inspector states that he considers Miss McGregor a capable and energetic teacher; and, although she appears to have worked hard, the pupils do not seem to have made any considerable progress, which is the result, altogether, of irregular attendance. The Inspector states that neither the pupils nor the parents take much interest in the school. He has recommended, if this school is kept open, that Miss McGregor be re-appointed.\n\nThe Department desires to continue the work at Kaboni and the re-appointment of Miss McGregor for the coming school year is approved. It will be necessary, however, to take some action in forcing the parents to see that their children attend more regularly. When this school re-opens after the holidays, the Department will expect you to see the parents and inform them that they are to send their children to school regularly. If not, it will be necessary to take action under Section 10 of the Regulations.\n\nThe Department will expect to have a report from you, regarding the attendance, at the end of September, next, stating the action taken by yourself in maintaining the same among the children. It is considered that, through the influence of yourself, Father Belanger and the teacher, there is no reason why the children at Kaboni could not take more interest in their work and maintain a regular attendance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

During September there was an enrolment of 15 pupils and an average attendance of almost 16 for the month. So far the teacher, Miss Byrne, does not appear to experience any difficulty in having a satisfactory attendance, and the parents are taking more interest in the school than they have for some time past.\n\nAs Miss Byrne is a capable teacher, and both parents and pupils have confidence in her as a teacher, I believe that the attendance will be more satisfactory during the current academic year than it has for some years past.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 13, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the Kaboni Indian Day School.\n\nIt is noted that the attendance is satisfactory and that the new teacher appears to have the confidence of both pupils and parents.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

There are now 13 from this section attending the Industrial School at Spanish, and the parents would rather have them at home if there was a school for them to attend, as they are all progressive farmers and able to support their children.\n\nImproved land suitable for a school site can be secured from John Kaboni at a reasonable price, also enough ground for a garden in order that the children may be taught gardening, which the Department is desirous of.\n\nIf the Department decides granting those Indians their request, I would most respectfully recommend that it be ready for September quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 17, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant recommending the erection of a school and teacher's residence in the Kaboni Settlement on the unceded portion of Manitoulin Island.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as the Department is unable to find this location on the map, I am sending you, under separate cover, a sheet showing Manitoulin Island and you will be good enough to mark where this settlement is situated.

The purposed site is about three miles from Wikwemikong-sing, and about five miles from Manitowaning, in the Kaboni or Pelletier settlement, where the main roads intersect to Wikwemikongsing, Wikwemikong, South Bay and Manitowaning. At this location is where the Wikwemikongsing school, which was erected a few years ago, should have been built, as it was placed away from where the majority of the pupils live, but I presume to be convenient to the church, at Wikwemikongsing.\n\nAt present the Chief and Secretary of the band is ill, but Joseph Pelletier and John Kaboni, two of the Councillors inform me that the resolution passed at the last council meeting was discussed by the members of the band, and that the cost of erecting a new school was to be chargeable to the funds of the Manitoulin Island Unceded band.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nKaboon Settlement,\nMontwohler, Island.\n30 acres.\n\nBand funds.\nOttawa, April 24, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo in further reference to the proposed erection of a new school and teacher's residence on the Manitoulin Island Unceded reserve in the Kiboni settlement.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that if the Indians are willing to incur the cost of the erection of the building the Department will provide for the salary of the teacher.

It was thought by the Band that a log building, which was purchased from the Roman Catholic Church authorities, could be taken down and moved at a small cost, and would answer the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 14, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant in further reference to the erection of a new school and teacher's residence on the Manitoulin Island Undeded Reserve in the Kaboni settlement.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department agrees with the suggestion of the band that the log building, which was purchased from the Roman Catholic Church authorities, could be used for school purposes at present. If the school proved to be a success the question of erecting a new building could be considered at a later date.

About one-half of the earth has been left on one side and this will crumble and fall down making a great amount of dirt at all times. Besides the space was required for storing away wood for the furnace.\n\nDate of inspection, October, 1916.\nOttawa, November 9, 1916.\n\nSir,-\n\nOn September 25 last you wrote informing the Department that the Kaboni school contract had been completed and that you had issued final certificate which was paid by the Department to the contractor Neil McMartin of Manitowaning on receipt of the certificate.\n\nIt now appears from the report of Inspector Fimm that the building is not completed as the dividing wall in cellar between excavated and unexcavated portion has not been erected, and the earth is crumbling and falling all over the floor of basement. It will be necessary for you to instruct the contractor to have the work completed as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nR. J.

There are two windows in the unexcavated portion which show light across into the furnace room, and by having a centre wall the furnace room would be almost in total darkness as there is only one small window in that portion. If a centre wall was to be erected it would hardly be reasonable to have two windows in the unexcavated portion, where light is not required, and only one small window in the furnace portion.\n\nI might say that occasionally a little earth falls down on the basement floor, but nothing to hurt anything, and it is much better to leave the cellar as it is than to erect a centre wall and shut out the light.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The troughs carried the water from the roof to one corner of the building, and such an amount of water falling in the one place caused a hole to be worn in the ground near the basement which held the water and soaked through into the cellar.\n\nIn order to prevent this it will be necessary to dig a small drain to carry the water away from the pipe which leads to the trough.\n\nThis building is situated on very high ground and has good drainage, and the only possible way of any dampness being in the basement is from the water falling from the roof and soaking through at the corner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndia Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 28, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have acknowledged the receipt of your letter of the 24th instant in regard to the water being in the basement of the Keboni Bay School and stating that, in order to prevent this, it will be necessary to dig a small drain to carry the water away from the pipe which leads to the save trough.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may have a small drain for this purpose dug and some cement should be put where the water drips from the save trough.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

A well should be arranged for. So much water enters the cellar in spring and fall that a spring must be closed. Cellar is very damp. The water is often about 1/2 ft. deep and remains there for days and is very unhealthy.\n\nThe outhouses need attention.\n\nA woodshed is needed.\n\nDate of Inspection, September 9th, 1919.\nOttawa, September 22nd, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nInspector Bennet, who recently visited the Kebeni school, states that a fence is required in order to keep the cattle off the school grounds. On April 23rd, last, you were authorized to have a fence built in accordance with price quoted in your letter of April 10th. Kindly advise why the Department's instructions were not carried out.\n\nThe Inspector also states that a well should be dug and that in spring and fall there is water in the cellar. You will be good enough to furnish an estimate of the cost of digging a well. You might also state what could be done to keep the water out of the cellar, quoting the probable cost of the work that would have to be done.\n\nIt is also reported that the outhouses need attention and that a woodshed is needed.

The fence would have been erected at an earlier date, but on account of it being difficult to secure the posts I had to wait until I could get an Indian to cut them, and they had to be drawn a long distance over a rough road which the Indian was rather slow in doing.\n\nWith regard to a well being drilled at the school, I consider that it will cost $150.00 to complete a well 40 feet deep with a pump.\n\nThere is not any water in the cellar only when barrels are put under the spouts from the eaves troughs to catch the water and the barrels are left to overflow and soak through the foundation. The school is situated on a bank where the drainage has ten feet of a drop.\n\nIn regard to a woodshed being needed, I have the honor to report that there is plenty of room in the basement for wood.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOctober 7, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant in reference to well required at the Kaboni Indian school, and in reply to say that the Department approves of this work being done, the cost not to exceed your estimate of $150.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Ont.\n\nBuilding.-\n\nDoors and windows are in need of repair and to prevent water running into the cellar it will be necessary to bank up with clay all around.\n\nNo woodshed and one is badly needed.\n\nRemarks.-\n\nAlthough this school is new and of a fine appearance there are some things not at all in good condition. The belfrey has never been properly finished and every time that we have rain we are obliged to place pans to catch the water. On the north side the house is settling and this prevents the doors from closing properly. The locks have been broken for over a year or longer.\n\nThere are so many mud holes that it would be necessary to cart about 10 loads of gravel to fill them up. Children have no place to play without getting their feet wet.\n\nRose Fagan,\n\nTeacher.\nOttawa, April 6, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nThe teacher of the Kaboni Indian Day School, in her report for the year ended March 31st, last, states that the doors and windows of the school building are in need of repair and that, in order to prevent water running into the cellar, it will be necessary to bank up with clay all round the building. She also states that the belfry has never been properly finished and every time it rains she is obliged to place pans to catch the water. She states also that the house is settling and this prevents the doors from closing properly, and that the locks have been broken for over a year or longer.\n\nShe also requests that a woodshed be built and states that it is badly needed.\n\nShe states that the grounds are full of mud holes and that it will be necessary to cart ten loads of gravel to fill them up, and that the children have no place to play without getting their feet wet.\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to furnish a report concerning all the above matters and what you would recommend should be done. The cost of the work should be stated in each case. You should furnish a report as soon as possible, as it is considered that, if the conditions to the building are as stated, the necessary repairs should be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nMay 28, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to Official Letter No.19-2-5 of April 6th last, regarding the teacher's report at the Kaboni School in connection with the repairs required to the building, I have the honor to report that I have examined the building and play-ground and find that the doors of the building are in good condition and they close perfectly. Two locks were broken but they are replaced. The windows require repairing which will cost probably $5.00.\n\nWith regard to the belbry I consider that $5.00 will cover the repairs required to prevent it from leaking, and the ground where the children play is unlevel and sticky when it rains. I estimate that it will take 50 loads of gravel which will cost $25.00 to put it in shape.\n\nThere should be plenty of room in the basement under the class-room and residence for wood if the space is not used as a store-room for tables, barrels, etc; therefore, I cannot recommend that a woodshed should be built.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 1, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo regarding the repairs needed to the Kaboni Indian Day School.\n\nIt is noted that the windows require repairing, at a probable cost of about $5.00, and that repairs are needed to the belfry to prevent it from leaking and that the cost of the same will also be about $5.00. You should arrange to have the windows and belfry repaired and the expenditure for having this work done should not exceed your estimate.\n\nYou may also expend a sum not to exceed $25.00 in having the ground round the school building levelled. It is considered that this amount should provide a sufficient quantity of gravel to fill in the mud holes and make the grounds suitable for playgrounds.\n\nYou should give all the above repairs your early attention and have the work completed during the coming summer holidays. Properly certified accounts, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred to the amounts stated above, should be forwarded as soon as the work is completed.\n\nWith reference to the providing of a woodshed, it is considered that, if the basement was cleaned out, there should be sufficient storage room for fuel. You should also arrange to have this done and provide storage accommodation for the wood required.\n\nIt is noted that the two locks which were broken have\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Que.\nhave been replaced and that the doors of the building are in good condition and close properly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. McLean\nAsst.

The forefathers of these worshippers throughout their eventful history had been summoned to battle by similar stirring peals, and all through the history of mankind we find that for the prompt assembling of scattered masses of men at a given point some sonorous, far-reaching sound has been employed. The trumpet that in various forms served well its purpose in the days of yore has bowed to the inevitable march of civilization, and for many generations the universal summoner has been the powerful yet pleasing voicings of large bells of various types.\n\nIt is impossible to justly estimate the actual importance of an acceptable church bell or to appreciate its powers to impress and influence the community upon whose ears its pleadings fall at the stated hours for worship. To the failure to realize its powers of building up and drawing together a congregation, rather than to indifference or parsimony, may be ascribed the absence of a bell from many a sacred edifice where its beneficent powers would quickly be apparent. A live church is of necessity one that asserts itself in a community and constantly keeps before those it seeks to attract, its sacred mission and work. This cannot be more effectually accomplished than by means of a sweet-toned, sonorous, far-reaching voice, with its inestimable powers to remind, invite and recall to a sense of duty the scattered elements of a rural or a city community. Its voice, lifted above all other sounds at the regular recurring seasons for worship, has a drawing power positively magnetic. A church, feeble by reason of its lack of the one thing needful, viz., numbers, never fails to trace a wonderful gain to the erection of a really fine bell, with its hearty summons \"to thee, and thy son and to thy daughter, and to thy stranger that is within thy gates.\" There is in every community an element of indifference on the subject of church-going manifested by a class who offer for their failures to attend the regular means of grace such excuses as: \"Did n't know where your church was or when service began,\" \"Did not know there was a church so near by,\" etc. From this class a lively, pleasing bell entirely removes such pretexts, and in the case of the merely indifferent it constantly wins many an attendant that, without its invitation, would not have entered His courts. All the members of any community have a vital interest in a church bell to herald the various events constantly transpiring in their midst. For the merry wedding peal, for occasions of general rejoicing or national celebrations, for the solemn funeral...\nThe Church Bell and Its Mission\n\nContinued\n\ndirge, or in cases of emergency as an efficient alarm at the outbreak of fire or flood; in brief, the presence of a fine church bell in any community promptly proclaims itself a positive blessing, and to this all of the people heartily say Amen.\n\nThe True Test\n\nThe true test of value of any mechanical device is not to be based upon its first cost, but upon its continued satisfactory performance and durability. The Blymyer Bell is to be so estimated; and although its cost is much below that of copper and tin bells, its performance will be found quite as satisfactory. We desire to emphasize the fact that the Blymyer Bell must be judged solely upon its own merits, and it is not to be confounded with bells of ordinary iron or of various grades of alloy or so-called steel composition, steel amalgam, etc.\n\nRecognizing the fact that all who purchase bells are not expert in looking for points of superiority, we suggest the greatest caution before buying. Too much stress cannot be laid upon this point.\n\nIt will not be hard to find a bell that will at first be satisfactory in price, in tone, or in general looks.\n\nIt will be a comparatively easy task to make a selection from among a lot of cheap and second grade bells, as there is not much to choose from, but it will take careful consideration and discernment to select the best bell from several of apparently equal merit\u2014to find one in which time will develop no faults, flaws or other defects of any kind.\n\nWhat We Guarantee\n\nThe Blymyer Bell is guaranteed to be the very best that capital, skill and experience can produce, and in order to fully satisfy as to its perfect workmanship, perfect construction and ability to make good all we claim for it, we offer it for free trial.\n\nIt has stood the severest tests successfully and we do not hesitate to guarantee it in its entirety, backing the guarantee with our reputation as bell founders of experience and success. There can be no greater surety for its quality.\n\nFinally\n\nAny sum of money, be it large or small, invested in a Blymyer Bell, will give better and more lasting satisfaction than a like amount spent for any other bell. It may not buy so large a bell, but it will insure better quality, richer tone and greater durability\u2014an infinitely better bell in every respect.\n\n---\n\nIn the ancient town of Bruges,\nIn the quaint old Flemish city,\nAs the evening shades descended,\nLow and loud and sweetly blended,\nLow at times and loud at times,\nAnd the jingle of the rhyme,\nHang the beautiful wild chimes\nFrom the belfry in the market\nOf the ancient town of Bruges.\nThen, with deep sonorous clangour,\nCalmly answering their sweet anger,\nWhen the wrangling bells had ended,\nAnd the clock struck the clock eleven,\nAnd, from out the silent heaven,\nSilence on the town descended,\nSilence, silence everywhere,\nOn the earth and in the air,\nSave that footsteps, here and there,\nOf some burgher, home returning,\nBy the street lamps faintly burning,\nFor a moment woke the echoes\nOf the ancient town of Bruges.\n\nBut amid my broken slumbers\nStill I heard those magic numbers,\nAs the low population the flight\nAnd stock mirth of the night,\nTill their chimes, in sweet collision,\nMingled with each wandering vision,\nMingled with the fortune-telling\nGipsy bands of dreams and fancies,\nWhich amid the waste expanses\nOf the silent land of trances\nWe wander slowly dwelling,\nAll else seemed asleep in Bruges,\nIn the quaint old Flemish city.\nAnd I thought how like these chimes\nAre the poet's airy rhymes,\nAll his rhymes and roundelay,\nHis conceits and songs and ditties,\nFrom the belfry of his brain,\nScattered downward, though in vain,\nOn the roofs and stones of cities!\nFor by night the drowsy ear\nUnder its curtains cannot hear,\nBut by day men go their ways,\nHeard not the music they pass,\nBut deeming it no more, alas!\nThan the hollow sound of brass.\nYet perchance a sleepless wight,\nLodging at some humble inn\nIn the narrow lanes of life,\nWhen the dusk and hush of night\nHave put out the loud din\nOf daylight and its toil and strife,\nMay listen with a calm delight\nTo the poet's melodies,\nTill he hears, or dreams he hears,\nIntermingled with the song,\nThoughts that he has cherished long;\nHears, amid the chime and singing\nThe bells of his own village ringing,\nAnd wakes and finds his slumberous eyes\nWet with moist, delicious tears.\n\nThus dreamed I, as by night I lay\nIn Bruges, at the Fleur-de-Ble,\nListening with a wild delight\nTo the chimes that, through the night,\nRang their changes from the belfry\nOf that quaint old Flemish city.\n\n\"Carrillon\"\n\nBlymyer Bells\n\n\"Full of the Ringing Voices\nFull of the Tidal Pulses\nSongs of the Golden Sea\"\n\nTHE metal from which the Blymyer Bell is cast and from which\nis derived its peculiar sweetness of tone and surpassing strength\nis a composition used only by ourselves. This metal consisting\nlargely of an extra quality of fine steel, is the outcome of long years of\nincessant experiment, and is absolutely unlike any other metal used in\nbell founding. Many alloys, amalgams and common iron bells have\nbeen put on the market, but none have proved ideal in tone or dur-\nability.\n\nThe Blymyer Bell not only differs absolutely from all others in its\ncomposition, but equally so in its modeling and proportions, and its\nuniformly fine tone is entirely due to this happy combination of form\nand substance. The Blymyer Bell, as turned out only by the Cincin-\nnati Bell Foundry Co., is unlike any other bell; is indeed, as a matter of\nfact, strictly a class by itself. While the first cost may exceed the cost\nof some others, it is because of the worth, and the worth means long\nlife, future satisfaction and future economy.\n\nThere is nothing more convincing as to the value of BLYMYER\nBELLS than the price for which they sell.\n\nConcerning Prices, Quality, Etc.\n\nThe Blymyer Bell distinctly lays claim to cheapness; to the only\nactual cheapness possible, viz., to the cheapness secured by an article\nwhich for a much lower first cost is in every respect equal to a much\nmore costly one. The Blymyer Bell, while fully equal in tone-sound,\ncarrying power and durability under any and all conditions to copper\nand tin bells of corresponding weight, is sold at very much lower prices,\nand sold, be it remembered, on an absolute guarantee of its satisfactory\nperformance. Elsewhere we discuss at some length the relative merits\nof the Blymyer Bell and those of copper and tin, but we desire to make\none point absolutely clear at the outset, viz., we do not attempt to com-\npete with cast-iron bells under whatever name they may be advertised,\nas we do not make or handle such bells. The Blymyer is giving better\nand more general satisfaction than any of the various makes of costly\ncopper and tin bells, and we offer in support of this sweeping assertion\na vast amount of disinterested testimony. For years past thousands of\nBlymyer Bells from church belfries, schools, fire-engine houses, factories, etc., all over the American Continent, and indeed all over the face of our planet, have been telling their own story, and it is solely to the eloquence of their tongues that we owe the host of testimonials above mentioned.\n\nConcerning Mountings\n\nThe mountings of our bells receive the attention justly due them and they will be found in perfect keeping with the bells they sustain alike in their strength, structural simplicity, neatness of finish and lasting qualities. They are especially designed to permit of their bells being rung with the least possible exertion and to guard against the discordant jarring so constantly encountered. Bells of twenty-four inch diameter and larger have springs attached to the clapper to prevent its resting on the wall of bell after striking, and leathers are attached to the ends of such springs. Bells of thirty-two inch diameter and upward have tolling hammer attached to frame, unless specially ordered without it.\n\nConcerning Dimensions\n\nWe desire to invite especial attention to the all-important features of the size and weight of bells in relation to their tone and sound carrying powers. In the case of all good bells, weight and size mean richness of tone and penetrating power; the larger the bell the more sonorous and pleasant its utterances will be and the further its sound waves will flow. For this reason purchasers should invariably select a large bell, indeed a larger bell than may seem sufficient, and by so doing they will never fail to congratulate themselves upon the satisfactory performance of such an instrument. Mounted as they are there is so little jar or strain incident to the proper ringing of the Blymyer Bell that any ordinary belfry will easily carry our largest sizes. The distance which a bell may be heard depends both on its weight and diameter, and, other features being equal, a bell of a given weight and specified diameter can be heard further than one of equal weight and smaller diameter, and in this respect our bells possess a distinct advantage over all copper and tin bells. The same amount of money will purchase a considerably larger and heavier Blymyer Bell than can be procured of copper and tin, and will consequently secure one vastly superior in volume and quality of tone to such smaller copper and tin bell, at a corresponding cost.\nThe Blymyer vs. Copper and Tin Bells\n\nIT IS an undisputed fact that in the founding of all copper and tin\u2014that is to say, of all so-called bell-metal bells\u2014results are strictly governed by three things, viz., dimensions, quality of metal used, and distribution of said metal. All makers of such bells are practically confined to the use of an identical pattern, and consequently the difference in performance of their bells depends solely upon the proportions of copper and tin used; the finer the metal the better the bell, and of course an inferior bell means simply bad metal in its make-up. The tone power of a bell and the quality of that tone depend upon the grade of metal used, the amount of such metal and the extent of the available resonant surface, the latter of course being dependent upon dimensions. Other features being equal, from the bell with the largest diameter and consequent greatest resonant surface, the deepest, richest and most far reaching tones will be obtained. In the vitally important feature of resonant surface the Blymyer Bell simply distances all others, as our composition permits of greatly increased diameters for bells of corresponding weights, with the great gain of resonant surface accompanying such increase. Take, by way of illustration, a thousand-pound copper and tin bell and a thousand-pound Blymyer Bell; the diameter of the former will be thirty-six or thirty-seven inches, which dimensions, as already stated, are absolutely arbitrary, and must be rigidly adhered to with the best results in view. The latter, namely, the one thousand-pound Blymyer Bell, has a diameter of forty-four inches in place of thirty-six or thirty-seven inches, and consequently furnishes about twenty per cent more of resonant surface, with a consequent tone and power quite beyond the compass of any copper and tin bell of such weight. This single comparison will be found applicable to our entire range of sizes. To the above easily recognizable mechanical advantages must be added the very important one of greatly reduced cost.\n\nI.\n\nHear the sledges with the bells,\u2014\nSilver bells!\nWhat a world of merriment their melody foretells!\nHow they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,\nIn the icy air of night!\nWhile the stars, that over-sprinkle\nAll the heavens, seem to twinkle\nWith a crystalline delight;\nKeeping time, time, time,\nIn a sort of a Runio rhyme,\nTo the tintinnabulation that so musically wells\nFrom the bells, bells, bells, bells,\nBells, bells, bells.\u2014\nFrom the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.\nII.\n\nHear the mellow wedding bells,\u2014\nGolden bells!\nWhat a world of happiness their harmony foretells!\nThrough the balmy air of night\nHow they ring out their delight!\nFrom the molten, golden notes,\nAnd all in tune.\nWhat liquid ditty floats\nTo the turtle dove that listens while she glafts\nOn the moon!\nOh, from out the sounding cells,\nWhat a gush of euphony voluminously wells!\nHow it swells!\nHow it dwells\nOn the future! how it tells\nOf the rapture that impels\nTo the swinging and the ringing\nOf the bells, bells, bells,\nOf the bells, bells, bells, bells.\nBells, bells, bells,\u2014\nTo the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!\n\nWARRANTY\n\nWe absolutely guarantee our bells to be in every particular as described in this catalogue; to be of good tone and satisfactory to the purchaser in every way, and not to break for FIVE YEARS, when being rung to call the prayers or service.

A peal is simply a number of bells of various sizes. As usually understood in this country, it is composed of two, three or four bells, attuned to harmonious intervals, as the first, third, fifth and eighth tones of the scale, as here shown.\n\nThe tones of a peal may, of course, be in any key of the musical scale, and its several members are mounted the same as ordinary church bells, which permits of their being rung in succession or simultaneously, as may be desired.\n\nWe cordially invite correspondence relative to peals, and it will be a pleasure to furnish any desired information with a view to securing the most satisfactory results attainable by their installation. A list of some peals we have furnished will be found on page 26.\nSome Famous \"Blymyer\" Peals\nAnd Where They Are\n\nSalem Ref.

No better evidence could possibly be given of the ability of the \"Blymyer\" Bell to be used generally with other types of church bells. We have installed such bells to be used in conjunction with one or more copper and tin bells and found the bells to be used with one copper and tin bell. In all of these instances, copper and tin bells had been previously purchased, whereas, in each case, we installed \"Blymyer\" Bells to form peals. They are today giving the satisfaction that was demanded of them.\n\nBells\nFor Schools, Factories, Farms, Etc.\n\n| Size in Inches | Diameter | Weight Complete | List Price |\n|----------------|----------|-----------------|------------|\n| 18 inches      |          | 135 lbs.        | $15.00     |\n| 20 \"           |          | 165 \"           | 25.00      |\n| 22 \"           |          | 200 \"           | 25.00      |\n| 24 \"           |          | 240 \"           | 30.00      |\n\nSchool and Factory Bells.\n\n| Size Diameter | Weight Complete | List Price |\n|---------------|-----------------|------------|\n| 18 inches     | 135 lbs.        | $15.00     |\n| 20 \"          | 165 \"           | 25.00      |\n| 22 \"          | 200 \"           | 25.00      |\n| 24 \"          | 240 \"           | 30.00      |\n\nFarm Bells.\n\n| Size Diameter | Weight Complete | List Price |\n|---------------|-----------------|------------|\n| 18 inches     | 110 lbs.        | $10.00     |\n| 20 \"          | 140 \"           | 17.00      |\n| 22 \"          | 175 \"           | 21.00      |\n| 24 \"          | 210 \"           | 25.00      |\nGeneral Information\n\nWe want to impress upon intending bell purchasers the advantage of buying a large bell; not that the small chapel or school should have a 1,500 or 2,000-pound bell, but that the bell selected be the largest the tower will contain, or the largest that can be afforded. A bell is an investment of a lifetime and future requirements should be considered. Satisfaction always results from the installation of a large bell, for the size and weight govern tone, volume of sound and carrying power.\n\nRegarding the carrying power, the impression is rather general that bells can be heard in proportion to their weight, that is, a bell of 1,000 pounds should be heard twice as far as one weighing 500 pounds. This is not possible, simply because the larger bell does not possess anything like twice the resonant surface of the smaller one. A bell with a sharp, shrill and penetrating tone is naturally heard farther in proportion to its weight than the large bell with the full and deep tone. Instances of this occurrence often cause unfavorable comment. The larger bells are admired for their great volume, their deep, dignified and sympathetic tones and the altogether sonorous, mellow and church-like sound.\n\nWhen bells are being tolled or struck while hung stationary, they will not, as a rule, be heard more than one-half as far as when swung. The swinging motion throws the mouth of the bell up at each stroke and the sound is carried off and out as it cannot be from a stationary bell. It also imparts a certain richness to the tone which is entirely lacking in a bell struck while at rest.\n\nThe Belfry\n\nThe belfry should be as open as possible to give full vent to the sound as exposure to rain or snow will not injure the Blymver Bell. It should be carefully ceiled above the bell and floored directly under it, and it is desirable in square belfries which are partially closed to board up the corner angles from floor to ceiling and from window to window. Belfry windows should be as large as possible and should reach from floor to ceiling, indeed the best results are obtainable from the largest possible belfry and one entirely open and unobstructed.\n\nThe belfry floor should be sheathed with tin and kept well painted to protect it from the weather and to exclude rain from the tower below. A good solid floor under the bell and a tight ceiling not more than two or three feet above the mountings are most important features. As a matter of fact the belfry should always be built to suit the bell and not a bell purchased and set up in a close belfry to do itself and its makers seemingly little credit. The bell tower should rise high enough above the highest point of the church roof and when possible above adjacent buildings or trees.\n\nDirections for Raising Bells\n\nIn constructing towers, provision should be made for hoisting the bell into position from the inside, but by the use of a simple tackle, bells may readily be taken in from the outside. (See illustration herewith.) Care should be taken that the hoisting apparatus is amply strong; and the work may be done from within, or in the case of very heavy bells the hoisting rope may be carried to the ground and passed through a fixed pulley when any number of men or a team may be employed. After a bell has been raised to the proper height it is readily drawn into the belfry by means of a small rope or tackle. The frame of mountings should first be placed in its proper position and then the bell with its yoke and springs should be lifted to its place with the wheel on the side opposite...\nto the tolling hammer. The bell should then be swung mouth up and the clapper inserted, care being taken to drive the key well through and the ends opened up so that it cannot work out. The bell should then be rung to test the adjustment of springs and clapper which may have been deranged in transit or in the process of erection. The journals and bolt of clapper should be well oiled at intervals.\n\n**Springs**\n\nSprings are attached to our bells to prevent the clapper from resting on the bell after striking, their duty being to catch the clapper just before it reaches the bell, to permit of a stroke of sufficient force, and then to withdraw it and so prevent its clattering on the bell or any checking of the free vibration of the sound waves. These springs should be most carefully adjusted, as if too near to sides of bell they lack the power to throw the clapper back after its stroke and a second stroke will be the result. If too far from the bell sides they will be too rigid and will prevent the clapper striking with the requisite force. If upon testing the bell the springs be found out of order it should be swung over, mouth up, and held in that position and then by the use of a bar the springs should be forced out or in as required. The springs should not be touched unless obviously necessary as they are most carefully adjusted by us before shipment and they are not liable to derangement en route; if however, they should be bent or twisted they must be made perfectly true before bell is used.\n\n**Attaching Rope**\n\nAfter a bell has been mounted, tested, and the frame properly braced and fastened to belfry floor, it is ready for its operating rope. This should be attached to the wheel by passing it through the hole A, and securing it by means of a knot. Thence it is carried to a point directly under the center at B, and through the sheaves fastened to the floor, as shown in cut. This arrangement prevents the rope being thrown from the wheel should a bell turn completely over in ringing. With the very largest bells the extra friction resulting from the deflection of the rope through these sheaves (B) greatly increases the labor of ringing. In such cases the rope may be carried down through the floor in a straight line as per dotted line C, and the sheaves dispensed with.\n\nFor twenty-four and twenty-six inch bells, use three-eighth inch rope; for twenty-eight, thirty and thirty-two inch, one-half inch rope; for thirty-four, thirty-six, thirty-eight, forty and forty-two inch, five-eighth inch rope; for forty-four, forty-six, forty-eight and fifty inch, three-quarter inch rope, and for fifty-two and fifty-four inch, one-inch rope. The rope should not be larger nor longer than necessary, since increased weight encumbers the free swing of the bell.\n\n**How to Ring a Church Bell**\n\nIn ringing church bells it is customary to swing the bell upward during six or eight strokes until the momentum throws the mouth directly upward, and then, after holding it in this position for several seconds, long enough for the other bells\u2014if there be any others in the vicinity\u2014to ring up and then to repeat this ringing as before, alternating with the other neighboring bells. After ringing a few minutes thus, it is usual to toll the bell either with the clapper or tolling hammer. Tolling with the clapper, while certainly requiring more skill is preferable as it secures a more musical tone than the graver ones awakened by the regular tolling hammer. When using the tolling hammer a short firm blow should be struck and the hammer dropped as quickly as possible as its continued contact with the bell after striking checks the vibration and produces a jarring and unpleasant sound. While the bell is being rung by the main rope, the hammer rope, if not directly under the ringer's eye, should be so secured that it cannot be pulled, as otherwise the hammer might be broken off or the bell dismounted.\n\n**Proper Care of Bells**\n\nThe mountings should be examined occasionally to see if they are in proper condition; all nuts tight; the clapper, springs and leather in good order. When leathers become worn they should be promptly replaced, and if clapper becomes flattened a new one should be supplied. Journal bearings should be kept well oiled, and care taken that no oil, grease or paint fall on the bell as any accumulation of these will impair its performance. A bell may be shifted to a new position when desired by partially unscrewing the nuts and turning it to the desired point. When this is done care must be taken to adjust the springs and clapper precisely at right angles with the yoke and to screw all nuts down firmly, one by one, with a powerful wrench.\n\nThe mountings, and not the bell, should be kept well painted to protect them from rust.\nEndorsements\n\nWe publish in separate form several hundred out of many thousands of letters received by us in testimony to the surpassing excellence of Blymyer Bells.

Mr. John King, an Indian\nresiding in the vicinity of the school has offered\nto paint the walls, steps, porch, outbuildings\nand belfry with three coats of pure white lead\nand oil, the window and door casing, cornice etc.\nto be painted green color, for the sum of $165.00.\nHe is to furnish all paints, brushes, etc.\n\nI would most respectfully recommend that\nMr. King be given the contract of the painting\nof the exterior of the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 12, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, furnishing a report on the repairs and painting required to the Zaboni Indian Bay School, together with an estimate of the cost of having the work done.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange, during the coming summer holidays, to have the walls and ceiling in the building calcimined and the woodwork oiled with raw linseed oil. The plaster should be repaired, where necessary, in the residential portion of the building. The Department will also approve of the painting of the exterior of the building. This will include the outside walls, steps, porch, outbuildings and belfry, which should be covered with three coats of pure white lead and oil - the window and door casings, cornice, etc. to be painted a green colour.\n\nAll the above work should be done by day labour. Please obtain competitive prices and purchase all material needed, such as calcimine, paint, oil, etc. Proper time sheets, in duplicate, should be kept for the labour employed. A supply of these forms is forwarded herewith. It is considered advisable to have the exterior painting of the building carried out by day labour rather than by contract. You may engage Mr. John King to do the work, which should be performed to your satisfaction.\n\nWhen this work has been completed, you will forward properly certified vouchers in duplicate, covering the cost of the material, also time sheets in duplicate, certified by you for the labour employed. A memorandum should be attached, showing the names of the firms asked by you to quote on the paint and other materials and the prices quoted.\n\nRegarding the oil cloth to cover the kitchen floor, I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the quantity required. The cost should not exceed your estimate of approximately $17.00. You will also forward properly certified vouchers in duplicate covering the expenditure for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. J.

It should be large enough to store a supply of furnace wood for a whole winter. It has always been a lady teacher in charge at this school and I find that it is impossible for her to carry on as janitor unless there is a winter's supply of fuel piled in under cover. There is ample room in the basement for a supply for the kitchen stove, but a very small amount or room for furnace wood. The cost of erecting a suitable shed would amount to approximately $200.\n\nI might also say that the furnace in connection with the school building is in bad condition, the brick wall around the furnace will have to be taken down and the furnace removed in order to have the necessary repairs carried out. At present it is inclined to smoke, but if taken out and the necessary repairs made I believe that it would overcome this difficulty, and obviate the purchase of a new furnace.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 19, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, relative to the erection of a woodshed at the Kaboni Indian Day School, and giving an estimate of the cost. In this connection I have to say that, as our funds for the present year are extremely limited, it is considered that the present arrangements for the storing of the wood supplied will have to be continued for next winter. It is regretted there are no funds to erect a woodshed this year.\n\nRelative to the repairs required to the furnace in the school building, you may arrange during the coming summer holidays to have the brick wall around the furnace taken down and any repairs required to the furnace carried out and the brick rebuilt. The Department will expect you to see that no unnecessary expense is incurred in having this furnace placed in good condition.

(RG 10, Volume 6137, File 400-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a requisition by Miss Carmel McGuire for a supply of floor Oil, Bon Ami, Dutch Cleanser and Linoleum for her living quarters at the Kaboni Indian Day School. She is asking for to be furnished with a Football and two Base balls, and a supply of garden seeds.\n\nOil should be furnished for the class-room as it preserves the floor and helps to keep the dust down when sweeping. The kitchen floor has never been covered with linoleum as it is hardwood, but by covering it with an oil cloth, or linoleum, it would curtail labour for the teacher in the way of cleaning.\n\nMiss McGuire thought of planting a flower garden in connection with the school. Her idea is quite in line with school work carried on in the white settlements, but among the Indians during the latter part of June, July and August, in the mid-summer holidays there is not any person to water and look after the flowers and I am afraid her project will not be a success.\n\nThe flag pole rope is worn out and should be replaced by a new one.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 9, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, enclosing a requisition from the teacher of the Kaboni Indian Day School for a supply of floor oil, linoleum, garden seeds, etc.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of 2 gallons oil and 1 quart turpentine for the classroom floors. The floors should first be thoroughly scrubbed and allowed to dry before the oil is applied. This work should be carried out at a time when it would not interfere with the classroom work. You may also purchase the quantity of linoleum required for the kitchen floor.\n\nRegarding the garden seeds, if you consider that arrangements could be made for the proper care of the garden during the summer holidays without any expense to the Department, you may purchase and have delivered to the teacher the quantity of flower seeds asked for. You may also supply a garden rake.\n\nBesides the above authorized supplies, you may also purchase 6 combs and the quantity of rope required for the school flag.\n\nAfter you have obtained the above supplies, you should forward itemized accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nA football and two playground balls will be forwarded to the teacher from here.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.
