There was no time to obtain authority to have repairs made before starting work on it, as the situation is serious. I have employed men to open up the system and make the necessary repairs under the supervision of the school caretaker, who has a thorough knowledge of the layout of the system, as he was present when it was installed.\n\nA further report will be sent later, but I presume the Department will not object to the work being commenced without first obtaining authority. It may be only a day or two's work, but it may be more extensive as it is impossible to locate the stoppage without uncovering the pipes. If near the school, a day or two will suffice, but it may be anywhere within 200 yards where it connects with the City system.\n\nIt is probably caused by roots, as the City of North Vancouver is having similar trouble elsewhere.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB/DH.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6467, file 889-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 10th instant regarding the trouble with the sewage system at Squamish Residential School, I have had this opened up, and it is easy to see the cause of the trouble.\n\nThere are two pipes - one from the girls' side and one from the boys' side - and these are both 6\" in diameter. They are joined to one 4\" pipe, which connects with the sewer. The remarkable thing is that such an error has not caused trouble before.\n\nIt is necessary to renew 130 feet of the four-inch pipe with 6\" vitrified pipe, and I am having this done pending your approval, as it is absolutely necessary and cannot be delayed awaiting authority.\n\nI trust this will be approved, under the circumstances.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nJune 20, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 12th instant with reference to the sewage system at the Squamish residential school.\n\nIt was not found possible to include any specific amount in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at this school. Under these circumstances the Department cannot pay for the expenditure caused by improving the sewage system. This will have to be provided by the school management.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer to my reports of June 10th and 12th regarding the stoppage in the sewage system at Squamish Residential School. After opening it up, we have found it more serious than anticipated, not only was the pipe too small but it was laid in a criminally inefficient manner. Instead of being straight, there were curves around every rock. The joints were not cemented, and the roots have bunched up inside the pipes. The health authorities gave us until today to get the water running, and this was done last evening. Two man-holes have to be built, and 180 feet of pipe renewed.\n\nIt is twelve feet below ground at one end and four feet at the other. On account of wet weather, the trench began to cave in and had to be shored up. I was able to get an expert in this line of work, who is highly recommended by the North Vancouver engineering department - Mr. Piper, who is doing a good job.\n\nNo Indians are available for digging, there is not one able-bodied Indian on the Reserve unemployed, so white men are doing the work. They request some pay as they have now worked during a period of eight days from the 10th to the 17th as follows:\n\n| Name     | Hours | Rate | Total |\n|----------|-------|------|-------|\n| T. Piper | 32    | $60f | $19.20|\n| P. Hanlon| 60    | $45f | $27.00|\n| J. Terillion| 28   | $45f | $12.60|\n| J. Beck  | 36    | $45f | $25.20|\n| M.

In this regard I would refer you to my letter of the 20th instant in which you were informed that the cost of the repairs to the sewage system would have to be paid by the school management.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nF.J.C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n416 Federal Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 20th instant regarding repairs to the sewage system at Squamish Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department does not appear to realize that this work is an emergency. The sewage system was completely blocked up, and the effluvia at the School was not only unpleasant, but a distinct warning, and for the protection of the pupils and staff at the school, something had to be done immediately - otherwise there was grave danger of an epidemic which could easily have had tragic consequences among these small children. The health authorities also notified us that conditions were bad, and with all these warnings we should have found ourselves in an inevitable position with the public and press had an epidemic occurred.\n\nI quite understand that no specific amount in the current year's appropriation was made for repairs at this school, and no request would have been made for any amount. This was something unforeseen, and came as an unpleasant surprise.\n\nI considered it my duty to have the situation remedied immediately as common humanity demanded that it be done. Most of the work is outside the school property, as shown on the attached sketch, and the school authorities say they are quite unable to pay for the work from their grant, which is only sufficient to feed and clothe the children.\n\nI hope the Department will re-consider this matter at as early a date as possible - the workmen are clamouring for their pay. No Indians were available to do the work even if they had been able, but it required an experienced man to construct the manholes and do the necessary pipe work.\n\nAn early reply will be appreciated as it is not pleasant to deal with men who think they are being refused their wages.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(P.J.C. Ball)\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nAIR MAIL\nSir:\n\nre: File No.167-1-5\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 24th ultimo and other correspondence in connection with the repairs to Squamish Residential School sewage, the Department is responsible for this expense and not the school authorities.\n\nI have gone further into the matter, and find that the school formerly had a septic tank, and it is claimed that they never experienced any trouble, but when the Auditorium was built in 1927, the school was connected by the builder of the auditorium with their system, and against the wishes of the school at that time. This accounts for the shoddy work on the pipes where they connected two six-inch pipes with a four-inch main and did not even cement the joints. This was in line with the rest of the work at the Auditorium, but was to be expected when such a person as Andrew Pauli was appointed \"building inspector\". The School authorities are in no way responsible for present conditions, and the liability is entirely that of the Department.\n\nI trust the matter will be immediately reconsidered in the light of this further information, and the labour and material paid for.\n\nIn addition to the previous list of wages earned, as shown in my letter of June 21st, the following additional work has been done, which completes the job:\n\n| Name       | Hours | Rate | Total |\n|------------|-------|------|-------|\n| T. Piper   | 68    | $0.60| $40.80|\n| P. Hanlon  | 74    | $0.52| $38.52|\n| J. Beck    | 63    | $0.57| $28.57|\n| F. Terrillion | 62 | $0.52| $32.12|\n| M. Goumain | 72    | $0.40| $28.40|\n\nI wish to point out that I wrote you on the 10th of June by air mail, which letter must have been received by the 11th or 12th, notifying you that the sewage system was blocked, that I was having the pipes opened up, that it might be an extensive job, and I asked if you objected to my having the work done. On June 12th I again reported about the work, asking for approval; on the 21st I reported further, and you did not write until June 20th refusing to pay for it. As the reports I sent were by air mail, I consider the Department should have notified me on the 11th or 12th at the latest that you would not pay the cost, and I should then, of course, stopped the work, and declined to accept further responsibility, although I think an outbreak of typhoid would have cost considerably more than these repairs.\n\nI regret that I have to disagree with the Department's decision in this matter. The present situation is\nthat both the Department and the School disclaim responsibility, and the cost of labour and material are unpaid; the workmen are demanding their wages, and no funds are available here to pay them. I do not know what the next step will be, but the workmen will probably commence some kind of action.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB/DH.\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nAIR MAIL.\nOttawa,\nJuly 8th., 1939\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of June 29th., and July 4th., in connection with repairs to the sewage system at the Squamish Residential School.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of the 20th. ultimo, it was not found possible to include any specific amount in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at this school. The Department is therefore unable to consider payment of the expenditure involved in repairing the sewage system.\n\nIn view of the fact that it has been decided that no further deductions will be made from the per capita allowances of Residential Schools, the management of the Squamish School will receive an amount $125.00, which was deducted from their March quarter earnings. This amount will be paid when issuing check for the June quarter grant. In addition there will be no deduction from the June quarter, consequently, the school management should have sufficient funds to pay for the expenses in connection with the sewage system.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. Welfare & Training.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n416 Federal Building,\nVancouver, B. C.\nSir:\n\nre: File No.167-1-5\n\nWith reference to your decision not to pay the expenses of repairing the sewage works leading from Squamish Residential School, I have received a telephone call this morning from Mr.Goumain saying that the workmen are going to sue for their wages - against whom, I do not know. If against me, I do not feel that I should employ counsel at my own expense. Personally, I do not see how provision could have been made in advance for emergency expense, such as this, which could not possibly be foreseen.\n\nThe school authorities have a clear case, as it was not the Residential School system which was blocked but the pipes laid when the auditorium was built. The auditorium is the day school, and the Residential School is a separate building, which belongs to the Order of the Sisters of the Child Jesus.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB/DH.\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nJuly 26, 1939.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn a letter dated June 12 Indian Agent Ball wrote to the Department stating that the sewage system at the Squamish residential school was causing trouble and that he had already authorized the necessary work. In subsequent letters dated June 21, June 29 and July 4 he wrote to us again in connection with this matter and in each of these letters referred to the Squamish residential school.\n\nIn the meantime we had advised him that as no funds were specifically provided in our appropriation for expenditure at the Squamish residential school during the present fiscal year it was impossible for us to consider payment of the expenditure for repairing the sewage system. Our reason for making this statement was that this is a Church-owned school and present regulations require us to secure an Order-in-Council for all expenditures at Church-owned schools and only those Church-owned schools that are specially mentioned in the Order-in-Council can be considered for expenditures. As no request had been received when we were preparing our estimates for any expenditure at the Squamish residential school it naturally followed that this school was not specially mentioned in the Order-in-Council secured this year. We intimated this to Mr. Ball but from the tone of some of his letters it would appear that he considers we are simply trying to ignore him. This is certainly not the case. I think you will realize that we have our own difficulties and certainly in the present instance it was not possible to authorize any expenditure at the Squamish residential school due to the reasons stated above.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nAfter all the letters he wrote to us he has now forwarded another letter dated July 15 stating that the sewage work was actually in connection with the Squamish day school although, as pointed out above, his other letters mentioned Squamish residential school. We can make expenditures at Squamish day school because this is considered in our records as Departmental property. Under these circumstances we are arranging to forward an accountable cheque for $163.42.\n\nI wish you would explain this matter to Mr. Ball.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n**REQUISITION FOR CHEQUE**\n\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\nDEPARTMENT: MINES & RESOURCES\n\nBRANCH: INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nDATE: July 26, 1939\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE No. | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n|            | Vancouver Indian Agency Trust Account | $163.48 |\n\nSend cheque to:\nF.J.C.

What are an Agent's duties in such matters?\n\nF. J. C. Ball,\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to report a matter to you personally, the necessity for so doing being regretted, but the Welfare & Training Branch does not appear to realise the serious situation.\n\nThe facts are briefly as follows, and have been reported to the Department on the following dates - June 10th (air-mail), June 12th, June 21st (air-mail), June 29th, July 4th and July 15th:\n\nOn June 10th the Squamish Residential School caretaker phoned me to go over and advise them as the sewage system was blocked and the health authorities had reported that the effluvia was most marked. I investigated and immediately wrote the Department by air mail that it was necessary to employ someone to open up the system and asking for the necessary authority. On the 12th we found the blockage more serious than expected and I again reported to the Department, following it with further reports on the 21st and 29th of June. Absolutely no attention whatever was paid to my requests or June 10th and 12th for authority to do the work and until the 26th June was any reply received, and then a letter, dated June 26th, by ordinary mail, arrived with the information that it was not found possible to include any specific amount in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at this School. Under these circumstances, the Department cannot pay for the expenditure caused by improving the sewage system.\"\n\nThis borders on the ridiculous as no one could possibly have foretold that the sewage system would be blocked on June 10th 1939, and the work being done was not \"improvement\" but a vital necessity to safeguard health and possibly lives. What would have been the situation if I had done nothing and an outbreak of typhoid had occurred, as it might easily have done? What are an Agent's duties, if not to attend to such matters?\n\nI strongly object to the Department ignoring my requests of June 10th and subsequent dates, by air-mail, for authority to do the work and waiting until the work was finished before saying they would not pay for it. I should have been advised on June 11th by air-mail or telegram that the Department would not pay for the labour and materials, and I should have stopped all work, and allowed matters to take their own course. It was grossly unfair to wait until the work was done and then refuse to pay for it, and such treatment is totally foreign to the usual custom of the Department.\n\nI received a further letter, File No.167-1-5, dated July 8th repeating that the Department is unable to consider\npayment of the expenditure and apparently expecting the School to do so. This they rightly refuse, as the blockage was found between the school system and the municipal sewer. The school formerly had their own septic tanks with 6-inch pipes from the boys' and girls' sides of the school, but many years ago the Department, against the wishes of the School, had connected them with the sewer; and in so doing had connected two six-inch pipes to one of four inches, and it is amazing that such an arrangement has not been blocked sooner.\n\nThe situation now is that the workmen are threatening suit for their wages and nothing has been paid either for labour or material.\n\nI do not see what other action I could have taken and am quite sure I should have merited censure if I had not protected the Department from public criticism and possible action by the health authorities. The School is in the Municipality of North Vancouver, surrounded by residences of white people, and the situation was one requiring prompt action, and I was entitled to different treatment from the Department.\n\nSurely provision is made in all estimates for emergencies of this kind, and it is no excuse to say that provision was not made for such work in this instance.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB/DH.\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nHAROLD W.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nto the sewage system are a fair charge against the Band funds as I think you were previously advised that if these repairs were necessary for the Squamish day school the Department is prepared to assume them although Mr. Ball should be very definitely informed that if he incurs expenditure in future without securing authority the Department will be unable to favourably consider any payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Hoey's letter of October 17th in the matter of expenditures incurred by Mr. Indian Agent Ball for repairs to the sewerage system serving the North Vancouver (Squamish) Indian Residential and Day Schools.\n\nI have inquired into this matter, as instructed, and found that the section of the system repaired runs along one of the main roads through the village along which new Indian houses have recently been constructed. In all probability these dwellings will in time be connected to this system, and as the Indians consider they have a right to do this I do not see why their funds should not, to some extent, be used to meet the costs of maintenance. In my opinion the two last accounts submitted by Mr. Ball, i.e., $52.55 and $106.50, covered by resolution of the Band, would be a fair charge against the Band Funds, and I would recommend they be so charged.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

If there are many fires in North Vancouver, the Reserve will be left to do its own fire-fighting. We have two hydrants on Squamish Reserve No.1, but no hose, the North Vancouver City Fire Department has attended to any fires on the Reserve. The Indians now need two more hydrants, hose and a small hose reel, 6 shovels and 2 axes. I would mention here that the large Church is on the Reserve in the middle of the village, and our fire insurance policy would not cover \"enemy action\".\n\nFred, J.C. Ball,\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nDecember 16, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIndian Agent Ball has also submitted an extensive report on air raid precautions that have been taken on the Squamish Reserve. He advises that the Indians require two more hydrants, hose, hose reel, 6 shovels and 2 axes. No doubt you have already made a survey of conditions on this reserve in view of the danger of possible air attack and this letter authorizes you to purchase the articles suggested by Indian Agent Ball, if you consider them necessary.

Ball,\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that damage to the extent of $70.00 was done to school property at Squamish Indian Residential School on Hallowe'en night last year, and although every effort has been made to locate the offenders, we have been unsuccessful. The school caretaker gave me the names of four boys who, he said, were implicated, but they were all able to prove definitely that they were at home hours before the damage was done, and did not leave their homes until the next day.\n\nOne of the drinking fountains in the school grounds was damaged to the extent of $10.00, the rest of the damage being to buildings and fences.\n\nThe Sister Superior requests that we assist in repairing this damage, and has asked me to write you for your advice.\n\nThe drinking fountain is one of the two which the Department installed some years ago. A flag pole was cut down and fences broken, besides damage to buildings. I respectfully request that at least part of the expense be paid. The Sister Superior has made many improvements to the school at her own expense, when they have been suggested to her, and recently installed new fire escapes, and I hope the Department will see its way clear to accede to this request.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB/DH.\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 29, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th instant, regarding the Squamish Indian Residential School, approval is granted for an expenditure of $70.00 for repairs and improvements.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Hoey,\nSup't of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am very grateful to receive the extra grant of $450 forwarded to the school. I was contemplating sending in an application for the repair of a furnace which could not be used any more without danger of fire.\n\nWith the grant I will be able to cover the expense, also the altering of two rooms where the plaster was falling off.\n\nTogether with my deepest thanks receive, dear Sir, the expression of my respectful consideration.\n\nSister Mary Alix\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith requisition for School Material for Squamish Indian Residential School.\n\nIt will be noted that #36 item is for a kitchen range. This is very badly needed. I have inquired everywhere in Vancouver, and the nearest to a 72\" range is one 84\". The Sister Superior advises me that it would be satisfactory. I have just been to the School, and find that by making some changes in the kitchen it can be fitted in.\n\nMarshall Wells Hardware will hold this range for a reasonable time, although it is one for which they have many calls. The cost, including cartage, will be approximately $305.00.\n\nWill you please advise as early as convenient if this can be supplied to the School.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nFB/C\n\nEnc.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, July 24th, 1945.\n\nMr. F.J. Ball, Indian Agent, 416 Federal Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to a request from the Squamish Residential School to be supplied with a new kitchen range. I note that you can secure a range for $305.00. I am inclined to feel that the range that we have been supplying to other schools with a larger enrolment than Squamish should be satisfactory. I refer in this regard to a kitchen range with hi-closet - no reservoir - burn coal or wood - approximate size 77\" x 31\". We can secure this type of stove from General Steelwares at an approximate cost of $230. Please let me know if you think that this type of stove would be satisfactory.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nre: File No.155-0-5\n\nReplying to your letter of the 24th instant, the school asked for a range not over 60 inches long. On examination of the school kitchen, I found that we could put in a range 72 inches long by changing the tank and sink, etc., but I doubt whether a 77 inch range could be installed as 72 inch appeared to be the extreme limit, and even that length was somewhat cumbersome.\n\nI should have mentioned that the figure I quoted, viz. $305.00, included delivery to the school, and it could be delivered immediately.\n\nIf General Steelwares have a 60 inch stove which could be delivered right away, it would probably be suitable.\n\nWill you please send your instructions by air mail as Marshall Wells Ltd. are holding the range I mentioned for us and they have several other applications for it if we do not want it.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDH\nOttawa, August 4th, 1945.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nIndian Agent Ball has written us with reference to supplying a kitchen range for the Squamish Residential School.\n\nHe states that Marshall Wells have a range which would be suitable and they are prepared to install it immediately. The quotation price is $305.00 including carriage.\n\nWe have provided an amount of $300.00 in our appropriation for the current fiscal year for repairs and improvements and the purchase of new equipment for the Squamish School. Consequently if the range mentioned is purchased the school management will have to pay the extra $5.00.\n\nPlease take whatever action you think advisable. In the event of your making the purchase, a copy of your Purchase Order should be forwarded to this office for the $300.00 available.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nre: Squamish Indian Residential School\n\nI beg to advise that Sister M.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to the desks and chairs required at the Squamish Indian Residential School.\n\nAs stated in my previous letter, only $300.00 was specifically provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements and the purchase of new equipment at this school. Voucher No. 227, received from Indian Agent Ball, amounted to $307.45. We have forwarded a cheque for $300.00 to Marshall Wells B.C. Limited, and the school management will have to send the firm a cheque for the balance, namely, $7.45.\n\nLater in the year, I will endeavour to have $70.00 transferred from some other school to the Squamish School, in order to buy the desks and chairs, but there will be some delay before this authority can be given, as a special Order-in-Council has to be secured.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, October 28, 1945.\n\nMr. F.J.C. Ball, Indian Agent,\n416 Federal Building, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to the kitchen range supplied to the Squamish Indian Residential School.\n\nThe amount of $300.00 is all that we can provide at the present time. Present regulations require that in the case of church-owned schools we expend no more than the amount specifically provided in the current year's appropriation, and for the current fiscal year the amount of $300.00 was included in our estimates for the Squamish School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nre: File No. 155-0-5\n\nI thank you for your letter of the 24th July last regarding a kitchen range for the Squamish Indian Residential School.\n\nThis has been installed at a total cost of $307.45 including cartage, and the Indian Commissioner's office has instructed me to advise the school to pay the $7.45 in excess of the amount set aside for the purpose.\n\nThe Principal, Sister Alix, is very pleased with the range, and wishes me to express to you her appreciation.\n\nIt was found necessary to install a double high shelf at a cost of $45.95 as the School does much food canning of all kinds. Sister Alix brought the account to me requesting me to find out whether the Department would pay for it, although she realizes that it was purchased on her own responsibility.\n\nIn accordance with her wishes, I am placing it before you, although I believe the amount set aside for repairs, etc., at the school was $300.00. I would ask you to look over the amounts allowed to this school in the past few years, as I believe you will find them most moderate. The Sisters have done considerable work on the School without asking us for assistance.

Table Tennis balls\n2 Rugby balls\n2 Soccer balls\n\nNormally the Department will not supply lacrosse and boxing equipment but it is believed that the boxing gloves requested are to be used in connection with a very enthusiastic Provincial Recreational Group organized in connection with the school, and it is felt that encouragement should be given to this effort.\n\nR.F.

No. 127 should be retained by this boy during his period of residence.\n\nPlease let me have full information regarding the above and you should point out to the Reverend Principal that the register number given a pupil on admission should be retained during the whole period of residence. Accordingly, on future returns, Percy Gonzales should be shown as No. 139; Thomas Williams as No. 140; Leonard Baker as No. 141; Gilbert Band as No. 142; and Herbert Band as No. 143.\n\nFor your convenience, a duplicate copy of this letter is enclosed, which you can hand to the Reverend Principal.\n\nYou may also inform the Principal that the admission of Herbert Baker, Molly Charlie and John Baker is approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Ferrier,\nSept. of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs I wrote the School Report for December Quarter, I am charged by the Principal to correct the errors found in it:\n\n(a) No. 118, Edward Corkill is now attending the Squamish Day School and very likely, the Principal forgot to notify the Department of the fact, but she will do so directly, giving reasons.\n\n(b) As I knew that Donald Hoody retained his former No. 127, after the expiration of sick leave, I entered Percy Gonzales under No. 137.\n\n(c) Henry Charlie's name was entered in the Statement for admission, last September, but was rejected by the Indian Agent, Mr. Ball, who said he would settle this matter with Ottawa. As his name never appeared on the school register, I gave No. 134 to Thomas Williams and followed the order for the two next boys: Leonard Baker and Gilbert Band.\n\nI meant to inform you of the change but overlooked doing so. But to comply with the directions given in your letter of January 12, Thomas Williams shall henceforth appear under No. 140, Leonard Baker No. 141, Gilbert Band No. 142, and Herbert Baker No. 143.\n\nI am sorry to say that No. 139, Percy Gonzales died in St. Paul's hospital, on December 28.\n\nSincerely regretting the trouble I unintentionally caused you, I am, dear Sir,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSister Mary Alex.\nOttawa, February 1st, 1932.\n\nMadam,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th ultimo, I beg to say that the discharge of Edward Corkill - No. 118, from the Squamish Indian Residential School is approved.\n\nThe death of Percy Gonzales - No. 139, is regretted.\n\nIt is noted that the other pupils who have entered the school recently will be given the register numbers requested in my letter of the 12th ultimo.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

In this connection, I would point out that extreme care should be exercised in preparing the quarterly return.\n\nUnder the heading \"Total number of days pupil in residence during quarter\", there should be entered only the actual number of days each pupil is in residence during the quarter which the return covers. If a pupil is absent owing to illness or any other cause, per capita allowance should not be requested for the period of absence. For instance, if a pupil is absent for thirty (30) days, the figure 62 should appear under this heading opposite such pupil's name and, in the column headed \"Remarks\", etc., the reason for absence should be stated.\n\nI also enclose for your guidance a copy of circular letter of October 19th, 1923.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Amy,\nPrincipal,\nSquamish Indian Res. School,\nN. Vancouver, B. C.\nOttawa, April 23rd, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your 4139 of the 12th instant, with reference to the quarterly return of the Squamish Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that grant is requested for 91 days for pupils 0121 and 0122, in spite of the fact that they were out of school for at least two months. The Department realizes that it would be rather difficult for you to check the attendance of the individual children at the school but, if you notice a case such as this on future returns, you should have the returns corrected before forwarding them to the Department. In the present case, the mistake on the part of the Principal in preparing the return did not make any difference in the earnings due to the fact that the return showed an average attendance of 57 while per capita allowance is made for only 55.\n\nI enclose a letter which you should hand to the Reverend Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nF.J.C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n822 Metropolitan Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant and hope that the circular will have the desired effect. In quite a number of cases Indian children are sent to hospital, but this School apparently makes no change in the attendance, always giving the number as the full attendance of each child on the list, which is far from correct.\n\nI note that the letter addressed to the Reverend Sister Mary Amy was not signed by you and as this was probably an oversight, will you kindly forward it direct?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nRussell T.Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSquamish Residential School\nNorth Vancouver B.C.\nMay 13th., 1932\n\nRussell T.

However, I shall in future abide\nby your kind instructions and beg of you to put on sick leave list\nNo. 0122 and admit instead No. 0148 Josephine Louis, who has been at\nschool for two years and not enrolled yet.\n\nRespectfully Yours\n\nSister M.Amy\nPrincipal\nOttawa, May 18th, 1932.\n\nMadam,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, replying to official letter of the 23rd ultimo.\n\nWith reference to your request for the admission of Josephine Louis to the Squamish Indian Residential School, please forward an application form and certificate of health to Mr. Agent Ball, who will send it to the Department for our consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

George - No. 123 - was approved by official letter of January 10th, last, and his name was not shown on the March quarter return.\n\nHis name is again entered on the June quarter return. Please advise if this boy is in the Squamish School at the present time and, if so, you should point out to the Principal that he should not have been re-admitted without the consent of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

C.\nSQUAMISH RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nJuly 21, 1933.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs you were told on your short visit of the 19th inst., Mother Amy will be taken up the whole week by her instructions to, and conferences with, her staff and the Sisters from the other schools, and she can dispose of very little time outside of these. Therefore I answer your letter of the 19th regarding the re-admission of No.123, Louis George, to school.\n\nI looked up all the papers for information concerning this matter. All I could find is that, accompanying the return for the December Quarter, a sick leave was asked for him.\n\nAs far as I know, a child who has been left at home on a sick leave can come back to school and be re-entered on the register without any notification to the Department. This boy came back after two and a half months of absence, that is, some time in March.\n\nKindly let the Principal know if any further adjustment is necessary.\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n(Sgd.) Sister Mary Alix.\n\nF.J.C.Ball,\nIndian Agent,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant regarding the June quarter return of the Squamish Indian Residential School.\n\nThere appears to be a misunderstanding on the part of the Principal, and her assistant, Sister Mary Alix, has written to say that the discharge of 123 L. George was not asked for in the December quarter.\n\nThe return for that quarter shows this pupil \"suffering from rheumatism, is on sick leave\". The Principal was therefore in error in showing the pupil as discharged.

Nahanees are in a position to support their children, the Department is not prepared to approve their admission to the Squamish Indian Residential School. They should continue to attend the day school and reside at home.\n\nRegarding the applications for Rodney and Margaret Nahanees, and Jacob and Madeleine Louie, please let me know if William Nahanees and Lewis Louie admit that they are the fathers of these children. If you have definite admission to this effect, the Department is prepared to consider withholding any interest money due these two Indians and fund same for the support of the children. You should, also, state with whom the children are living at the present time and whether or not they are receiving proper care and attention.\n\nThe application form signed by Moses Guss for the admission of Marjorie Thomas states that Guss is only her guardian. Please let me know for what length of time this girl has been in Guss' care and whether or not he has children of his own to support. If so, it is possible that it would be in the girl's best interests to place her in a residential school.\n\nIf more pupils are required at the Squamish Residential School to bring the enrolment to the number for which grant is allowed, the Department considers that you should assist the Principal in securing the necessary pupils. Preference, of course, should be given to orphan and neglected children.\n\nYou may inform the Principal that the admission of Mary Madeleine George and Clare Thomas is approved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq., Indian Agent,\n203-6 Rogers Building,\nVancouver, B.

They were returned to School apparently none the worse for their experience.\n\nI am reporting this because it may reach you indirectly and through alarmist channels. There was no reason for the truancy; they were merely tired of confinement in the School as we are not allowing the pupils to visit the Indian village on account of epidemics of measles and influenza.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nB/DH.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nREPORT FOR MONTH OF FEBRUARY 1937, ON VANCOUVER AGENCY.\n\nOn the 1st at 1.30 P.M.

Immediate search was made and the boys were found next day at Lynn Valley, and all well though wet and tired on account of the deep snow. I instructed the school authorities again that it is vitally necessary to notify this office immediately a pupil is missing. We might easily have had a repetition of the Lejac tragedy.

In view of the information contained in your letter of October 3rd, 1936, you were informed in official letter of October 9th, 1936, that the Department was not prepared to approve the admission of these children.

I considered that as the father was longing at fair wages, the pupils should be selected from those who were either orphans or in poor circumstances, and it was arranged that the two boys mentioned should be day pupils instead of residents, and this was explained to you in October, 1936.\n\nShortly afterwards, the mother suddenly decamped from the Reserve, and left the father to take care of several small children. We have not yet succeeded in getting the mother back home again, and we had to place the children in residence as no one was taking care of them.\n\nI hope this explanation will cover the admission of these boys and that you will approve same under the altered circumstances.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nB/DN.\n\nPhilip Phelan Esq.\nChief, Mining Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, May 13th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 6th instant, the Department approves the admission of Stanley and Willard Joseph to the Squamish Indian Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nF.J.C.

They had no excuse or complaint against the school, and two of them would be leaving next term on reaching the age limit. As they had broken into some houses and stolen considerable property, they were brought up in Juvenile Court, and given a whipping by their parents by order of the Court. This seems to be a satisfactory arrangement, but the school refuses to take the boys back on account of the possible bad influence on the remaining pupils.\n\nF. J. C.

The Police located the boys at Squamish and the total cost of getting them back to Vancouver amounted to $13.55 (as shown on the account attached to the voucher), but I was able to collect $9.80 from the boys' shares of the recent Squamish interest distribution. The boys involved were Lorne Antone, No.5; Donald Moody, No.67; and Sammy Louie, No.84, all of the Squamish Band.\n\nThe boys obtained sufficient money to take them to Squamish by stealing some baskets from an Indian house on Squamish I.R.No.1, and selling them in Vancouver to a Japanese store. It was necessary to reimburse the store for the $10.00 they paid the boys, and the baskets were restored to their owner. While awaiting trial for this theft, they were held at the Juvenile Detention Home for 4 days each at $0.20 per day, making a total cost of $10.20, which also had to be paid.\n\nTheir shares of interest money ($10.00 per capita) were applied to the above expenses as follows:\n\n| Description                                      | Amount |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Cheque                                           |        |\n| Juvenile Detention Home, 4 days each @ $0.20     | $3.20  |\n| B.C.Provincial Police, transportation............| $1.55  |\n| Kodiara Store, for baskets.......................| $10.00 |\n| Total                                            | $33.75 |\n\nLess 3 shares @ $10.00 each......................| $30.00 |\n\nBalance as per voucher herewith...................| $3.75 |\n\nThe boys received suspended sentence on condition that their parents whipped them, which was done. As they would have been discharged at the end of June in any case having reached the age of 16, and the Principal did not want them back in the School again on account of bad influence, (this being their second offence within a month) they have not returned to School.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.

These boys were located and returned to school, and on the 28th a girl bolted, but has also been returned to school. It has been a busy month and until fishing season commences and the Indians leave for their fishing reserves, there will be plenty of work for me on the main reserves. Longshoring has picked up considerably and the high price of logs has opened the logging camps earlier than usual though this may be only temporary. During the month I visited Capilano, Sliammon, Sechelt, Musqueam, Squamish No.1.\n\nF. J. C.

She was found with a soldier in Vancouver on one occasion, and figured in a juvenile delinquency case.\n\nMildred Baker was born January 28th 1926, and is, therefore, in her 15th year. She is the daughter of No. 9, William Baker, Jr., of the Squamish Band. Both William Baker Jr., and his wife, Caroline, are worthless Indians, and Caroline is continually in jail - in fact, is there now. They have a large family, who are left to themselves without any parental control, so it is not surprising to find the children difficult to handle.\n\nIf we discharge this girl, she will immediately follow in her parents' footsteps and become a prostitute in Vancouver.\n\nI would recommend that she be placed in the care of the Convent of the Good Shepherd in Vancouver, where she may, under different surroundings, improve in character.

At 10 a.m. the Sister Superior notified me of their absence and search was started. No trace of any kind could be found, but late on Saturday night a telephone message was received that they had called at the home of an Indian woman on Lulu Island and except for her two girls, had left for St. Mungo's Cannery near New Westminster. They were finally located and brought back to School late Sunday night, except the two who returned today. They were all warmly dressed and have apparently suffered no ill-effects.\n\nI have investigated the cause for this truancy but it was apparently only a prank, and evidently arranged the evening before they left.\n\nI am reporting this only as a matter of record or in case news of their absence had been received by you, as I understand the radio was used to help find them. They ranged in age from 8 to 14 years and were led by the two oldest girls of the party. These latter two are a bad influence at the school and have run away four or five times before.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nB/DH.\nOn the 23rd, during the cold spell, 8 girls ranging in age from 8 to 14, left the Squamish Residential School without leave at 9 a.m. Naturally it was expected they would go only as far as the village, but no trace of them could be found. On account of the weather, some uneasiness was felt until an Indian woman living on Lulu Island near New Westminster telephoned to say that they had all arrived at her place late at night. They were returned to school on Sunday and Monday. They had no complaint and apparently did it for a prank.\n\nFred J.C.

This is due to the reduced pupilage (now numbering 61 instead of 65) and the number of children who had to be sent to the hospital.\n\nI hope though that the Department will kindly overlook the average, considering that, in spite of the per capita grant reduction since the war started, we kept the same number of children in residence as before. And, as you are aware, Sir, the school now pays the taxes on the land it occupies, which Ottawa did before. A new curtailment of the grant would greatly handicap the school management.\n\nWould you kindly bring this special affair concerning the school before the Department?\n\nI am, dear Mr. Ball,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSister Mary Alix.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6468, file 889-10, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith, for your consideration, a letter from Sister M.

The girl's father, Arthur Gonzales, made a great disturbance when his daughter was missing from school, and advised the Sisters that he was spending day and night looking for her, and we had much sympathy for him. Elsie was returned to his custody, but three weeks later, to our amazement, the Police notified me that the girl, accompanied by her married sister and a young brother, had called upon them and laid a charge of incest against the father. The case came up for trial and after three sessions at Court, he was convicted this morning and given 18 months imprisonment. The evidence given was most revolting and incriminated him in connection with all three of his daughters. Personally I think the sentence was much too light but, of course, we have no control over that.\n\nThere is no place to which we can send this girl as Lejac School does not want her, and I believe that if we could now release Mildred Baker from the Good Shepherd Home and Send Elsie Gonzales there in her place, it will be the best place for her and everyone else.\n\nWill you kindly authorize this to be done.\n\nFred.

The Return shows pupils who were in hospital for less than thirty days deducted for the number of days they were in hospital. This is incorrect for grant is allowed for pupils up to thirty days hospitalization in any one Quarter.\n\n2. Ditto marks cause confusion and it is requested that in the column headed \"Attendance\" that figures be shown or the number of days pupils are in residence.\n\n3. Pupil No. 0209 Laverne Leon was not shown on the September Quarterly Return but ninety-two days was requested on the December Return. Please advise the date the pupil returned to school.\n\n4. Pupil No. 0215 Marion Billy entered hospital on November 21st and fifty-three days grant was requested. With reference to paragraph one this pupil is allowed thirty days hospital grant and is therefore entitled to eighty-two days.\nThe above corrections have been made on the December Quarterly Return and are only brought to your attention for the purpose of speeding up the checking of future returns and thus ensuring prompt forwarding of the school grant cheque.\n\nPhil'p Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Thunderchild Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child:\nEnglish name: Justin Hector Denis Tootoosis\nAge: Jan. 14, 1940\nName of Band: Roundmaker\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid: #167\nFather's full name and No.: John Baptiste Tootoosis #167\nMother's full name and No.: Louisa Angwa #167\nParents living or dead: Living\nState of child's health: Good\nReligion: R.C.\nDoes applicant speak English?

Taylor,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\n416 Federal Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.,\n\nThe Department approves\nthe discharge of pupil No. 0252 Ann C.\nGeorge from the Squamish Indian Residential\nSchool.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Squamish Residential School.\n\nThe Vancouver Agency is having considerable difficulty in finding Residential School accommodation for necessitous cases. This is due to the fact that some children whose home circumstances are good are now enrolled at the Squamish and the Sechelt Residential Schools. It is therefore felt that nine children from the Squamish Reserves should be discharged to make room for these necessitous cases. Children discharged in this manner can attend the provincial schools at Squamish. It is therefore requested that authority be granted for the discharge of the following children:\n\n| No. | Name                  | Age | Address                          | School                        |\n|-----|-----------------------|-----|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| 039 | Theresa Andrew        | 8   | Brackendale, B.C.               | Sechelt Residential           |\n| 301 | Alphonse Williams     | 9   | Brackendale, B.C.               | Sechelt Residential           |\n| 302 | Thomas Williams       | 7   | Brackendale, B.C.               | Sechelt Residential           |\n| 220 | Ronald Walter Billy   | 13-6| Squamish, B.C.                 | Squamish Residential          |\n| 242 | Richard Douglas Billy | 9   | Squamish, B.C.                 | Squamish Residential          |\n| 245 | Humphrey Brent Billy  | 9   | Squamish, B.C.                 | Squamish Residential          |\n| 042 | Sally Rose Mary Billy | 8   | Squamish, B.C.                 | Squamish Residential          |\n| 026 | Shirley Moody         | 8   | Squamish, B.C.                 | Squamish Residential          |\n| 026 | Mona Moody            | 7   | Squamish, B.C.                 | Squamish Residential          |\n\nIt will be noted that six of these children are resident at Squamish and three at Brackendale. These two points are too far apart to permit the children from Brackendale to attend an Indian Day School on the Reserve at Squamish without the operation of a bus. In any case the number of children involved is insufficient to warrant the establishment of a school.\nDEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nFebruary 19, 1951.\n\nCIRCULAR - TO ALL SUPERINTENDENTS AND PRINCIPALS OF RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nThis office is concerned that the best possible use does not appear to be made of the Residential Schools. It is believed that many children who should be in Residential Schools are being prevented from being admitted by the presence of children in Residential Schools who could very well attend Day Schools.\n\nIt has always been the Department's policy to have Superintendents approve the admission of children to Residential Schools and have them indicate their approval by signing the application forms for pupils entering Residential School. No child should be admitted to a Residential School unless these forms have been completed. It is the responsibility of a Superintendent in whose Agency the Residential School is located to check the quarterly return with the application forms and delete pupils from the quarterly return for whom there is no completed application form. Application forms from outside Agencies should be forwarded to the Superintendent in charge of the Agency in which the Residential School is located for forwarding to the Department. The practice of having children admitted to Residential Schools without the approval of the Superintendent should not be tolerated. Such practice, in addition to permitting accommodation to be used by children who have no need for this type of service, is a contributing factor to the lengthy delay which often occurs in making family allowance returns and the resulting over-payment of allowances.\n\nAs a guide to Superintendents, the following order of precedence is given:\n\n1. Children whose home circumstances require that they be given institutional care.\n2. Children from Reserves where there is no Day School or inadequate facilities.\n3. Children who have reached high school level.\n\n(Sgd.) W. S. Arneil,\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6468, file 889-10, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI should also like to draw to the Department's attention the fact that although the Residential School in North Vancouver is named Squamish, it is many miles distant from the Reserves referred to in the above list.\n\nThis request is in accordance with the policy outlined in the circular issued by this office on February 19, 1951, which had Departmental approval. A copy of this circular is attached.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nAugust 23rd, 1951.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Squamish Indian Residential School\n\nWe have your letter of August 9th suggesting the discharge of several children from the above school in conformity with your circular letter of February 19th, 1951.\n\nIt is true that your circular was approved, but on review it does not indicate that we were obliged to infer that it applied to children already in a residential school. Our understanding at the time was that it applied to pupils who had not been admitted to any residential school.\n\nAre we going to receive any protests regarding the discharge of the children from the Squamish School and sending them to a provincial school as mentioned in your letter?\n\nWe would appreciate hearing further from you.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Squamish Residential School,\nYour 889-10 (E), August 23.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's letter of above date, it is anticipated that if the children listed are discharged from the Residential School by the Department there will be protests from the Principal of the school and possibly from the church authorities. The parents of these children had previously requested, verbally, that their children be permitted to attend the Provincial school; however, when they were asked to put this request in writing, two of the families declined to do so.\n\nI have assumed from the Department's letter that it is your wish that in view of the circumstances no further action be taken.\n\nW.

The parents are reputedly responsible people and apart from the large number of children in the family, there does not appear to be any reason why Bernice, Rhoda and Lois cannot live at home rather than in residence. It was not possible to interview Mrs. Guerrero as she was away from home.\n\nNAME: JOSEPH, Chief Moses and Christine\nBAND: Squamish Band, Vancouver Agency\n\nCHILDREN:\nMarion, born 5.2.33 \u2014 in the spring of 1952 was working away from home\nShirley, born 9.4.35 \u2014 attended Kamloops High School but did not return after Christmas\nChristine, born 20.11.36 \u2014 attended Kamloops High School but did not return after Christmas\nCharles, born 12.11.38 \u2014 Grade 7 Residential School\nMichael, born 13.12.39 \u2014 Grade 7 Residential School\nGloria, born 22.12.40 \u2014 Grade 5 Residential School\nRosina, born 21.1.44 \u2014 possibly in Coqualeetza Hospital\nAgatha, born 3.3.46\nSusan, born 3.11.47\n\nMrs. Joseph stated that she also cares for her 5 year old grandchild. Mr. Joseph is working longshoreman and their is fairly adequate in size, a new addition having been added to the back. There are two bedrooms in the house \u2014 one downstairs and one large dormitory style upstairs. These children may possibly be in residential school owing to the mother's drinking habits and during the interview she was partially intoxicated, but she raised no objection to the idea of having all her children at home rather than being in residence. The home is within about 5 minutes walking distance of the school.\n\nNAME: BILLY, William Jr. and Celestine\nBAND: Capilano Indian Reserve, Vancouver Agency\n\nCHILDREN:\nMatilda, born 17.7.38 \u2014 working part-time, living at home\nMary, born 20.8.35 \u2014 Grade 4 Residential School\nJane, born 29.8.38 \u2014 Grade 4 Residential School\nMartha, born 3.3.41 \u2014 Grade 4 Residential School\nJohn, born 9.9.45 \u2014 not attending school\nJimmy Edmund BILLY, grandson, 11 years of age \u2014 Grade 4 Res.

Mrs. Billy did not raise any objection to the idea of her children living at home rather than attending residential school.

The Department views this programme with favour and agrees that the best site would be on that part of the reserve nearest to the school. Please get in touch with interested members of the Band and have a rough sketch prepared, indicating the size and accommodation which should be provided in the building. This should be submitted to the Department with a recommendation as to the method of erecting the building, i.e., by contract or by day labour. You should also secure an accurate estimate as possible of the total cost, including furnishings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nChas. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRoom 404, Holden Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nRussell T. Perrier, M.A.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nCanada.\n\nSir:\n\nFor some time I have been thinking of communicating with you concerning the establishment of at least two Manual Training Centres, in connection with our Indian Schools.\n\nYou are aware that for four years Rev. G.H. Naley has been carrying on a manual training program at Coqualeetza Residential School.\n\nThe Manual Training Instructor, Mr. A.G. Jamieson, is well qualified to carry on this work. He has charge of the Manual Training Work in connection with the Public Schools of the Chilliwack Valley.\n\nTwo nights of each week from seven P.M. to nine P.M., he instructs ten of the Indian boys systematically and scientifically.\n\nI would respectfully recommend to the Department that two Manual training centres be opened this autumn in connection with our Indian Schools. First, in connection with the Squamish Residential School; second, in connection with the Nanaimo Bay School.\nI would further recommend that these two centres be equipped with ten benches each and whatever tools are necessary to successfully carry on this work.\n\nAt both of these centres it will be possible to have the services of two efficient instructors. My idea is that we should employ men who are making a success of their work in the Public Schools. We must have men of good standing to introduce this work.\n\nThese schools would be carried on along the same line as the Night Schools. This work would have to be conducted in this way as the men that we would engage would be able to come to us only at night. In the daytime they would be at work in connection with the public schools.\n\nMr. Raley pays the instructor in his school $4.00 for each night, so that the expense in connection with the two centres that I have suggested. At this rate it would cost $16.00 per week for the time the school is carried on.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Schools.\nOttawa, September 2, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th ultimo, in which you recommend that manual training classes be established at the Squamish Indian Residential School and the Nanaimo Day School. In reply I have to inform you that favourable consideration has been given and I should be pleased if you would inform Agents Perry and Lomas that they should get in touch with proper instructors and each make a definite proposal to the Department. You should explain to them how the work could be undertaken and what equipment will be needed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. H.

Cairns Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia and having reference to the establishment of a Manual Training Centre at the Squamish Indian School, North Vancouver, was duly handed to me by Mr. Cairns for perusal.\n\nPreviously to this letter having been received by Mr. Cairns, the Inspector, and I had visited the Strathcona Public School Manual Training Centre together and had made some notes in this connection. Subsequently, to the receipt of this letter, Mr. Cairns & I visited the Provincial Public School at North Vancouver and there made survey of the Manual Training Centre. We met Mr. F. Wilcox, City School Manual Training Instructor, with whom we discussed various phases of Manual Training Work. We told Mr. Wilcox that we were gleaning data as a basis of a recommendation to the Department respecting a proposed Manual Training Centre for the Squamish Indian Residential School, whereupon he placed himself at our disposal and assisted us in every way possible in pursuit of our investigation. Mr. Wilcox accompanied us on our visit to the Squamish Indian Residential School for the purpose of looking over whatever accommodation might be available there for Manual Training purposes. We further consulted with the School Staff and after careful survey of prevailing conditions we came to the conclusion that the space available was utterly inadequate and unsuitable for the purpose. It was apparent that if a Manual Training Centre were to be established in connection with the school a cheap and suitable building would have to be erected to accommodate the equipment and serve the pupilage. It was decided, upon mutual discussion, to recommend that the Department make a grant for the construction of a suitable building and I proceeded at once to investigate details of the probable cost of a building, equipment, etc. Fortunately, I was able to secure the assistance of Mr. R.F. Wheaton (the contractor who erected the fire escapes at this school last year), and he very kindly prepared a sketch plan showing the local requirements together with a list of quantities in regard to material etc., required for the construction of an inexpensive.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nof an inexpensive and fairly substantial wooden frame building.\n\nAfter making careful inquiries, assisted by Mr. Inspector Cairns, Mr. Wheadon and Mr. Wilcox, an estimate of the approximate cost of installing a Manual Training Building and equipment such as would meet the requirements of the above mentioned school, is as follows:\n\n1. Building including all labour & material $950.00\n2. 10 benches @ $17.50 ........................................... $175.00\n3. Cupboards, sawboard, tool racks, side benches approximately .................................................. $40.00\n4. Instructor, 80 lessons at $5 ........................................ $400.00\n5. Tools, approximately ................................................ $50.00\n6. Drawing materials .................................................... $10.00\n7. Hardware, glue and paint ........................................... $15.00\n8. Lumber for Manual Training work ................................ $75.00\n\nTotal $1465.00\n\nOf the foregoing total the sum of $1465.00 represents the initial outlay in installing the plant and the remaining $950.00 represents the estimated and approximate annual expenditure based upon eighty lessons per year at $5.00 per lesson. It has been thought best to recommend the appointment of an instructor at $5.00 per lesson rather than on stated salary so as to provide for possible broken periods or cessation of work.\n\nThe plan of the proposed building and equipment is submitted herewith, together with a bill of quantities connected with the building and a list of tools necessary for the carrying on of this work. These will be self-explanatory, and with regard to the tools and manual training lumber it is not expected that these would all be purchased at once but it was deemed advisable to give the Department an approximate total cost of the tools and material required.\n\nMr. Inspector Cairns and I have today gone over the specifications etc., and we have decided to submit the data thus gathered to the Department with a recommendation that authority be granted to proceed with this installation at the earliest possible date. We feel that we have cut down the cost as closely as can be done commensurately with the local requirements.\n\nAs to a Training Instructor, Mr. Cairns and I have agreed to ask the Department to appoint Mr. Wilcox as Instructor under the terms mentioned above, as we believe he is a thoroughly capable man and he is at present engaged in the Public School Manual Training Centre as Instructor and is giving satisfaction there. We believe Mr. Wilcox who has obliged us in every possible way in making our investigations would fully meet our requirements in connection with this school.\nI would inform the Department that whilst visiting the Squamish Residential School the Rev. Principal, Mother Mary Amy expressed a wish to have an additional classroom built over the proposed Manual Training Building, but Mr. Carling and I regret not being able to recommend this in connection with the proposed building, as the substructure to take care of an additional classroom overhead would have to be more substantial and would consequently be more costly and would involve the preparation of plans and specifications on a larger scale.\n\nI would further call attention of the Department to the fact that the Squamish Indian Residential School Building is showing considerable all-round decay in the foundations of the building, which indicates that it is only a matter of time and it will become necessary to dispense with the old building.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.C.

Mr. Inspector Cairns recommended the Squamish Indian Residential School and I asked them to submit a proposal with regard to the teaching service as well as an estimate of the capital expense. It is reported that the following expenditure would be necessary:\n\nBuilding with benches, tools, etc. $1,565.\nAnnual cost of instruction 400.\n\nIn view of: (1) the main building at this school cannot be used many years; (2) the Department would never build a modern school on this site; and (3) the large capital expense necessary, I wish to recommend that the manual training activity be not allowed.\n\nRussell Ferrier\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, November 6, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 1-193 of the 15th ultimo, with reference to the establishment of manual training activity at the Squamish Indian Residential School.

I have not figured on the cost of gymnasium equipment, as it has not yet been decided what equipment will be required in that connection.\n\nI regret there has been some delay in procuring this information, but the Department will be aware that it is difficult to secure prices from contractors unless it is an estimate based upon work which they have some prospect of obtaining; hence I have been obliged to feel my way along and secure the information as best I could, not having received any authority from the Department to incur expenditure in this connection.\n\nI trust that the information thus furnished will give the Department and its architect a better idea of what is wanted. It is proposed to heat the building with a furnace but to build a chimney and have a stove on each floor, sufficient for the purpose of heating the rooms. It is proposed to shiplap the exterior walls of the building up to the second floor, and from there to the roof it is suggested that it be shingled and stained. It is proposed also to plaster the rooms on the ground floor and to joint the Manual Training room upstairs. It is proposed to construct a septic tank, ten feet square.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nsquare or thereabouts in connection with this building, as there is no sewerage outlet at the Reserve.\n\nIt is the opinion of the Squamish Indian Council and myself that this work could best be done under contract and not by day labour for which purpose I would recommend that tenders be advertised for.\n\nIn the wiring of the building for electric light, it is suggested that this work be done in conduit and in conformity with the bylaws of the City of North Vancouver, as the best means of safeguarding the building from fire, as well as in anticipation of reduced insurance rate should this be desired.\n\nI have conferred with Mr. R.H. Cairns, Inspector of Schools for British Columbia on this matter and we have examined the enclosed data together and Mr. Cairns is prepared to endorse the suggestions which have been offered herein.\n\nI should point out to the Department that the Reverend Principal of the Squamish Residential School, at North Vancouver, recently asked the Department to authorize the purchase of twenty-four desks for Indian Day School purposes, with the expectation that the Department would sanction the use of the room on the main floor for the conduct of the Indian Day School which is attached to the Indian Residential School therein. This matter, however, has not yet been decided but will be presented for consideration of the Indians and the Department; if the Department has decided whether or not it is intended to proceed with this construction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nO.C.

C.\nNovember 23, 1926.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nWhen Andrew Faull, of the Squamish Band, was in Ottawa some months ago, he was very keen on a community building for the reserve - one that could be used as an auditorium and a gymnasium and which could be equipped with manual training facilities for the special use of the older pupils of the Squamish Indian Residential School. I suggested that the interested members of the Band have the Indian Council pass on an expenditure from their funds for the purpose. I advised against the erection of such a building on the school property and suggested that it be on the nearest point on the reserve which is close at hand.\n\nSome time ago, a resolution of the Band in Council in this connection came to hand, and I asked Mr. Indian Agent Perry to prepare a rough sketch and secure estimates of the cost. These are now on file and I wish to recommend that the Department Architect prepare a plan of a suitable building and estimate its cost. Such a plan could be returned to the Council for their consideration, with a request for a further resolution indicating the exact amount required for not only the erection of the building but for the equipment necessary. Mr. Inspector Cairns and Mr. Indian Agent Perry both endorse the scheme.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOpening St. Paul's Fine New Auditorium Attracts Gathering; Provide Manual Training Course\n\nW.

E. Ditchburn, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Victoria, formally declared the new St. Paul's school and auditorium open. Following the formal opening ceremonies the school children provided the audience with an interesting programme in the history of the local reserve and other branches of the school. Among other officials present were Mr. McCandless, Point R. Willing, Mr. C. G. Peters, Indian Agent, and Mr. H. G. Clunies, Inspector of Indian Schools. Among the guests were Mr. Francis L. A. Macdonald, Mayor of Victoria, Mr. Robert McMillan, Member of Parliament, Mr. J. B. Baker, Mr. McNeil, Mr. R. K. Murray, Chairman of the Allied Tribes of B. C., Mr. William D.

SCOTT,\n\nWith reference to the attached letter from Dr. King, I wish to report that it is now timely to make arrangements for a manual training instructor, who will give classes in the evening to the young men of the Squamish Indian Reserve. He should also give one half day's instruction per week in the daytime for pupils of the Squamish Indian Residential School, in all a total of 3 lessons per week, two in the evening and one in the daytime. As soon as an instructor is selected, it will be necessary for him to indicate just what equipment and materials are required for our purposes. The classes will be held in the new community hall and manual training centre, which has recently been opened on the Reserve.\n\nI understand that funds could be found in the Band's Interest Account to pay for this activity; but I am of the opinion that it would be a proper charge against the special appropriation of $100,000 per annum for British Columbia Indian work. It has already been proposed that $20,000 of this special appropriation be used for vocational training.\n\nPrevious to the receipt of Dr. King's recommendation that Mr. E. F. Hopkinson, of 156 Seventh Ave. W., Vancouver, be employed, Messrs. Cairns and Perry suggested that Mr. Wilcox, manual training instructor for North Vancouver City Schools, be given the work. I may say there has been no correspondence of late regarding the commencement of the activity.\n\nI recommend that Mr. Hopkinson be advised to apply to Mr. Indian Agent Perry for the work and that our representative be instructed to make a report, not only on the instructor to be engaged, but on the activity generally.\n\nRussell T.

Shockley a testimonial as to their splendid ability as Superintendent and Matron of our St. John's Home for Children in this town.\n\nI have had 24 years' experience as a Poor Law Guardian in Ipswich, and have always been on the St. John's Home Committee, so have been able to judge of the fitness of the various Officials we have had from time to time, and I can truthfully say that we have never had a better couple as Superintendent and Matron than Mr. & Mrs. Shockley and that is saying a great deal, for we have had some good occupants of the posts previous to their coming here. Mr. Shockley has proved himself to be a very capable administrator, also a good disciplinarian, and has carried out all his duties in a manner entirely to the satisfaction of the Guardians. He has kept a large set of books accurately; he has carried out many improvements in the Home, and obtained for the Guardians a large increase in the grant of money for Industrial Training.\n\nMrs. Shockley has not only been a first class Matron, conscientiously and carefully carrying out her duties to the entire satisfaction of the Guardians, but she has been like a Mother to the children of our Home; and it will be a terrible wrench to all when she leaves us.\n\nI am sure it will be a very difficult thing to fill their places with a similar couple of capable, energetic, and willing officers. I sincerely wish them great success in their future career, and can confidently recommend them to any body who requires such competent officers as Mr. & Mrs. Shockley have proved themselves to be.\n\n(Signed) W. H. CALVER,\nChairman of the Ipswich Board of Guardians.\nMr. and Mrs. R. H. Shockley entered the service of these Institutions in June, 1903, as Superintendent and Matron of Branch Home for Little Boys at Leopold House, Burdett Road, E., where over 300 boys are in residence.\n\nIn 1904 a vacancy occurred at the Headquarters, 18 to 26, Stepney Causeway, where the responsibilities were greater and where boys of a more advanced age were in residence, and Mr. and Mrs. Shockley were invited by the late Dr. Barnardo to fill this post, and they were in possession when I took up the duties of Director in October, 1905.\n\nI have much pleasure in stating that Mr. and Mrs. Shockley carried through the responsibilities entrusted to them in a very satisfactory manner. We considered them to be good managers and organisers, and they had the welfare of the boys at heart.\n\nMr. Shockley also took a great interest in the boys' sports, and did much to foster a spirit of friendly rivalry between the different dormitories.\n\nIt was with regret that I received Mr. and Mrs. Shockley's resignation in August last on their securing a joint appointment under the Local Government Board.\n\n(Signed)\n\nWM.

To me your leaving is a personal sorrow, for the Institutions can ill spare the devotion and unselfish service of those who were chosen by and known by their Founder.\n\nWith kind wishes to you both, believe me,\n\nAlways your sincere friend,\n\n(Signed) SYRIE LOUISE BARNARDO.\n\n2, Amen Court, St. Paul's,\nLondon, E.C.\n\nJuly 3rd, 1908.\n\nI have had many opportunities of seeing and hearing of the excellent work which Mr. and Mrs. Shockley have done in Dr. Barnardo's Home in Stepney.\n\nUnder their care the discipline and management of the boys have been admirable.

Being a good athlete he has taken an active part in the boys' cricket, football, games, etc., as well as helping in their physical training, and being a good Tonic-Sol-Fa trainer, he has rendered valuable work in the teaching of singing. He has taught our Evening Science Classes under the Board of Education, and also Manual Training in Woodwork.\n\nHe is steady, regular and attentive. Since he came here he has taken up Institutional work with a view to obtain such a position as that he is now seeking. In fact, when he applied for our vacant position of Schoolmaster, he told me that was his object in undertaking duty in an Industrial School.\n\nPossibly you may be aware that Macclesfield Industrial School is noted for its industrial training, and doubtless the experience and knowledge gained here by Mr. Shockley will be most helpful to him should he be successful in his present application.\n\nI firmly believe he would prove himself a faithful and efficient officer.\n\nHe has my best wishes, and I shall be pleased to answer any questions concerning him.\n\n(Signed) P.

These have been received and copies of the same are sent herewith for your perusal.\n\nAn application was also received from Mr. R.H.

His record is exceedingly good; and I knew of his work when he was engaged as Instructor at the Prince Rupert Public schools.\n\nIt will be noticed that Mr. Shockley asked $7.50 per lesson, while Mr. Hopkinson asked only $5.00. We discussed this with Mr. Shockley, who agreed that he would do the work at the price of $5.00 per lesson.

C.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF W. E. DITCHBURN, INDIAN COMMISSIONER, BOX 666, VICTORIA, B. C., dated January 25, 1929.\n\nSquamish, North Vancouver --------- Full reports on the desirability of putting a manual training equipment in the second story of the new community building have already been furnished by Mr. Indian Agent Perry. The room for manual training purposes is 40' x 42' and a class of sixteen pupils is assured with possibly more, as some of the boys who have completed their school terms also desire to take up instruction in manual training during their evenings. The services of an instructor, a Mr. Shockley, have been secured.\nFebruary 6, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Mitchburn:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to manual training at the Indian schools of British Columbia. I am very desirous of getting this activity extended without delay, and, as a preliminary step, I have to authorize you to purchase the materials listed on the enclosure you forwarded. The materials for work benches, the individual and general sets of tools and the drawing sets indicated should be supplied to the Kamloops, Squamish, Luper Island, Cariboo, St. Mary's, St. George's, Alert Bay and Fraser Lake schools. As the Squamish activity can be started immediately, work benches, Osmond's, may be purchased. For Squamish, you may supply $650 worth of equipment, as listed in your letter. The Department is already in correspondence with the Reverend Mr. Scott, concerning suitable workshops for St. George's. I rely upon you to purchase to the best advantage and to write to the principals concerned, explaining the use to which this equipment will be put. You may also authorize each principal to purchase lumber with which to work, as soon as the classes can be started. You may fix the amount to be expended on these materials from $50 to $100, as indicated in your letter, and you should direct principals to make requisition to the Indian agent for further materials, when required. If you find that any expenditure is necessary to complete the carpenter shop at Fraser Lake, you should let the Department have an estimate.\n\nI have written a special letter to Father Rohr, of the Cariboo School, pointing out that the boys must not be overworked in connection with the supply of fuel, and I am satisfied that vocational training can be started at this institution also. The populace is being increased to assist with current financing, and I have clearly indicated that the extra grant is for the engaging of labour for the supply of fuel.\n\nThe question of organizing this work and the appointment or securing of suitable instructors should now engage our attention. If we could secure the\n\nS. S. Mitchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nBox 666,\nVictoria,\nB.

It might be a good investment. The duties of such a man would be to make recommendations regarding buildings and equipment for vocational training at each school; to advise regarding the local instructors and to get the classes started. At some schools, it would be necessary to add a man to the staff and at others, to make arrangements for the holding of classes by public school instructors.\n\nThe Department will secure copies of the manuals and job sheets Mr. Kyle has recommended, and these will be sent to the various schools. If the Department is able to secure the services of a special officer to organise this work, I should expect you to continue his activity. The organisation might take from one to two years, and, at that time, experience would have shown whether it would be necessary to continue the position. If you are able to secure applicants for this organisation work, please let me know when I am with you a few weeks from now.\n\nAt a later date, after courses in carpentry are well under way, the Department must consider the advisability of extending the work along other lines.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nFebruary 7, 1929.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nOn File 600224, Commissioner Ditchburn was authorized, on February 6th, to purchase the following equipment so that the work could be started immediately at the manual training centre at the Squamish Indian Residential School:-\n\n- 16 Single benches.\n- 16 Bench screws.\n- 16 Individual sets tools.\n- 16 Drawing sets.\n- 1 General set tools.\n- Material.\n\nThe estimated cost is $709.31.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6468, file 889-11, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMarch 1929.

Box 688,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nNovember 22, 1932.\n\nC.C. Perry, Esq.,\nAssistant Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 688,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nFollowing a conversation with respect to the Manual Training at the Squamish Indian Residential School which we had a couple of weeks ago, I visited the school on the 16th of November, and later in the day had an interview with the Manual Training Instructor which lasted nearly two hours. This last took place at the Devonshire Hotel, Vancouver.\n\nThe Manual Training Instructor is Mr. R.H. Shockley, a member of the Church of England, and about 55 years of age. He was a teacher in England, a Superintendent of the Barnardo's Home at Stepney and was later on the Manual Training staff in Prince Rupert. Mr. Shockley holds a Manual Training Certificate for the Province of British Columbia, obtained as a result of a short course here. He is not, as was previously reported in error a member of the Vancouver Manual Training staff; but he has been trying to follow the course adopted by the Vancouver City Schools.\n\nMr. Shockley, who appeared to be anxious that the work done at the Squamish Indian Residential School should be a success, stated that there were supposed to be two periods of two hours each on Friday afternoons between 1 P.M. and 5 P.M. The boys, twenty in all, are divided into two classes, the Junior of which is composed of boys in Grade 2 for the most part. Possibly the Senior Class gets a little more than the two hours, and the Junior Class a little less.\n\nI am informed by Mr. Shockley that since the opening of school in September last the Seniors have made a spade, and a shelf which involved shaped ends, stopped lap joint, and stopped housing joint. The Juniors in the same period have been learning the use of the saw, chisel, and plane, on small pieces of wood. The work of the last school year was mainly small articles, as in the Vancouver City Schools. The largest article constructed appears to have been a small cabinet of about 24in. by 15 in. The boys take the articles away at the end of the year, on instructions issued through the late Indian Commissioner. I had therefore no opportunity to inspect the work. This is the fourth year that Mr. Shockley has been the Manual Training Instructor at this school.\nI inspected the Manual Training Shop while I was in North Vancouver, and found everything tidy, the tools well cared for and neatly arranged, and no chips etc. on the floor. I observed the drawings done by the seniors - A SPOON. The classes were not working, nor was the Instructor present.\n\nMy opinion, arrived at after my talk with the teachers at the school and my interview with Mr. Shockley, is that very little if any worthwhile work has been done for some time, possibly since my last report on this school. I consider that the Instructor has been perfectly honest in his labours; but has been far too theoretical in his lectures etc. He has been following a course which very little can be urged, though it may be more suitable in Vancouver Schools. I have suggested to him that I shall inspect the work in detail early next Spring, and that in the mean time he should have the boys construct much larger and more useful articles, such as TABLES? CHAIRS, STOOLS, CUPBOARDS, LAMP STANDS, TOWEL HORSES, etc., involving the usual joints. I asked that Drawings should still be made; that they should not take too long to draw. I explained that what we wanted in Indian Schools was not so much EXTREM ACCURACY as a neat DIMENSION SKETCH. I further suggested that he should have the boys choose partners, and suggest the work they wished to do. I explained in detail just how he could make these changes in a natural manner with his classes, so that he would secure full cooperation of the pupils.\n\nI am strongly of the opinion that Mr. Shockley should be given an opportunity to make good on this revised programme.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith report dated November 23rd, instant, signed by Inspector Gerald H. Barry (Indian Schools, B.C.), in regard to the Manual Training branch of the Squamish Indian Residential School, Vancouver Agency, the contents of which will be self-explanatory. I would advise the Department that Mr. Indian Agent Ball recently reported that he was not satisfied with the progress being made with Manual Training at this school and I requested the Inspector to consult with Mr. Ball and Mr. Shockley in regard thereto, which he has done. I am in accord with Inspector Barry's report on this subject.\n\nEnclosure:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 1, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 162/14/27141 of the 24th ultimo, forwarding the report of Mr. Inspector Barry in regard to the manual training activity at the Squamish Indian Residential School. In this connection it is noted that the work being done by the pupils, under the instructor, Mr. R. H. Shockley, is of an elementary type. However, it is noted, further, that Mr. Barry suggested that the instructor have the boys construct much larger and more useful articles.\n\nWhen the Inspector makes his next visit, he should report whether there has been any advance in the instruction given the pupils and in the character of the work being performed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

INSPECTOR BARRY ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE SQUAMISH INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ON MARCH 23 and 24, 1933.\n\nManual Training:\n\nThat in view of the representations of the principal and senior teachers of the Squamish Indian Residential School with regard to the poor progress of pupils taking the manual training courses at the school, and the fact that it is impossible to report favourably on the work being done at the present time, I have no alternative but to request the Department to terminate the engagement of the present manual training instructor, Mr. A. H. Shockley, as from the end of June, 1933.\n\nIn making the above recommendation, I have taken the following facts into consideration:\nThere has been very little advance in the quality of the instruction given to these boys since my interview with Mr. Shockley last November.\nThe articles being constructed consist of stools, towel racks, salt boxes, brackets, and some small tables, and are not up to the required standard for this work in the Indian Schools.\nThe Director of manual training agrees with me that there are a number of well trained instructors available. I keep in very close touch with the above mentioned Director, Mr. J. Kyle, who tells suitable instructors to register their applications in this office.\nShould the Department agree with me in the above, and decide to appoint a new manual training instructor at this school, there will be no difficulty in suggesting a very well trained and experienced person, properly qualified to each the subject to young Indian boys.\n\nMR. C. C. PERRY, INDIAN COMMISSIONER FOR B.C.,\nIN FORWARDING MR. INSPECTOR BARRY'S REPORT, COMMENTS AS FOLLOWS:\n\nManual Training Instruction:\n\nAlthough it will be noted that this Instructor, Mr. Shockley, has a B.C. Manual Training Certificate - First Class in both woodwork and metal-work - and has also had a very long experience in both public and private schools, his present services are not satisfactory to Inspector Barry, nor are they satisfactory to Mr. Indian Agent Ball.\n\nI understand that Mr. Kyle, Provincial Director of Manual Training in Public Schools, is anxious to have, wherever possible in our Indian schools as well as in his own schools, manual training instructors who are in the habit of keeping up to date by taking summer school courses under his direction. It seems to be quite possible that Mr. Shockley may be considered old-fashioned because he does not subscribe to these courses, and was not recommended by Mr. Kyle for appointment in the first instance. I am in agreement with Inspector Barry in that we should expect our instructors in manual training to keep reasonably efficient in their work; and if it is felt by the Indian Agent and the Inspector that a change is desirable in the interests of better work I would not place any obstruction in the way of such change.\nOttawa, May 6th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Inspector Barry's report regarding his visit to the Squamish Indian Residential School on March 23rd and 24th, last.\n\nMr. Barry considers that the services of the present manual training instructor, Mr. R. H. Shockley, are unsatisfactory and he recommends that Mr. Shockley's engagement be terminated as from the end of June.\n\nPlease discuss Mr. Shockley's services with the Reverend Principal of the Squamish School and advise the Department if you concur in Mr. Barry's suggestion.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n203-5 Rogers Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th ultimo regarding Mr. R.H. Shockley who is manual training instructor, part time, at Squamish Indian Residential School.\n\nI have discussed this matter with the Reverend Principal, Sister Mary Amy, and she is of the opinion that the best interests of the School will be served by making a change of instructor as it is felt that very little progress has been made under Mr. Shockley.\n\nIf the Department so desires I could take up with Mr. A.R. Tebb, the manual training instructor at Sechelt, the question of doing the work at Squamish in addition to Sechelt. I do not know whether he would be inclined to take on the extra work as he has a business of his own at Sechelt. If he could be induced to take on this work, I am sure the pupils would benefit under his instruction.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C. Ball]\nIndian Agent\n\nB/HM.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 8, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, regarding the services of the present manual training instructor, Mr. R. H. Shockley, at the Squamish Indian Residential School. It is noted the Rev. Principal and yourself are of the opinion that a change of instructor should be made. You may therefore notify Mr. Shockley that his services will not be required after the end of the present month.\n\nWhen arranging for the services of an instructor to replace Mr. Shockley, it would be desirable that you consult Mr. Inspector Barry. If he approves of your suggestion, that Mr. A. R. Tebb, the manual training instructor at the Sechelt Indian Residential School, be engaged to perform this work at the Squamish School also, the Department will agree to this arrangement. However, it is possible that Mr. Barry would be able to nominate the services of a competent man who could be appointed, and this might be more satisfactory than utilizing the services of Mr. Tebb for both schools. It is doubtful if he could give the necessary attention to the work for the two schools.\n\nI shall be pleased if, after consulting the Inspector, you will forward the name, qualifications, etc., of the man whom you recommend for appointment at the Squamish Indian Residential School, to succeed Mr. Shockley.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n203-6 Rogers Building,\nVancouver, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th instant regarding a change of instructor in Manual Training at Squamish Indian Residential School and have advised Mr. Shockley that his services will not be required after the end of the present month.\n\nI have just returned from Sechelt and consulted the Principal and Mr. Tebb. There is no doubt that Mr. Tebb's work has exceeded our expectations, and under his instruction the boys have done considerable repair work to the school, such as shingling and rebuilding sheds, etc., thus saving considerable money and giving the boys practical experience in work which they will be expected to do after they leave the school. In addition, Mr. Tebb, who is an experienced boat builder and has built a number of ships along the coast, is going to instruct the boys in boat building next term. This will be very valuable to the Coast Indians and more satisfactory probably than spending their time following the Provincial course of instruction.\n\nMr. Barry, Inspector of Schools, is not in favor of asking Mr. Tebb to take over the Squamish Indian School and he recommends Mr. Charles J. Merrick, 1248 Keith Road, Hollyburn, B.C., to replace Mr. Shockley. He states that Mr. Merrick is thirty-one years of age, married, holds a B.C. Manual Training Certificate and for the past four and a half years has been in charge of Manual Training in the District of North Vancouver and has been discharged recently on the plea of economy. Previously he was in charge of Manual Training at Ocean Falls for two years.\n\nMr. Barry.....\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMr. Barry states further that Mr. Merrick holds excellent testimonials and reports from Principals and Inspectors, including Mr. John Kyle, Provincial Director of Manual Training.\n\nI must admit that I am more in favor of practical instruction among Indians rather than the academic, and many of the Principals of the schools I have met agree with me but I understand Mr. Barry wants a certificated instructor.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C. Ball],\nIndian Agent.\nTo whom it may Concern,\n\nIntroducing Mr. Charles J. Merrick.\n\nIt was my privilege to be intimately associated with Mr. Merrick during his two years residence at Ocean Falls, B.C. As Manual Instructor in the Public and High Schools his work was very highly appreciated by the whole community.\n\nHe took an active part in our Church life being a member of the Young Men's Club and a Teacher in the Sunday School.\n\nHe is a young man of strong and sterling Character who would be a valuable asset in any community. I have much pleasure in recommending him to any one requiring his services as one whose influence among boys has always been for the making of good men.\n\nWith very best wishes for Mr. Merrick's success,\n\nI am, Yours very sincerely\n\n(Signed) Wm.

(Evening Classes.) 4 yrs.\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer again to your letter of the 8th instant and my reply of the 19th, regarding manual training instruction at Squamish Residential School, North Vancouver, B.C.\n\nMr. Merrick called this morning with the enclosed copies of testimonials in support of his application. The Rev. Father Maillard, Principal of the Sechelt Residential School happened to be in this office when Mr. Merrick called, and was able to tell Mr. Merrick some of his experiences with this branch of the work.\n\nFather Maillard is in complete agreement with me that the practical instruction given by Mr. Tebb is invaluable, and fits the pupils for the work they will find most useful after they leave school.\n\nThe Squamish School is in charge of Sisters, consequently the discipline has been lacking in manual training classes because the instructor cannot receive the same support as where there is a male principal. Father Maillard advises me that Mr. Tebb has always insisted upon strict discipline in his classes and knows how to handle Indian pupils and much of his success is due to it.\n\nI believe Mr. Barry was agreeably surprised when he inspected the Sechelt School, to find that the pupils knew the name of every tool, how to spell it and its use, which he had not found in other schools; also that some dovetailing work the pupils had done, could not be done as well...\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept.of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nas well by many carpenters.\n\nMr. Tebb is not a young man but advises me that if he did the work at both schools, he would not have to do any outside work. I may add that he has built all the big houses around Sechelt and many of the smaller ones. He also was called in by the Department to act as building inspector at the Sechelt Indian School when it was in some difficulty with the contractors during its erection. Mr. Tebb's family lives in Vancouver except for two or three months in summer when they go to Sechelt, so he would have no objection to travelling between the two schools.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C. Ball],\nIndian Agent.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. McGill.\n\nFor the past five years, the Department has provided a Manual Training Instructor at the Squamish Indian Residential School, North Vancouver, B. C. Approximately forty (40) lessons are given during the ten teaching months of the academic year and an allowance of $5.00 a lesson has been paid the instructor. Funds for this purpose are taken from the \"B. C. SPECIAL VOTE\".\n\nMr. Inspector Barry recently reported that the services of the present Manual Training Instructor, Mr. R. H. Shockley, are unsatisfactory, and he has recommended that Mr. Shockley's services be dispensed with. Mr. Agent Ball and the Reverend Principal of the Squamish Residential School concur in this recommendation.\n\nTo replace Mr. Shockley, Indian Agent Ball recommends Mr. A. R. Tebbs. For the last two years, Mr. Tebbs has been giving manual training instruction at the Sechelt Indian Residential School, Sechelt, B. C., and his services have been satisfactory as the instruction that he has given the pupils at the Sechelt School has been of a very practical nature and has included boat building; instruction in which is very useful to the Coast Indians.\n\nInspector Barry recommends the appointment of Charles J. Merrick, 1248 Keith Road, Hollyburn, B. C. This man is thirty-one years of age, holds a B. C. Manual Training certificate and, for the past four and a half years has been in charge of manual training in the district of North Vancouver, but has recently been discharged owing to the necessity for economy.\n\nI would appreciate your direction as to what action should be taken with reference to the appointment of a Manual Training Instructor at the Squamish Residential School.\nJune 28, 1933.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nDuring the past five years, the Department has provided a Manual Training Instructor at the Squamish Indian Residential School, North Vancouver, B.C.

Shockley, are unsatisfactory and recommends that they be dispensed with. He has suggested as an instructor Mr. Charles J. Merrick, 1348 Keith Road, Hollyburn, B.C. On the other hand the Indian Agent Mr. Hall has recommended that appointment of Mr. A. M. Tebus of Sechelt, B.C., who, during the past two years, has been giving similar instruction at the Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nIn view of the fact that we have these two recommendations I would be glad to have your direction as to who should be employed.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo: Mr. R.

The last item, a warehouse coat, was the personal property of the manual training instructor, C.J. Merrick.\n\nIt was discovered that one of the pupils Joe Charlie, aged 14, went to the teacher Sister Alix on December 29th and told her another Sister had sent him for the keys to the manual training school so that he could go in and close a window which had been left open. The Sister handed over the keys which were returned shortly after and nothing more was thought of it until school re-opened when the loss was discovered. The pupils were questioned and all denied knowledge of the theft but suspicion centred on Joe Charlie who was brought to this office for questioning. He finally confessed that he had not been sent for the keys at all, had taken the tools and hidden them under the school and later that day sold them to two white boys for fifty cents. These boys can not be traced as he said he had never seen them before or since. There is evidence to support the matter of the fifty cents because he took another boy to North Vancouver and spent it on soft drinks - which was verified later.\n\nI was in favour of sending the boy to the Industrial School, but the Sister Superior begged that he should not leave her school. After consulting the father of the boy who was very disappointed and angry, I acceded to the Sister's Superior request on condition that the boy was properly punished by his father. Unofficially I may say he was given a wholesome thrashing and later he apologized to his teachers and will refund $10.00 towards purchasing new tools. The manual training instructor also asked that the boy remain and continue his instruction, although he had lost a coat in the deal.\n\nPossibly the Department will consider that this matter was handled in rather an unorthodox manner, but personally I do not like to see Indian boys sent to the Provincial Industrial School as it does not improve them in the least--rather the reverse.\n\nThe loss will not be very much in excess of the $10.00 and every effort will be made to locate the boys who bought the tools, though I doubt if we shall meet with any........\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nany success.\n\nI intended reporting this matter fully, when it became necessary to request authority to replace the tools.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6468, file 889-11, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, February 7, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, regarding the theft of tools from the manual training department of the Squamish Indian Residential School. In this connection it is noted that the tools stolen, as shown on a list which accompanied your letter, were taken by one of the pupils, who has admitted the theft.

The keys were returned in a short time.\n\nThe loss of the tools was not discovered till school re-opened. When questioned the pupils denied knowing anything about it and suspicion fell on Joe Charlie, who was brought to the Indian Office and questioned. He admitted taking the tools, hiding them under the school and later selling them for fifty cents to two white boys, strangers to him. These boys were unable to be traced. Second hand stores in North Vancouver were checked but no trace of the tools were discovered.\n\nAfter consulting the boy's father, Charlie Antoine, the Indian Agent acceded to the request of the Sister's Superior, that the boy be allowed to remain in her school instead of being sent to the Industrial School.

This teacher instructs manual training three half days per week and gardening for 1/2 hours on two days. He is the only male member of the staff.\n\nI have not had an opportunity of seeing him give lessons but have examined the work of his pupils. This appears to be somewhat better than average.\n\nThis school is badly in need of a male member on the staff and I believe that encouragement should be given to the school to retain him.\n\nI recommend that the grant of $50.00 per month be increased to $85.00.\n\nR.F. Davey,\nDist. School Inspector.\nAir Mail\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 167-1-11 (W 1)\nRe: Manual Training Instructor\nSquamish Residential School\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of January 26th and application of Robert Chaland for appointment as manual training teacher at the Squamish Residential School, I am enclosing a memorandum dated February 2nd from District School Inspector Davey in this connection. You will note that Mr. Davey recommends Mr. Chaland's employment and payment of a grant of $85.00 a month to the school towards his salary.\n\nMr. Davey is away on an inspection tour but I understand that he interviewed Mr. Chaland and considers him suitable for the position and although it is doubtful if his services as manual training instructor would warrant a grant of $85.00 a month from the B.C. Special Vote it is doubtful if the school will continue to employ him unless assistance to this extent is given. As stated by Mr. Davey, the school is badly in need of a male member on the staff, in view of which I concur in his recommendation, the arrangement to be subject to review before the next academic year.\n\nW.S.

To supply the materials requested on this requisition would involve an expenditure of approximately $200.00. We do not feel that leather work has any great educational value, although it might be considered occupational work.\n\nWe are not prepared to allow all the articles listed on the requisition, but if you consider it advisable, you may arrange for purchase of leather work supplies at a cost not exceeding $50.00.\n\nIf you decide to make a purchase, the account when forwarded should be marked \"Pay from B.C.

There results an increased susceptibility to disease and often a marked falling off in ability to study.\n\nSubject to the approval of the Department I would respectfully suggest the name of Dr. E. Fraser Allen, an ex-service man, 825 Granville Street, Vancouver, B. C., as a legally qualified and professionally efficient dentist. His father is on the staff of the Department of Customs, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nM.D.\n\nCharles C.

Wilson, who recommends that the Department authorize necessary dental attention be given to those pupils of the St. Paul's Indian Boarding School at North Vancouver, who are found to require the same, and suggest ing the name of Dr. E. Fraser Allen as a legally qualified and professionally efficient dentist. In submitting this report, which will be self-explanatory, I would recommend that the Department allow Dr. Wilson to supervise with a dental practitioner such dental aid as may be found necessary for these pupils, after consultation with the principal of the School, as I am sure Dr. Wilson's discretion in this matter will be most satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. L. Perry,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSir:-\n\nA great many of the children of St. Paul's Indian School, Squamish Mission Indian Reservation, Vancouver Agency, have adenoids and diseased tonsils which increase their susceptibility to cervical adenitis or diseased glands of the neck, and pulmonary tuberculosis.\n\nSubject to the approval of the Department I would be pleased to remove the adenoids or abnormal growths and the diseased tonsils at St. Paul's Hospital, Vancouver, B.C., at any time. The time of the hospitalization of each patient would be approximately three days. There would be no other expense than that of the hospital.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.A. Wilson, M.D.,\nMedical Officer Vancouver Agency,\n\nCharles C. Perry Esq.,\nIndian Agent; Vancouver Agency,\n16 Hastings Street East, The Holden Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir,\u2014 I have the honour to transmit herewith a report of Dr. T.A. Wilson of Vancouver, which will be self-explanatory. Dr. Wilson seeks authority to give medical assistance which may be necessary to some of the pupils of the St. Paul's Indian Boarding School at North Vancouver. I would recommend that Dr. Wilson be given Departmental authority to give such medical and surgical aid as may be necessary for these pupils by arrangement with the Principal of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.C. Perry,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your two letters of the 30th ultimo, with reference to the medical and dental treatment required by the pupils of the Squamish Mission Indian Residential School and enclosing reports from the medical officer for the Vancouver agency regarding the best means for having the necessary treatment carried out.\n\nWith regard to the pupils requiring medical and surgical aid for adenoids and diseased tonsils, I have to say that Dr. Wilson may arrange to have the necessary operations performed. It is noted that the time of hospitalization of each patient will be approximately three days and that there will be no expenses other than that charged by the hospital to which the pupils are sent. The fees charged by the hospital should be the same as those charged for Indian patients. Only those pupils considered by the doctor, the principal and yourself as requiring operations or treatment should be dealt with. When the work has been completed you should forward properly certified vouchers covering the amount of the hospital fees due for each pupil. It is hoped that no unnecessary expenditure will be incurred and that the cost involved will be kept down to the lowest possible point.\n\nRegarding the dental attention, I have to request that you will state what arrangements it is intended to make in having the work carried out. Would the dentist perform the work at the school or would the pupils visit his office? I may say that the only dental work which the Department can allow is extractions and fillings and only in those cases absolutely requiring the same. We cannot authorize dental treatment in the case of pupils whose teeth are crowded or crowded. The cheaper materials should be used for fillings. Please state what fees Dr. Allan, the dentist recommended by the medical officer to perform the work, would charge for each extraction and for each filling, using amalgam for the purpose. You should also state approximately the number of children whose teeth require attention. When we have further particulars as to the amount of dental work to be done and the fees charged, we will then be in a position to consider authorizing this work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C.

C.\n\nEnclosure.\n(Dr. Allen; estimate)\n(for dental work for)\n(Indian children.)\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6468, file 889-13, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 7th last, No.167-1-13, having reference to the desirability of having pupils of the Squamish Indian Mission Residential School receive professional Medical and Dental attention as recommended by Dr. T.A.Wilson, the Department's Medical Officer here.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this matter was duly brought to the attention of Dr. Wilson, who has made a careful survey of pupils of the school in these regards and I now have pleasure in enclosing herewith a letter received from Dr. Wilson, dated July 8th, covering an estimate of Dr. E. Fraser Allen, Dentist, of Vancouver, enclosed therewith relating to dental work required to be done.\n\nIt will be noted that Dr. Wilson states that the prices quoted are approximately half the regular rates for dental work in the City of Vancouver. I shall be glad to be advised if the Department approves of the work recommended by Dr. Wilson being carried out at the rates thus specified by Dr. Allen.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.C.Ferry,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, July 28, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, regarding the dental work required by the pupils of the Squamish Indian Residential School and enclosing a communication from the medical officer, Dr. Wilson, covering an estimate made by Dr. Allen, dentist, of the cost and the amount of work to be performed.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange with Dr. E. Fraser Allen, 210-211 Coughlan Building, Vancouver, to perform the dental work absolutely required in the case of each pupil. We note that the cost of fillings and extractions, which work only is to be performed, is as follows:\n\nAmalgam or porcelain without local anaesthetic ............... $1.00\nAmalgam or porcelain with local anaesthetic .................. 1.50\nExtractions, without local anaesthetic ......................... .50\nExtractions with local anaesthetic for nerve blocking ...... 1.00\n\nAll material used, equipment and transportation is to be included in the above quotations and the work is to be done at the school. The dental work should be performed at a time satisfactory to the principal and when it will not interfere with the regular routine or classroom work of the school.\n\nWhen the work has been completed, you should forward a properly certified voucher, in duplicate, covering the amount due Dr. Allen for his services. This voucher should show the number of fillings and extractions, separately, and also whether done with or without local anaesthetics. The Department will rely on you to see that no unnecessary expenditure is incurred. It is to be understood that fillings are to be done only to permanent teeth and then only where absolutely necessary. Owing to the cost involved, due discretion should be used regarding the necessity for each filling and extraction performed.\n\nAs the pupils of this school are members of the Squamish Band, the cost of the dental work will be charged to the interest funds at the credit of that band, Account No. 54.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In the course of her duties she will visit your school, and it is desired to recommend her to your courtesy. The purpose of her visits will be to confer with you and the person in charge of the health of the pupils on matters which relate to their welfare. It is not expected that she will be able to offer many useful suggestions on her first visit, but with your kind co-operation she should prove of great assistance to you after she has gained experience. The nurse who has received this appointment has been in the employ of the Department before and has our fullest confidence in respect to qualifications, tact, and good judgment. It is hoped that you will receive great benefit from her services.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.S.

The last work of this kind performed at this school was in November, 1927. This school is located at North Vancouver, in the electoral district of Vancouver North. I shall be pleased to have the name of a dentist whose services should be engaged.\nOttawa, March 9, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, enclosing the report of the Travelling Nurse, Miss Gerry, on her visit to the Squamish Residential and Day Schools.

The fees allowed will be at the rate of 25 cents for each extraction and $1.00 for each amalgam filling. More expensive fillings are not authorized. In the case of temporary teeth, only extractions can be allowed. The work should be performed at the school, and all material, equipment and transportation expenses should be supplied by the Dentist. You should interview Dr. Dalby at your earliest convenience, and ascertain if he will carry out the work at the fees mentioned. If so, you should inform the Principal and arrange to have the work absolutely necessary carried out.\n\nThe Dentist should prepare a list, in duplicate, giving the name of each pupil receiving attention and the number of fillings and extractions performed by him in each case. He should hand this list to you, together with his account, in duplicate, for the amount due, which you will be good enough to certify and send to the Department for payment.\n\nPlease inform the Department if Dr. Dalby will accept the offer made, and the date upon which he would undertake the work at the above School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

It would be advisable if possible to have the Medical Officer check tonsil cases and general health before the children go out on the term holidays. Would also recommend that a Dentist visit the school in the near future if at all possible as many of the teeth need attention and if neglected mean the loss of the tooth and consequent impairment of health.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) H.E. Gerry\nPublic Health Nurse\nSir,\n\nMr. Agent Ball further states that he will attend to the matter of dental service to the pupils of the Squamish Residential and Day Schools, if the Department will authorize that such work be done. As it is thought that the visit of a dental surgeon is necessary at this School, I would recommend that one be sent there as on previous occasions and on like terms. The matter to be settled is as to the dentist who shall undertake the survey. Perhaps the Department will be good enough to advise me of its wishes in this regard.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) W.E.

Made the usual individual examination and spoke to the children individually of personal habits and conditions to be corrected.\n\nGave three class room talks, - Diet and care of teeth. At the time of my visit several of the children were absent from school, the teaching Sister informs me the irregular attendance is a regular habit with certain families. Visited the homes and found no legitimate reason for absence with the exception of one. Possibly if the Sister-in-Charge would report the week's absentees to the office a check up and consequent lessening of the number would result.\n\nCleanliness - Heads show improvement as to cleanliness both in the Residential and Day Schools.\n\nGeneral Health - Fair, a list of the children it would be advisable to have the Doctor examine enclosed.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) H.E.

Reported case Margaret Peters Musqueam to the Doctor. The morning of June 9th visited the Squamish Residential School. Made routine inspection and gave class room talks. As the Department requires that all pupils entering school and those leaving school be vaccinated, it would be advisable to have Doctor Willis visit and vaccinate in the near future as school no doubt closes about July 1st. Have asked the Sister Superior to have a list of those leaving school this term ready. Those at school Tuesday requiring Vaccination:\n\nMildred Lewis Gertrude Point Henry Charlie\nThomas Williams Teddy Williams\n\nNo doubt there will be more requiring Vaccination.\n\nExpect to visit Pemberton Reserve next week.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nTravelling Nurse.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6468, file 889-13, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nWith reference to vaccination Dr. Willis has the matter in hand and as soon as the list is prepared by the Sister Superior, he will visit the School and do these vaccinations.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) Fred J.C.

On November 16th, I made a most complete inspection of the premises, including the dormitories and the manual training department. On November 22nd, I timed my visit so as to be present when the mid-day meal was being eaten.\n\nSTAFF.\n\nThe Mother Superior is a most courteous lady and seems to be vitally interested in the health and general welfare of the children under her care. She seems to be frugal, but at the same time appears to be anxious that her pupils shall be comfortable and that the diet they receive shall be reasonably well balanced. She seems to be sincere.\n\nDuring the course of my visits, I was given every opportunity to thoroughly inspect the whole Institution. The entire Staff did everything they could to assist me.\n\nFOOD.\n\nThe meals served the children seem to be better than they would receive in their homes. There appears to be plenty to eat, although there is no waste.\n\nThe Mother Superior gave me an outline of the average daily menu as follows:-\n\nBreakfast - 7:30 A.M.\nPorridge with one-half cup of fresh milk.\nSugar in the porridge.\nBread and peanut butter, ordinary butter once or twice per week.\nWeak tea with milk.\n\nLunch - 12 Noon.\nMeat\nPotatoes\nBeans once or twice a week instead of potatoes.\nOne raw carrot per child\nOne apple\nOne-quarter loaf of bread.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nFile No. B-7-C.\n\nFour O'Clock Lunch.\nOne Piece of Bread.\nOne Apple.\n\nSupper - 6 P.M.\nPotatoes, boiled or baked.\nApple Sauce, jelly or preserves.\nBread\nCocoa.\n\nOn November 22nd, I was present during lunch and know that the menu was adhered to for that particular meal.\n\nSANITATION ETC.\n\nThe whole Institution was clean and well kept. The dormitories were tidy, and although perhaps a little crowded, were above reproach.\n\nIn conclusion I will say that from personal observations, I have made, I am of the opinion that the children are well nourished, well looked after and give one the impression of contentment. Most certainly they are not starved or neglected in any way.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. L.

Apparently this voucher arrived before you had returned to the office.\n\nI do not see how I could have this charge further itemized, but if you think you would rather not pass it as it is, I will have a new voucher for the Tincture Gentian P.D. by itself sent in, and will pay for the stove myself. I realize the impossibility frequently of passing these things in this form, but the school already has the stove, and I can see that the charge is paid without any inconvenience to myself if you prefer it that way.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMedical Superintendent.\n\nDoctor E.L.

Miss Berry will apparently have charge of the clinic and it will be greatly appreciated if she can find herself able to complete it in four days.\n\nThe rate allowed is $30 per day, net, and is to cover any expenses for materials or travelling costs which will be small. The class of work required is extractions with local anaesthetic and the cheaper type of fillings. The department is accustomed to receiving the co-operation of the dentist in a good day's work.\n\nIt is desired that a complete separation be made between the accounts for residential school pupils and for the other children as the funds are provided from different allotments. All accounts will be endorsed by Miss Berry and certified by yourself. It is not necessary that a list of the pupils names should reach Ottawa, but it is essential that the number of different operations\n\nP.J.C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n203-206 Rogers Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nbe specified. Miss Gerry undoubtedly will wish to keep a list of the names for her own records. The work may be done at any convenient time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.R.L.

The old building is altogether insufficient, and unhealthy. The school-room is too small, and too dark, and the health of the pupils is injured thereby. Last fall we were obliged to keep together with the other boys, some of them who were taken by a contagious disease.\n\nA new building about fifty feet long and twenty-five feet wide would remedy these grave inconveniences, by affording spacious school-rooms and a healthful dormitory. The old building would answer for the kitchen and refectory, and also for an infirmary, we have\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Superintendent\nNorth-Westerns\nB.C.\nIn means of building the new school house by ourselves. If you could afford to give us a sum of about five hundred dollars to assist us in building it, we would be very thankful to you, and you would do a great deal to improve the Indian youths.\n\nRelying upon you well known kindness,\n\nShare the honor too,\n\nSir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSigned A.M. Carson\n\nDirector of Allenschool\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to submit herewith for your consideration a copy of a letter which I have just received from the Rev. A.M.

I may remark, to give you an idea of the Oblate ability in using English, that the children are nearly all French and speak very broken English; the Indians had previously to my coming taken their children back in great numbers to the Mission of St. Joseph at Chilcotin. They said their children learned English from the Oblate Fathers and they were not well cared for by Bishop Lourier's intention of fixing...\nmy Englishman, for some time past.\n\nI may remark also that Simon, the teacher of the school, hath been sentenced and imprisoned for cruelty dealing an Indian Woman some years ago, and another Priest lately arrived, Walter Morgan being most severely admonished by the Judge in the recent Parliamentary Scandal.\n\nI have heard the injustice of the manner in which he proceeded in his proceedings against me, because I have refused to submit to his monstrous imposition & am contemptuously informed that I am not treated a civil in remuneration for my time & labor.

It is needless to say that (as he had no proposition to make) I refused to talk about Bishop Durien or his School, then the matter ended as far as that was concerned, so I will leave you to imagine how far Bishop Durien's apparent willingness to view the matter fairly is to be relied on\u2014\n\nI am Sir\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\n(Signed) Sylvester Stone\n\nP.S.

March 1895.\n\nMr. Sylvester Hone,\nSouth Vancouver.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 17th ultimo I have to inform you that I have been in communication with His Lordship Bishop Durieu respecting your case, and he appears to take a very fair view thereof. I would advise you to arrange your difficulties with him and accept of whatever settlement he might be prepared to offer you.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) A. W. Vowell,\nIndian Superintendent.\nNew Westminster, Feb. 27th, 1895.\n\nA. W. Vowell Esq.\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour favour of the 17th inst. and its enclosure have been duly received. You wish to have some information concerning the grievance Mr. Sylvester Hone appears to have in connection with the non-payment of salary alleged to be due for services rendered at St. Mary's School, Lower Fraser.\n\nI have the honor to state that Mr. Hone wrote me from St. Joseph College, Mount Angel, Oregon on the 25th February 1894 on the following terms: \"I am studying for the Holy Priesthood in the Seminary of the Benedictine Fathers here. I should very much like to eventually become a parish priest in your diocese, as I have relatives residing in the Province, I being now 28 years of age, I may state that I had to start latin again.\"\nagain from the commencement and that I made\nthe third class in a year and half, having\nbeen here now a year and seven months.\nThe great difficulty in continuing my\nstudies is that my Father's means will\nnot permit of my finishing my studies\nowing to his own indebtedness. Might I\nenquire if your Lordship could adopt me for\nyour diocese and enable me to do so.\n\nTo this demand of Mr. Hone I\nmerely replied that I was willing to adopt\nhim for my diocese. In May I wrote again to\nMr. Hone inquiring about the time he would\nprefer to come. He replied on the 11th. May\nthat he would prefer to come up after the\nclose of the session, the 25th. June, and\nno inquiries were made in same letter by\nhim as to where and how he should continue\nhis studies. Some time in the beginning of\nJuly, he came to see me in New Westminster.\nI then told him that after few weeks rest\nwith his parents, he would have to go to\nSt. Mary's Mission, where a Priest would be\nhis professor for his course of philosophy\nin Latin, and his director in the ecclesiastical training, and where also Mr. Hone would have to give class to the boys of the school every day. No demur was then made to that by Mr. Hone, in my presence. In the course of conversation I added that, if he would understand the Latin at the first sight or reading and if he would give full satisfaction in everything, most probably he would be through his preparation to the priesthood in three years.\n\nOn the second day of August Mr. Hone came to St. Mary's of his own free will and on the 3rd. August he commenced to teach the boys of the school two hours in the forenoon and two hours in the afternoon, receiving himself every day a class of Latin philosophy from the priest I had appointed to that purpose.\n\nOn the 25th. August Mr. Hone asked leave to go to his parents and pass a week or two with them. On the 12th. September he came back to the Mission and did resume his former regulation.\nregulation, except that he had only two hours class to the boys in the afternoon. Revd. Father Morgan, an Irish Priest, was then giving two hours class to them in the forenoon. Mr. Hone had everyday, except Sunday, a class of one hour duration given to him by his professor of philosophy.\n\nOn the 23rd. December, Mr. Hone went to Vancouver to pass the Christmas Holy Days with his parents and did not return any more.\n\nThe above is a correct statement of facts on which Mr. Hone takes ground for claiming a salary as teacher for over four months. Has he really a right to some salary?\n\nIn his application on the 25th. February 1894 to be received in my diocese as above mentioned, Mr. Hone asks the favour to be adopted by me for my Diocese. To adopt means to take a stranger into one's family as a son. To be adopted by a Bishop for his Diocese means, in the case of Mr. Hone, to be received as a young\nyoung aspirant to the Priesthood for my Diocese and consequently to be trained by me as one of my future priests and in the way I think best in order to render him worthy of the priesthood.\n\nSo have I understood the application and demand of Mr. Hone, and I have acted accordingly. I sent him to St. Mary's to be trained there to the Priesthood and in order to put him to work in acquiring the virtues and qualifications required in a Priest, I gave him so much time every day to pray in the chapel with the Priests of St. Mary's, I gave him so much time every day to teach the boys in the school, so much time to study his Latin and philosophy, I selected a professor to explain said philosophy to him during one hour every day.\n\nThe teaching of the boys given to Mr. Hone was only to be a means to train him in the acquisition of the virtues and the disposition required in a priest as a spiritual and religious adviser of the people. I had no\nno need of Mr. Hone for a teacher. Brother Collins, an Irish Teacher, has been the teacher of the boys these last six years and said Brother Collins was still at the Mission all the time Mr. Hone remained there. It is not true that I have given a month's notice to a teacher employed at St. Mary's school in order to make room for Mr. Hone. No teacher has been dismissed from St. Mary's school in April 1894, none in May, none in June, none in July, and none in August. Every man and child at St. Mary's may testify to this. Brother Collins was the teacher there, and when on the 25th. August Mr. Hone went down to Vancouver for a rest, Brother Collins resumed his former school occupation.\n\nWhen in our first interview at New Westminster I said to Mr. Hone that if he would understand the Latin at the first sight or reading and if he would give full satisfaction in everything, most probably he would be through his preparation to the Priesthood in three years, the realization of\nof this rested on the sole and essential if. But when Mr. Hone was put to the Latin of the book of philosophy, he was found deficient, he could not understand well such Latin nor translate it correctly. When also it was found that Mr. Hone had some aversion to many things required from him in order to train him to a true sacerdotal spirit my former word and saying \"if\" was not applicable to him. Thence came the declaration made to him that six years would be probably necessary to the priesthood.\n\nThe various complaints, though exaggerated, brought forward by Mr. Hone in his letter to you show indeed that he had to take time in acquiring the interior perfection to which an aspirant to the priesthood is bound to reach in order to become worthy. Mr. Hone complains of the food, but he was taking his meals with the Priests of St. Mary's and at the same table. Friday of course is a day of penance in the Catholic Church: meat is forbidden, consequently the food is poor on that day but\nbut the good Catholic does not complain, because it is a day sent for penance. If, after considering our way of living and the various practices required from him in view of his elevation to the priesthood, Mr. Hone comes to the conclusion that it is too hard for him and that he cannot stand it, he is perfectly free to retire. But am I bound in justice to pay him a salary for the hours he has been teaching in our school during the time of his probation? Am I in justice bound to give him compensation for time lost or for other expenses? In my humble opinion, I think that I am not bound to anything of the kind.\n\nMany young Catholics have been here with us in the same predicament as Mr. Hone and none have raised such pretensions to salary or indemnity. In order to show you that I have not followed with Mr. Hone an unusual or wrong way of acting, I may state that I have at present at New Westminster an ecclesiastical student. He is paying\npaying annually $150.00 for his board, he gives classes to the boys of our College and the Priest appointed for his Professor of Theology gives him three quarters of an hour only five days in the week in explaining the Latin book of theology.\n\nTo sum up I will say that at the demand of Mr. Hone I have admitted him as an adopted aspirant to the Priesthood for my Diocese and to work in my Diocese. I have admitted him without any conditions, as it is always done. I have given him board, lodging and washing. One of my Priests has been his Professor of philosophy in Latin. I think that I have been fair with him. If he resolves to retire, I am not the cause of it nor the cause of any loss of his time.\n\nI am not unwilling to make a present to Mr. Hone as a consolation stake; but Mr. Hone must leave me to determine the amount and he must agree beforehand that he will be satisfied with what I will give him, though said amount may be far\nfar from the $250.00 he claims as due payment of his loss of time, of his expenses and the injury he has sustained, as he writes in his letter of the 12th January last.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour humble servant,\n\n(Sgd) Paul Durieu\n\nR.

Vowell Esq.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to lay the following facts concerning the Roman Catholic Indian School at Mission, and the nature of my connection with it for your consideration and assistance.\n\nI must inform you to commence my statement, that I became a convert to the Roman Catholic Church a few years ago, and I went to the College of the Benedictine Fathers at Mount Angel, Oregon in 1892 to study for the priesthood. I remained at College two years when finding my own resources would not permit of my continuing my studies there this year without pecuniary assistance, I did as other clerical students do, endeavoured to get them paid by a Bishop, on condition of devoting ones future labours to the advancement of his diocese.\nHaving relatives resident in B.C., I naturally applied to Bishop Durieu of New Westminster last April to that effect, and received an answer from him in reply, \"That he would be very happy to adopt me for the continuance of my studies on condition of my eventually labouring in his diocese, if I could send him a written reference from the Benedictine Fathers as to my proficiency in translating just an ordinary Latin book and gave general good conduct etc.\n\nAs I was engaged in translating Antons Ceasar at the time, the Benedictine Fathers sent Bishop Durieu a very satisfactory reply in every respect; and I received another letter from him stating that the reference was perfectly satisfactory in every way, and would I like to come to Westminster at once. As Bishop Durieu had not given me particulars (as I had requested him) as to where I should continue my studies etc., I wrote him again to that effect, but in reply he evaded giving me a definite answer saying\nhe would explain all when I came to Westminster.\n\nOn vacation in June (with much difficulty and expense owing to the railway strike at the time) I came to Westminster fully expecting Bishop Durieu (as is customary) would reimburse me for the outlay, but nothing of the kind, and to my surprise he informed me that he had made arrangements for me to study philosophy and theology at Mission and to teach the school there, and when I demurred at not having been told these arrangements before leaving Oregon, I was told (after having lost other and as it proved then, better chances there, and having come a long and expensive journey on his account) \"Well, that was all he had to offer me\". He however assured me by going up to Mission I should get through all my studies in three years, and was very desirous \"On account of my health\" that I should first spend a month's holiday with my friends (And as I afterwards learned to enable him to give\na month's notice to a teacher employed at the Mission School).\n\nI went up to Mission on August 1st, and had the entire charge of the school with attendance at all the spiritual exercises of the Oblate Community and study of Senerinos Philosophy imposed on me. I continued all these duties for a month and then owing to the constant mental strain without the least time for relaxation or exercise I became so unwell from dyspepsia that I had to return again to my friends to recuperate.\n\nAfter two weeks absence I received a letter from Father Chirouse the Director of the School, stating that Bishop Durieu had sent Father Morgan then up to Mission to help me with the school, (though I learnt afterwards Father Morgan's presence there was owing to the strong condemnation by the judge of his conduct in intimidating a witness in the penitentiary scandal) I however returned shortly afterwards and resumed my studies in the morning.\nI may remark here that I always experienced great difficulty in obtaining instruction from the Fathers there, owing to their very Frenchified Latin pronunciation, and their ignorance of any but the most crude and simple words in the English language.\n\nIt is utterly impossible that they (including Bishop Durieu) can teach Boys English when they can neither speak it or write it correctly themselves, and though they draw two thousand dollars yearly from the Government for the proper maintenance and instruction of the twenty two boys in their school. Bishop Durieu in a recent letter to myself states that \"He never has at any time paid a salary to a teacher for them\" and as they do not spend a cent of the money to clothe them, but leave them to be insufficiently and wretchedly clad by their friends. I can only surmise at what they do with the money. I know that I frequently spoke to Father Chirouse about their not having suitable books for geography and other\nother studies, and complained about the supply of books being insufficient and dilapidated, but to no effect. I know too, that they were frequently employed out in the fields when according to the code of rules sent by the Government for their regulation, they were supposed to be in school acquiring an education. I purposely omitted signing the marks in the record for their attendance, because I did not wish to mark down their being in attendance at school when they were not.\n\nI returned again and taught school in the afternoon rising at five in the morning attending all spiritual exercises of the community and studying myself in the morning and to continue my statement my relatives desired me to ask Bishop Durieu in November if he was willing (to do as other Bishops do) provide me with clothes etc. especially as I was chiefly employed in teaching his School, and he had never contributed a cent towards my expenses so far. I did so, and was told by Bishop Durieu that he would supply me\nme with clothes from the store of cast off garments given them for the Lay Brothers to work in, and a pair of shoes when those I had were on the ground, and I must not imagine that I could continue wearing linen shirts as I had been accustomed to, but in future a flannel shirt must serve me both summer and winter. He would also require me to study and teach school four years. He also must insist on my making no further excuse to Father Chirouse opening and examining all my letters before I received or sent any away. I must fast more rigorously too, I asked for time to consider these conditions. I may state that the living there is frugal and scanty in the extreme. I had nothing but bread and coffee, salt salmon and potatoes on the many fast days and I could not fast more than I did then. I may mention too that Father Chirouse, the Director of the School, and who was also appointed my spiritual adviser, is the same priest who so unmercifully beat a poor Indian woman some time.\ntime ago and was imprisoned in consequence.\n\nOn Dec. 20th, I received intimation through a letter from Bishop Durieu to one of the Fathers at the Mission \"That I should then be required to study and teach school six years instead of three as first agreed on. I must at once allow Father Chirouse to examine all my letters and fast more strictly. I at once said these conditions were entirely different to those under which I had been induced to teach their school five months, and that I should not continue there any longer unless I remained until I could obtain some position elsewhere.\n\nI learnt a few days later that Bishop Durieu had again written stating that I might remain as long as I liked, providing that I taught school, but I must not expect to receive a cent in payment from him. I however came to Vancouver and consulted with my relatives, who advised me to\ndemand payment of Bishop Durieu for the time I had been employed by him under misrepresentation to teach his school.\n\nIn the meantime I received a letter from Father Chirouse stating that he was awaiting my return to open up school again.\n\nBishop Durieu steadily refuses to recompense me in any way for the tuition I have given his school or for the loss I have sustained, and I leave it to you, Sir, to judge whether recompense should not be given me, for the time I have taught the school. I do not include in this the cost, the loss of other positions, the expense of travelling and the wear and tear of my clothes etc. in the same cause. And I trust that in any way it is in your power to aid me against this injustice being perpetrated on me you will kindly do so. And oblige\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n(Sgd) Sylvester Hone.\n\nP.

The pupils are well clad, well fed, and have sufficient books for their requirements. The teacher in the Boys' School, Brother Collins, is an Irishman. The Sisters in charge of the Girls' School are also Irish and educated. They teach the English language fluently and distinctly. It is quite true that Rev. Father O'Brien does not speak English very well, but he only looks after their religious instruction, and does not pretend to act as a teacher. No one could be justified in saying that the pupils were engaged working in the fields when they should have been at school, was during the time they were digging potatoes last fall. A few of the older boys gathered potatoes for a few afternoons, having had to school in the forenoon only. If the older boys were employed more outside on the farm, they would have been better off when they returned to their own homes.\n\nI have written Mr. Hays and requested him to meet me in Vancouver whenever it would be convenient for him, but he has not answered my letter and I have been unable to see him personally. His letter appears to be written more from personal spite than a desire to do any good, and I don't think it is worth while to give any further notice to it.

The report is for the year ending on April 1st, 1896, and shows that within the year the area of Great Britain devoted to wheat has been diminished by somewhat more than 2 per cent., in percentage it is 20.5, and in acres 30,330 acres. The decrease is uniform throughout the country, every county practically in England, since wheat beans are grown only in some areas, and therefore a great deal of the whole wheat area over 30 per cent., is English. This is clear proof that feeding sheep has already gone far. It approached too much for the British farmer to attempt to sustain. So great a diminution could not prevent from being due to certain causes, but must be the result of a settled conviction of the hopelessness of the contest, or the strong feeling against countries where land so much cheaper and agricultural labor not equally dear than our own can produce the best. The natural question ensues, To what is the land hereafter to be devoted? What more productive crop than wheat growing? There is a considerable increase in the acreage of potatoes, and an increase also of the number of \"improved pastures,\" though the grass is still not sown as far in Scotland as in other parts of Great Britain. The increase in the number of pigs raised. This increase is about an equivalent to about one-fifth of the wheat area. The American farmer should be much interested in this information. While he discovers that without the advantage of high land values, he cannot grow as much wheat as he could if the prices were higher, he must also discover that the wheat market is wider open to him than ever before. He cannot avoid advertising his product all over the world, about to be made upon the American farmer. If he wishes to have his work declared non-commercial, it must be stronger than ever before.\n\nIRVING APPRECIATED.\n\nThe telegraphic despatches from Montreal a few days ago stated that the appearance of Sir Henry Irving's new company was anything but a success. The reviewer said: \"It is more than a grain of salt by Sir Henry Irving himself, who has perceived with feelings of journalistic regret what might have been. The piece represented was 'Faithless,' which was imperfectly presented at Montreal, the applause would not so well filled as most people had expected. The vacant seats down stairs probably expressed the opinion of those whom over-anxious spectators had familiarized with anticipated productions.

The Department sees no reason why such a sum should be continued in British Columbia where provisions and supplies are cheaper, if anything, than in the Territories, and where the expense for fuel is a very small item in comparison to what it costs for heating similar Institutions east of the Rocky Mountains.\n\nMuch as the Department would like to meet your wishes in regard to the proposed change it fears that it will not be able to do anything in this direction for some time to come.

Gen. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have the honor to bring to your notice the annexed letter of the Rev. Father Benson, Principal of St. Mary's Indian Boarding School in the Fraser River Agency.\n\nIn their desire to lead on their offsprings more and more in the path of civilization, the Fraser River Indians are most anxious to see their children educated in an Industrial School. Such desire is surely very laudable and it were good policy on the part of the Indian Department to encourage and foster so good a disposition in our Natives. In the case in point the wish of the Indians could be met by simply enlarging the Government Grant to St. Mary's Indian School.\n\nThis school is deserving of great credit for all the good it has accomplished in favor of the Indians who attended it since its opening in 1862. Besides its central location and other advantages, its efficiency is equal in all respects to that of the other Industrial Schools in British Columbia.\n\nAs a proof of this efficiency I have but to refer you to the testimony of Mr. Hayton Reed, your Esteemed Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, who visited the school last August and was present at an examination where he could personally convince himself of the progress made by the pupils.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6468, file 890-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nNew Westminster, B.C.,\n\nAs another proof of the efficient training given to the children in this school I might mention that their work was rewarded with ten first and two second prizes at the Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition held in New Westminster last week.\n\nAs a practical solution of the question of meeting the wish of our Fraser River Indians, I humbly beg that the St. Mary's Indian Boarding School be declared an Industrial School with an annual capitation grant of \u00a3150.00 dollars for each of fifty pupils and thus be placed on the same footing as all the Industrial schools now established in British Columbia.\n\nI feel confident that your good will towards our Indians, your readiness to foster their laudable desire to advance in civilization and your very well known interest towards our Indian schools will urge you on to give a favorable answer to my present request.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nHonorable and Dear Sir,\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nPaul Durieu, O.M.I.\nRoman Catholic Bishop of New West.\nSt. Mary's Mission, B.C. Oct. the 7th 1895\n\nRev. Rev. Davies, D.D.\nBishop of New Westminster\nB.C.\n\nMy Lord,\n\nHaving to meet in our Indian School a good many new exigencies with which we cannot cope without the benevolent help of the Dominion Government, we humbly beg of Your Lordship to lay our case before the proper Authorities.\n\nDuring the last few years, the number of our pupils has almost doubled and is still increasing. This is due to the consoling fact that the Fraser Indians have made considerable progress in civilization. The old pupils of our school are now fathers and mothers of families; they understand better the advantages of education and wish to have their children properly educated. Therefore they ask us to take them in our school expecting us to supply tuition, board, books etc. To answer to their praiseworthy wish of advancing in civilization we used all the efforts in our power to give the pupils the training best adapted to make of them good and useful people in every way.\n\nWe receive from the Dominion Government\nSt. Mary's Mission, B.C.\n\na grant of $60 per capita for 40 pupils. This is certainly a great help for the school, but as I have before, the number of the pupils having almost doubled, it is now very insufficient even to keep the children we received, and besides, with great regret, we have been obliged to refuse many applications only for not being able to afford their board.\n\nWe are, therefore, compelled to humbly beg of the Indian Department to endow us as a Government Industrial School with an allowance of $130 per capita, which is granted to the other industrial schools. Should this be done, we will be enabled to give a good education to the children of our Fraser River Indians.\n\nBefore ending I must remark that our pupils are all full-blooded Indians, all belong to the Government Reserves of the Fraser River Agency and come from the reserves which are situated along the Fraser from Yale to the mouth of the River.\n\nKnowing the great interest you take in the Indian children we have every hope that you will not refuse to present our request and that coming from you it will be favourably received by the Indian Department.\n\nI am respectfully yours,\n\nE.

E. M. Bunoz.\n\nYou will remember that the year before last in a conversation with the Rev. Fr. McCookin and myself you promised to have this school declared an Industrial School last Session.\n\nI think that Mr. Reed's visit there this year will have convinced him of the importance of the school and I hope therefore that you will see your way to having the necessary grant made to it in the estimates this year as an Industrial School.\n\nIf you decide to do this would you kindly let me know and much oblige.\n\nYours truly\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Dictated)\nOttawa, 28th October, 1895.\n\nMy dear Lordbishop,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 14th instant enclosing one from the Revd.

I can only say to Your Lordship in the concluding words of your letter, that with my good will toward the Indians, and my readiness to foster their laudable desire to advance in civilization, and the interest I take in Indian Schools, I shall endeavour to do my best to meet Your Lordship's wishes. Your Lordship will understand that however willing I am to help you in this matter my ability to do so will be measured entirely by the amount of money I may be able to get for the purpose.

I recollect the conversation I had with yourself and the Revd. Father McGuckin last year in reference to the St. Mary's School, but I do not recollect making, as you state, any promise to have this School declared an Industrial School. We make no promises in matters of this kind unless we are in a position to carry them out. All that I said to Father McGuckin and yourself was that I would do my best to meet his wishes. I was not able to do so and I may again fail. You can understand that I am only too glad and desirous to help this Indian School, but my willingness is too often defeated by my inability to procure the funds necessary. We are expending large sums\n\nG. E. Corbould, Esq., M. P.,\nNew Westminster,\nB. C.\nsums of money now on Indian Schools, and it is with the greatest difficulty that I can satisfy either the Government or Parliament that we are justified in making the large expenditure we are doing. I am fully aware of the importance of this School and will do my best to meet His Lordship's wishes, but as I have not the sole say in the matter I do not wish His Lordship to be disappointed if I should not chance to succeed in my efforts.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.) T. Mayne Daly.\nOttawa, 26th October, 1895.\n\nDear Mr. Reed,\n\nI enclose, herewith, a letter from Mr. G. E. Corbould, M. P., Bishop Durieu, and Revd. Father Bunoz in reference to having St. Mary's Mission School made an Industrial School, and consequently increasing the grant thereto. Copies of my reply to Mr. Corbould and His Lordship are attached. Please see that an item is inserted in the Estimates for the coming year that will admit of this School being brought up to the standard of an Industrial School.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHayter Reed, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Mr. Daly,\n\nReferring to the correspondence relative to advancing the St. Mary's Boarding School to the status of an Industrial Institution, I would say that during our recent visit to the coast I had come to the conclusion that the amount - $130 - being paid to the institutions of the latter kind should be soon decreased, as I saw but little reason why they should not be run upon nearly as cheap a basis as those on this side of the Mountains. In Industrial Institutions the Department requires that apart from farming and gardening the boys should be taught two trades and the girls all household and womanly duties. With your permission, instead of increasing the amount per capita ($60), I shall estimate for an increased number of pupils, say 80, which will double the number now authorized. I am prompted to this, as in a conversation with the Rev. Father McGuckin yesterday, he told me, after I had explained my views, that they were what he thought the Department would do and seemed satisfied.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6468, file 890-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nand said that he had written the Church authorities, prior to seeing me, that he felt this would be all the Department would do under the circumstances.

The rate allowed is 60 dollars for each of sixty pupils. Experience has proved that for 60 dollars a year a pupil cannot be provided with board, clothing, books, stationary, medical attendance, medicine &c., to say nothing of keeping the school up to the high standard demanded by the Government and expected by the parents of the children.\n\nEntirely at our own expense we have erected at a cost of $18,000.00 two separate school buildings, one for girls under the management of four Sisters of St. Ann, the other for the boys under two Fathers and two lay teachers. There is ample accommodation for forty-five children in each school.\n\nIn our anxiety for the advancement of the Natives we expended this large sum under the impression that the Federal Government would furnish the means to carry on these schools for the benefit of an Indian Catholic population of over 1300.\n\nA careful census taken this year shows that there are 1635 Indians living in the valley of the Fraser River from Yale to its mouth and that 1356 are members of the Catholic church.\n\nIncluded amongst those Catholics are many heads of families who were educated at St. Mary's Boarding School, that school having been established in 1861, upwards of 25 years ago, and having been educated there themselves they wish to send their children there likewise. Seventy-seven of their children are at present inmates of St. Mary's School.\nThe golden rule of the Federal Government being, not to disturb the faith of the Indians but to leave them to the guidance of those who converted them to Christianity, I hope and trust that you will help those Catholics to have their children educated in the school of their faith and choice, placing them on a level with the Indians who send their children to Coqualeetza Methodist school at Chilliwack.\n\nThe Dominion Government having found it advisable to grant to the Methodist school at Chilliwack $150 dollars per head for fifty pupils, should, it seems to me, grant the same amount for fifty pupils at St. Mary's Boarding School.

In adopting this manner of dealing with the Indians the Canadian Government has earned for itself the reputation of wisdom, prudence and humaneness. In being guided by a spirit of tolerance and respect for the religious convictions of the Indians, the Federal authorities have shown that they understood the character of these people, who when once converted, are generally deeply religious.\n\nIf the same policy shall in future pervade the legislation for Indians, and guide those who are commissioned to apply the laws, the authorities will always find a docile and submissive people.\n\nWhen in pursuance of this policy the governments, in the past, have\ngranted pecuniary aid to the school authorities of various denominations, they did so under the conviction that the help voted for the Indians would more surely and efficaciously reach those for whom it was intended. The Indians themselves understand it in that light and we know from experience that money thus spent for them is the most profitable to them, since it reaches them through the channels of their acknowledged and revered guides, who know best how to devote it to their highest interests. The sums thus granted cannot be considered excessive when it is considered that the Indians in British Columbia have handed over their former lands so peaceably. Moreover, it is well to remember that as our Indians receive no allowance of any kind, other than that for education, they are obliged to furnish themselves with food, clothing etc., for which they have to pay and so they are an inconsiderable source of revenue to the Dominion since they help by their labor to the development of commerce, and since they share in bearing the custom taxes which go to the Dominion.\n\nWhile rendering due homage to the good intention of past governments as to their Indian policy in British Columbia, we feel it however, our duty to take exception to one feature of the course followed heretofore. We beg leave to expose our views before you.\n\nSince the government granted pecuniary aid for the education of the Indians in this Province, it seems to us that the plan of distribution ought to have been so devised that all those Indians who are desirable to improve by education, could have shared proportionately in these grants. Again, since the government made it a rule to make the grants to the denominational schools as such, this distribution, to be equitable, should have been made in such a manner that the amounts, allowed for each Denomination, should have been in\nproportion to the number of adherents of each denomination.\n\nSuch, however, we regret to say, has not been the course followed. We show this to be the case by means of the accompanying table marked \"A\" (see at Reference attached to back).\n\nProportionate Distribution of School grants in the Province of British Columbia.\n\nThis table (A) has been prepared from the Annual Report of the Department of Indian Affairs for 1896.\n\nTaking the official figures given in the Departmental Report, 1st as to the population in each agency, 2nd as to the number of Catholics in each agency, and 3rd as to the school grants, and comparing the amounts granted with the numbers of Indians belonging to each Denomination we see:\n\nThat the proportionate amount allowed to the Protestants by far exceeds that given to the Catholics.\n\nThe number of Catholic Indians in B.C. = 12523\n\nProtestant in B.C. = 6769\n\nThe total school grant for Catholics was $29,000\n\nProtestants was 22,060\n\nIf these sums were divided equally amongst the Catholics and Protestants respectively, the Protestants would each receive 41 per cent more than the Catholics. This is a very sensible difference. The Catholic Indians having the same rights as the Protestant they should be treated on equal terms and we know of no reason why the governments, in the past, should have acted with such discrimination in this matter, nor is there any reason why this inequality of treatment should not be removed by the present administration.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6468, file 890-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nProportionate Distribution of School Grants in the Fraser River Agency.\n\nWe next call your attention, Honorable Sir, to the distribution of School Grants in the Fraser River Agency, where the inequality of treatment appears truly offensive.\n\nIn order that all our assertions may be controlled by figures we have arranged a second table (marked B) where the population by camps and by religious denominations, as well as the school grants, are given in a more detailed form.\n\nWe have classified the bands into three groups. The first group contains all the bands living on the Fraser River proper. The second comprises those bands living on the sea coast, and the third, those living north of Harrison Lake. As there are three Indian Schools subsidized by the Government one under Catholic direction, one under Methodist and one under Anglican, we have also given the number of Indians of each of these three Denominations. The number of children of school age in each camp is also given.\n\nBy this table we see that the number of Catholic Indians in the Agency is 2703\n\nMethodist 151\n\nChurch of England Indians in the Agency 94\n\nThe School Grants in 1896 were as follows:\n\nto Catholics $2400\n\nto Methodists 2210.\n\nto Church of England 1500.\n\nWhich sums when divided proportionately would allow a per capita to Catholic 38 cents, to Methodists $14.63, to Church of England $15.95.\n\nThus it is seen that the Catholics have fared very badly in comparison to the others.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6468, file 890-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIf now the grants allowed for 1897 (which were voted in 1896) are compared, the difference or treatment is simply confounding:\n\nGrant to Catholic School $3000, to Methodists $3000.\n\nto Church of England $3000., which, when divided proportionately give a per capita of\n\nto Catholics $1.20, to Methodists $43.00 to Church of England $31.91.\n\nNow, any one will naturally think that the grants given to a school or a particular agency are to be devoted to the education of the children of that agency.\n\nAgain, as the grants are given to the Denominational schools as such, one also will naturally infer that the school authorities will devote the subsidies received to the children of the particular denomination under which the school is placed.\n\nBut in the case under consideration neither the Methodist nor the Church of England School can show a number of children of their respective denominations and belonging to the agency, which could justify them in receiving the grants which they receive at present.\n\nOn the other hand the Catholic school received an amount totally inadequate to the number of Catholics who are living on the Agency, and who have a right to share equally in the public money devoted to their agency.\n\nWhy should the other schools, especially the Coqualeetza Institute of Chilliwack, receive amounts out of all proportion to the number of children whom the authorities can justly lay a claim to? It is impossible to answer this question unless we should admit that the government granted this disproportionate sum to enable the Methodist school authorities to carry on proselytism among the Catholic Indians.\nWe do not wish, however, to affirm that such is the intention of the government, but what we may affirm, and, what can easily be proved, is, that the school authorities of the Coqualeetza Institute, have drawn and are still trying to draw Catholic children to their school, which is a course entirely opposed to the spirit of the Indian legislation, as may be seen by Orders in Council issued at various times, and more recently on November 10th, 1894* A.Y.L. (14).\n\nAs a conclusion of all that we have laid before your enlightened consideration, Honorable Sir, and on the strength of the justice of our demand, we ask that the Government increase the annual grant to St. Mary's Mission Boarding School.\n\nIn order that this School may be placed on a proper footing of efficiency as a Boarding School, and to enable it to answer better to the requirements of so many who have a claim upon it, we ask that the Government give a yearly allowance of $100. per capita for at least 70 children.\n\nAfter what we have shown on table 'B', of this memorial, we need not insist further on the necessity of providing for a larger number of pupils than this school was able to receive up to the present.\n\nNow, as to the increase of the per capita grant from $60. to $100., we must say that the present allowance of $60. is entirely inadequate to defray all the expenses for a child's keep. This sum hardly paid for the board, and the school has to furnish the children with books, provide fuel, light and clothing. etc. etc.\n\nMoreover, considering that the Mission has done so much for the instruction of the Indians of the Fraser River since 1862, date when the school was established, and, considering what it is still\ndoing for the same purpose, the Government ought not to defer any longer the granting of the much needed increase, namely $100. for 70 children, instead of the present all too insufficient allowance.\n\nWe have the honor to be,\n\nHonorable Sir,-\n\nYour humble servants,-\n\n+ Paul Dumas\nBishop of New Westminster\n+ Augustin Dorion\nCoadjutor Bishop-\n\nNew Westminster, B. C.\n\nNovember 5th. 1897.-\nWith reference to the application made personally by His Lordship Bishop Doctonell of New Westminster, B.C., for an increased grant to the St. Mary's Mission Boarding School, viz., that provision be made to pay for 100 children at $70 per capita instead of for 60 pupils at $60 as at present, I urge upon His Lordship that such an increased allowance would put this school on a much higher basis than any other boarding school in British Columbia, the other three schools of this class receiving the following grants:\n\n(C.E.) Fort Bay Girls' Home 10 pupils at $60\n(South) Port Simpson do 20 do $60\n(C.E.) All Hallows, Yale 35 do $60\n\nI observe the draft of a letter on file from the Superintendent General to His Lordship Bishop Durien, dated the 25th Jan., last, in which the minister stated that he could not hold out any promise that during the present fiscal year (1897-98) any changes would be made in respect to the St. Mary's School.\nAt that time Bishop Durieu's application was for a grant of $130 per capita for 50 pupils. The present application is, therefore, for a much smaller grant.\n\nIt may be well to make a comparison between the Indian Boarding School and the industrial schools in British Columbia, by giving a list of the grants to the schools of the latter class:\n\n- Metlakatla 50 pupils at $120 (i.e., 25 boys at $160; average $120)\n- Alert Bay 35 pupils at $130\n- Kamloops\n- Kootenay\n- R.C. Hughes Island\n- Williams Lake\n- (Vest) Coquihalla 80 pupils at $130\n\nH.C.

Bedard, Principal of St. Mary's Mission Indian Boarding School, reporting that three pupils have run away from the School, and requesting that Indian Department defray the expenses of returning said pupils. I saw the father of pupil No. 48 (Dan Chen) and he positively refused to compel his son to return to the School, and it will be necessary to send a constable to arrest the boy in order to compel his return. This will of course entail expenses Constable fees, Railway fares etc.\n\nThe parents of the other two pupils are dead and I think as soon as they are located can without any legal process be induced to return to School, but even in returning them to School certain expenses may have to be incurred such as Carriage hire, Railway or Steamboat fares. I notice in the Regulations relating to the education of Indian children that the Boarding School at St. Mary's Mission is not mentioned; and I presume should the pupils be arrested they will likely be committed to St. Mary's Mission School.

With regard to Ivan Chau, the missionary priests, Rev. Fathers O'Brien and Rohr, have completely failed in their efforts to bring him back to school. George Chau and Patrick Sheehy have not been heard of since they left the school. They are two orphans having no guardians on whom we can much depend, hence, if their respective chiefs fail to return them to school some other way to do so than to cause a warrant to be issued, authorizing some person to search for and take them back to school.\n\nBut this will cause expenses which under the circumstances I cannot afford to incur. For, as you are well aware, the annual per pupil grant of $60.00 to pupils, which we receive from the Government is not even sufficient to pay the cost of the pupils' board at school. Hence all other expenses of the school have to be paid by the St. Mary's Mission whose resources are very limited. The work of my duty and that of two lay brothers working with me goes every quarter toward balancing the deficit.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6468, file S90-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit herewith for your information the following correspondence relative to pupils belonging to St. Mary's Boarding School who have played truant and are absent from school without leave:\n\nThe Agent's letter dated 19th instant covering the Rev.

The first case developed on Monday last, and during the week four cases in all were moved to the infirmary. These cases are all on the boys' side. There was an outbreak of the disease on Hatzic Prairie, & the contagion, no doubt, has come from there.\n\nNow, this is a curious business. I reported the matter to Fagan, & he says all the children ought to be immunized. This, of course is true; but the expense!\n\nI used the Antitoxine, and the four cases are doing well; but I fear the end is not yet, by any means. It would cost in Antitoxine alone, about $200 to immunize both schools. Will you kindly instruct me by return.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n(sgd) A.J. Stuart.\nIndian Office, New Westminster, B.C.,\n389/4 March 6, 1905.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a copy of a letter dated the 5th instant received by me today from Dr. Stuart of Mission City, reporting four cases of Diphtheria in the boys' division of St. Mary's Mission Boarding School, and asking for instructions as to whether all the pupils should be immunized. I wrote the Doctor stating that unless other cases continued to appear, it did not seem to me to be necessary to have the pupils immunized, and with proper precautions there should not be any danger of the disease spreading to the girls' School, as the two buildings are considerable distance apart.\n\nI would thank you to advise me what should be done in regard to the Doctor's suggestions if other cases continue to appear.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd) R.C. McDonald,\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to forward herewith for the information of the Department a copy of a letter, dated the 6th instant, No. 389/4, received from Mr. Agent McDonald of the Fraser Agency to which is attached a copy of a communication of the day previous addressed to him by Dr. A. J. Stuart of Mission City reporting the illness of four of the pupils of the boys' branch of the St. Mary's Mission Boarding School of Diphtheria, who, according to the statement of the doctor, were removed to the infirmary.\n\nFor the Department's further information I may state that the Indian Superintendent left Victoria for the Fraser Agency by this morning's steamer where he will see Mr. Agent McDonald who has just been requested by telegraph to notify the Superintendent of the outbreak in order to receive from him the necessary instructions for the care of the four cases and the prevention of the spread of the disease to the other pupils (boys and girls) of the institution. Dr. Stuart remarks that\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nthat he reported the matter of the outbreak to Dr. C. J. Fagan, Secretary of the Provincial Board of Health, Victoria, B. C., who advised that all the children of the school be immunized the cost of which, for Antitoxine alone, Dr. Stuart states would be about $200.00. Being on the ground the Superintendent will be placed in possession of such such information by the doctor and Mr. Agent McDonald as will enable him to readily give the necessary instructions in the matter.\n\nThe attention of Mr. Agent McDonald was drawn to what appears to be an important point concerning which nothing is stated either by Dr. Stuart or himself, viz\u2014 the sanitary condition of the institution. Mr. McDonald has been asked to inform this office if all the closets, drains, etc. about the premises are in a thoroughly sanitary state and if the drinking water is pure also whether garbage be allowed to accumulate about the school grounds and if the vegetables consumed at the institution are obtained from an unquestionable source.\n\nThe Agent has been asked to report to this office from time to time as to the progress made in the treatment of the disease that the Department may have full information with respect thereto.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nfor the Indian Superintendent, B.

Every possible precaution was taken to prevent the spread of the disease and there has been no new cases since my report of the 8th instant; and the four pupils affected are getting along nicely. Dr. Stuart is now of the opinion that there will be no other cases.\n\nThe sanitary conditions of the School are first class, the water supply is pure, and the vegetables used are all grown on the farm attached to the School and are of the best quality.\n\nIn regard to the remark in Dr. Stuart's letter that the contagion is supposed to have come from Ratnic Prairie where there was an outbreak of the disease, I may say that that district was properly quarantined when the nature of\n\nA. W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria, B.C.\nthe disease became known, but none of the people from there had been at church at the mission before it was known that diphtheria was in their district, and as the pupils of the school attend the same church, it is thought that they must have caught the disease in this way.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nBritish Columbia.\n\nIndian Office,\nVictoria, March 15th, 1905.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to letter from this office of the 8th instant, No. Q. 4., 5II, on the subject of the outbreak of diphtheria at the St. Mary's Mission Indian Boarding School, Fraser Agency, B.

It was also stated in the letter that two of the pupils of the girls' school were down with the same disease, and that the school was quarantined by Dr. Stuart, the Department's medical officer for that locality. Dr. Stuart has not yet reported to me, but I have written to him to send a full report for the information of the Department, which, when received, will be forwarded to you.\n\nFather Marchoal signed the quarterly school returns on Monday, and they were received at this office the same day, accompanied by a covering letter in which he stated that he was very sick, but did not mention the nature of his ailment. I was checking over these returns this afternoon, and had just finished doing so when I received the news of the Principal's death from diphtheria, and I felt a little scared that the disease might be carried here in the papers, until I consulted one of the local doctors, who said there was very little danger if the Principal had merely signed the returns. However, I at once took the precaution to have them thoroughly disinfected before forwarding them to you.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nA. W.

Father Marchal must have contracted the disease outside the limits of the Old Mission. The sanitary arrangements at the School are excellent; everything is scrupulously clean & there is no defective drainage. As, for the past four years there have been sporadic outbreaks of Diphtheria in Mission Municipality and Dewdney, it is probable that the contagion may be lurking in some of the older houses in these districts.\n\nI am glad to say there have been no fresh cases at St. Mary's School since the date of my last report.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n\"A. J. Stuart\".\nMission City,\nOctr. 3rd 1906.\n\nDear Mr. McDonald,\n\nI should have notified you yesterday of the bad state of affairs at Old Mission, only I had to go to North Bend, and consequently had to put off writing till today.\n\nFather Marshal contracted Diphtheria\u2014a most malignant type\u2014on Sunday. I saw him on Monday & gave him a maximum dose of Antitoxine. On Tuesday morning he had evidently attempted to sit up in bed and the effort had been too much for the weakened heart. He must have fallen back on the pillows and died instantly.\n\nTwo of the Indian girls then took the disease; but prompt measures have succeeded in checking the mischief. I am living in fear & trembling; for of course there was plenty of opportunity for the disease to get all through the place. I will notify you at once should any more cases develop.\n\nMany thanks for cheque, for which I enclose receipt.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n\"A. J.

Father Welch of Vancouver, Superior of the Oblate Order, in regard to the removal of the Rev. J. P. O'Neill from the principalship of St. Mary's Mission Boarding School on account of ill-health, and that he will replace him by the Rev. John Tavernier, O.M.I. I may say that the Rev. Father Tavernier was some years ago, principal of this School, and his re-appointment to the position will, no doubt be satisfactory to the Department, as he is well qualified for the position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 27th August, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 20th instant.

He is active and intelligent, and an excellent disciplinarian, and in every way well qualified to fill the position.\n\nAnother reason why I am particularly desirous of seeing Brother Collins appointed, is that there is no probability of his being removed from St. Mary's for many years.\n\nIf my request is granted, I should\nRespectfully ask that the change take effect March 1st 1911.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.

Mr. Cairns, Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia, who visited this school in April, last, reported that a new building for the staff and a dwelling dwell had been put up in addition to the two main buildings, one for the boys and one for the girls and that the buildings are equipped with all modern appliances both for heating and lighting, being heated by steam and lighted by electricity, which is generated on the premises from water power supplied by a spring about a mile distant, which furnishes an unfailing supply of pure water, as well as affording excellent fire protection. Sixty pupils are provided for at this school. Mr. Cairns in his concluding remarks states that \"This school is doing excellent work. Every effort is being made to raise the Indian child and youth to a higher level. The aim of the school is to educate...\"\neducate, to civilize and to Christianize the pupils. This is being accomplished to a marked degree.\"\n\nIn view of the favourable reports and good work of this school, I would recommend that a substantial increase in the pupilage be made.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6468, file 890-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, December 28, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nAn application has been made to the Department for an increase in the pupilage at the St. Mary's Mission Boarding School and before dealing with it I should be glad if you would visit the school and give a full report as to the accommodation they have. If additional accommodation has been provided lately be good enough to state what it consists of and how many pupils the school has room for and give the cubic contents and floor space of the dormitories and class-rooms.

There are two kitchens, each furnished with a large range.\n\nIn my opinion this school has ample accommodation for Seventy-five pupils. As the two schools are the same size the number of boys should be equal to the number of girls.\n\nNo additional accommodation has been added lately.\n\nInspector of Indian Schools for B.C.\nDear Mr Scott,\n\nI thank you for your letter of 31 Dec., and I trust Mrs Calhoun will be in a position to report favorably on St Mary's School.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSwales. O.M.I.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nReferring to my memorandum of the 21st ultimo in regard to the request for an increase in the pupilage at the St. Mary's Mission Boarding School I beg to say that Mr. Inspector Cairns, who was asked to report on the accommodation they have, states that there is accommodation for 84 pupils in the dormitories, 42 girls and 42 boys, and class-room accommodation for 51. As the half day system is carried on at this school there is ample room in the class-rooms for the number the dormitories will accommodate. Mr. Cairns says that in his opinion the school has ample accommodation for 75 pupils. Would you be willing to grant an increase of 15 pupils at this school? Sixty are now provided for.\n\nMartin Benson\nOttawa, January 28, 1915.\n\nRev.

Mr. Inspector Cairns, who made a recent visit to this school, reports that they have ample room to accommodate seventy-five pupils. The Department has, therefore, decided to grant an increase of fifteen pupils at this school and will from the first instant pay the grant for the pupils enrolled up to the number of seventy-five at $100.00 per capita.

At this moment hundreds of Indian children are not attending any school.\n\nAt your request Mr. Cairns has recently visited St. Mary's School, Mission City, and he assured the principal, Rev. V. Roth, that the school had ample accommodation for eighty-four children. This being the case perhaps the Department would be willing to increase the number of grant-earning pupils from sixty-five to eighty-four.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.W. Elch.

As a matter of fact that was all I requested when you granted me the favor of an interview last December.\n\nHowever, on my return to British Columbia I discovered that we had accommodation for 84 pupils, according to measurements made by Mr. R.H. Cairns on the 7th of last month. I am enclosing a copy of Mr. Cairns' report to Father Rohr O.M.I., principal of the school. According to this report there is sufficient accommodation in the dormitories for 42 boys and 42 girls. I also am satisfied that we have room for an equal number of boys and girls in the class-rooms, for the reason that all the pupils do not attend class at the same time. The older children have class in the forenoon, and the younger ones in the afternoon. Probably Mr. Cairns did not think of referring to this arrangement, but you will see how it greatly enlarges our school-room capacity.\n\nNow I do not wish to bore you with this subject but in as much as a very large number of Indian children are not attending any school, I thought you would not be annoyed if I pointed out how, as I think, we can easily receive 24 additional pupils at St. Mary's making a total of 84.

For many years I have been traveling among the different Indian tribes and lived with them their own life. Often I wondered why not more was done for the education of the poor Indian children. They are so anxious to learn something especially now as the country is getting more and more settled with white people.\n\nDear Sir, you struck the right thing when you had the department to investigate how many Indian children there were of age to go to school and who had no opportunity of doing so and everybody was amazed to see that the children admitted to the schools were only a minority.\nAt once you went to work and great changes have been made for the betterment of the schools already existing and new schools have been built.\n\nGrasping your idea I tried it many times to interest the officials of the department to interest themselves with the needs of St. Mary's Mission. I do not know how they never succeeded to appease you. They make fine promises and that was all.\n\nThe Oblate Father of the North West had spoken to me often times of the great interest you take yourself in this great question of education. I said to myself why not write myself directly to Mr. D. Scott, when I knew that Rev. Fr. Welsh was at Ottawa I did not hesitate a moment to do so. At once you took steps and it did not take you very long to favor our request with a grant for 15 more children.\n\nMany thanks to you, dear sir, for your great kindness.\n\nAs I tell you above I tried the authorities to interest themselves in my plan. But they\ncost me very dearly. My intention was to enlarge the buildings of St. Mary's Mission School for the purpose of taking in more children. We drew up the plans ourselves, but that did not suit the Rev. Father J. Welch our superintendent. He wanted the things done properly and by an architect. Himself and our Indian Agent and between our Inspector, Mrs. Dickburn went to interview the architect, Gardner & Murray of New Westminster, to draw plans for St. Mary's Mission School. The plans were drawn and approved by those gentlemen but between rejected by the Council of the O.M.I. on the ground that they had not the means to pay for the proposed buildings. Now the plans are in my hands and also the bill which amounts to $474.90. Nobody wants to take the responsibility of it and the architects are urging me to settle the account. This puts me in a terrible plight. I have done all I could for the betterment of the institution. All the officials of the department can give testimony of what I have done. The school is in a ten times better condition than what it was when I took charge of it. Never I spent a cent on anything else except my school.\nMy plans will remain idle for a while yet. My intention was to build on those plans and complete them little by little without going into debts. I wish you could help me. You will not regret it as it will encourage me and my staff to devote ourselves more and more to the education of the Indian children.\n\nThis is only a private letter to you, Mr. B. Scott. I do not want to be importunate. I wished only to put the matter before you to see what can be done.\n\nEnclosed also you will find the bill of the architects, Murray and Gordon.\n\nHoping not to give you too much trouble in your labours.\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nV.

Up to there has been only one case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 15th., 1916.\n\nSir,-\n\nThe Department has received your letter of the 7th instant, reporting the outbreak of smallpox at St. Mary's Mission Indian Boarding School; and in reply I beg to say that it is observed that you state that Dr. A. J. Stuart of Mission City, salaried medical officer, is in attendance, and that every precaution has been taken to prevent an epidemic. The Department has learned with regret of the outbreak of the disease, but is pleased to know that prompt action has been taken to stamp out. You should report within a short time as to conditions existing at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nPeter Byrne Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B. C.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nDuring the past two years I have taken considerable interest in our Indian Schools, and visited them frequently. Permit me to draw your attention to St. Mary's Mission, B.C.\n\nI consider St. Mary's an excellent establishment, and yet it only receives the minimum grant $100.00 per annum. Now, you will agree with me, I have no doubt, that the children cannot be properly fed and clothed and educated according to approved standards for such a sum. Likewise it may be said, that the obligation to adequately provide for the education of Indian children is on the State, not on the Church.\n\nJust a year ago you were good enough to increase the number of grant earning pupils at St. Mary's from 60 to 75. I was grateful for this concession and I may assure you that it has been of some financial benefit to us. But I now wish to renew my request made about the same time that the number of grant earners be further increased. As I then stated, there is according to Mr. Catton's report sufficient accommodation in the dormitories for 42 boys and 42 girls. Now, I also honestly believe that we can accommodate at least an equal number of boys and girls in the class rooms, for the simple reason that all the boys and girls do not attend class at the same time.\nThe bigger children have class in the forenoon, the smaller ones in the afternoon. In this way it appears to me that we really have room for 84 or 85 children.\n\nTrusting you can this year see your way to grant us the further increase which I am asking you,\n\nI beg to remain\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6468, file 890-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFebruary 29th, 1916.\n\nDear Father Welch -\n\nReferring to your communication of the 3rd instant, in further reference to the request for an increase in the pupilage at the St. Mary's Mission Boarding School, I have given consideration to your request and have decided to increase the pupilage from 75 to 84, from the first of April, next, being the commencement of the new fiscal year. This is the number for which the Inspector shows you have proper accommodation.\n\nI trust that this increase in pupilage will be some help in the financial management of the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. Welch, O.M. I.,\n59 Blackwood St.,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nOttawa, March 1, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that it has been decided to increase the pupilage at the St. Mary's Mission Boarding School from 75 to 84 pupils. This increase in pupilage is to take effect from the first of April next, the commencement of the new Fiscal Year.\n\nThe church authorities, under whose auspices this school is conducted, have been notified of this increase in the number of grant earning pupils allowed, and you will be good enough to inform the principal accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster,\nB. C.\nNew Westminster, 8 March 16.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nOn returning from the upper valley yesterday I found your communication of 29 Feb awaiting me.\n\nI thank you sincerely for raising the pittance of St. Mary's from 75 to 84. Certainly it will be of some financial aid to us.\n\nI need not tell you how pleased we all were when your Parliament Building was so seriously damaged by fire. Every Canadian was justly proud of them.\n\nYours respectfully & faithfully,\n\nJ. Welch. O.M.I.\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAss't Deputy & Secretary\n\nDear Sir,\n\nKnowing that Mr. Duncan Scott is not at his office, I respectfully beg to request you to reappoint Rev. V. Rohr, O.M., principal of St. Mary's School, Mission, B.C.\n\nI regret being obliged to ask you to make another change in your staff at St. Mary's, but I have no choice as Father Tavernier, the present principal wishes to go back to France. No doubt he feels that he can assist his country a little when all the world knows it is making such heroic sacrifices.\n\nI shall be grateful if you will allow Father Rohr's appointment to take effect at once.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. Welch, O.M.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6468, file 890-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nJuly 18, 1916.\n\nDear Father Welch,\n\nYour letter of the 10th instant, with reference to the principalship of St. Mary's Mission boarding school has been brought to my attention, and I am quite agreeable that Rev. Father Rohr should again take charge of this school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. Welch, C.M.I.,\n59 Blackwood Street,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nProvincial House, O. M. I.,\n59 Blackwood Street,\nNew Westminster, B. C.\nJuly 28th 1916.\n\nDuncan G. Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nAs Superior of the Catholic Indian Schools on the lower mainland in British Columbia, I am much interested in their welfare. To-day, I beg leave to write you particularly in behalf of St. Mary's Mission, B. C.\n\nSt. Mary's is the oldest Boarding School in this Province, and one of the best conducted. For more than half a century it has done splendid work, and at the present time especially is giving the fullest satisfaction to the Department. This school is admirably situated on high ground overlooking the Fraser Valley. The health of the children is again perfect this year, and it is worthy of note that at St. Mary's epidemics are unknown. Our sanitary arrangements have been carefully attended to and a perfect water system has been installed, pure water being piped in from the neighboring hills. The milk supplied to the children is pure and abundant, and you will be pleased to hear that at the request of the Principal the cattle of the school are examined every year, for tuberculosis, by Dr. Dalton, the Provincial Veterinary Inspector. Two years ago we installed a steam heating system at a cost of $8000.00 and for\nseveral years the whole establishment has been lighted by electricity.\n\nWith regard to the intellectual and moral training received by the children, I need not speak, as it has been highly commended by the Government Inspector, and I think, by both Indian Agents. I would like to state, however, that the children are also educated along various useful lines. The boys, for instance, are taught farming and gardening and a little carpentry, a few are learning shoe-repairing, and three or four of the oldest, plumbing and pipe-fitting. As for the girls, they learn from the devoted Sisters, cooking and housekeeping, and plain and fancy sewing in a way that would reflect credit on many far more pretentious institutions.\n\nAnd now the question to which I wish to draw your attention is one of further financial aid from the Government for this particular School.\n\nSt. Mary's School at present is only receiving the minimum grant, $100.00 per annum for each pupil. I consider the School is entitled to the maximum grant. In such an institution as St. Mary's, $100.00 per annum is quite inadequate. We find it impossible to feed, clothe, educate and house a child with this amount, and each year when we have expended on the School the Government allowance, we have to turn for additional help to the Society for the Propagation of the Faith, and to the Congregation of the Oblates. But this, to my mind, is unfair,\nfor as I have said on a previous occasion it is on the State, and not on the Church, to provide the necessary means for the education of the Indian.\n\nAnd here let me submit a rough estimate of our receipts and expenses at St. Mary's, last year.\n\n| Government Grant | Expenses |\n|------------------|----------|\n| $7500.00         |          |\n| Meat             | $1200.00 |\n| Bread            | $1200.00 |\n| Groceries        | $1200.00 |\n| Clothing         | $420.00  |\n| Fuel             | $850.00  |\n| Taxes            | $460.00  |\n| Gen. extra       | $562.00  |\n| Extra            | $215.00  |\n| Light            | $75.00   |\n| Int. on loan     | $280.00  |\n| Freight etc.     | $190.00  |\n| Sugar & Syrup    | $700.00  |\n| Eggs             | $100.00  |\n\nNow $7462.00 does not represent the whole of our expenditure. Last year we spent $200.00 on septic tanks, $400.00 on machinery and $200.00 on piping, but you will see at a glance that $7462.00 practically eats up the entire grant, leaving nothing for teachers' and principal's salaries. The laborer, however, is worthy of his hire. As a matter of fact, we pay our teachers and our shoe-maker $2220.00 per annum, towards which the Oblates contribute $1000.00, and the Society for the Propagation of the Faith $600.00, the balance is made up from the revenue of the farm. The bigger boys, it is true, work a little on the farm, but the greater portion of the work is done by hired\nhelp. For some years past we have received contributions from the Propagation of the Faith, but on account of the war, I understand, there will be no contribution this year and perhaps not for many years to come.\n\nIn the column of expenses I beg to draw your special attention to the item of clothing. Last year it cost us only about $420.00 because we prevailed on many parents to pay for their children's clothing, but realizing that they are somewhat averse to this we intend in future to clothe the children at our own expense. Our bill for children's clothing will in future be at least $1600.00 per annum.\n\nMore on this subject might easily be said, but it is unnecessary. What I most respectfully ask of the Government is the maximum grant for St. Mary's. I may say that I fully believe that Mr. Ditchburn, Inspector of Indian Agencies, and our Indian Agents, Messrs. Byrne and Graham, would if asked, gladly endorse my request.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. Walec.\nAugust 30th, 1916.\n\nDear Mr. Cairns -\n\nThe management of St. Mary's Mission Boarding School which, under existing conditions is graded in Class C and draws a grant of $100.00 per capita, have asked to be placed in Grade A and receive the maximum grant of $125.00.\n\nI have known something of the work of this school and I have read with interest your very commendatory reports. I understand that some improvements have been made during the past five years since the first contract was signed, and it may be that the building now is such that the school might properly be graded in Class A. I do not know whether it will be necessary for you to visit the school to make a report, but, if so, I would ask you to make a special inspection with a view to reporting particularly on the nature of the accommodation.\n\nI am sending you herewith a copy of the correspondence and agreement for the maintenance of\n\nR. H. Cairns, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nChilliwack, B.C.\nIndian Boarding Schools; on pages 5 and 6 of this you will note the requirements for schools of the different grades.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nAugust 31st, 1916.\n\nDear Father Welch -\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, with reference to change in the classification of the St. Mary's Mission Boarding School.\n\nI am asking Mr. Cairns for a special report which will enable him to come to a decision in the matter, as much depends upon the state of the buildings and care must be taken not to create a precedent which will be cited as favourable to other claimants.\n\nI am quite aware of the valuable work that has been done in this institution and it is apparent that the financial situation gives cause for serious consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. Welch, O.M.I.,\n59 Blackwood St.,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nOttawa, October 11, 1916.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reference to previous correspondence regarding your application for a change in the classification of the St. Mary's Mission Boarding School I beg to say that the Department is in receipt of a special report from Mr. Cairns, Inspector of Indian Schools, in which he states that the condition of the buildings owned by the Church meet the requirements called for by the Agreement for the Maintenance and Management of Indian Boarding Schools, which would entitle the St. Mary's Mission Boarding School to a per capita grant of $125.00. In view of Inspector's Cairns favourable report I have to inform you that this school will be placed in Class \"A\" from the 1st instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nRev. J. Welch, C.M.I.,\n59 Blackwood St.,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nMr Scott,\n\nI have just received your communication of 11th inst., placing St Mary's in Class A. You are very kind to us and thank you sincerely.\n\nIt is my intention to go to Ottawa next month when I hope to have the pleasure of calling on you.\n\nYours faithfully & respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6468, file 890-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFor the information of the Department, I beg to report that two cases of diphtheria broke out in St. Mary's Mission Indian Boarding School during the month of December, but thanks to the immediate action of Dr. Stuart, Medical Health Officer of the Department and the staff of the Institution, who at once isolated the sick children, the attack was limited to two cases, and the patients are now fully recovered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 28, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant reporting that two cases of diphtheria broke out in the St. Mary's Mission Boarding School during the month of December, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is glad to learn that this attack was limited to the two cases and that the patients are now fully recovered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

During the conversation our business was mentioned, which lead to a general talk on tractors.\n\nWe have a small garden tractor known as the Beeman, and apparently the Father Superior was very much taken with this little machine from an instructional point of view, both from an agricultural and mechanical side of the question, so we are taking the liberty of writing you and forwarding circulars covering this little machine.\n\nWe have supplied these machines to the Experimental stations out here, and I believe a machine went to an Indian Mission on the west coast of Vancouver Island, from Victoria; and we have also supplied these machines to the District Supervisors for the Department of Education, Provincial Parliament, Victoria. These later machines are used for agricultural instruction and also for giving them an insight into the mechanical construction of gas engines, and we think from the way the Father Superior spoke that he had some such object in mind as the above, hence the reason for bringing the subject before you.\n\nThanking you for giving your kind consideration in the matter, we remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nToiling-Power, Ltd.,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6468, file 890-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMay 30, 1919.\n\nDear Sir -\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd inst., with reference to furnishing a tractor to the St. Mary's Mission Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is not the general policy of the Department to supply our Indian Schools with machinery of this kind. If the school requires a tractor, they should make the purchase from the funds furnished by the Department for the maintenance of the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nThe Manager,\nToiling-Power, Ltd.,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to report the serious outbreak of small-pox amongst the Indians in the lower part of this Agency.\n\nOn investigating yesterday in company with Dr. McCaffrey I found that so far it was solely amongst the pupils belonging to St. Mary's Mission School. I questioned the children and found that there had been some sickness in the school, and some of these now suffering had been sick for a few days in the school, so they were all sent off home. One child was taken off the train with the rash out on her and she stated that the school authorities had not any doctor to attend her.\n\nI immediately placed the patients and those that were brought in contact with them in quarantine and placed a constable in charge. Some of them were very much adverse to being placed in quarantine stating that they had no means of support so I had to purchase a certain amount of supplies, and made arrangements for the constable to keep them supplied in water, fuel and necessary food. There was another patient who was at home with her parents on Seabird Island Reserve, which family I have also placed in quarantine.\n\nWe had an expert sent from the coast who pronounced it small pox of the very worst type.\n\nIt is likely to be hard to control as the children were sent from the school to different reserves. There were no less than twelve (12) of these children sent out into different parts of this Agency. Dr. Fort has one of these children under his care at North Bend but has not as yet pronounced the disease as small-pox.\n\nI cannot understand the action taken by the Principal of St. Mary's School at Mission in sending these children back into the reserve to scatter any disease amongst the others, even if they did not know what the dreaded disease was. I understand that there is a Medical Doctor for the Indians at Mission who should have been called and if there was anything wrong the children should have been treated at\nat the school instead of being turned out to the four winds as has been done. It seems to be a failing of this school to send children home when anything is wrong with them instead of taking care of them as they should do.\n\nAs soon as I learned where this originated I wired Indian Agent Byrne at New Westminster, under whose jurisdiction this school comes, and also the different Provincial Police where any of the children may have got to.\n\nThis outbreak will cost a considerable sum to control, but I trust the Department will approve of the action I have taken to prevent any further spread.\n\nI have the honor to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgn. H. Graham\nIndian Agent,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\u2014\n\nI beg to report the progress of the outbreak of small-pox in this Agency.\n\nI managed to locate all the pupils that has been discharged from the Mission School and found about every one of them had not been vaccinated was suffering from small-pox, so I immediately quarantined them with those who had come immediately in contact with them and placed a guard over them so as to try to prevent it spreading.\n\nI have no less than seven quarantine camps in the lower district and so far there has been no outbreak outside of these camps. There have only been four more cases who have been infected by these children who came from the school.\n\nI have also found that it has broken out amongst the Indians of the Anderson Lake Band at Darcy. This was brought there by Indians from the Pemberton and they state that there is a great deal of it there. I immediately quarantined the whole reserve and put a guard on as there were several other Indians who had the symptoms and I want if possible to prevent this disease spreading further.\n\nI have the honor to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Graham\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAgassiz B.C.\n\nOctober, 19, 1919\n\nTo H. Graham Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nSir:\n\nThe above is a list of the Indians sick with smallpox in this part of the Agency, which I covered from the 2nd August to date. Nos. 20-21-23-31-32-33-34-35-36 are not complete as they are still in quarantine and will be so for at least another week. As you are personally aware of how the disease broke out in your Agency, where it came from, etc., and the difficulty we were up against owing to defective vaccine. Had the same been good no doubt our list would have been much smaller and the disease stamped out much sooner than it has been. Any further remark on my part is I presume not necessary.\n\nI have the honor to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(signed) E. MacLeod\nDominion Constable.\nIndian Agents' Office,\nLytton, B.C.\nOctober 20th, 1919.\n\nSir:-\n\nI herewith beg to submit a report upon the outbreak of smallpox in this Agency, which started by girls being sent home from St. Mary's Mission School suffering from the disease. These were practically all sent into the lower portion of this Agency with the result that I had no less than twenty-seven cases of smallpox which are shown on a separate report enclosed from Constable MacLeod. Owing to these cases there were no less than fifty-five who were in these quarantine camps and attended to by Dr. McCaffrey and supervised by Constable MacLeod. Of all these cases there were a number belonging to the New Westminster Agency, but I am glad to report that we are now quite clear of the dreaded disease.\n\n#\n\nI have the honor to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Graham\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6468, file 890-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIt may be stated in this connection that the epidemic, seemingly was the result of pupils from St. Mary's Mission School in the New Westminster Agency, having been sent home who showed symptoms of illness and apparently without any measures having been taken to ascertain the nature of the illness from which they suffered and I may here state that Dr. A.G. Stuart of Mission City is paid salary at the rate of $500.00 a year to attend Indians on certain reserves and also pupils of St. Mary's Mission School. It seems strange that both the Principal of the School and the Doctor allowed the pupils of the School to leave the Institution when showing symptoms of small-pox. Agent Graham has stated that one of the children from the school was taken off the train with an eruption visible, and he has said further that the School authorities did not have a doctor to look after the pupils. In another letter Mr. Graham stated that he had managed to locate all the pupils that had been discharged from the Mission School and found that about every one of them that had not been vaccinated was suffering from small-pox (F427031-65). Mr. Graham said that later the disease was pronounced by an expert from the coast to be small-pox of the very worst type. The disease also developed amongst the Indians at Anderson Lake where it was brought from Pemberton. Possibly the School authorities and Dr. Stuart should be written to in this connection.\n\nF.H. Paget\nAccountant.\n\nOttawa, 3rd November, 1919.\n427031-65.\nSir:\u2014\n\nA serious epidemic of small-pox occurred during the latter part of the summer in the Lytton Agency. Small-pox was also prevalent in the New Westminster and Williams Lake Agencies. It is understood that the outbreak of the disease is to a large extent due to the fact that the pupils of St. Mary's Mission School, who contracted the disease, were sent to their homes before recovery. It is stated that one child was taken off the train with an eruption on her.\n\nThe Department requires you, as Principal of the School, to closely supervise the health of the pupils and expects you to have the medical attendant, Dr. Stuart, give such attendance as is required in illness. Every effort should be taken to prevent an outbreak of disease and when the pupils contract a disease of a contagious character too great care cannot be taken in stamping out the same. Seemingly failure to take ordinary precautions under the circumstances, as above referred to, has resulted in a general outbreak of small-pox, a serious state of affairs, which has entailed much expense upon the Department. I shall be glad to learn why necessary measures were not taken in this matter not only to safeguard the health of the pupils but to prevent small-pox from spreading throughout the country.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nThe Principal,\nSt. Mary's Mission School,\nMission City, B.C.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, 6th November, 1918.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to point out that under the terms of your appointment as salaried medical officer to Indians, you are required to attend not only Indians of certain reserves (Nisqually, Mataqui, Whonnocka, Skweshin) but also the pupils of the St. Mary's Mission Boarding School, which is in the New Westminster Agency.\n\nA serious epidemic of small-pox occurred recently. The disease was prevalent in the New Westminster Agency and other Indian Agencies, and it is understood that the outbreak of the disease was due, to a large extent, to pupils from St. Mary's Mission School who had contracted small-pox being sent to their homes before their recovery. It has been stated that one child was taken off the train with an eruption visible. In view of the fact that you are the salaried medical officer for the School, it is not understood why you did not take necessary precaution to stamp out the disease while it was confined to the School. Owing to lack of precaution being observed the disease became widespread and a serious state of affairs resulted which has entailed much expense upon the Department. Under the circumstances, I beg to say that the Department will be glad to receive an explanation from you. Be good enough to state whether your attention was drawn by the Principal of the School to illness amongst the pupils.\n\nYou should also state whether you have visited the Institution once a month or more frequently during the past six months. I may say that the Department has not received reports from you with regard to your work since the fall of 1918. A report with regard to the performance of your duties should be submitted to the Department at the close of each month, and the said reports should reach the Department through the office of the local Indian Agent, Mr. Byrne.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6468, file 390-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMission City, B.C.\nNov 13th 1919.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th inst., and I do not hesitate to say that, with the exception of the initial paragraph regarding my professional duties to the pupils of St. Mary's Mission Boarding School, about which there can be no dispute, it is the most grossly injurious and unfair I ever had the misfortune to receive.\n\nHow can you, Sir, if you possess any sense of justice, on the no-authority of such vague and indeterminate statements as, \"it is understood,\" \"it has been said,\" bring so gravely criminal an accusation against a Medical Health Officer? For, in effect, you accuse me of having, through carelessness and dereliction of duty, been the direct means of causing a wide-spread and serious outbreak of Small Pox throughout the country.\n\nYou say, categorically, that I did not take the necessary precautions to stamp out the disease while it was confined to St. Mary's School.\n\nI have been Medical Health Officer for Mission Municipality, as well as the districts of Dewdney & Nicomen, for so many years that I have the right to assume my services have uniformly met with the approbation of the Authorities concerned; and I have no intention of permitting my reputation to be injured in this manner, without making every effort in my power, not only to exonerate myself, but to discover if possible the author or authors of this glaringly false and most injurious scandal.\n\nYou say that the Department will be glad to receive an explanation from me; and yet I may, without impertinence, ask what assurance I have that such explanation will meet with the impartial consideration it deserves, seeing that my case has been already prejudged and my conduct severely censured.\n\nThe facts, however, are these:\n\nI was away on holiday during the month of July, and my \"locum tenens\" for the time was Dr. R.H. Port, of Clayburn, B.C.\nTowards the latter part of the month, the Rev. Father Rohr, Principal of St. Mary's School, sent for him to examine a pupil who was ill, and on whose skin a suspicious-looking eruption appeared. Dr. Port saw the case, diagnosed Small Pox and promptly quarantined the school.\n\nWhen I returned on August 1st, I visited the place, saw that the usual warning placards were in position, and that the proper precautions were being taken to prevent the spread of the disease. I may say here that they have exceptional facilities at Old Mission for thoroughly isolating cases of contagious disease, and that these were taken full advantage of on this occasion. Very soon we had 32 cases at St. Mary's School; and not only were these kept in a dormitory by themselves, but Sisters were detailed to attend them, who never, under any circumstances, came in contact with the healthy inmates.\n\nI visited these cases at least once a day in the earlier stages, and two or three times a week while they were convalescing. Not one of those children was permitted to leave the School until the very last one to contract the disease had thoroughly recovered; then every one was scrupulously sponged from head to foot with disinfecting solution; clothes that could not be properly sterilized were burnt, and the whole building cleansed and fumigated in a way that, I do not hesitate to say, could not have been improved upon. Then, and only then, were any of the children allowed to leave St. Mary's; and the fact that no new case developed subsequently, either in the school itself or anywhere in the immediate neighbourhood, showed fairly well that our efforts to restrict the spread of the disease had been satisfactory.\n\nAs to the origin of the outbreak, it has been clearly demonstrated that Small Pox existed among the Pemberton Meadows, Anderson Lake and Chilliwack Indians weeks before it appeared at Old Mission.\n\nI, both as physician and Health Officer, took so much pains in visiting the sick Indians and watching individual cases carefully, that I considered I had not only done my duty well, but that my services merited some special recognition from the Department; and I did not hesitate to say so; the more, because, last year, about this time, I, for over two months, visited St. Mary's School, not only every day (and several times at night) but frequently twice a day, as there were in all between 70 to 80 pupils ill with Flu.\n\nTaking those two occasions alone into consideration, I know that I did an amount of professional work for the Department, for which a whole year's salary would be inadequate payment; and the special recognition I receive, is your letter of the 6th!\nIn accordance with the request from the Department, I have, as physician to the Indians here, given you my version of the Smallpox outbreak, without exaggeration, reservation or concealment of any material fact; and now, speaking with the authority my position as Medical Health Officer gives me, I say emphatically, that not only was everything possible done to limit the spread of the disease, but it was done more thoroughly than is usual in such localized outbreaks.\n\nThe Rev. Father Rohr, I am satisfied, did not fail in his duty in any particular; and he gave me strenuous and invaluable assistance throughout the whole course of the epidemic.\n\nIt is easy to be wise after the event; and if the disease had been discovered on any of the St. Mary's School pupils soon after leaving the school and before there was any indication of it there, surely no blame could possibly attach to Father Rohr for that. Indeed, it is a well-established fact, that some of the earlier cases were so mild that the patient did not complain of more than a slight malaise, and the ill-defined eruption, in more than one of these, was discovered accidentally.\n\nRegarding my ordinary visits to St. Mary's School, I don't hesitate to affirm that a week seldom passes without my making a professional call there.\n\nI have in this reply, endeavoured to avoid overstepping the bounds of courtesy, and the gravity of the attack on my professional reputation sufficiently warrants an emphatic denial.\n\nThe monthly report of my Indian work was interrupted in the Fall of 1918, simply because, on account of the excessive amount of the Flu Epidemic work, I had no time to make out the usual forms; and since then this duty has, I admit, been neglected; for which I tender the Department my regret and apology.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6468, file 890-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 13th instant, on the subject of the outbreak of smallpox at St. Mary's Mission Boarding School and the measures taken in the matter both by you and the Principal of the School; I beg to say that the Department is pleased to learn that you put forth your best efforts to stamp out the disease.\n\nI may say further that there would seem to be no reason why you should take umbrage at the remarks made to you in regard to the epidemic.

Father Rohr, has taken out his citizenship papers.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the appointment of Rev.

O'Boyle, O.M.I.,\nChurch of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary,\n646 Richards St.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nThe Principal thinks five years enough for the average Indian pupil in the class-room from ten years of age to fifteen years. Give them a drilling in the three \"R's\" and let them go home to make room for others. The idea is extensive rather than intensive.\n\nOne strong objection to this method is that you cannot teach an Indian to farm by the time he is fifteen years of age. You may give him Manual Training by the time he is fifteen but you cannot do much with vocational training.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the ST. MARY'S MISSION BOARDING SCHOOL, November 24th and 25th. Or. 119704-6\n\nPUPILS-\n\nThe pupils are clean, tidy and alert. They were well dressed. The girls sing sweetly. They do not practice calisthenics. The sisters do not see that organized play and a course of physical culture would be beneficial from a health point of view. The principal looks at it from the same standpoint. I have discussed the matter with him. The boys do have, occasionally, a little military drill.\n\nAll manual work is good. Writing and map drawing are very good. Geography and history are not attempted, hygiene and composition receive attention. The older pupils do not seem able to reason and to draw conclusions. Problems in arithmetic they cannot do. I have been trying to raise the educational standard but have not succeeded to my satisfaction.\n\nThe pupils of this school have a good home and receive every care and attention. The school is fulfilling the purpose for which it was established, viz., the developing of the physical, intellectual and moral nature of Indian children.\n\nR. H. Cairns.\nInsp.\nThe Rev. J. Welch, of New Westminster, has informed me that he is going East shortly and while there will call at Ottawa to see you about St. Mary's Mission Indian School at Mission City, which as you know is one of the oldest in the Province, and the upkeep has lately become quite a burden as there are so many things necessary to keep in repair. I am not sure whether you ever visited this Institution, but if not I may say that there are three separate buildings, the boys' on the west, the girls' on the east with the Church occupying a position midway between the two.\n\nLately it had been thought that by the building of a fair-sized structure immediately behind the Church to be used as a kitchen and dining halls for both boys and girls it would help both in minimizing the labour and expense, but as there are other things necessary this idea has been given up and attention is now directed in the matter of a new barn, laundry, and some general repairs to the buildings which need a good overhauling, until such time as they can be replaced by new ones.\n\nSince the Department has taken over the St. George's School at Lytton and it is understood, the Coqualeetza School at Chilliwack, the Reverend Father feels that the same policy should be pursued with regard to St. Mary's Mission. I have explained to him that the Department's policy was against the spending of large sums of money on property for which it did not hold the title.\n\nI do not know how far you will be prepared to go in this matter, but I would say that in the event of your deciding to do anything in the way of taking the school over, the erection of an up-to-date laundry and a new barn, with a small amount of repair work on the present buildings would carry them along for some time.\n\nHaving a keen appreciation of your generous nature in connection with all school matters I feel that you will hardly be inclined to disregard Father Welch's appeal but will meet it insofar as it is possible so to do. Therefore in the event of you deciding to do nothing in the matter of taking this school over I might suggest that some assistance be given in the way of purchasing the materials for the barn so much needed, and also a washing machine and wringer similar to the one purchased for the Kamloops School last year at a cost of about $450.00. What the material for the barn would cost I am not prepared to say.\n\nI thought it best to write you these lines in order to prepare you for Rev. Father Welch's interview with you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies.\nEXD. Ottawa, January 26, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge yours of the 13th instant, referring to the coming visit of the Rev. J. Welch, of New Westminster. I have noted that he will make certain requests on behalf of the St. Mary's Boarding School at Mission City, B. C.\n\nThe Department is grateful for the information that you have offered, and the Rev. Father Welch's requests will receive due consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nVictoria, B. C.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOttawa, February 4th, 1932.\n\nThe Honourable J.A. King,\nMinister of Public Works,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nHonourable Sir:\n\nI have come to Ottawa to ask the Indian Department to make certain important improvements in St Mary's Indian School at Mission, B.C., viz:\n\nA\u2014Let us erect a steam laundry. The washing (for 100 persons) is now done in a shed and all by hand;\nB\u2014Above the laundry to build a common kitchen with dining rooms for boys, girls and staff;\nC\u2014As a third story (or second story if laundry is put in a basement) a large sewing room which would also serve the purpose of an auditorium for the children's concerts.\n\nB\u2014We have a farm in connection with the school, the produce of which goes to the upkeep of the school children, and yet, this farm land is taxed by the municipality to the extent of about $1,000.00 per annum or nearly one sixth of our per capita grant. We consider that these taxes should be borne by the Indian Department.\n\nC\u2014A barn is urgently needed but the school has no funds with which to erect it, so practically the entire Government grant each year and all the produce of the farm go to the support and education of the Indian children, who after all, are the wards of the Government. Would the Department be willing to vote us $5,000.00 towards a new barn?\n\nD\u2014When I have explained to Mr Duncan Scott who has always shown great interest in the welfare of our Indians, how by a small outlay, the class-rooms, play-rooms and dormitories could be enlarged, and provision be easily made for 20 or 30 more pupils. Large class-rooms are much needed at the camp where we have so much rain.\n\nE\u2014Lastly, I am making an appeal in behalf of the Indian School in North Vancouver. The Department in all fairness should give them additional help or build them a new school. At present the children and the Sisters are packed like the proverbial sardines. For lack of funds they cannot better conditions. As at St Mary's (Mission B.C.) their little garden and orchard are heavily taxed. The per capita grant is barely enough to supply the children and Sisters with food. It is only by appealing to the charity of other institutions that they can make ends meet. These hardworking and self-sacrificing women are the servants of the Government; why should they be forced to beg, in order to be able to carry on their noble work?\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6468, file 890-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nST. MARY'S BOARDING SCHOOL\n\nThere is a farm and garden at this institution, large enough for a big residential school. All the priests in the vicinity are in favour of this. A small increase in pupilage - say from 84 to 90 - could be offered now. Father Duplanil suggests the principle of having parents pay something to the school: the educational facilities would be more appreciated. In connection with recruiting and the return of pupils Agent Graham of Lytton has not been much help to the Principal.\n\nNew flooring is needed in the girls' playroom and in both dining rooms (boys' and girls' buildings separate). Girls' dormitories should be provided with fire escapes.\n\nIn the near future, a special building should be provided (kitchen and 4 dining rooms). Space would then be available for playrooms, infirmaries and showers.\nOttawa, July 9, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Daunt:\n\nI have to inform you that the Rev. Sister Mary Gabriel has been appointed Mother Provincial of the Sisters of Ste. Anne for their Ecclesiastical Province of British Columbia. This Sister has been actively interested in Indian educational work at Caughnawaga, Que. for some years, and the Department has great confidence in her ability. The Sisters at the St. Mary's Boarding School will be under her supervision, and when she is visiting the institution, you should extend every courtesy.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nA. O'H. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B. C.\nOttawa, Sept. 26, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General has directed that the Department give favourable consideration to accounts for material, that is being used by the principal of the St. Mary's Indian Residential School, to effect certain alterations which will permit more accommodation. The amount that has been mentioned in this connection is $600. When these alterations are completed, I should be pleased if you would certify the accounts for material, if in order, and forward them to the Department.\n\nYou should also give me information, concerning the size of the classrooms and dormitories after the alterations have been completed.

E. Maillard, Principal, immediately turned them over to the Provincial Police without notifying this office, and has not yet made any report of it beyond mentioning in a letter, a week later, that two children had tried to set fire to the School, but were now in the hands of the Police.\n\nThey were committed for trial by the local Magistrate, sent to Oakalla Jail and thence to the Provincial Industrial School for Girls, Vancouver, from where they were brought up before the County Court yesterday. His Honour, Judge Howay, turned them over to me to be dealt with, and I am sending them to the Kamloops Residential School, where Rev. J. Duplanil, will I am sure take care of them. I would, therefore, request that the approval of the Department be given to the transfer of the above mentioned pupils from St. Mary's Mission Residential School to the Kamloops Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I may say that I consider the action of the Principal very ill advised, and as it is the second time this summer that he has given undesirable publicity to the Institution under his charge, I requested the Rev. Father Welch to take the necessary steps to remove him forthwith, and have no doubt you will be communicated with from this quarter at an early date.\n\nFather Maillard has many good points, but he is altogether too excitable and hot headed to be Principal of a School, and I do not consider that the interests of the Indian children, the Church or the Department are safe in his hands.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O'M.

I note they were committed for trial; that the County Court Judge asked you to deal with them and that you now recommend their transfer to the Department's school at Kamloops. Approval of this transfer is given.\n\nI note that you are not at all satisfied that Rev. E. Maillard, Principal of the St. Mary's School, is suitable for the position he holds and that you requested Very Rev. John Welsh, O.M.I., to relieve him of his duties.

On Oct. the 12th, you asked if Father Maillard had given me satisfaction while at his present post. In replying directly to your question, I have to say that the Reverend Gentleman has given me full satisfaction as Principal of St. Mary's. There has been a slight difference of opinion between Mr. Dent and Father Maillard, but none between Father Maillard and myself. I am well satisfied with the entire staff at St. Mary's.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYours ever respectfully,\n\nJ. Welch.

Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSt. Mary's School, Mission City, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nOn the advice of my council, I have decided that a change at the Indian School at Mission City would help in the re-Organization of some of our other work. I therefore respectfully submit the name of Rev. Father P. Fahlmann, O.M.I. as Principal of St. Mary's School, Mission City in succession to Rev. Father Maillard, O.M.I.\n\nRev. Father Fahlmann, O.M.I. has been in charge of the Indian missions in the Lilloet and Pemberton Districts. He has been very successful in this work and is held in the highest esteem by the Indian Agents and by the Indians themselves. We have every reason to believe that he will make a very efficient Principal.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nProvincial.\nOttawa, August 12th, 1930.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to inform you that the Department has approved of the appointment of Rev.

Information on our files indicates that the dormitories cannot adequately and safely accommodate more than one hundred and seven (107) children, which is the number for which grant is provided. Under these circumstances, it is hoped that steps can be taken to reduce the number at present in the school to the accommodation of the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

I am preparing accommodation from a portion of the Staff quarters for extra pupils, and will be in a position to adequately care for all children at present here.\n\nI trust that upon the submission of capacity figures, the Department will increase my Grant proportionately.\n\nI hope that my action will meet with the approval of the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.J. Fahlman,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, October 29, 1930.\n\nRev.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. J. Fahlman,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Mary's Residential School,\nMission City, B.C.\nOttawa, June 17, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of October 22nd, last, and to my reply of the 29th idem, with reference to the pupilage at the St. Mary's Indian Residential School. A study of the reports that have been sent in for the December and March quarters shows that there are still approximately 130 pupils in residence. The Department feels that crowding the old building at your school creates a serious situation, and I would not be doing my duty if I did not ask you to reduce the number to approximately 112 at the earliest possible date. This would allow you to earn the grant for approximately 107 pupils, for which number provision has been made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. J. Pahlman, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Mary's Mission Res. School,\nMission, B. C.\nOttawa, July 23rd, 1931.\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your 2-8-A of the 13th instant, enclosing the June quarter return of the St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School. This return shows the names of 136 pupils enrolled and the average attendance is 128. Grant is provided for 107 pupils at this school and, in addition, the Department promised some time ago to allow supernumerary grant for four pupils. The earnings have, therefore, been computed on an average of 111.\n\nFor your information, I may point out that, in paying supernumerary grant, it is the practice of the Department to only allow same until the close of the academic year during which the supernumerary grant was promised.\n\nThe Department is, therefore, not prepared to allow further supernumerary grant. In connection with the number of pupils at the St. Mary's Mission Residential School, I may say that, on October 10th, last, and also on June 17th of this year, the Reverend Principal was written and advised that information on our files indicates that the dormitories at the St. Mary's Mission School cannot adequately and safely accommodate the number that is at present in residence.\n\nThe Reverend Principal was further asked to reduce the number in the school to, approximately, 112, at the earliest possible date.\n\nIt is hoped that you will cooperate with the Reverend Principal in this regard and no new pupils should be placed in this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. O'H. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B. C.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSIR:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No.153-1-1, of the 23rd instant, regarding the grant earning pupils at St. Mary's Mission Residential School.\n\nIn connection with the supernumerary grant, I would submit that it is absolutely necessary to have these children in the school, as I have no other way of caring for them, and this being so, it is only fair that the school should be recompensed for their keep.\n\nIn connection with the reduction of the pupil list, I can see no way of doing this, as there are a number of orphans and indigent children which absolutely must be entered after the holidays.\n\nThe fact is, that Mission School has outlived its District requirements, and until such time as an adequate building can be erected, the regulations must be relaxed to meet the emergencies of the moment.\n\nI am endeavouring to have the Principal alter some of the building so as to provide more dormitory accommodation, and trust that I shall be able to report upon this a little later on. One thing is certain, and that is we have no way of reducing the pupilage. On the contrary, it will increase, as the poor little waifs must be taken care of in spite of the regulations.\n\nI should be glad to know to what extent the Department can increase the grant, provided the accommodation is arranged.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.O.M. Daunt.\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 14, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 2-8-A of the 31st ultimo, with reference to the pupilage at the St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School. Our regulations regarding overcrowding and concerning the safety of pupils at these institutions need not be relaxed, as you suggest. There may be very deserving and needy applicants for space in this school, but there are alternatives which will relieve the situation. A certain number of pupils could be transferred to the Kamloops, Squamish or Sechelt Schools, or those who have good homes could be discharged to make room for urgent cases.\n\nAlterations to the buildings, to provide more dormitory accommodation, cannot be favourably considered by the Department, as there are no funds with which to pay grant for more than 107 pupils. Please inform the Reverend Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster,\nB. C.\nOttawa, November 20, 1931.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nPursuant to your conversation this morning, I have to inform you that the Department will approve of the appointment of the Reverend V. Rohr, O. M. I., to the principalship of the St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School, if you desire to nominate him for this post. If you take this action, please let the Department have definite information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nVery Rev. W. Byrne Grant, O. M. I.,\n151 Laurier Ave. East,\nOttawa, Ont.\nKamloops, B.C., Dec. 2nd, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith report on the above agency (New Westminster No. 2.) as follows:\n\nST MARY'S MISSION RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nUnfortunately, when I called at this school there was a big funeral on, and I could not see the Principal. However, I went partly round the school. There were 113 children in the school at the time of my visit. The school was clean and tidy, and the children in the class rooms at work.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nVictoria, B.C., Dec. 4, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to transmit herewith the inspection report No. 2 of Mr. O. S. Pragnell, Inspector of Agencies, dated December 2nd, instant, of his inspection of the New Westminster Indian Agency.\n\nIn regard to the Coqualeetza and Mission Residential schools, I beg to say that Inspector Barry (schools) is at present on his tour of inspection, and will report also in due course thereon.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nEXTRACT from Inspector Barry's Report on his visit to the ST. MARY'S MISSION INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL on November 24 & 25, 1931.\n\nOriginal on File 153-1-6.\n\nClassification: The following table is not perfectly correct. It is the best I can make after a long talk to the Principal. The first table given to me by the Principal gave a total number of children in the school at 114, made up of 111 present and 3 absent. The Department pays Per Capita on 107. The Principal appears to have been told to send the extra children home. A number of children have, I am informed, been refused admission and 8 children have been discharged. The Principal regrets very much that he gave me wrong figures and has apologized for doing so. He informs me that many of the children the Department wishes him to discharge come from homes in which the conditions are poor. I consider that there is ample room in the school for a total of 125 children and would recommend that Per Capita grant be given for this number.\n\nTotal Present: 124. Boys 62. Girls 62.\n\nAbsent three, 1 in Hospital, and 2 temporarily at home. The Agent has been notified by the School with regard to these 2.\n\nThere are, I am certain, more children in the school than I have shown above, and I would recommend that the Department ask for a definite statement as to how many children are at the school.\nOttawa, January 27, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nMr. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia, in a report on his visit, in November, last, to the St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School, states that he was informed there was a total of 124 children enrolled. This matter has already been drawn to your attention. The information on our files indicates that the dormitories cannot adequately and safely accommodate the number that are at present in residence, and a request was made to reduce the number of pupils in residence to approximately 112.\n\nI shall be pleased to have a report from you, stating definitely the total number of boys and girls at present in the school and what arrangements you propose carrying out to reduce the pupilage to the number mentioned above. As you are aware, per capita grant is allowed for only 107 pupils, but the extra enrolment up to 112 is allowed in order that they may replace any of the regular grant-earning pupils who are absent and the school thereby earn the full per capita grant allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. T. J. Fahlman O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Mary's Mission Residential School,\nMission, B. C.\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No.153-1-1 of January 27th, 1932 regarding the number of children in school.\n\nI wish to say that Mr. Barry's report states the correct number; 61 boys and 63 girls.\n\nIn this connection I beg to remind you that the number of 107 was authorized in 1923 in consideration of extra dormitory accommodation then installed. In 1928 the smaller dormitory added in 1923, and which held 9 beds, was discontinued because of possible risk of fire and a class-room on the ground floor with space for 16 beds substituted as sleeping-quarters. This gave us room for an additional 7 children.\n\nLast year, recognizing the rush of entries likely to occur, I made over rooms in the staff-wing which accommodate 10 beds nicely. We have thus room for 17 pupils in excess of the authorized number of 107.\n\nFrom my report you will have seen that I have struck off pupils bringing the number to 111; but owing to the difficulty of getting many of these children to proper, and also on account of the feeling of the parents, have carried them as our own pupils, as I felt that I had the necessary accommodation to care for them.\n\nI may mention here, that Mr. Barry on his inspection, looked through these dormitories and seemed to find them quite satisfactory such as the buildings are, and I definitely remember that he remarked that he did not find them overcrowded.\n\nThe school having the necessary space, as an act of charity I have carried the extra pupils at the expense of the Oblate Fathers in the hope for such time as proper arrangement can be made for their care.\n\nI appreciate that the Department finds it difficult to finance the extra grant for the present; but surely that should be no reason that these children should not be assisted.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nT.J.

Perry, January 4, 1934.\n\nOriginal on 153-1-6.\n\nWith the new Central Building and the reconstructed Boys' Building; the accommodation available has been greatly enlarged. I am of opinion that two hundred children can now be cared for without overcrowding. My recommendation in this respect is made under the head of Finance.\n\nI understand that the Principal will be visiting the Department of Indian Affairs in Ottawa during the month of January, and that he will on that occasion hand to the Secretary of the Department the blue prints which will clearly show all the changes in the buildings. I have pleasure however in informing the Department that the new work has been done in splendid manner, and in consequence excellent accommodation will now be available for about 100 extra Indian children at Mission. There are a large number of children in the Fraser valley, whom in my opinion should be in this Residential School.\n\nSpecial Recommendation:\n\nIn view of the fact that the Catholic Church has spent or is spending a very large sum in the reconstruction of the Residential School at Mission, and the erection of a new central building, and that the accommodation now available is sufficient for 200 children, I wish to recommend that per capita grant be allowed for 200 in place of the 107 and 3 special children for which this grant is at present sanctioned.\n\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM ASST.

H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools, B. C., together with his inspection report on the St. Mary's Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department has noted that the work being performed in the classrooms is satisfactory and that very good progress is being made by the pupils.\n\nThe Department has also noted the building operations that have been carried out by the church authorities, providing extra accommodation for 100 children. All this work has been undertaken without reference to the Department. Our estimates for the coming fiscal year are made up and before the Treasury Board. It is therefore unlikely that it will be possible to provide a grant for any increased enrolment at this school for the coming fiscal year. I have noted that the drainage, water supply and heating arrangements have been greatly improved and also that good dormitory accommodation is provided for an increased pupilage and fire hazard greatly reduced.\n\nIt is noted that the Principal intends to visit the Department and that he will submit blue prints showing all changes carried out in the buildings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nSt. Mary's Indian Residential School\n\nUNDER THE DIRECTION OF\nThe Oblate Fathers\n\nMISSION CITY, B.C.\n\nFounded in 1861 on the banks of the Fraser, St. Mary's School has carried on its work of educating the Indian ever since. For many years it was the only seat of learning in the region and had to open its doors to Indian and White alike. In course of time schools for the whites were built, but St. Mary's, instead of ceasing to exist, only specialized its course the better to suit the special needs of the Indian.\n\nThus it carried on, at first without aid from the Government at all, then receiving Sixty Dollars per annum per capita for board, tuition, clothing, and transportation to and from the School, and not infrequently the same sum had to provide a bonus to the parent who thought he should receive something for permitting the School to educate his child.\n\nIn 1884, new buildings were constructed on a higher level, and these have been enlarged and replaced as need arose. By 1925 two new separate Class-rooms had been erected. Likewise, the per capita grant, as well as the pupilage, was raised from time to time, in accordance with conditions, or reduced, as in the case of the recent depression, until the St. Mary's of January 1933 was receiving a per capita grant of One Hundred and Forty-Five Dollars per annum for one hundred and seven Indian Children.\n\nAt that time it had in residence one hundred and forty children\u2014not because its authorities liked to act contrariwise to an opinion of the Department that the school had not adequate accommodation for more than one hundred and seven, but because when parents came with their poorly clad and underfed children and pleaded that they might leave them at the school the Fathers could not refuse the youngsters admittance, for they realized that even if it meant comparative overcrowding, every child at the school would be infinitely better housed and better fed than he or she could be in the home such parents could provide.\n\nAnd so they were caring for twenty-three without compensation whatsoever, and the applications for admittance in September 1933 were coming in in goodly numbers, when, by June, it became apparent that additional accommodation must be provided.\n\nAccordingly the Department was visited and asked if assistance could be given to increase the capacity of St. Mary's School which serves a large district and one in which depression seems to have had specially baneful effects upon the Indians. Though no direct help could be offered, the assurance was given that the Department recognized the need of greater accommodation owing to the large number of Indians to be served by that School, and that an increased pupilage should almost surely follow as a matter of course if the School were enlarged and improved to warrant it.\nBuilding operations were commenced at once and went on unceasingly until just before Christmas 1932. Meanwhile a new building was erected, the dimensions of which are fifty by eighty feet. This building is of frame construction stuccoed and plastered, erected on a ten inch concrete foundation.\n\nIt has a full basement eight feet high, four feet above ground which furnishes ample space for kitchen store room, ice plant, dairy, quarters for dairyman and technical instructor, and technical class rooms, twenty-four by sixty-four and sixteen by twenty-four respectively. The main floor provides a spacious kitchen, a scullery, and four well-lighted and airy dining rooms, while the top floor is a dormitory with room for more than fifty children. The main floor rooms are ten feet high and the dormitory nine.\n\nThe fact of the new building furnishing a central kitchen and dining-rooms makes it possible to turn the former kitchen, dining-rooms and scullery of each residence to other uses. The space thus gained in the girls' residence permitted alterations which give larger sewing rooms, recreation halls, and dormitories, and in the boys', a large well-appointed infirmary, gymnasium, and additional dormitory space.\n\nThe boys' residence has been repaired and altered to such an extent that it serves its purpose now much better than it ever did. The girls' residence so far has not been completely done over but the early Spring will see work on it continued. The aim is to have St. Mary's, the first School in point of time in the Province, the first School in point of excellence under the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nSt. Mary's is serving the Indians and they appreciate it. This appreciation was evidenced in a tangible way recently by a bequest of one of its earliest graduates whose life savings made possible the building and repairing operations begun last Summer.\n\nAppreciated because it has provided for a great need, and loved because of its homelike atmosphere and beautiful surroundings, St. Mary's reason for existing is greater today than at any period in the past. There have been times when Indian parents could look after their children at home from the material point of view, the missionary could see to the spiritual, and the day-schools provide the educational needs in many localities, but now poor parents are hampered by Provincial Game and Fishing Laws and innumerable regulations which render them incapable of clothing and feeding their little ones, and the children either go to school improperly and inadequately clad, unable to do justice to school work because of hunger pangs, or else they must idle away their days at home.\n\nThough I took a very decided stand in September, and determined to limit the number of admissions to the pupilage allowed by the Department, I was forced to yield to the sheer pressure of unusual circumstances and at present one hundred and thirty-seven children are in attendance. But over a hundred others are clamouring for admission. Most of these have applied in writing on the regular forms provided by the Department.\n\nOf those admitted over and above the School's pupilage, and of those who have applied now for admission, the greatest number from any one place is from Pemberton Meadows. This is a very low and quite unhealthy place.\nspot, an undesirable site for a day school, and yet the centre of a large band of Indians. They are a well-organized band and have great attachment for St. Mary's School. Two families with five children in all of school age have literally camped on the School property for months seeking admission. Before Christmas I yielded to the extent of taking the oldest of the family with the majority.\n\nWe are desirous now, as in the past, to provide for the needs of all, but the debts incurred by the improvements already made make it quite impossible for us to carry any longer a greater number than is provided for by per capita grant. The school inspector and the agent have visited the school recently. They agree that we have done all that could be expected, more than actually was expected, to meet the requirements and provide accommodations for the Indian children of our districts, and we now humbly request the Department to increase the pupilage of our School to two hundred and twenty, for we believe we have ample space and accommodation for that number.\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nJanuary 25, 1934.\n\nDear Father Gillen:\n\nReferring to your report of the 10th instant, on the building operations carried out during the past summer at the St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School, which will enable the school to accommodate 200 pupils, and requesting that grant be provided for this number, I have to say that the Estimates for the coming fiscal year have been completed. It will therefore not be possible to include therein the amount required to provide for increasing the pupilage from the present number, viz.: 107, to 200. There are many demands which will have to be considered at the time the Supplementary Estimates are being prepared, and I regret it will not be possible to provide for any increase in pupilage over the number at present allowed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. A. M. D. Gillen, O. M. I.,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Mary's Mission Residential School,\nMission, B. C.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nFeb. 9th, 1934.\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nThe Minister would like you to furnish him with a report as to the condition of the Indian Residential School at Mission City, B.C., showing the repairs that are urgently needed, and the estimated cost of the same.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, Feb. 13, 1924\n\nMr.\n\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\nFebruary 12, 1934.\n\nMemorandum: The Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nWith reference to your request for a report on the repairs required to the St. Mary's Indian Residential School at Mission, B.C., I beg to say that no request has been received from the Church authorities for repairs to this building.\n\nThe St. Mary's Indian Residential School is owned and operated by the Reverend Oblate Fathers. Last year they built a new building 60' x 80', which furnished accommodation for a kitchen storeroom, ice plant, dairy, quarters for dairyman and technical instructor, technical class rooms, kitchen, scullery, dining rooms and dormitory.\n\nThe boys' residence was repaired and altered to such an extent that it now serves its purpose much better than previously.\n\nThe Church authorities are not asking for any reimbursement for the money expended for the additions and repairs, but have petitioned the department to allow for an increased pupilage from 107, their present number, to 200. They were advised on January 15th last that it would not be possible to provide for any increase in pupilage over the number at present allowed.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSIR:-\n\nThe Principal of St. Mary's Indian Residential School has applied to me for increased pupilage grant, based upon the additional dormitory space provided by recent additions and alterations at the school.\n\nThe accommodation now provided is as follows:\n\n| Girls Dormitories | Cubic Feet |\n|-------------------|------------|\n| 32 x 68 x 9       | 19,584     |\n| 15 x 30 x 10      | 4,500      |\n| 15 x 64 x 12      | 11,520     |\n| Total             | 35,604     |\n\n| Boys Dormitories  | Cubic Feet |\n|-------------------|------------|\n| 32 x 68 x 9       | 19,584     |\n| 24 x 36 x 9       | 7,776      |\n| 46 x 72 x 9       | 29,808     |\n| Total             | 57,168     |\n\nThis would give space for seventy-one girls and one hundred and fourteen boys, a total of one hundred and eighty-five in all, against the present grant for one hundred and seven pupils.\n\nIn this connection I would draw the attention of the Department to the great need for extra Roman Catholic Residential School service for this Agency.\n\nI have at date three hundred and seven children between the ages of seven and sixteen. Two hundred and seventy-three Catholics and thirty-four United Church.\n\nFor school accommodation I have the large Cqualeasetze Residential School, almost entirely for the benefit of distant Agencies, and on the other hand have to share the one hundred and seven pupil school at Mission with the Lytton Agency for my two hundred and seventy-three Catholic children. The Lytton Agency has large numbers of Catholics also to place.\n\nIt is therefore apparent that this extra pupilage is badly needed by both the Lytton and New Westminster Agencies, and I would strongly recommend that an increase be allowed this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa, April 7, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to the request of the Principal of the St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School for an increased pupilage.\n\nThis matter was discussed with the Department by Rev. A. M. D. Gillen, O. M. I., last January, and he was informed that, owing to the fact that no provision had been made for an increased pupilage in our Appropriation for the year 1934-35, it would not be possible to authorize per capita allowance for more than 107 pupils.\n\nThe advisability of providing an increase in pupilage at this school will be kept in mind when we are preparing our Estimates for the fiscal year 1935-36.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Sept., 17th, 1934\n\nMr. A. O'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThough our School is already filled to well beyond the allowed or granted pupilage appeals are still coming in requesting that we admit still other children. Some of these cases may be put off, and several have been put off, but occasionally an exceptional case arises,\u2014a case merit ing special consideration.\n\nJust such a case came to my attention yesterday, and I wish to know what I should do about it.\n\nMrs Henry Joe wrote to me with a strong plea that I admit her niece to the School at once. The niece's name is Mary Ann Joe, a child of Joe Jim of Skookumchuck, but he does not look after the child, and, it appears that the mother has abandoned her family. Mrs Henry Joe says that she cannot provide for her own children and her niece.\n\nWhile I should like very much to accept all the children in the district, and especially all the needy cases, there is a limit to the charity I can perform. If supernumerary grant could be procured for this and a few other similar cases I would gladly admit them. Please let me know what I should do.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nINDIAN OFFICE\nNEW WESTMINSTER\nSEP. 17 1934\nSIR:-\n\nI beg to forward you herewith a request received from the Reverend Principal of St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School, for a compassionate grant in connection with a child of the Skookum Chuck Band, named Mary Ann Jim.\n\nThe father, Joe Jim, is utterly worthless and it is really necessary that the child be placed in some Institution.\n\nWhile the Department have increased the school grant from 107 to 125, the Oblate Fathers are carrying a number of additional charity cases, and I think it only fair that they should receive what assistance we can give them.\n\nI would strongly recommend, therefore, that authority be given to include this child, Mary Ann Jim, as a grant earning pupil for the current school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.N. Daunt.\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 3, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th ultimo, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School, with reference to the case of an Indian child, named Mary Ann Jim, whose home conditions are unsatisfactory, and whom the Principal wishes to have admitted as a supernumerary grant-earning pupil.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department will approve of this girl being taken into the school, and per capita grant will be allowed for her, as a supernumerary, until such time as the first vacancy occurs among the regular grant-earning pupils - when she should be counted as a regular grant-earning pupil. When preparing his quarterly returns, he should note opposite the name of this girl that she is entitled to supernumerary grant. This case must not be taken as a precedent, as our funds are extremely limited and it will not be possible to authorize any extra pupils at this school. Please advise the Principal accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. O'H. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster,\nB. C.\nNEW WESTMINSTER, B.C.\nOctober 13th, 1934.\n\nSIR:-\n\nI beg to forward you herewith Report received from Reverend A.D.M. Gillen, Principal of St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School, for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1934.\n\nThe Grant is only allowed for 125 pupils, but the Reverend Principal has insisted on showing 178 upon the roll, which after deducting twenty discharged, leaves 158 or 33 in excess of the grant. There is ample accommodation for them, due to the improvements and additions made at the School by the Church Authorities, and the Reverend Principal informs me that he is leaving for Ottawa immediately to discuss the matter with you on the spot, so I am forwarding the report as it stands.\n\nI have returned this report once for alterations, and as you will see have made numerous corrections the second time it was received. I think it is in order now, and would strongly recommend that the Grant be forwarded as soon as possible.\n\nWith reference to pupil, No.343, James Charlie, in accordance with instructions contained in your letter No.153-1-10, dated July 18th, I instructed the Reverend Principal to show this boy on the September Quarter return as No.343, but he omitted to do so, and I have accordingly changed the number on the report.

Daunt,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nOn January 10th., last, I presented to the Indian Department at Ottawa a memorandum in which I outlined the needs of this district for greater Residential School capacity, the improvements already made to this School to increase its accommodation, and the urgency of an increase of pupilage for this School.\n\nBy letter of January 25th., I was notified that my request would not be granted; that not even would the item be included in the Supplementary Estimates. Going East in May I had an interview with the Minister of the Interior, at which the Deputy Superintendent General and Mr. Barber, our local Member, were present. There I was assured that an increase of pupilage would be allowed at once, to date from April 1st., 1934 and to cover as many as available funds would allow, and that the matter of further increase of pupilage would be given full consideration in the next estimates presented to Parliament.\n\nThe former portion of that promise has been fulfilled, for on July 19th., a letter from the Secretary informed me that our pupilage had been increased to 125 pupils, as from April 1st., and the June and September quarter grants have been paid accordingly. Now, I think it opportune to remind the Department of the latter part of the promise.\n\nMeanwhile, I have further increased the capacity of the School, by the erection of a three-story wing to the Girls' Building, and I would urge that request be made for 220 rather than 200 pupils.\n\nI enclose herewith a list indicating the dormitory space of the School as at present constituted.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nINDIAN OFFICE\nNEW WESTMINSTER\nDEC. 1 1934\nSIR:-\n\nI beg to forward you herewith a communication received from the Reverend A.

It is noted that the dormitories in the school provide ample air space for approximately 250 pupils.\n\nRegarding the Principal's request, I have to say that our Estimates for the coming fiscal year are now in course of preparation, and consideration will be given to providing for an increased pupilage. However, I am not in a position to state, at present, if any increase can be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. O'H.

MCGILL\n\nThe Minister recently discussed with you matters concerning the St. Mary's Residential School at Mission, B.C., and asks to be furnished with a memorandum, this to include the amount of the per capita grant paid by the Department to this School.\n\nGeorge Buskard\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nper\nFebruary 12, 1935.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable The Superintendent General,\n\nReferring to your memorandum of the 8th instant, relative to my recent discussion with you in connection with matters concerning the St. Mary's Indian Residential School at Mission, B.C., I would state as follows:\n\nThis school is the property of the Roman Catholic Church authorities (Oblate Order). During the years 1933-34, the Church authorities carried out extensive additions and alterations to the school building at a cost of $25,000. This work was undertaken solely on their own responsibility and without reference to the Department. Before these repairs and alterations were made, the matter of closing the school, owing to the dilapidated condition of the building, was receiving the consideration of the Department. The work carried out by the Church authorities, under the supervision of Rev. A.J.D. Gillen, C.M.S., the Principal, has greatly improved the condition of the building. By the enlargements and additions made, accommodation is now provided for 250 pupils. There is a separate building for boys and girls, also a new building for dormitory accommodation for the male members of the staff and a number of the older boys.\n\nPrevious to April 1, 1934, no capita grant was provided for 107 pupils. At the urgent request of Father Gillen, funds were provided from our General Appropriation for Indian Education for a grant for an increased pupilage to the total of 125. In the Appropriation for the coming fiscal year 1935-36 provision is made for an increase of 25 pupils; thus providing for a total of 150 as from April 1, 1935. Father Gillen has urged that a grant be provided for the full number of pupils which the school will accommodate.\n\nI might add that the Department has recently paid the cost of repairs to the heating system to the amount of $1,431.07.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSIR:-\n\nI am informed by the Reverend Principal of St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School, that grant was not allowed in respect to pupil, No. 0480, Mary Ann Jim (Joe), for the December Quarter.\n\nIn this connection, I would refer you to your letter dated October 3rd last, File No.153-1-1, in which you gave authority to have this girl admitted as a supernumerary grant earning pupil.\n\nThis authority was given subsequent to the decision to increase the grant to 125 pupils, which was dated July 19th last, File No.153-1-1, and it would, therefore, appear that the School is entitled to be paid for the pupil, in question.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.N. Daunt.\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 28th, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your No. 1-8-A of the 21st instant, I beg to say that the Department regrets overlooking the promise to allow supernumerary grant for Mary Ann Jim - No. 0480 of the St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School. Payment of the amount due for her maintenance for the December quarter will be made and a cheque will be forwarded to the Reverend Principal.\n\nIn authorizing supernumerary grant, it has been the practice of the Department to only allow per capita grant as a supernumerary until such time as a vacancy occurs among the regular grant-earning pupils and, in any case, payment as a supernumerary does not go beyond the end of the current academic year. In the case of Mary Ann Jim, this will mean that supernumerary grant will only be allowed for her until June 30th, 1935, after which date she should be absorbed among the regular grant-earning pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.

Accordingly, in 1934 an increase of 18 was given, and this year another of 25, bringing the pupilage up to 150 at present.\n\nThis number, however, falls far short of filling the needs of the district, and many children have to remain in the reserves roundabout without any schooling, while those we do accept have to be taken in at a later age and discharged at an earlier age than the children of any other Boarding School in the Province. Furthermore, this number leaves the School only partly filled, and the fact of the Indians knowing that there is room here for their children makes the refusal to accept their children hard for them to understand.\n\nI should be very grateful to you for any assistance towards remedying this situation. The capacity of the School at present is 220.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, December 5, 1935.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo, applying for an increased pupilage at the St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department has received definite instructions that the Estimates for the next fiscal year must not exceed the Appropriation for this year. Consequently, it was found impossible to increase the pupilage at any Indian residential school, although several requests have been received.

JOSEPH'S RECTORY, 151 Laurier Avenue East,\nOttawa, Ont., dated February 7, 1936.\n\nOriginal on 160-5.\n\nMISSION CITY SCHOOL - As you are doubtless aware, the Oblate Fathers have during the past year spent a considerable sum of money improving the buildings, providing accommodation for increased pupilage. At the present moment there is accommodation for 220 children whilst the Indian Dept. only recognizes pupilage for 152 children. One could understand this state of affairs were there no children in the various Indian reserves around seeking admission to the school. The fact is that not only are there large numbers of children eligible for school but the condition of these children is such as to cause even the Indian Agent himself to remark on their deplorable condition. These children are oftentimes the victims of sad circumstances and it is not at all uncommon (my authority is Rev. Fr. Patterson who works on the Indian reserves) for these children to be seen drinking with adults. Anyone interested in the Indian question and seeing the deplorable effects upon the lives of these children will readily see what inestimable benefits would accrue to them if the Indian Dept. would, by sanctioning their entry into the residential school, afford them the protection and care they need so urgently.\nFebruary 17, 1936.\n\nDear Father Scannell:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the requirements at the St. Mary's Mission, Kamloops and Kootenay Indian Residential Schools and enclosing a communication which you received from the Reverend Principal of the Kamloops School.\n\nRegarding the request for an increased pupilage at the St. Mary's Residential School, I would say that, owing to a drastic cut in our Estimates, it has not been possible to provide for an increase in pupilage at this school for the coming fiscal year. I have noted that there are a sufficient number of children eligible for admission to fill the school to its present accommodation.\n\nWith reference to the request contained in the communication from Reverend Father Kennedy, Principal of the Kamloops Indian Residential School, I would say that the laundry machinery has been supplied and instructions have recently been issued to make the alterations required to the laundry and install the machinery. Certain funds will be available in our appropriation for the coming fiscal year to carry out repairs, painting, etc., and to repair the sewage disposal system. I regret that it was not possible to proceed with the erection of the barn. A supply of supplementary reading material has recently been sent the Principal, and he will be advised with reference to retaining in the classroom a number of the pupils who are over 16 years of age.\n\nRegarding the supplying of storage batteries for the lighting system at the Kootenay Indian Residential School, I would say that this matter is now before the Honourable the Minister to approve the expenditure required, and we are awaiting his directions in the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHarold W. McGill\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nVery Rev. J. Scannell, O.M.I.,\nSt. Joseph's Rectory,\n161 Laurier Avenue East,\nOttawa, Ont.\nFebruary 26th, 1936.\n\nThe Honourable T.A. Crerar,\nThe Minister of the Interior,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nHonourable and dear Mr. Crerar:\n\nI beg to call to your attention a matter concerning some of the little Indian children of this Province.\n\nSince 1860, the Oblate Fathers have conducted a Residential School at St. Mary's Mission, (now Mission City, B.C.), where the educational needs of the Indian children of the district have been attended to.\n\nFrom time to time, increased accommodation was called for and provided, and each such increase, from the period when the Government began to allow grants for the education of its wards, met with the approval and sanction of the Government under which it was effected; increased pupilage followed as a matter of course, the increase being to the full capacity of the school so long as there were children to be educated.\n\nLatterly, however, it has not been thus. In 1933, the St. Mary's Mission School authorities approached the Department for increased accommodation. Both parties recognized the need of this, but the Department declared its inability to help financially towards construction while it agreed that, as in the past, increased accommodation would merit and receive corresponding increase in grant-earning pupilage.\n\nAccordingly as the accepted pupilage in 1933 was only 107 and the number of children in the district well over 200, alterations and additions were made at St. Mary's School to provide for 220 children. The work done at that time, met with the approval and high commendation of the Departmental authorities, yet, in 1934, an increase in pupilage of but 18 was granted. Redoubled efforts in 1935 resulted in an additional increase of 25, and so far this year no encouragement has been offered, no assurance given and but little hope held out that further recognition will be given by the Department to the necessary increased pupilage.\n\nAt the present time they are allowed 160 children.\n\nThey .....\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6468, file 890-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThey have actually 162, or 12 children in excess of that number. There are also a certain number of other children on the Reserve who should receive schooling, and if the Department could allow a larger pupilage of, say 25 more students, the Oblate Fathers could select the most needy children from the Reserve and place them in the school.\n\nWe appreciate indeed, all that the Department is doing for the education of the Indian children and write the above information in the interests of the children, knowing that the mind of the Department is to furnish every Indian child with the education necessary to become a good Canadian citizen.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nsgd) W.M. Duke\n\nW.M. Duke\nArchbishop of Vancouver.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMarch 3, 1936\n\nDr. McGill,\nD.S.C., Indian Affairs\n\nRe: St. Mary's Mission School,\nMission City, B.C.\n\nIn the attached letter (Feb. 26) the Archbishop of Vancouver calls attention to the need of increased pupilage at the above School, which serves Indian children of the district.\n\nWith its return, will you please furnish a draft reply for the Minister's signature.\n\nW.J.F. Pratt\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nEnc.\nMarch 5, 1936.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nReferring to memorandum of the third instant, with attached communication to the Honourable the Superintendent General from His Grace the Archbishop of Vancouver - requesting a grant for an increased pupilage at the St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School, Mission City, B.C., I would state as follows:\n\nThis school is the property of the Roman Catholic Church authorities (Oblate Order). During the years 1933 and 1934, the church authorities carried out extensive additions and alterations to the school building at a cost of $25,000. This work was undertaken solely on their own responsibility and without reference to the Department. Before these repairs and alterations were made the matter of closing the school, owing to the condition of the building, was receiving consideration by the Department. The work carried out by the church authorities greatly improved the condition of the building. By the enlargements, alterations and additions made, accommodation is now provided for 250 pupils. There is a building for the boys and one for the girls; also a new building for dormitory accommodation for the male members of the staff and a number of the older boys.\n\nPrevious to the carrying out of the above work, per capita grant was provided for 107 pupils. This was increased, in the Estimates for 1934-35, to provide for a pupilage to a total of 125. In the Estimates for 1935-36, provision was made for a further increase of 25 pupils - thus providing for a total of 150 as from April first, 1935. The church authorities have been urging since that time for a grant for the full number\n\n- of pupils\nof pupils which the school will accommodate. Owing to definite instructions, that no increases were to be made in our Estimates for the coming fiscal year, 1936-37, it was not possible to provide for a further number of pupils. The last returns from the school show that there are actually 162 children in attendance, and, as this school is situated in the vicinity of a number of reserves or Catholic Indians, there would be no difficulty in recruiting to the full number for which accommodation can be provided. I understand that many applications have to be refused by the school authorities.\n\nIt would, no doubt, be possible, from the appropriation for per capita grants for the coming fiscal year, to find funds to provide for an increase of 10 pupils, and the amount required would be as follows:\n\n\\[ 10 \\text{ pupils} \\times \\$170 \\text{ per capita} = \\$1700. \\]\n\nI beg to recommend that a grant for an increase of 10 pupils, as from January 1st, 1936, be provided, to the amount of $1700, less the present deductions. If this extra number is allowed, it would provide a grant for a total of 160 children. If the Superintendent General and yourself concur, a letter could then be drafted for his signature to the Archbishop of Vancouver.\nMarch 5, 1936.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nReferring to memorandum of the third instant, with attached communication to the Honourable the Superintendent General from His Grace the Archbishop of Vancouver - requesting a grant for an increased pupilage at the St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School, Mission City, B.C., I would state as follows:\n\nThis school is the property of the Roman Catholic Church authorities (Oblate Order).

However, each year we provide a small sum to take care of emergency requirements in the way of increased pupilage. By this I mean to provide for orphans or those children of school age whose unfavourable home surroundings make it desirable for the Department to send them to residential schools.\n\nThe $1700.00 required to take care of the ten extra pupils for the Mission School, recommended by Mr. Sutherland could be met from this appropriation and I would respectfully concur in the recommendation.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, March 5th, 1936.\n\nMy dear Archbishop Duke,\n\nIn reply to Your Grace's letter of February 28th I would say that the necessity for severe curtailment of our Estimates has prohibited us from any general increase in the enrolment of pupils of residential schools in receipt of the per capita grant.\n\nNevertheless, I find that a small appropriation is made each year to take care of unforeseen demands for the admission to residential schools of orphans and children exposed to undesirable home environment. I think this appropriation might be depended upon to provide for ten extra pupils in your enrolment and I shall direct that such provision be made.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMost Reverend W. M.

The delay in replying to same was caused by my absence from Victoria.\n\nI am certainly very sorry to hear that there have been complaints with regard to the St. Mary's Indian Residential School, at Mission. I had arranged for an inspection at this School on the 13th of October last but owing to an outbreak of mumps and chicken-pox at the School, it was found necessary to postpone my inspection until the School is clear of infectious disease. I shall, however, keep Your Grace's remarks in mind when carrying out my next inspection at Mission.\n\nMatters such as those mentioned in Your Grace's letter are as a rule dealt with by the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, and the church authorities under whom the School is administered without reference to me, unless a special report on the matter is required. I have, therefore, forwarded to the Department copies of Your Grace's letter of October 20th and of this reply in order that the officials of the Schools Branch may take any action they see fit.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H.

O'M. Daunt, Indian Agent,\nIndian Office,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Daunt:\n\nI wish to call your attention to a very serious matter regarding the pupilage of this school which I hope you will refer to the Department immediately to have settled as soon as possible.\n\nWhen I was appointed Principal in November I found 160 pupils in attendance with 15 more temporarily absent for one reason or another. I inquired as to the number for whom the Government allowed a per capita grant and I found it did not exceed 160. Now it is quite impossible to meet the expenses of the School with the grant for that number. The daily allowance for each child is barely sufficient to provide food, clothing, fuel and other necessary expenses. How then am I to provide for those children for whom the Government allows nothing?\n\nI am therefore forced either to provide those children with insufficient food and clothing or to discharge them. I can not and will not do the first. Any children kept in the School must be properly taken care of. Nor can I discharge them. Many of these same children are weak and sickly and need medical attention and special care which could not be given to them on the Reserves. Were they allowed to return to the Reserves a good number of them would die.\n\nFurthermore have not those children the same right to receive proper education and training? Are they not wards of the Government which should find means to provide for them and to educate them to become true Canadian citizens?\n\nThe only solution to the problem is to have the grant increased at least to 185. That would be sufficient to provide for the number already in School and for a few of the many who are making application to enter. There are more than fifty children whose parents are most anxious that they be admitted to School as soon as possible.\n\nThe Oblate Fathers made provision, within the last few years, for at least 215 children. In the past the Government allowed an increase in the grant where increased accommodation was provided. But for the present if you could prevail upon the Department to increase the grant by 25 I should feel enabled to meet the financial expenses of the School which, with the grant as it is now, are overburdening.\n\nWith kindest regards I am\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. O'Grady O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6468, file 890-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSIR:-\n\nI beg to forward you herewith, a communication received from Reverend F. O'Grady, Principal of St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School, in which he requests to have the present Grant for 160 pupils raised to 185.\n\nI am aware, of course, that the Department find it necessary to economize, but I would submit that the Reverend Principal has a very valid claim for consideration. It is true that in the area covered by the Lytton and New Westminster Agencies, there are three Residential Schools, St. George's Indian Residential School at Lytton, Coqualeetza Indian Residential School at Sardis, and St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School.\n\nSt. George's Indian Residential School takes care of something less than fifty percent of the Lytton children, the remainder being Roman Catholics come to St. Mary's Mission Residential School. Approximately all the New Westminster Indians being Catholic, Coqualeetza Indian Residential School is of no use to me, so the result is that I have to share St. Mary's Mission School with the Lytton Agency. This means, of course, that there are long waiting lists of children and many really necessitous cases which must be passed over.\n\nThe Church Authorities at their own expense provided accommodation up to 215 pupils to meet this situation, and the Department thus being relieved of constructional costs should, I think, make every effort to raise the Grant, as it can, from time to time, until it eventually reaches the limit of accommodation.\n\nWill you be good enough to give the matter your serious attention, and if it can be managed in any way increase the Grant for this Institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.O.N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nENCL.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6468, file 890-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, March 8th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your No. 1-8-A of the 9th ultimo, with reference to the request of the Principal of the St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School for an increase in the pupilage from 160 to 185.\n\nWe have received several applications from other Indian residential schools for increases in pupilage. All of these have been refused as funds for the purpose could not be secured. I regret, therefore, that, at the present time, the Department cannot favourably consider the application made by the Principal of the St. Mary's Mission Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes.\nSecretary.\n\nA. O'H. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B. C.\nReverend W.V. Doran, O.M.I.\nSt. Joseph's Rectory,\n151 Laurier Avenue, E.\nOttawa, ONT.\n\nReverend and Dear Father:\n\nOn February 7th last I addressed a letter to Mr. Indian Agent Daunt of New Westminster, B.C. asking for an increase of twenty-five in the present pupilage of our school. The letter was forwarded to the Department but so far no reply has been received.\n\nI have learned recently that it is not the wish of the Department to further increase the pupilage in any of the schools this year and that therefore it is quite unlikely our request will be granted. But it is absolutely necessary, as I outlined in my letter to Mr. Indian Agent Daunt, that something be done immediately to alleviate the financial burden we are forced to carry at present.\n\nWould it be possible to have a part of the present pupilage of the Cariboo Indian Residential School transferred to this School? I understand that the Cariboo School is not so hard pressed as we are here and could, without great detriment to itself, dispense with at least twelve of its present pupilage. That number, while not enough to increase the Grant sufficiently for the Children we have in School, will nevertheless be of great help to us in the present difficulties. I have spoken to Father Forbes about the matter and he is not unwilling to have part of his pupilage transferred.\n\nIf you would present this new proposition to the Secretary of the Indian Department for his immediate consideration I would be very grateful.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nSigned - F.O'Grady, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nMarch 16, 1937.\n\nMr. T.R.L. McInnis,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed is copy of a letter I received from Reverend Father O'Grady, Principal of the Indian Residential School at Mission City, B.C.\n\nI believe that the letter outlines so well the conditions that we wish to bring to your attention that it requires no further comment of mine.\n\nIn the event of your wishing further discussion of this matter, I would certainly appreciate a call from you.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nReverend W.V.Doran, O.M.I.\nOttawa, March 19th, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, enclosing copy of letter received from the Principal of the St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School with regard to the pupilage.\n\nIt is noted that the Cariboo Indian Residential School cannot secure the pupilage for which grant is allowed at the school and, under these circumstances, it has been decided to transfer per capita allowance for twelve (12) pupils from the Cariboo Indian Residential School to the St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School.\n\nThe above arrangement will be effective from January 1st, 1937, and it will mean that, from that date, the pupilage for which grant at the Cariboo Residential School is allowed will be reduced from 135 to 123.\n\nFrom the same date, the pupilage at the St. Mary's Mission Residential School will be increased from 160 to 172.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. W. V. Doran, O.M.I.,\nEnglish Oblates of Eastern Canada,\n151 Laurier Avenue East,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSt. Mary's Indian Residential School\nunder the direction of\nThe Oblate Fathers\n\nMission City, B.C., Oct. 11th, 1937.\n\nMr. A.O'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have an urgent matter which I should like you to take up with the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nWith the re-opening of School this year we were forced to refuse a number of children who had made application to enter. We accepted 185 although the per capita Grant is allowed for only 172. We could not possibly take more. We had to refuse children 13 and 14 years of age who have never been to School and who have been on the waiting list for two years.\n\nThe situation is explained by the fact that the New Westminster Agency is almost entirely Catholic and ours is the only Catholic Residential School in the Agency. It must, therefore, apart from the Day Schools, meet the educational needs of nearly all the children. The Coqualeetza Residential School at Sardis, although in this Agency, has not more than 15 of the children. Furthermore this School is expected to take care of more than 50 per cent of the Lytton Agency.\n\nThese facts explain why we have applications for more than the per capita allowance of 172.\n\nWould it not be possible for the Department this year to give us an increase of 15 in the Grant? Although we have accommodation for many more, yet an increase of 15 would enable us to accept those children whom we had to refuse and who are sadly in need of an education.\n\nWould you kindly urge the Department to give this matter serious consideration.\n\nYours sincerely\n\n\"F. O'Grady, O.M.I.\"\nPrincipal.\nNEW WESTMINSTER, B.C.\nOctober 13th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing a letter from the Reverend Principal of St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School, requesting that the Grant earning pupilage at the School be increased by fifteen.\n\nHe goes on to explain the Scholastic situation in the District, and I entirely concur with his views.\n\nThe vast majority of my Indians belong to the R.C. Church, as well as about fifty percent of the Lytton Agency Indians, and St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School has to supply the Residential Boarding School requirements of this large proportion of both Agencies.\n\nI presume it is too late to do much about it this year, but I would most strongly urge that consideration be given the matter for the coming fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"A.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 8,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have read the letter from the Rev. F. O'Grady, O.M.I., Principal of the St. Mary's Indian Residential School, Mission, and the recommendation of Mr. Indian Agent Daunt as contained in his l-8-A of October 13th last, and would report as follows:\n\nWhen I last inspected the Mission Indian Residential School on September 28th and 29th of this year, I found 67 boys and 108 girls or a total of 175 in the actual classrooms and dormitories, and a further 5 boys and girls in the Preventorium, making a total of 185 children in residence in the school. As reported after that visit a new Primary Classroom has lately been opened, and there was no sign of overcrowding in any of the dormitories.\n\nDuring the years 1933 and 1934 a considerable building programme was carried out by the Oblate Fathers at Mission. This provided for accommodation greatly in excess of the numbers previously accommodated here.\n\nIn my report to the Department after an inspection in December 1933, under the heading of Buildings I stated that two hundred children could be cared for without overcrowding.\n\nA new wing having been added in 1934 to the girls building, I reported, following an inspection in January 1935, that two hundred twenty children could easily be accommodated. There were at that time 144 in residence. I believe that soon after this the number of children permitted to draw Per Capita Grant was increased. As others took over the duties of reporting on Finance and Buildings about then, I have no further information with regard to the actual number permitted to remain in this school by the Department.\n\nAs you have asked me for my opinion I have no hesitation in recommending that two hundred children be authorized to draw Per Capita Grant at the St. Mary's Indian Residential School, this number to include the ten or so in the Preventorium. There is more than sufficient room in the main buildings for dormitory and classroom accommodation for one hundred ninety pupils.\n\nI certainly consider that it would be better to authorize such a number than to try to establish very small Day Schools in a large number of places. At the moment a number of children can not be accommodated in any Indian school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6468, file 890-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nThe attached correspondence deals with an application by the Rev. Father O'Grady, O.M.I., Principal, St. Mary's Indian Residential School, Mission, B.C., for an increase in the number authorized to draw the per capita grant by 15. At present the grant is paid on a pupilage basis of 172 and the Rev. Principal would increase this to at least 187. It will be observed that Capt. G.H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for B.C., recommends that the number authorized to draw the per capita grant at this school be raised to 200 but in view of the likelihood of a new Day School at Pemberton which, if established, would take care of some of the Pemberton children now attending St. Mary's Residential School, thereby making room for some of those not attending any school for lack of accommodation, I would recommend that the Department favorably consider increasing the number authorized to draw the per capita grant to 187.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 7, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of November 30th, enclosing correspondence in connection with the application of the Principal of the St. Mary's Indian Residential School for an increase in pupilage.\n\nAlthough the Department has received several requests from different residential schools for increase of pupilage, it has not been found possible to favourably consider any of them. I regret that, at the present time, we are not in a position to authorize any increase in the pupilage at the St. Mary's Mission School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Box 5,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to request the Department to allow a supernumerary grant to St. Mary's Mission Residential School, to cover the admittance of ten Indian children to that Institution.\n\nThere are in the Boston Bar Band ten children of school age and Roman Catholic denomination, who are not now and have not been attending school because of lack of room in the Roman Catholic Residential Schools. Recently I learned that St. Mary's Mission School has room for this number of pupils but they have no grant to cover them.\n\nThe problem of adequately caring for these children at home is a difficult one, particularly at this time of the year when resources are very low and if a grant could be allowed to cover their admission it would help a great deal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Strang,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 21, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 9th instant in which you request supernumerary grant for an additional 10 pupils at the St. Mary's Mission Indian residential school in order to permit the admission of that number of children from the Boston Bar Band.\n\nI regret that owing to lack of funds it is not possible to favourably consider allowing supernumerary grant for 10 extra pupils at the St. Mary's Mission school. I am, however, writing to the Rev. Principal and drawing his attention to the fact that the children to whom you refer have not had the advantage of any educational facilities. He is being requested to give these children first consideration when recruiting for the St. Mary's Mission school for the academic year 1939-40.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

He requested that they be admitted to the St. Mary's Mission Indian residential school and supernumerary grant allowed for them.\n\nI regret that owing to lack of funds it is not possible to favourably consider the recommendation of Indian Agent Strang. However, it is presumed that there will be a number of children discharged from the St. Mary's Mission residential school at the end of the current academic year, June 30 next. When recruiting new children to replace those who have been discharged it would be appreciated if you would give first consideration to the children from the Boston Bar Reserve.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

McGill,\nDirector Indian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. McGill:\n\nI wish to take this opportunity of expressing my grateful appreciation of the special grant allowed for the St. Mary's Indian Residential School at Mission, B.C., for the year 1941. It is a further indication of the sympathetic co-operation of the Department with the Indian Residential schools. I would be glad if you would convey my thanks to the Honorable Minister.\n\nYou may be assured that we are practising every reasonable economy possible at the school and that the special grant will be very judiciously expended, for the welfare and training of the Indian children. This rigid economy has been our practice ever since the previous reduction in the quarterly grant. The present special grant, while effecting, as it were, a respite, by no means creates a substantial reserve; but it does lessen the financial burden of the school and for this we are truly thankful to the Department and yourself.\n\nVery sincerely,\n\nA.H. Fleury, O.M.I. Principal.\nREPORT ON NEW WESTMINSTER AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL, 1944.\n\nSt. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School entered three teams of Indian pupils at the Provincial Recreation Display at Vancouver Forum. They won third, fourth and fifth prizes, which considering the competition reflects great credit on the School.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON NEW WESTMINSTER INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH MAY, 1944.\n\nThe St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School won two first Prizes and Challenge Cup in the School competition for Tuberculosis Posters. The girls from the School also won first and second prizes at the Fraser Valley Musical Festival during the month.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\nWelfare & Training -\n\nThe St. Mary's Indian Residential School continues to do wonderful work in training its pupils for future life. The boys are given a thorough manual training on practical lines, and are carefully trained in farming as well. The girls receive a similar instruction in home economics, including both needlework and cooking. A great deal of very useful instruction has been given them in the art of making over garments, by the adaptation of military uniforms to ordinary civilian requirements. This school also believes in the character forming quantities of Athletic and Gymnastic instruction, and has gone far in this respect. The various school teams have an enviable record in various fields of sport, and their gymnastic teams have gained laurels not only in the local valley towns, but in Vancouver itself. About sixty boys make up five teams. This physical activity has had a wonderful effect on the boys, and has greatly advanced the mental and moral standard of these young people. Mr. J. Matheson, Provincial Director of the Pro-Rec. in a recent broadcast spoke in glowing terms of the work being performed by the school in this direction. The boys of this School will compete in the Provincial Gymnastic competition this Spring. The disciplinarian at the School this year, is Thomas Bull, a former pupil and outstanding athlete.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\nSt. Mary's Indian Residential School: The Reverend A.H. Fleury, O.M.I., is Principal of this School, which has a roll of 200 pupils, 94 boys and 106 girls. Their health has been excellent throughout the year. Conditions at the School are very good, and it is very popular with the Indians. Inspector's reports are invariably good, the children happy, and in every way this school is outstanding. It has made quite a name for itself in the Pro. Rec. and Athletic field as well.\n\nIn addition to the actual School Work, the Reverend Principal co-operates with the Coqualeetza Indian Hospital by carrying a number of convalescent children from that Institution in his Preventorium, which is in the charge of a Registered Nurse. Many of these children had had no previous connection with the School or Agency. This releases hospital beds, while the children receive convalescent care they would not receive at their homes.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI beg to report, for your information, that on April 11th, the St. Mary's Indian Residential School was visited by Major Ian Eisenhardt, Federal Director of National Physical Fitness. He was accompanied by Captain G.C. Darby, University of Saskatchewan, Mr. Ray Youmans, University of Manitoba, and Mr. Gerry Methierson, of the British Columbia Fitness Programme. I met these gentlemen at the School.\n\nThe School teams put on a display which was declared by Major Eisenhardt to be the best he had seen in his tour of the Country. He was also greatly impressed by the singing of both Boys and Girls.\n\nMajor Eisenhardt stated it was his intention to call upon the Department, when he returns to Ottawa, around April 23rd, and seemed to be anxious to make arrangements, if possible, for a team from the School to give displays across Canada, during the coming summer. He will doubtless, go fully into his re-actions when he visits you.\n\nA very fine luncheon was served to the party by the pupils of the School.\n\nThere is no doubt that the performance put up by the pupils was a great credit to themselves, the School, and the Department.\n\nA.O'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 19, 1945.\n\nDear Major Eisenhardt:\n\nI have received acknowledgment your letter of the 18th instant and also copies of memoranda relating to a gymnastic display at the St. Mary's Indian Residential School and to the proposed tour of a group of Indian boys, sent forward therewith.\n\nI can see no objection whatever to your proposal that a film on training in physical education at the St. Mary's Indian Residential School be taken for display purposes throughout the Dominion. Indeed, I feel sure that the taking and display of this film will bring a great deal of worthwhile publicity to this Branch and particularly to our Welfare and Training Division.\n\nThe suggestion that fifteen Indian boys now enrolled at the St. Mary's School be included in the group with the object of visiting a number of the larger Canadian cities is also acceptable to this Department. I notice that Father Fleury will accompany the boys. In this connection, it has occurred to me that the tour should prove of more than ordinary educational value to this group of pupils. I am sending a copy of this letter to Father Fleury for his information.\n\nI shall be glad to discuss with the Minister just as soon as I have an opportunity to do so, the suggestion contained in the last paragraph of your communication. May I embrace this opportunity to thank you very heartily for your visit of a few days ago and for the interest you have taken in physical education amongst Indian boys and girls.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMajor Ian Eisenhardt,\nNational Director of Physical Fitness,\nDepartment of National Health and Welfare,\nDaly Building,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6468, file 890-1, part 2)\nRoom 226, Daly Building,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nMay 18, 1945.\n\nMr. R.

Indeed, I feel sure that the taking and display of this film will bring a great deal of worthwhile publicity to this Branch and particularly to our Welfare and Training Division.\n\nThe suggestion that fifteen Indian boys now enrolled at the St. Mary's School be included in the group with the object of visiting a number of the larger Canadian cities is also acceptable to this Department.

The subject matter of this correspondence, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nIt would appear that Major Eisenhardt visited St. Mary's Indian Residential School, Mission, British Columbia, about two years ago, and while there, succeeded in interesting the boys in a physical fitness campaign. Major Eisenhardt reports that the boys have made phenomenal progress and at the moment excel to a greater extent than any other group of whom he has knowledge in gymnastics, folk dancing, etc. He is so impressed by the work of these boys that he now proposes to take them on a tour of the Dominion and to have a film made of their exercises at an approximate cost of $5,000.00. When the matter was discussed with me first, it was my understanding that the full cost would be borne by the Department of National Health and Welfare, but it now transpires that their funds are somewhat limited, hence the request to this Branch for a 50% contribution. While no provision has been made in our estimates for such an expenditure and while the expenditure itself is somewhat substantial, conversations I have had with Major Eisenhardt have convinced me that the project is well worthwhile and should prove invaluable from a publicity standpoint. This film displayed on other reserves should prove of great educational value, particularly along the lines of health and physical development. The amount of $2,500.00 might be included in a supplementary estimate or paid from our welfare funds with the approval of the Minister. Your comments on this proposal would be appreciated.\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI am sending forward herewith copies of correspondence between this branch and Major Ian Eisenhardt, National Director of Physical Fitness.

The third group of seniors gave an advanced display of tumbling, high vaulting, springboard and parallel bar work, finishing off with two-man pitching and tossing.\n\nAt the close the girls of the School sang and Major Eisenhardt addressed them. He complimented the children and their instructors on their fine performances. He also announced that he would arrange for the National Film Board to visit the School to take a film of the display, to be shown across Canada, as he considered it the finest exhibition of gymnastics that he had seen from such young people.\nMr. P.

The pupils at the St. Mary's school made an excellent showing in Pro-Rec work and it is considered that assistance in this case would be warranted.\n\nThe Director of the Recreational and Physical Education Branch advises me that his Department is quite prepared to take care of the expenses incurred by Mr. Ruben, their instructor.\n\nD.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am writing in connection with the proposed summer course in Physical Education and Leadership, open to Indian boys, under the auspices of the Provincial Department of Education.\n\nThe course started yesterday, August 6th, and is being conducted at the Normal School in Vancouver. I have enrolled two senior boys, Thomas Bull of Seton Lake and Ernie Charlie of Harrison Mills. These are two of our most promising boys and I would have liked to have sent more, but I could not find suitable accommodation for them in the city.\n\nI am very pleased about the boys taking the course, as it is just the thing for them. The course comprises many very useful subjects in the fields of Health and Physical and Social Education. I am enclosing a copy of the time table, which you may find interesting.\n\nThrough the kindness of the Christian Brothers, I have been able to find accommodation for the boys at Vancouver College, where they will be well looked after. I have also arranged to have Mr. Ruben, one of the Instructors, board with the two boys, in order to look after their welfare, while in the city. The course is free, but I will have to pay for the living accommodations for the three. This will amount to about thirty dollars each for the month of August, the duration of the course. I would respectfully ask that the Department assume this expense, namely the amount of $90.00.\n\nThe course will complement previous training, given these boys and prepare them for positions of responsibility in the Schools. Thomas Bull, one of the boys, has already served one year as disciplinarian at St. Mary's and has given fullest satisfaction. I have hopes of placing the other boy in a School this autumn.\n\n(over)\nInasmuch as this course of studies is educational and richly deserved by these boys in view of their aptitude and attentive work at school, I feel that it is not asking too much to request the Department to defray the aforementioned expenses.\n\nVery sincerely,\n\nA.H. Fleury, O.M.I. Principal.\nOttawa, 17th August, 1945.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant with reference to two pupils of St. Mary's Indian Residential School who are taking a special course at the Provincial Recreational and Physical Education School at Vancouver.\n\nIn view of your recommendation, the Department will allow an amount of $60.00 to pay the cost of room and board.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nINDIANS ENROLL AS PRO-REC LEADERS \u2014 The first Indians ever to enroll in the Pro-Rec leader physical education course are shown above limbering up before the first day's work begins.

Daunt,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Daunt;\n\nThis letter is in reference to the Indian Commissioner file number 0-11-1, dated August 20th, 1945.\n\nI am enclosing receipted bills in triplicate from the Vancouver College, in the amount of $150.00. This covered the board and room of two of our Indian school boys and a Pro-Rec leader for the month of August.\n\nI have received $50.00 from the Pro-Rec for their man, which leaves a balance of $100.00 for the two Indian boys. Frankly, I did not surmise that cost would be so high, and I applied for only $60.00, as I thought that would be a reasonable charge. If the Department can only re-imburse me in the amount of $60.00, which was originally asked for and authorized, the remainder of $40.00 will have to be charged against school funds, which is not all-together fair to me, but, I suppose I should have secured a definite rate from the College before applying.\n\nHowever, the course was of wonderful benefit to the boys. It was great experience, mingling with other youth leaders and receiving a training that is of immense value to them. I hope that we have more boys taking the course next year. I am very grateful to the Department for the help that they have given.\n\nVery sincerely,\n\nA.H. Fleury, O.M.I. Principal.\nVancouver College\n39th AVENUE and CARTIER\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nTo Rev.

E. Hoey,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nIt is my duty to call your attention to a situation that has been prevalent for some years in the district and territory served by St Mary's Indian Residential School.\n\nThis institution has an authorized quota of 175 pupils and serves the two Agencies of New Westminster and Lytton. There are, in these two Agencies, according to the Government Census of 1939, 629 Catholic children of school age. Beside St Mary's boarding school, there are four Catholic Day Schools operating in these two Agencies with a maximum enrollment of 110 pupils. Also about 85 children attend other Residential Schools. This leaves about 434 children to be taken care of by St Mary's. Considering the fact that our quota is 175, this means that about 80% of the Catholic children of these two Agencies are without the means of Catholic schooling. You will admit with me that this is a very alarming situation, both from the point of view of the Department and the Church. It is all the more striking when you consider that most of these children live in the Fraser Valley, a thickly populated and progressive district. In such surroundings, lack of education is a serious handicap.\n\nIn an effort to relieve this situation, St Mary's School has been carrying a considerable number over its quota of 175 as there is room for 210 children at the school. This is not fair, you will admit, to the school but the pressure of applications has been so great, especially\n\n......2\nto Mr. R. E. Hoey --\n\nin regard to destitute children, that we could hardly refuse sympathetic aid to the requests of Agents and parents. There are present, today, at St Mary's 97 boys and 105 girls. This represents 28 over our quota.\n\nI am informed that this situation has now existed for over five years and that the Principal has carried that extra number without receiving any relief from the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nIn view of the above facts, I will ask you to authorize an increase for this school from the present number of 175 to 210. This increase will enable us to take a few more pupils over the number that we have in already and will facilitate the operation of the school.\n\nWhile the above increase will not solve the Indian problem in the territory served by St Mary's it will at least enable the Principal to carry on with less anxiety and fewer financial troubles. The matter of providing school accommodation for the 200 odd children who are at the present time without school facilities may be left to some future plans which may be evolved between St Mary's and your Department.\n\nHoping that you will give this matter your immediate attention, I remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, November 1, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School,\nNew Westminster Indian Agency, B.C.\n\nA request has just been received for an increase in the pupilage at this school.\n\nAt the present time the school has an authorized enrolment of 175 pupils and accepts the Roman Catholic Indian children from the New Westminster and Lytton Agencies. There are upwards of 629 Catholic children of school age in these two agencies. We have four day schools, which have a maximum enrolment of approximately 125 and an additional 85 Catholic children from these agencies attend residential schools other than the St. Mary's. This leaves approximately 390 children of school age in the two agencies for whom the St. Mary's School is expected to provide.\n\nMost of these children live in the Fraser valley, a thickly populated, progressive district, and in such surroundings Indian children who have no education suffer a serious handicap.\n\nThere is accommodation in this school for 210 pupils and, as a matter of fact, the school has been accepting approximately 20 pupils over their authorized pupilage during the past year.\n\nI realize that increasing the pupilage at this school will not totally solve the educational problem.\nin the territory served by St. Mary's, but an increase would benefit several children. Under the circumstances I recommend, for the Minister's approval, that the pupilage at this school be increased from 175 to 210, effective October 1, 1945. Funds for the purpose are available in the current year's appropriation.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, November 6, 1945.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI am sending forward herewith a request for an increase in the authorized enrolment at the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, Pelican, Alberta, and St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School, New Westminster, British Columbia.\n\nIn this connection, may I refer to Mr. Jackson's memorandum of November 2nd, in which he asks if consideration has been given to the establishment of improved Indian Day Schools on the reserves from which Residential School pupils are recruited. The records indicate that an educational survey was undertaken at the Pelican Reserve by Mr. Doucet about three years ago. Mr. Doucet, in his report, states that the condition of the roads on the reserve, the scattered settlements and climatic conditions, in his judgment, render the operation of an Indian Day School impracticable. No educational survey, so far as I am aware, has been made at W'Appello or at St. Mary's Mission at any time since I entered the department. I am of the opinion, however, that the need for thorough educational surveys at Residential Schools and on reserves throughout the Dominion is becoming a matter of considerable urgency. Should such surveys be undertaken, however, at the earliest possible date and should it be decided to establish improved Day Schools on a number of reserves, it is not at all likely that these schools could be established and in operation at any time within the next two years; in the meantime, our Indian Agents in the administration of Family Allowances are called upon to certify that educational facilities are not available for groups of Indian pupils before such pupils or their parents qualify for allowances under the Family Allowance Act.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6468, file 890-1, part 2)\nAllowance Act. It is somewhat difficult for an Agent to do this if he is aware that space is available at Residential Schools in his Agency. The Qu'Appelle School is a spacious building, fully fireproof and is capable of providing instruction for at least 325 pupils; as a matter of fact, they have 280 pupils enrolled at this date.\n\nSt. Mary's Mission is a Church-owned school and the Principal and Father Scannell, who discussed the enrolment of this school with me recently, assured me that they had ample accommodation for 210 pupils, with 185 enrolled at that date.\n\nThe Peigan School is a Government-owned school with a comparatively small enrolment of fifty pupils. I notice from the last audit report that a large staff is employed at this school, which, if reduced, would no doubt enable them to enrol an additional fifteen pupils.\n\nMay I suggest that consideration be given to these requests on the understanding that thorough educational surveys will be undertaken on the reserves served by these institutions just as soon as officials qualified to undertake this work are available. While funds are available for this increased enrolment in the present fiscal year, these requests if granted would mean an additional expenditure during the fiscal year 1946-47 of approximately $20,000.00. Such requests, if granted, should also be granted on the understanding that the authorized pupilage at each of these schools may be substantially reduced just as soon as improved Day School accommodation can be provided. This decision on the part of the department would discourage or tend to discourage the building of additional classrooms to accommodate pupils who may be seeking enrolment during the next two or three-year period.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6468, file 890-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM:\n\n- Mr. Hoey -\n\nI discussed with the Minister your memorandum of the 6th instant in reference to the requests you have received for an increase in the authorized enrolment at the Sacred Heart Residential School, Peigan, Alta., and St. Mary's Mission Residential School, New Westminster, B.C.\n\nIn view of our inability to provide now the necessary improved Day Schools which would undoubtedly serve the educational needs of many of the children in these Residential Schools, the Minister approved of the proposed increases.\n\nThe requests are granted on the understanding that the authorized pupilage at each of the schools may be substantially reduced just as soon as improved Day School accommodation can be provided.

Hoey,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI wish to take this opportunity of expressing my deep appreciation of your many kindnesses to me, when I was in Ottawa some months ago. Above all, I wish to thank you for your kind efforts, which resulted in having our school grant increased by thirty-five pupils. While the facts, that I presented, spoke for themselves, in this case, nevertheless, I realize that the satisfactory results obtained, were due in a large part to your sympathetic understanding and keen interest in the welfare of our School.\n\nThe increase in pupilage and consequent financial increase will greatly relieve the burden, under which we have been operating for the past years. Moreover it will enable me to do more for the children. I have already taken on two new teachers, making a total of five at the school. Thus you can see that the increase is being applied directly for the benefit of the children. This is a source of satisfaction not only to myself, but to the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nPlease accept my sincere wishes for a continuance of good health and a full measure of success in your administration during the year of 1946.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA.H. Fleury, O.M.I. Principal.\nSt. Mary's Indian Residential School\nUNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE OBLATE FATHERS\n\nJanuary 17th, 1946 MISSION, B.C.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan;\n\nDuring our conversations of some months ago, I was given to understand that the Department of Indian Affairs had set aside the sum of $2500.00 as its contribution towards the filming of pictures by the National Film Board, at the St. Mary's School. This was part of a project, sponsored by the National Fitness Director, Major Ian Eisenhardt and discussed between him and Mr. R.A. Hoey, Director of Indian Affairs.\n\nAt the same time, while I was in Ottawa, I talked over this matter with an official of the National Film Board. As an outcome of this talk it was suggested that it would be more feasible and desirable if these pictures were filmed not sooner than May 1946. This has now become a certainty, due on one part to the availability of the Film Board and on the other to the nature of the pictures to be filmed. Since this will bring us into a new fiscal year, I was wondering if arrangements can be made to carry over the appropriation into the new period. It would be a highly desirable move as otherwise it would result in a very discouraging let-down. Our plans and interest in the project have not lessened, but rather increased in line with a greatly augmented and successful program of Physical and Cultural Activities now in operation at the School. I am sure that the Department feels as I do, that these pictures will not only reflect great credit on the Department and the School, but also serve as an inspiration in other places, where it would have the same beneficial results, obtained in our School.\n\nVery sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6468, file 890-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSt. Mary's Indian Residential School\nUNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE OBLATE FATHERS\n\nMISSION, B.C.\nJanuary 17th,\n1946.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nPlease accept my sincere thanks for your many kindnesses shown to me when I was in Ottawa some months ago. Above all for your efforts, which resulted in our school pupilage being increased by thirty-five. I felt that I had a 'good case' in presenting my request for increase, but I know full well that if I had not your support and interest, the results might not have been so favourable.\n\nWhile it has been indicated that this increase may be only temporary, I have full confidence that the Department will confirm the increase as a permanent measure. As a result of the increase, I have been able to take on two new teachers, which applies the increase directly to the welfare and benefit of the children in a field of vital interest to the Department. To me it is unthinkable that the Department should do anything at a later date, which would withdraw this benefit. We have now five excellent teachers at the school. I would be glad to have your comments on this matter, so that I may have some reassurance for the future.\n\nI am enclosing correspondence in regard to other school matters, for which I would like to have your advice and consideration.\n\nWith kind personal regards.\n\nVery sincerely,\n\nA.H.

I discussed this matter last week with an official of the National Film Board and was informed that the approximate cost of taking the film would be $5,000.00. Mr. Hoey promised to provide to you $2,500.00 of the supplementary estimates submitted to the last session of Parliament. This was approved. However, the latest information is to the effect there is no appropriation available for the other $2,500.00 required.\n\nI discussed the matter with Mr. Hoey this morning and under the circumstances nothing further can be done at the present time. I am extremely sorry about this as I know it will be a disappointment to you but possibly the matter can be revived later in the year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

The financial responsibilities of a School today are most heavy and often disheartening. There are so many things one would like to do towards improving the general standards of the School.

Summer Course here in Vancouver in August. At the time of your visit here to the School you were willing to allow these boys the sum of $25.00 weekly during the three weeks Course to cover their expenses. Two of our Indian boys have volunteered to take this Course. One is Tommy Hull, who will be in charge of Physical Education here during the year. He is a fine athlete and a natural leader and should greatly benefit by this Course. The other is Herbert Francis, a graduate of the School and this Fall will be looking after Physical Ed. on the Seabird Island Indian Reserve situated near Agassiz B.C. He was for two years in charge of Physical Ed. here at the School and is an outstanding boy. Tommy is 24 yrs old and Herbert 21. I fully believe that these two boys willingly profit by the Course and should be able later on to carry on this work amongst their own people. Would appreciate an early reply so that I may get word to both these boys.\n\nIn regard to Physical Ed. and Recreation in the School. As you know we have had a very thorough and complete Course in this regard for some years. This has comprised Pro-Rec gymnastics; folk dancing; inter-mural sports etc. In order to carry on this Course the School has employed an Indian boy to help along in this work. Likewise the services of Mr. and Mrs. Huben, both Pro-Rec Instructors. Would it be possible to receive some aid towards the salaries we are now paying out to these people to carry on this Course? The Indian employee receives $1000.00 yearly. Mr. and Mrs Huben $100.00 each yearly. Any financial help along this line would be appreciated.\n\nMany thanks for the snaps taken during your visit.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Mary's Ind.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Mary's Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 2nd, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at New Westminster, B.C., this 4th Oct., 1943.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nTelep.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Mary's Indians School for the Quarter ended... Dec. 31st. 19... Principal... A. H. Flanagan.\n\nDated... Jan. 4th. 19... I have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Mary's Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: A. H. Fleury, O.M.\n\nDated: April 3, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at New Westminster this 15th April 1944.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 408\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Mary's I.R. School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: July 10, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: New Westminster, this 12th July, 1944.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance at St. Mary's Indian School and tuition at Mission City, B.C., School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: A. H. Flannery, O.M.\n\nDated Oct. 4, 1944.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at New Westminster this 5th October, 1944.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.
