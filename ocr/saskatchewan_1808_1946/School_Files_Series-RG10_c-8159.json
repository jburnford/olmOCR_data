It is of the utmost importance that this school re-open on September 5. The teacher who will conduct the school has been engaged by the Department and will report for duty on that date.\n\nThe necessary action to secure the seats requested by you will be taken here and delivery will be made in due course.\n\nYou are authorized, therefore, to proceed with the other additional repairs. If you find it impossible to have a table for the teacher made on the reserve, you should purchase one and have it installed at once.\n\nYour only responsibility in this matter is to see that the repairs are undertaken and completed and the table and desks installed. Indian day schools are conducted by the Department from Ottawa. No provision is made in the Indian Act for the election of trustees to administer such schools. It is just possible that a caretaker may be required, but this is a matter that can be discussed with the teacher and the request sent forward later.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

The bill for the \"tin\" cups has already been forwarded to you.\n\nThe supply of books has arrived and my pupils are very interested in all we are doing for them.\n\nI again mentioned caretaker to our agent, and \"Miss Elizabeth Marr, Shubenacadie,\" has been\nengaged for this position.\n\nA second-hand teacher's desk has been supplied. (It is yet unfainted) also a second-hand table.\n\nThe question has arisen as to whom is to supply our wood or coal. Our local agent wants the Indian people to supply the school with wood, but I have been two weeks now waiting for a supply to come in, and none has come yet. Each seems to be waiting for someone else. If some one person were appointed to supply the wood for the school we could be dependent on him, as it is we are depending on everyone, and nothing is done.\n\nKindly advise as soon as possible what I can do towards this matter.\n\nMr. Dobbs has also promised to have our yard cleaned. I would have regarded this as an outdoor project for my pupils, if it were\nnot for the condition of the outside \"toilets\" that have been used and abandoned by the family who formerly occupied the school-house. However, this is not a child's work, so I cannot regard it as an outdoor project; therefore the condition of our school yard is very unsanitary and would surely be condemned if certain members of the Board of Health were to visit us. Kindly advise what further step I may take.\n\nI would also like a copy of the list of books supplied by the Department for children in grades zero, three, five, six, seven and nine.\n\nI shall send the \"return\" for September as soon as I receive the materials you are sending, but in the meantime, I would like to say I love my work and my pupils are doing nicely. I have a\nwonderful group of boys and girls. Hoping their progress will continue and that their present standing will be satisfactory to you. I am\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nElgie Charles.\nOttawa,\nOctober 21, 1939.\n\nDear Miss Charles:\n\nI find it necessary to return the account which you forwarded covering the cost of the towelling purchased for the Shubenacadie day school. You should certify on the account that it is correct and that you have received the goods and sign all three copies.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMiss Elsie Charles,\nTeacher,\nIndian Day School,\nShubenacadie, N. S.\nOttawa,\nOctober 21, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is informed by the teacher of the Shubenacadie Indian day school that no wood has yet been supplied to the school.

I didn't\nknow of this order until notice of this kind\nwas made. Ben Brown of Springhill, N.S.\nwanted to come here with a large family but\nwasn't able to get a house to live in because\nhe had been and informed me he was getting $8.00\nper month and $15.00 for a infant child.\nI told him he would be able to get work\nhere and wouldn't need the $8.00 as he was an\nable bodied man he left home and said he\nwould take the matter up with the Dept and\nask for a house to be built for him whether\nhe did or not I don't know.

It now appears from a letter received from Indian Agent Robb that these desks are not required as an Indian family whose children were expected to attend the school have now decided to reside elsewhere. There is not much advantage in returning these desks and consequently the Agent is being requested to have them placed in the school, but I would point out that in future you should be extremely careful that any article of equipment is required before requesting authority to purchase it. I may also add that all your requisitions in future must be forwarded through the office of the local Indian Agent or no attention will be paid to them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

However, the family with whom I am now boarding intend selling their home and moving away as soon as this school term is finished. If this plan be carried out that would leave the teacher without a residence and without boarding accommodation; therefore I would suggest the Department make some provision for the coming term 1941-'42, and later years.\n\nMr. Duncan's home would be a likely or suitable purchase. It is new (built in 1938) neatly finished and fairly comfortable, its size is about 18x24', and it is a convenient distance from the school.\n\nKindly let me know immediately what provision can be made by the department with regard to a Teacher's Residence, as soon as possible.\n\nI am,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nElsie Charles\nOttawa,\nMay 5, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI attach copy of a letter which has just been received from Miss Elsie Charles, teacher of the Shubenacadie Indian Day School. No funds were provided in the current year's appropriation for the erection or purchase of a teacher's residence on this reserve.\n\nMr. Phelan, who visited the reserve in 1939, is under the impression that there is sufficient room in the building now used as a school to supply living quarters for a single teacher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

The plans of this building should be followed with the following changes:\n\n1. Double doors should be provided from the outside to the general workshop entrance to the latter to be by ramp. A railing should be provided around the exterior entrance to the general workshop.\n\n2. Double doors should be provided between the general workshop and the sewing room, also between the sewing room and the kitchen. This will involve enlarging the passageway.\n\n3. Extra flues should be placed in the chimney to provide for two kitchen ranges.\n\n4. The window in the fuel room is considered unnecessary and the fuel room should be enlarged to a size 13'3\" x 11'.\n\nIndian Affairs.

S. Arneil, Acting Inspector of Indian Agencies in the Maritime Provinces, on an inspection trip which began on November 23rd, 1942, and occupied seventeen days. Mr. Gremarty, of the Lands, Parks and Forests Branch, had also been authorized by the Department to accompany Mr. Arneil and Mr. Buck.\n\nOur Architect now reports as follows:\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch has already begun action in centralizing the Indian population now occupying twenty-three separate reserves in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island on three existing reserves, the areas of which have recently been considerably increased by the purchase and expropriation of adjacent territory.\n\nEach of these enlarged reserves will constitute an Agency, and on completion of the scheme, approximately one thousand Indians, from six existing reserves in Cape Breton Island, will be settled on the Escasoni Reserve. The same number from twelve other existing reserves in Nova Scotia will be accommodated on the Shubenacadie Reserve. The Indians now occupying five reserves on Prince Edward Island will be centralized on Lennox Island Reserve, and will number approximately two hundred and seventy-five persons.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch proposes, during the fiscal year of 1943-44, to erect at Shubenacadie and Escasoni, a day school with four class-rooms, manual-training room and domestic-science room, as well as a residence for the Priest-Principal, a residence to accommodate at least five teachers, and a combined office and storehouse for the Indian Agent. To this group there may in the future be added a Medical Officer's residence, and a residence for the Indian Agent.\n\nAt Lennox Island, P.E.I., it is proposed to build during the 1943-44 fiscal year, an Indian Agent's residence only, and at a later date, as funds become available, a combined office and storehouse, a two-room day school, and other buildings.\n\nOther installations common to all sites will be water supply systems, septic tanks and sewage disposal beds.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10; Volume 6052, file 266-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nHousing accommodation, without water supply, lighting or plumbing, is being provided for the increased population by the Indian Affairs Branch. Heads of families are being provided with building materials without expense, and they, with other unemployed Indians, are being encouraged to undertake work on these buildings, for which services they will be paid 30\u00a2 per hour.\n\nIn this connection a considerable number of window frames and sash, as well as other materials surplus to their own requirements, were being disposed of by the R. A. F. Works and Buildings Division at Moncton, N. B., and Mr. Buck, before leaving Ottawa, was authorized to stop off with Mr. Arneil, with a view to determining whether any of the materials could be utilized in the Indian housing programme. It was found that the frames and sash were suitable for Indian Affairs' use, and that other materials, including plaster board and building paper, which would also be of value, were available. It is understood that the Indian Affairs Branch are arranging to obtain quantities of the materials inspected, through Departmental channels.\n\nThe inspection of materials at Moncton was completed on November 25th, and the party proceeded to Truro that evening, and thence to Shubenacadie, where the Department maintains an Indian Residential School at present occupied by 14 pupils, under the administration of the Principal, Rev. Father Mackey.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch had authorized Mr. Arneil to engage local surveyors for the purpose of obtaining spot levels, contours and other topographical features of the sites, and before leaving Truro arrangements were completed to have Mr. Howard Murray, of Earlton, N. S., carry out this work at Shubenacadie. Mr. Murray, Provincial Land Surveyor, was unable to visit the site with the Departmental officers. He stated that an uncompleted assignment from the Department of National Defence demanded his immediate attention. He was willing, however, to undertake and complete the work as described by Mr. Buck, beginning on November 30th, and completing his survey plan so that the data would be available for use by this Service upon the return of our Architect to Ottawa.\n\nTo this end, while carrying out the inspection of the site, detailed instructions regarding the area affected and the information required, were furnished to the Indian Agent, Mr. H. C. Rice, for Murray's guidance.\n\nIt was learned that on a previous visit to the reserve, which is approximately three miles from the Village of Shubenacadie, Indian Affairs officers had tentatively selected two alternative sites for an Agency building group, one being in the neighbourhood of the existing church and one-room day school, the second being approximately one-half mile directly south of the first.\n\nThe area....\nThe area is served by one of a series of Indian gravelled roads on the reserve, and a road allowance has already been cleared for another which will connect up two of the most travelled of the existing roads and will pass through the centre of the site. At present the connection between the gravelled road referred to, and the allowance for the new road, is a wagon trail which will be improved to become part of the new road on completion.\n\nAfter viewing the available sites, Mr. Buck chose the southerly as being the better location for the proposed group of buildings. This site, which consists of approximately 65 acres of crown land, is approached from the north over the wagon trail already mentioned, at a gentle incline which flattens out in the proposed building area. The ground falls rapidly away from the site on its south, east and west boundaries, providing good natural drainage and making available several suitable locations for sewage disposal beds.\n\nThe soil in the neighbourhood appears to consist of a top covering of sandy loam, over a subsoil of sand and gravel. No rocks or large boulders were observed.\n\nWhile the location of buildings on the site cannot be definitely established until the topographical plan is received and studied, it is felt that the soil composition may be considered uniform, and not likely to produce structural difficulties.\n\nIt would be possible to provide a water supply from streams in the vicinity; but it is anticipated that when the increased Indian population is settled on the reserve, the danger of water contamination will always be present. It is felt that investigation should be carried out to determine the feasibility of furnishing a water supply from drilled wells.\n\nThe only power transmission line close to the reserve terminates at the Village limits of Shubenacadie. As it is hoped to provide current for lighting in all buildings except the day-school, and for the operation of mechanical services in the Agency grounds, it will be necessary to determine the most economical method of making electric current available.\n\nThe Shubenacadie Agent of the Avon River Power Company was contacted, but since the Company is a subsidiary of the Nova Scotia Light and Power Company Limited of Halifax, this officer advised that any enquiries regarding extension of service must be directed to the Company's head office. It was understood from the Power Company's Agent, that an extension of the existing service to serve the proposed buildings on the reserve, under present conditions, would be difficult to obtain.\n\nThe inspection of Shubenacadie was completed on November 28th, and on that evening the party proceeded to Sydney, Cape Breton.\n\nMr. Cromarty had arranged with the Lands, Parks and Forests Branch to have Mr. MacMillan, Superintendent of the Cape Breton Highlands National Park, and a Departmental car available for the use of the inspecting party in travelling between Sydney and the Escasoni Reserve, which is situated on the north shore of East Bay, Bras D'Or Lake, approximately 33 miles south west of Sydney.\nThe site which had been tentatively selected by Indian Affairs officers on a previous occasion, overlooks East Bay in all directions, and possesses great scenic beauty. Its position with regard to the Indian settlement scheme now under way, and to the Roman Catholic chapel and cemetery, both of which are within the area, appears to establish it as the logical location for the proposed building group.\n\nThe site is reached over a gravel road, which branches off Provincial Highway No. 4 at the eastern end of East Bay. It occupies about seven acres of cleared land on the top, as well as the southerly and westerly slopes of a hill rising rather sharply to a flat area approximately 50 ft. above the roadway. The northerly and easterly slopes of the hill fall steeply towards small ravines, and are uncleared.\n\nIn the vicinity of the suggested site, the existing 60 ft. road allowance consists of a side hill cut, approximately 500 yards long, which leaves the northerly edge of the cutting between 10 and 15 ft. above the roadway, while from the southerly limit of the road allowance a scrub covered slope descends rapidly to a large area of tidal flat.\n\nAt the time of the inspection, the ground was covered with snow from six to eight inches deep, with drifts to a greater depth in places. Consequently no test pits were dug to determine soil characteristics where the proposed buildings were likely to be placed. Existing excavation for an earth cellar within an unused concrete foundation on the site, however, indicated at that point a top soil of sandy loam containing light clay and gravel to a depth of approximately five feet, the maximum depth observed. No rock outcroppings were visible anywhere on the site, and it could be assumed that the characteristics described are uniform. There should be no difficulty in locating septic tanks or sewage disposal beds.\n\nIt appeared possible that water might be supplied to the site from a stream at the toe of the westerly slope; but under the prevailing conditions it could not be determined that permanent volume was available. It is considered advisable to investigate whether water might be obtained from drilled wells before deciding to make use of the stream. However, attention to this point under more favourable weather conditions is suggested.\n\nPower facilities do not exist at Escasoni, and to provide current for lighting and the operation of mechanical services, the necessary equipment must be provided by the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nBefore work on the building programme can be started, it will be necessary to provide the site with a service road for the use of the Contractor during construction operations, and later to serve the various units of the building group, and from data obtained a site plan will be prepared from which it will be possible to determine the work involved on this feature, and to estimate its cost.\n\nOwing to the lack of topographical data, no previous technical consideration of the site had been possible, and to obtain information for our use it was necessary, as at Shubenacadie, to engage a local Surveyor, Mr. Arneil, on the authority of his Director,...\nDirector, made necessary investigations to this end, and the services of Mr. M. McMullen, a Provincial Land Surveyor of Nova Scotia, were obtained. Mr. McMullen was taken over the site and our requirements were outlined in detail. Although he was to report in ten days for service in the army, Mr. McMullen was able to obtain spot levels on a 50 ft. by 50 ft. grid, establish contours at 5 ft. vertical intervals, complete his field notes and forward a plan to Ottawa, by the time our officers returned.\n\nWhile it would be desirable to carry out building operations on a more level site, no alternative area sufficiently large for the purpose is available, unless purchase or expropriation of additional land is arranged, and it is understood that the Indian Affairs Branch are not likely to take such further action.\n\nThe inspection of Escasoni Reserve was completed on December 2nd, and the party left Sydney, N. S., for Borden, P. E. I., that evening.\n\nMr. Cromarty had arranged with the Lands, Parks and Forests Branch to have Mr. E. Smith, Superintendent of Prince Edward Island National Park, available with a Departmental car for the transportation of the party to and from Lennox Island. It had also been arranged that Mr. Smith would obtain any topographical data our Architect required on the site of the proposed agency. Mr. Smith met the party on the evening of December 3rd at Borden as arranged, and drove them to Summerside.\n\nLennox Island is approximately 30 miles by road from Summerside, and lies about one mile off shore in Malpeque Bay, between Hog Island and the mainland.\n\nOn the morning of December 4th the party began their trip from Summerside, but owing to snow blocked roads were forced to return, and later the same day proceeded to Indian Agent Daly's office in Charlottetown. It is understood, however, that the Lands, Parks and Forests Branch are agreeable to making the services of Mr. Smith available for the preparation of whatever topographical data this Service requires, when weather conditions are more favourable.\n\nOn the evening of December 4th, Indian Agent Rice contacted Mr. Buck at Charlottetown by long distance telephone from Shubenacadie, and advised that he had been notified by Mr. Murray, The Surveyor who had been engaged for work on the selected site there, that, anticipating a further assignment from the Department of National Defence, he was not disposed to carry out the duties he had arranged with Mr. Buck to undertake. Indian Agent Rice advised that he had attempted to locate a Surveyor, but had found none available. Our Architect considered it advisable to contact a definite source of information regarding the services of a qualified Surveyor, and instead of accompanying Mr. Arnell and Mr. Cromarty back to Ottawa, arranged to meet Mr. Rice, at the Provincial Department of Highways in Halifax, on the morning of December 7th. He was able to interview Mr. Bellevue, Chief Engineer of the Department, and his Senior Office Engineer, Mr. Kenneth MacKenzie, who very kindly provided a list of names of Surveyors they were prepared to recommend.\n\n(over)\nConsiderable difficulty was encountered in locating a Surveyor who was free to undertake our work; but contact was eventually made with one of the recommended parties, - Mr. R. W. McKenzie, D.L.S., of Enfield, N.S. Mr. McKenzie accompanied the Indian Agent and our Architect to Shubenacadie, was taken over the site, and agreed to begin work as required on December 10th. While more snow had fallen, and further frost penetration was evident, it should have been possible to obtain the information we required without too great difficulty.\n\nAfter completing arrangements with Mr. McKenzie, Mr. Buck returned to Ottawa on December 10th. However, in a letter dated December 19th last, Indian Agent Rice advised us that Mr. McKenzie has been prevented by illness from commencing work, but that he anticipates the topographical data would be undertaken very shortly. It will be realized, however, that if severe weather conditions have set in, it is not unlikely the Surveyor's work will have to be postponed until the Spring.\n\nWhile in the Maritimes Mr. Buck interviewed the following Contractors regarding the building situation there:\n\nJ. H. Kenney, General Contractor, Truro and Halifax, N.S.\nThe J. W. Stevens Co. Ltd., Sydney, Cape Breton, N.S.\nH. J. Phillips, General Contractor, Charlottetown, P.E.I.\n\nEach of these firms has at different periods carried out work for this Service satisfactorily, and all are at present engaged on some type of construction work for the Dominion Government in connection with National Defence Projects. These Contractors stand unanimously that they were experiencing great difficulty in obtaining materials and labour, and under existing circumstances can give no assurance that any work they undertake could be completed within a time limit, or that they would be able to adhere strictly to specified materials or equipment.\n\nThe experience of these firms confirms the opinion of this Service, that even if the Department is granted a licence by the Controller of Construction, authorizing building operations, we must be prepared for delays and possible substitutions in materials and equipment, with consequent increases in cost, none of which can be anticipated.\n\nFurther memoranda dealing with the building programme, funds provided, approval of sketches, working drawings and other related items, will be forwarded for your information as our work on these projects develops.\n\nChief Engineer.\nOttawa, July 29, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, enclosing bill of lading for the teacher's desk which you shipped, freight charges prepaid, from the Shubenacadie Indian Day School to Charles Hudson, Indian Agent, Micibucto, N. B. It is noted that you will include the charges in connection with this shipment in your Expense Account. The Department prefers that you forward a separate voucher, in duplicate, covering the freight, trucking and crating charges paid by you. This, you should certify in the usual manner, when a cheque to reimburse you for your outlay in the shipping of the teacher's desk will be directed to you.

S.\nDr. McGill\n\nI am forwarding herewith, for your information, a copy of a report, dated January 13th, covering the inspection made by Mr. Buck, our Chief Architect, on the proposed building sites and other matters relating to the centralization of Indian Agencies in the Maritime Provinces. It will be noted that the inspecting officers went into the various features such as drainage, water supply, etcetera, and accessibility of the site to roads and power lines. Heavy snowfall prevented the party from reaching Lennox Island but everything possible was done under the circumstances.\n\nArrangements will be made later on when weather conditions are more favourable, for the obtaining of such topographical data as may be required by our Architectural Division at this point. I understand Mr. Buck is in close touch with your officers in regard to the various details of the building programme.\n\nYou are, of course, aware that the $55,000 which I understand is in your 1943-44 estimates, will not complete the building programme at present contemplated for the two Reserves in Nova Scotia and this sum will have to be supplemented from other sources. Certain sections of road are required to reach the building site and serve the proposed buildings in the Escasoni Reserve and their cost will have to be met from the funds provided. I think your officers reached the decision that no electric wiring should be provided in either of the classroom buildings.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 25, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Proposed new day schools to be erected at Shubenacadie and Eskasoni in the Province of Nova Scotia during 1943.\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of the 16th of January with reference to Mr. Buck's inspection of the proposed building sites and have carefully noted the information contained in this report.\n\nOn reviewing the plans for the proposed new day schools at the above-mentioned places, we find that the position of the cloak rooms necessitates anyone entering the classroom to first pass through the cloak room. Several reasons could be advanced against this arrangement. Consequently it is desired to have the cloak rooms placed at the rear of each classroom as verbally explained to Mr. Buck by Mr. Doucet.\n\nAs provision is being made in our 1943-44 appropriation for all Indian day schools to re-open on September 1, 1943, it is the hope of the officials of this Branch that these buildings will be completed by that date so that the required accommodation for the training of the children will be available.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nMarch 29, 1943.\n\nEX'D\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Proposed new day schools to be erected at Shubenacadie and Eskasoni in the Province of Nova Scotia during 1943.\n\nI desire to refer you to the last paragraph of my memorandum of January 25, in which you were advised that all Indian day schools would re-open on September 1, 1943.\n\nI should appreciate your advising if the plans and specifications for the above-mentioned buildings are completed and when you expect to call for tenders.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, July 5, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY.\n\nRe: Proposed new Indian day schools on the Eskasoni and Shubenacadie Reserves.\n\nI am advised by the Surveys and Engineering Branch that they are ready to commence operations and the amount of $18,000.00 should therefore be transferred to them from Appropriation No. 76.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, July 5, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY.\n\nRe: Proposed new Indian day schools on the Eskasoni and Shubenacadie Reserves.\n\nI am advised by the Surveys and Engineering Branch that they are ready to commence operations and the amount of $18,000.00 should therefore be transferred to them from Appropriation No. 76.\n\nDirector.\nTRANSFER BETWEEN ALLOTMENTS\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE TO THE SECRETARY, TREASURY BOARD, FOR THE FOLLOWING TRANSFERS WITHIN:\n\nVOTE: 163 Indian Education\n\nNAME OF PRIMARY | AUTHORIZED AMOUNT | PROPOSED DECREASE | PROPOSED INCREASE\n---|---|---|---\nStructures and Parts, Indian Affairs Branch. | $5,000.00 | $8,000.00 |\nStructures and Parts Surveys & Engineering Branch. | | | $15,000.00\n\nDEPARTMENTAL EXPLANATION\n\nThis transfer to Surveys and Engineering Branch is required for the purpose of constructing new Indian day schools on the Eskasoni and Shubenacadie Reserves.\n\nRECOMMENDED | APPROVED | APPROVED\n---|---|---\nBRANCH HEAD | DEPUTY HEAD | MINISTER\n\nNOTE: APPROVAL OF THE MINISTER IS REQUIRED ONLY WHERE A QUESTION OF POLICY IS INVOLVED.\n\nTREASURY COMMENTS\n\nACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNTING RECORDS, THERE IS NO OBJECTION TO THESE TRANSFERS BEING MADE AND THE APPLICATION IS THEREFORE SUBMITTED FOR THE APPROVAL OF TREASURY BOARD, AS REQUIRED UNDER SECTION 26 OF THE CONSOLIDATED REVENUE AND AUDIT ACT.\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER | FOR COMPTROLLER OF THE TREASURY\n\nT. 246309 B.

Rice, Indian Agent, Shubenacadie, N. S.\n\nTenders received by the Surveys and Engineering Branch for the construction of an Indian day school, a teacher's residence, a residence for a principal and an office building at Shubenacadie indicate that the cost of these buildings - should we proceed with their construction at this time - would be approximately three times greater than the amount provided in the 1942-43 estimates. In view of this fact, it will not be possible to proceed with our building program on your reserve at any time during the present fiscal year.\n\nWe are naturally anxious to do everything humanly possible to encourage Indian families, particularly families the members of which are not gainfully employed, to establish themselves at Shubenacadie. It is just possible that our failure to build a day school this year may retard to some extent the movement of Indian families to the reserve. We are anxious, therefore, that you should undertake, in co-operation with Father Mackey, a survey of the educational facilities available with the object of utilizing these to the fullest possible advantage.\n\nWe have in mind the organization of a class of day school pupils at Shubenacadie. Should this be at all practicable, transportation of course would have to be provided. Accommodation in the adjoining public school, where a small group of Indian children might be provided with instruction, should also be considered. An inexpensive addition, under the supervision of Mr. Robb, might be built to the Indian day school on the reserve.\n\nWe deeply regret our inability to proceed with the regular program of centralization, particularly the building program, and our failure to do so is likely to add to your burdens as agent. Is it your opinion that a temporary, inexpensive office building should be constructed? We are anxious that you should give these matters your immediate consideration and, if you deem it at all necessary, we might send Mr. A. J. Doucet down to assist you in this task. Mr. Doucet, however, has been absent from the office for several weeks and we are not anxious to send him to Shubenacadie unless his presence there is absolutely necessary.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nActing Director.\nIt was with regret I learned of the necessity to postpone for another year the construction of the Agency administrative buildings. However I do not think that this decision will retard to any extent the movement of families to this reserve. The education of the children is not a matter of paramount interest to many Indian families and, if and when, the present school is unable to accommodate new-comers the construction of it lends itself to easy extension. We have sufficient lumber and labor and an enlargement under the direction of Mr. Robb is not a very difficult proposition. There are only twenty-three pupils attending this school and I feel that the present teacher is able to instruct almost twice that number without undue work. I feel that in this regard you need have no concern.\n\nThe present office site is satisfactory. During the summer when the roads are passable it is no trouble to be in the vicinity of the new houses whenever necessary. In the winter or while the mills are in operation it is, perhaps, better located than one on the old reserve would be.\n\nWhen notice that these buildings were not going ahead, arrived, we were doing the preliminaries before moving the houses which interfere with the proposed constructions. This has now been abandoned in favour of the more important task, that of building Indian houses.\n\nAs much as we would enjoy having Mr. Doucet visit with us I feel, since he is so urgently needed elsewhere, and no serious difficulties apparent, that his presence here, though enjoyable and welcome, is not urgently required. The only change contemplated is an easy addition to the present day school.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In the appropriation for the fiscal year 1944-45 an amount of $75,000 is being included for this project. Recent reports received indicate that the centralization of the Indians on the Shubenacadie Reserve particularly is increasing and as a consequence the present small day school will not accommodate the number of children available and it, therefore, appears essential that the school on this reserve should be built during the current calendar year and be ready for occupation on September 1, 1944.\n\nDirector.\nExtract from Indian Agent Rice's report on the Shubenacadie Indian Agency for the period October, 1943, to January, 1944, inclusive.\n\nThe Shubenacadie Day School is crowded and I feel that before another year a new school building will have to be erected, if possible, if not an extension will have to be made to the present dwelling.\nOttawa,\nApril 14, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Proposed new Indian day school to be built at Shubenacadie in the Province of Nova Scotia, during 1944.\n\nIn my memorandum of March 1, I brought to your attention the necessity for erecting the above school during the coming summer. Subsequent reports received from the Indian Agent confirm the statements made in the memorandum mentioned above with regard to the need for the new school.\n\nThe season is advancing and, as we would like to have the building ready for occupation on September 1, I should appreciate your advising what action is being taken.\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDR. MC GILL\n\nOn February 17th at Truro, Nova Scotia, a meeting was held with the Nova Scotia Agents, H.C. Rice, Shubenacadie, and J.A. MacLean, Eskasoni, to discuss the various phases of their agency activities and their work during the past year and to prepare and lay plans for the current year's programme.\n\nWhile at Shubenacadie reserve consideration was given to the possibility and of our erecting a four room school according to the existing plan on a material plus labour basis, as it seems unlikely that a satisfactory contract price can be obtained. I found that it was possible to get the services of two or more fully qualified teachers from the Order of the Sisters of Charity should a school be erected, and that they could reside at the residential school. Transportation could be provided daily from the residential school to the day school, a distance of about four miles each way.\n\nA small building contractor residing in the locality was interviewed by the agent and at present he is available for a season's work. He is Fred Robson and has been building for many years. He recently completed a large house of some $15,000 value. He has three or four carpenters whom he employs at various times. Robson is willing to work on a seasonal basis for $6.00 per day. He is known to be capable and reliable and is a lifelong resident of the locality.\n\nI would recommend that consideration be given to our erecting the four room school at this time so we may proceed more rapidly with our centralization plans.\n\nW.

Arnell, Inspector of Indian Agencies, who visited Shubenacadie during the past winter. Mr. Arnell writes, in part, as follows:\n\n\"A small building contractor residing in the locality was interviewed by the agent and at present he is available for a season's work.

As pointed out in my memorandum of April 14, we would like to have the building ready for occupation on September 1.\n\nDirector.\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: New Indian Day School at Shubenacadie, N.S.\n\nYour memorandum of March 1st advised that for the fiscal year 1944-45 an amount of $75,000 was included for new Indian day schools to be erected at Shubenacadie and Eskasoni in 1944. Your memorandum of April 14th refers only to the new school at Shubenacadie and this, coupled with Mr. Buck's verbal advice of discussions with your officers, gives us the understanding that the day school at Shubenacadie is the only building in Nova Scotia Reserves that under present plans you wish us to undertake during 1944-45. Consequently, unless advised to the contrary, we are making our plans on this basis and with the objective of having the building ready for occupation on September 1st next.\n\nRe-writing of certain of the forms and specifications, necessary because specifications prepared last year covered buildings at both Shubenacadie and Eskasoni, is under way and it is the intention to call for tenders at the earliest possible date. The plans already prepared and approved for the Shubenacadie day school will be used. It is also proposed to extend the scope of the newspaper advertisements in the hope that the decrease in building operations in the Maritimes on account of the war, will result in more favourable tenders being received.\n\nThe question of whether this school could be erected by day labour has been carefully considered but all the factors indicate that erection by contract is preferable at this time. Our Engineering and Construction Service has not its former day labour organization and it would be difficult to obtain a construction foreman of known competence, together with carpenters, for this one comparatively small project. Materials and labour priorities would also present difficulties.\n\nThere would also be difficulty in the transportation of supplies and the undertaking of excavation work and concrete work.\n\nOn the other hand building contractors have always the nucleus of a permanent organization and know of experienced carpenters who look to them for employment from time to time. They have the necessary contacts with firms handling building materials and with sub-contractors who can do excavation and concrete work, if necessary.\n\nIn your memorandum of April 21st you refer to the information that you just received from Mr. W.S. Arnell, Inspector of Indian Agencies, regarding Mr. Fred Robson, a local building contractor on small projects, who would be willing to work on a seasonal basis for some $6.00 per day, and has contact with three or four carpenters whom he employs at various times. It is the view that Mr. Robson and his carpenters could obtain suitable employment with the contractor who might be awarded the work. Mr. Arnell could be advised to let Mr. Robson know when the construction of the day school is advertised, so that he could get in touch with contractors who are interested.\n\nIt is our understanding that in so far as the day school at Shubenacadie is concerned, provision for a water supply at present will be limited to the installation of outside tanks for the wash basins in the basement and which can be connected up later on with any water supply system that is developed. In the meantime water for drinking and washing purposes will be brought to the school from near-by springs in buckets or barrels.\nAs it is our definite understanding that flush toilets are not required for the day school building, these have not been provided for and the design of the building in plan or elevation does not afford space for them. If later on toilets with running water were decided upon, it would be necessary to build an addition at ground floor level.\n\nThe question of a water supply for the Shubenacadie administrative unit has been the cause of delay and has required a good deal of study and investigation by our engineering officers. Last summer a well drilled near the proposed site proved unsatisfactory and on the advice of the Water Supply and Borings Section of the Mines and Geology Branch, further drilling was discontinued.\n\nEarly this month a test was made on an Indian well in the vicinity of the existing school with the view that if there was ample water there, the proposed residential group of buildings might be moved to the vicinity. However a test of this well undertaken by your Indian Agent, Mr. Rice, showed that the capacity of the well was far below that required.\n\nSpring Creek is consequently the only satisfactory source of water supply and it was examined last fall by Mr. N.A. Sparks of our Engineering and Construction Service. A suitable intake for a pipe line is available about three-quarters of a mile from the proposed site of the buildings and there is ample water available. However as the intake is some 40 feet lower than the building site, pumping from the intake through a pipe line would be necessary. In order to protect the source of the spring it is considered that your Branch should secure an adjacent land on both sides of the road which might involve the purchase of about 150 acres. Mr. Rice expressed the view to Mr. Sparks that this land could be obtained at a very low price. In view of the fact that the village of Shubenacadie has made some investigations in connection with Spring Creek as a source of water supply, it is suggested that this land be obtained in the near future.\n\nThe design of a water supply system based on Spring Creek requires an estimate of what the eventual building development will be at the Shubenacadie centre so that the essentials of the original installation will be adequate to meet future requirements. Plans have already been prepared of four buildings, namely - day school, teachers' residence, principal's residence, agency office and warehouse. A water supply will be required for all of these.\n\nExperience has shown that other buildings may eventually be required, among these being -\n\nAgent's residence\nDoctor's residence\nNursing Station\nR.C.M. Police quarters\n\nAs even the buildings for which plans have been prepared will represent a considerable investment, it is the opinion that besides a domestic water supply, a reasonable degree of fire protection should also be provided for. Generally then the installation of a water supply system will involve the following:\n\nAn electric pole line to provide power for operating the pump motor and to give electric light and power to the various buildings.\n\n4800 feet of water pipe and its installation.\n\nErection of pump-house and installation of suction pipe, etc.\nThe purchase and installation of a suitable pump and fittings.\n\nThe purchase and erection of a 5000 gallon water tank on a tower 60 feet high and which would be kept full by automatic operation of the pump. This would give a gravity supply of water for ordinary domestic needs.\n\nArrangement of valves so that if required in case of fire and after the tank is empty, water could be pumped directly through fire hose.\n\nThe provision of sewage disposal facilities in the nature of septic tanks.\n\nEstimates of water and sewage installations are not yet prepared but it is expected the cost will be in the neighbourhood of $25,000. However, this is not excessive in view of the long term value of the water system and other facilities and in view of the comparatively large building investment there will be in the Shubenacadie centre.\n\nThis information is given now as it should be available to you before any construction is actually begun.\n\nMost of the information given does not affect the erection of the day school and unless we hear from you to the contrary, we will proceed with all arrangements in this connection as quickly as possible.\n\n(Sgd.)

I also enclose, for your information, a copy of our reply to the memorandum just mentioned.\n\nYou will note the detailed information supplied by the Surveys & Engineering Branch regarding the expenditure that they consider necessary in order to provide adequate water and sewage installations on the Shubenacadie Reserve. To carry out their suggestion would involve an expenditure of $25,000, plus the cost of the land. As no funds have been provided in the current year's appropriation for this particular expenditure, it will be necessary to secure a supplementary vote.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\nOttawa,\nMay 4, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of April 26 and regret that you are under the impression that the day school at Shubenacadie is the only building in Nova Scotia that we would like to have erected during the current fiscal year.\n\nIn providing the amount of $75,000 in the current year's appropriation we were hopeful that the school at Shubenacadie and the school and teachers' residence at Eskasoni could be erected for the amount just mentioned.\n\nThe buildings mentioned in the preceding paragraph are extremely necessary, in order to provide necessary facilities for the centralization of the Indians on the Shubenacadie and Eskasoni Reserves.\n\nTo provide the funds required for the water and sewage installations would involve a supplementary vote and under these circumstances I am submitting your memorandum to the Deputy Minister.\n\nDirector.\nMay 10th, 1944\n\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: Indian Day Schools, Shubenacadie and Eskasoni Agencies, Nova Scotia.\n\nDr. McGill's memorandum of the 4th instant, bearing your notation of May 6th in connection with the above schools is acknowledged.\n\nIt is noted that the Indian Affairs Branch were hopeful that the amount of $75,000.00 provided in the current year's appropriation, would cover the erection of the four classroom school at the Shubenacadie Agency, as well as a similar school and a teachers' residence at the Eskasoni Agency.\n\nIn this connection it is pointed out that when tenders were submitted last August, the lowest tender for the Shubenacadie school amounted to $32,585, while the lowest tenders for the Eskasoni school and teachers' residence amounted to $32,140 and $16,500 respectively.\n\nSince living accommodation for the teachers at Shubenacadie is available at the Residential school, it is not imperative that water supply should be installed when the day school is built; but at such time as a school is built at the Eskasoni Agency, a residence for the teachers will definitely be required. This will necessitate consideration of at least a domestic water supply, and preferably a system providing a considerable measure of fire protection. A septic tank, sewage disposal bed and an electrical plant are other features which must be considered.\n\nUnder these circumstances, a rough estimate of the necessary expenditure for buildings, with costs based on the lowest tenders received last August, would be as follows:\n\n(a) Four classroom school - Shubenacadie $32,585.\n(b) Two outside toilets - \" (pupils) 500.\n(c) Four classroom school - Eskasoni 22,140.\n(d) Teachers' residence - \" 16,500.\n(e) Two outside toilets - \" (pupils) 600.\n(f) Septic tank, drainage lines, sewage disposal works - Eskasoni 2,000.\n\n$85,325.\n\nJ.

You will note from this memorandum that to construct and service the buildings you have in mind at Shubenacadie and Eskasoni this year some $110,500 would be required instead of $75,000. This would require\na supplementary estimate of $35,500. There is, of course, a possibility that tenders received this year may be more reasonable and it is hoped this will be the case.\n\nThe water supply at Eskasoni will be taken from the Eskasoni River in which there is ample water at the low water period. A test of the quality of the water last year also showed it to be first-class.\n\nThere is no electric power supply available in the vicinity of the building site so that a power plant would have to be provided for the Eskasoni unit.\n\nIt is understood that the teachers' residence will have to accommodate about ten sisters. We have not as yet been asked to provide accommodation for a school Principal and I would like to be advised if a Principal's residence is to be erected in the near future or if some other arrangement in this respect is in mind.\n\nWould you also kindly advise as soon as possible what is decided upon in regard to the buildings at Eskasoni, and if in the case of no further funds being available the Day School only would be erected there this year.\n\nAs I think you are aware tenders have been called through public advertisement for the construction of the Day School at Shubenacadie and tenders close in this office on Wednesday, May 31st next.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nMay 18, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nWith reference to my memorandum of May 4, I enclose, for your information, a copy of memorandum from the Director of the Surveys & Engineering Branch dated May 16.

McGill\n\nRe Indian Day School, Shubenacadie,\nYour File 51-1-5\n\nWill you please refer to your unsigned memorandum of the 4th instant, in which you enclosed a copy of a long report received from the Director of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, referring to the proposed construction program at Shubenacadie. Tenders have already been called for the construction of the school building and it is to be hoped that the prices will be low enough to permit a contract being awarded.\n\nIt would appear from Mr. Wardle's report that the greatest difficulty we are going to have in proceeding with the program is that connected with the water supply.\n\nMr. Pratt has discussed the matter on two occasions with Mr. Purdy, the Member, who does not understand why we are finding so much difficulty in getting a satisfactory supply of water in this district. He stated that no such difficulty is encountered by those residing in the vicinity of the Reserve.\n\nMight it not be well for you to forward a copy of Mr. Wardle's report to Agent Rice and ask him if he has any proposals to suggest in reference to the water supply. In view of the estimated cost of securing water from the springs, it might be wise to consider drilling another well in a new location close to where the buildings are to be located. However, as Agent Rice has lived in the district for a good many years, his advice might be helpful.\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nOttawa, May 17, 1944.\nOttawa,\nMay 20, 1944.\n\nMr. H.C. Rice, Indian Agent, Shubenacadie, N.S.\n\nWe recently received a lengthy report from the Surveys & Engineering Branch, in connection with the construction of the new Indian day school at Shubenacadie. This was submitted to the Minister's office for consideration and I am advised that persons who know the district find it difficult to understand that we are encountering so much difficulty in obtaining a satisfactory supply of water. It is further stated that no such difficulty is encountered by those residing in the vicinity of the school.\n\nI enclose, for your information, copy of part of the report of the Surveys & Engineering Branch in regard to the water situation. You will note that the estimated cost of securing water from the springs is high and it might be advisable to consider drilling another well close to where the buildings are to be located, but in a different place from where the previous well was drilled. I wish you would give this matter further consideration and let me have a report from you at the earliest possible date.\n\nActing Director.\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nWith reference to my memorandum of May 4, I enclose, for your information, a copy of memorandum from the Director of the Surveys & Engineering Branch dated May 16.

Frankly I do prefer the possibility of a drilled well over the idea of taking the water from spring brook which is some distance from the proposed building site and which would involve considerable pipe laying, pumping station, etc. The consensus of opinion among the foreman here, myself and neighbors is that if a well was drilled by a competent driller, behind the cottage of Wm. Paul (which is shown on the plan prepared by Surveyor McKenzie) somewhat over the hill, water in sufficient quantities should be found. In this vicinity springs are quite numerous and water is in evidence even yet after experiencing the worst drought in years. I do not have in mind the spring which Engineer Sparks tested at the time of his visit here. This does not appear to be surface water.\n\nI feel that, in view of the estimated cost of the project required should Spring Brook be utilized, the drilling of another well, in the most favoured location, would be justified.\n\nH. C. Rice,\nIndian Agent.\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI desire to refer to Mr. Jackson's memorandum of May 17, with reference to securing a water supply at the Shubenacadie Reserve. On receipt of this memorandum the Indian Agent was immediately written and in a letter dated May 30, 1944, which reached us this morning, he writes as follows:\n\n\"I am no authority on such a matter as this and I do not wish to make definite claims.

Such a well on the basis of unit prices furnished last summer by O. V. Kennedy and Trask Well Company, whom we believe are generally considered to be reliable well drillers, is estimated to cost between $1500 and $1800 for drilling and casing only. This amount would not include the cost of the pumping equipment that would be required, if water was found in adequate quantities.\n\nI am forwarding herewith, for your information, copy of a map on which is indicated the site of the new well as proposed by the Indian Agent, the site of the dry well drilled last summer, and the site of an existing drilled well tested this spring by the Indian Agent and which was found to be capable of furnishing less than thirty gallons of water per hour.\n\nIf it is your wish that the drilling of a 6-inch well should be proceeded with at this time and if you will so advise me and will transfer $1800 to our Engineering and Construction Service for the purpose, we will be glad to make arrangements for having the well drilled. The location of the well would be at the point suggested by the Indian Agent and the driller.\n\nDirector.\nREPORT ON SHUBENACADIE INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF MAY, 1944.\n\nIn May we took the census. This was a tedious job over such a widespread Agency. It was slowed down considerably by the fact that so many Indians are either in the armed forces or working away from the reserves. For the last two weeks of this month I was requested to be available for showing the proposed building site, of the new school to be erected this summer, to prospective tenderers. On the last day of the time limit a representative of the Municipal Spraying Co. arrived and, after being taken to the spot, he appeared to be well pleased with the prospects. When leaving he stated that he was phoning the data to the local Head Office who would, no doubt, wire or air-mail their bid in.\n\nH.C.

MacDonald of Moncton, N.B. submitted the lowest tender for the construction of the day school at Shubenacadie, namely $17,000, and the acceptance of his tender was authorized by P.C. 4484, June 15, 1944. Two other tenders were received in amounts of $31,160 and $33,910, respectively.\n\nIt is the view of our officers that Major MacDonald's tender is in a reasonable amount and that if there are no serious delays in regard to obtaining materials and competent labour, he will be able to erect the building without difficulty at his quoted price.\n\nIt is expected that with contingencies and unforeseen extra work, the total cost may be $18,700.\n\nIn view of the reasonable tender submitted for the Shubenacadie day school, funds would now be available for some of the building program at Eskasoni. It is noted from your memorandum of May 4th that you would like the day school and teachers' residence at Eskasoni erected this year and the cost of these buildings, exclusive of water supply and sewage disposal systems, is estimated by our officers at $49,240. I am suggesting to the officers of the Engineering and Construction Service that they discuss with officers of your Branch the program at Eskasoni.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nJune 22, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: New Indian Day School,\nShubenacadie, Nova Scotia.\n\nI am in receipt of your memoranda of June 15 and June 19, with regard to the above building.\n\nIt is noted that you estimate the cost of the new building, plus unforeseen extra work, at $18,700. I also note that you estimate the cost of drilling another well at $1600. This makes a total possible expenditure of $20,500. In May we transferred the amount of $12,500 to your Branch and arrangements are being made to transfer an additional sum of $3500.

Major D.A. McDonald, of the construction company of the same name, first arrived here on July 4th. About two weeks later his foreman and one helper arrived on the scene. They were followed on the 24th by a bull-doser and then a cement mixer. They picked up some help, both Indian and white, were held up some by erratic shipments of lumber, basement window frames, etc., and at the present have the basement excavated and the foundation walls completed. They are preparing now to install the necessary plumbing and pour the concrete for the floor. In exchange for the hundred thirty six dollars we owe them for the use of their bull-doser on our road, I have arranged to haul them one hundred yards of gravel from our pit. It will work out that we will have a little profit which we can use to good advantage hauling gravel on our road.\n\nEngineer N.A. Sparks of the Engineering and Construction Service arrived here to supervise this building on July 17th and is still with us. The Chief Engineer, Mr. T.S. Mills, arrived here on the 16th inspecting the school site and talked over the advisability of drilling another well. At the present rate of progress it is problematical whether the school will be in readiness before the new year.\n\nWhen I was advised that we were authorized to drill another well I contacted O.V. Kennedy, Esq., of Bridgetown N.S., asking him to come up at his earliest opportunity and go over with me the so-called administration centre and select a suitable site. He arrived here on the 4th of August and we agreed upon what we thought would be a likely spot. He promised to send his very best machine and operators and the outfit arrived here on the 15th. The began work the next day and have been working almost continuously ever since. At a depth of 132 ft. they found water which rose to a height of 30 ft. in the pipe. They were not in rock and although the water stayed with them to a degree it was not in the desired quantity. They drilled day after day and since about 75 ft. it was always in sand or fine gravel. They drove case pipe almost foot for foot with the drill and at the end of August they had reached a depth of 175 ft. still in the same sand and gravel formation.\n\nH.C.

Macdonald, General Contractor of Moncton, New Brunswick, for erection of the above, prevented the start of operations until late in July last.\n\nFurther difficulties of which you have been advised regarding trouble experienced by the contractor in obtaining carpenters and other skilled labour, has delayed the completion of the contract within the time limit set out in the contract agreement namely, August 31st, 1944.\n\nThis Service has endeavoured to obtain from Macdonald through Mr. Sparks an approximation of the date by which the building would be ready for acceptance, and under date of the 10th instant, Mr. Sparks has advised that with the exception of outside painting the contractor considers all work should be completed by February 1st, 1945.\n\nIt is our opinion however, in view of progress to date and factors contributing thereto, that such a date has very little significance.\n\nWe recommend therefore that authority be obtained from the Department to extend the date for completion to March 31st, 1945. Under the most favourable circumstances it will likely be necessary to provide an amount of approximately $500.00 in 1945-46 estimates to cover painting work which will not be completed until next spring.\n\n(Sgd.) T.S. Mills\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector, Surveys & Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nDecember 22nd, 1944.\n\nThe Deputy Minister\n\nAttached herewith is a copy of a memorandum received from Mr. Mills, Chief Engineer, in regard to the date of completion by contract of the Indian Day School at Shubenacadie. Delay in the construction of this building has been due to labour shortage. The contractor, Major Macdonald, has interviewed Selective Service officers at Halifax on many occasions but gets no assistance as that Service apparently takes the position that this project is non-essential and has no priority in the labour market. Another disadvantage in securing men is that the wage rates authorized by the Department of Labour are not attractive when compared with wages paid for similar work in Halifax. The work is also located too far away from any large centre to obtain the benefit of the services of soldiers or sailors when on leave.\n\nYou will recall that on November 17th a letter was sent to the Associate Director of National Selective Service (Mobilization) forwarding a formal application from the contractor for ten enlisted men. This request was refused.\n\nUnder the circumstances the recommendation of Mr. Mills that the date of completion for the contract be forwarded to March 31st, 1945, is concurred in.\n\nA copy of this memorandum and Mr. Mills' memorandum is being forwarded to the Acting Director of the Indian Affairs Branch for his information.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nDecember 26, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of December 22, with reference to the construction of the Shubenacadie Day School. It is noted that due to circumstances beyond the contractor's control it has been decided to extend the date for completion of the contract to March 31, 1945.\n\nI note from Mr. Mills' memorandum to you that under the most favourable circumstances it will likely be necessary to provide an amount of $500 in the 1945-46 estimates. We have already submitted our estimates for the next fiscal year to the Minister's office and no provision was made for an outstanding amount on the Shubenacadie Day School, due to the fact that we were under the impression that the building would be completed before the end of the current fiscal year. However, if there is a small balance necessary no doubt we will be able to find the funds, but it is hoped that your officers will keep this amount to the minimum.\n\nActing Director.\nSTATEMENT\n\nSHUBENACADIE, N.

Macdonald, General Contractor. It was pointed out at that time, that while an opinion had been given that work, with the exception of outside painting, might be completed by February 1st, 1945, existing circumstances indicated that the opinion had very little significance. An extension of time to March 31st, 1945 was approved by the Department.\n\nA letter dated the last instant from Indian Agent Rice, confirmed by a letter from Macdonald dated February 5th 1945, informs us that due to heavy snowfall and cold weather it has become impossible for the small working force obtainable to make progress on the building, and operations have been closed down. Macdonald advises that he considers work can be resumed by approximately April 1st next, and that by present indications labour conditions will have improved by that time.\n\nUnder the circumstances there appears no alternative to our concurrence in this action, which will necessitate a further advance of the date for completion of the contract. While the building is only about 50% completed, we believe that if operations are resumed on or about April 1st next, an extension of time to June 15th 1945 would be satisfactory.\n\nWith reference to the financial status of the project when operations terminated, the following tabulation is furnished for your information.\n\nAccepted tender $17,000.00\n\nAuthorized Extra Work Orders\nNo.1 - Additional foundations $325.10\nNo.2 - \" drain work 135.00\nNo.3 - Revisions to Heating Plant 425.22 885.32\n\nTotal value of work to Jan. 31st, 1945 $17,885.32\n\nPayments to Contractor\nProgress Estimate No.1, July 1944 $675.00\n\" No.2, Aug. 391.50\n\" No.3, Sept. 1612.74\n\" No.4, Oct. 1354.05\n\" No.5, Nov. 1691.60\n\" No.6, Dec. 693.00\n\" No.7, Jan. 1945 816.00 7,623.09\n\nUnpaid balance $10,260.23\n\nJ.M.

Hoey\n\nRe: Indian Day School, Shubenacadie Indian Agency, Nova Scotia.\n\nAttached herewith is a copy of a memorandum from Mr. Mills dated February 8th, from which you will note that the contractor was forced to close down work on the building and it will not be resumed until April next.\n\nThe total amount estimated for the building, including contingencies and extra work orders, was $17,883.32. The contractor has been paid to date on Progress Estimates $7,623.09, leaving an unpaid balance of the estimated cost of $10,260.23. Approximately 50% of the work is completed.\n\nMr. Mills advises that $10,600 could be released from the Shubenacadie Vote if the purchase of water pipe for the water supply system is not made in this fiscal year. This pipe will not be required if the water from the well can be satisfactorily processed, and this point has not yet been decided.\n\nAs the pipe will cost approximately $6,000 it is proposed to release $4,600 at the present time, retaining the balance until the water supply system is finally decided upon.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, February 15, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSURVEYS and ENGINEERING BRANCH.\n\nI have your memorandum of February 13, with reference to the construction of the Indian day school in the Shubenacadie Agency.\n\nIt is noted that work has temporarily stopped on the erection of this building and, as a result, it will not be completed until the fiscal year 1945-46. When we prepared our estimates for the coming fiscal year, we were under the impression that this building would be finished before the end of March, 1945, and consequently did not make any special provision for this school. However, it is possible that the money provided for Shubenacadie Agency will be sufficient to cover the balance due on this building and, if not, we will have to secure a supplementary appropriation.\n\nIf the water supply system is finally decided, it is noted that you intend to purchase, from the current year's appropriation, pipe at a cost of approximately $6,000.00.\n\nActing Director.\nREPORT ON SHUBENAGADIE INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OCTOBER, 1944\n\nSome progress was made this month on the Day School being built here but, if any mistakes are made in this building, they can never be attributed to haste.\n\nH.C. Rice,\nIndian Agent.\nApril 13th, 1945.\n\nThe Acting Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nRe: Indian Day School at Shubenacadie\n\nI think you have a copy of Mr. Mills's memorandum of February 8th last giving details of the financial status of the above project and showing that for 1945-46 $11,500 should be available for the completion of this school.\n\nAdvice has recently been received from the contractor that he plans to begin work around the middle of this month. In his letter he requests an increase in wage rates for carpenters and labourers over those authorized by the Department of Labour. In order to facilitate the completion of the project this question will be taken up with the Department of Labour who set the wage rates at present in force. If higher wage rates are authorized the Department would have to bear the difference in wage payments between the original rates and the new rates, since the work is being done under a lump sum contract. This sum might be in the neighbourhood of $500. However, you will be advised later of any arrangements made in this connection.\n\nDirector.\nJune 4, 1945.\n\nThe Chief Treasury Officer,\n\nWill you kindly arrange for the transfer of $5,000 to the Surveys and Engineering Branch in order that the construction of the school at Shubenacadie, N.S. may be proceeded with. I understand that the balance owing on the contract price is $11,500, which sum will eventually have to be transferred, but in the meantime $5,000 will be sufficient for the branch to go on with the work.\n\nWill you also arrange to transfer to the aforesaid branch approximately $10,000 - (5/12 of $25,000) in order that the Surveys and Engineering Branch may commence the work of providing a water supply for the buildings on the Eskasoni Reserve.\n\nFunds are available in the Vote for Indian Education.\n\nActing Director.\n\nM.W.\nOttawa, June 5, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSURVEYS and ENGINEERING BRANCH.\n\nWith reference to the completion of the Shubenacadie Day School, the Department is forwarding you an amount of $5,000.00. I understand from your memorandum of April 13 that the total amount required to complete the building will be between $11,500.00 and $12,000.00. The balance of this amount will be forwarded to you when requested.\n\nWe are also transferring to your Branch the amount of $10,000.00, in order that you may commence the work of providing a water supply for the buildings at the Eskasoni Reserve.\n\nActing Director.\nJune 13th, 1945.\n\nMr. R.A.

C. RICE, INDIAN AGENT,\nSHUBENACADIE, N.S., for quarter ended June 30, 1945.\n\nRegarding the school, which has been overcrowded, it was necessary for me to advise the teacher to take part in the morning and the other part in the afternoon. The old school requires quite a lot of repairs but have kept clear of this because of the erection of the new one. The building of the new school is progressing very slowly because of the scarcity of carpenters. Mr. DesRoche, the foreman, claims it is impossible to obtain these through the Selective Service, although several times he has been promised help but as yet none has arrived. Therefore, most of the work is being done with Indian help, which has not been too satisfactory. As Mr. Sparks, the Engineer, left for Ottawa the latter part of 1944, it has fallen on me to superintend the work and to keep the Construction and Engineering Branch advised each week. I feel that if the work there keeps going at the present rate, it will take another two months to complete the job.\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Eskasoni Indian Day School\n\nVOTE 76 ALLOTMENT ALLOCATION SYMBOLS\nSHIP TO Mr. H.C.

Rice, Indian Agent,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\n\nI am interested in knowing if you are using the new Shubenacadie Day School. I phoned the Architect, Mr. Buck, but he is out of town and no one else in the Surveys and Engineering Branch seemed to know much about the matter.\n\nAn early reply would be appreciated.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Departmental Letter dated September 21, 1945, File 5I-I-5.\n\nWith reference to the above letter regarding new Shubenacadie Indian Day School, I am sorry to say we are not using the new school as it is not completed. Stairs and casings have not arrived as yet, floors are not varnished and toilets are not yet stained. The contractor will not varnish the floors until the remainder of the building is finished, as he has to bring the painters from Halifax. I might also state that seats, desks and chairs have not arrived yet.\n\nI have opened the old school with one teacher holding classes in the morning and the other in the afternoon. Just as soon as building is completed and seats arrive, I plan to move them into the new school.\n\nI regret to have to report this condition regarding progress on the new building. However it is the only possible account I am able to give under the present circumstances.\n\nH. C. Rice,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Shubenacadie Indian Day School.\n\nThis is to advise you that the contractor finished the School yesterday, excepting the registers which have not yet arrived and have yet to be installed. I can open this School without these, just as soon as desks, seats and chairs arrive. I have had no word of these so far. Will you kindly have them rushed as soon as possible.\n\nH. G. Rice,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 16, 1945.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nPurchase Order No. 3805 was forwarded to you on August 29, last, ordering 100 desks, 4 chairs and 2 teacher's desks, to be shipped to H.

I\n\nSCHOOL -\nA new four-room day school has just been completed. Materials used in the construction are good and all the work appears to be well done. Only two rooms will be used as there are only about fifty children enrolled this year. Two lay teachers are employed. At the time of my visit it was raining very heavily and had been raining for several days. As a result water was coming into the school under the front door. The front entrance is built almost flat on the ground. If there had been one or two cement steps up to the entrance then it would be impossible for the water to enter. There is an excellent well lighted basement. In my opinion it would have been much better had classroom space been made available in the basement rather than at the back end of each classroom.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This has been a long drawn out process\u2014about fifteen months constructing the building. I feel however that MacDonald, the Contractor, has done a real good job and that nothing has been slighted in any way. We certainly have a nice building and it is a great credit to the Reserve. Throughout the job, most of the work was done by two men and Indians from the Reserve supplied the remainder of the labour. This building will require a lot of attention both inside and outside and I intend to burn wood in the furnace for this year, as there is plenty on hand with only two classrooms to be heated. I have recommended Joseph Ross, the only competent Indian I have, for the job. He lives near the school and I have recommended his salary at the rate of $50.00 per month.\n\nAlthough this might seem rather high, yet the building will require someone to look after it day and night and considering circumstances, I do not think this rate too unreasonable. I am waiting Departmental instructions on this matter. As I had to hire two teachers at the beginning of the school term, expecting that the new building would be ready, it has been necessary to have two sessions each day in the old school, one in the morning for the higher grades and another in the afternoon for the lower grades. Because there was not room in the old school, this has been necessary. Immediately the seats, desks and chairs arrive, I intend to open two rooms of the new school as this will be sufficient for this year and will be easier to heat. Mr. Ross of the Engineering Service was here for two weeks, surveying out the water line from the spring back to the Reserve. He found abundance of water and an analysis showed it to be in first class condition. He also inspected the new School and found it to his entire satisfaction. While construction of the building since last Christmas, has taken up quite a lot of my time, due to the fact that there was no Engineer here, Mr. Ross' favourable comments made me feel that time I had spent on it had been well worthwhile.\n\nH.C. Rice,\nIndian Agent.\nWe finally managed to move into our new School the first of November. Two classrooms only are in use and these have been kept warm quite easily by burning wood. Because the remainder of the School has been closed off, it has been possible to heat the two rooms fairly easily. However I feel sure that when the time arrives and we have four teachers, we will have to use coal for a few months in place of wood. I had some gravel spread around on the School grounds, but there is still considerable work to be done in order to make the playgrounds attractive. In the Spring I will endeavour to get some crushed rock which will make it much drier and should show a much greater improvement. The children are all watched carefully regarding their school attendance and in case of absentees, the Constable is notified and a full explanation is required from the parents. We had Mr. Ross from the Survey and Engineering Branch, checking on the new School and surveying out the proposed waterline.\n\nH.C.

In a memorandum, dated February 25th, Mr. Ross estimated the cost of providing the Indians with water at $14,200.00.\n\nIt is the intention this year to provide the money required to build a 14,000 gallon concrete reservoir required for the storage of water for the Indians. The estimated cost of this work is $4,200.00, and this sum can be made available but the distribution pipe line will have to be left until next year.\n\nAs I understand that money is required immediately, I am arranging to transfer to your Branch $10,000.00 of the $35,000.00 provided in the Indian Education Vote. I am also arranging to transfer $4,500.00 from the Welfare Vote in order that the work may be proceeded with. The $4,500.00 from the Welfare Vote is to be used on the portion of the system to provide water for the Indians. As soon as further funds are released by Parliament, a transfer of the balance of the funds will be made to you.\n\nDirector\nMay 6, 1946.\n\nMemorandum\n\nThe Chief Treasury Officer,\n\nRe: Shubenacadie Indian Reserve Water Supply\n\nThe water supply system to serve the agency buildings, school, etc., is estimated to cost $35,000.00, and this sum has been provided in the Indian Education Vote.\n\nIn addition, it has been decided to provide water for the Indians and this year we intend to proceed with a portion of the work only. The plan is to build a two celled buried concrete reservoir from one portion of which the agency buildings, school, etc., will be supplied with water and from the other portion the Indians will secure their water. Will you kindly arrange to transfer to the Surveys and Engineering Branch a sum of $10,000.00 from the sum of $35,000.00 provided in the Indian Education vote. Will you also transfer from the Welfare Vote a sum of $4,500.00 so that when the concrete tank is being built there will be funds on hand from which to pay the share of the cost of the tank chargeable to the Welfare Vote as this is a service for the Indians.\n\nI may say that the Surveys and Engineering Branch have ordered some materials and are waiting for the transfer of funds to pay accounts.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Rice,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 28th, 1947.\n\nMr. H.C. Rice, Indian Agent,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\n\nWith reference to your letter of July 23rd, the contents of your letter of May 30th were submitted to the Surveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nThe school was built so recently that it is difficult for us to understand why it is necessary to expend approximately $2,000 more. We have not yet received any reply from the Surveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MD\nMrs. Hoey:\n\nAs your memo of June 3rd last - blueprint herewith. Mr. Mills' recommendation concurred in that Mr. Ross be authorized to build this shelter by day labour, accounts to be forwarded to you for payment. Please advise if foregoing agreeable to you.\n\nJuly 25, 1947.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Shelter to Basement Entrance,\nIndian Day School,\nSimbasacodie Agency, Nova Scotia.\n\nIn accordance with a discussion between Mr. Founder and our Chief Architect, Mr. Ross new at Simbasacodie was requested to analyze, with a view to reducing the cost, a tender submitted by the Kennedy Construction Co. Ltd., the above.\n\nMr. Ross has now replied to our query, advising that an error in extending his figures, had resulted in the estimate being $111.80 too high and that the revised estimate was $715.00.\n\nThis estimate is based on cost plus 10%, and includes a contingency amount of 10%.\n\nEven the reduced estimate of $715.00 appears excessive to this Service, but Mr. Ross advised that if the work is carried out, by day labour in conjunction with the erection of the water supply pump house structure, the cost may be somewhat reduced. He expects to have the latter built during the latter part of August.\n\nIt is recommended therefore, that authority be obtained for Mr. Ross to have the shelter built by day labour, under the arrangements he suggests, and that accounts for labour and materials upon his certification, be forwarded directly to the Indian Affairs Branch for payment.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch should be prepared to make approximately $700 available for payment of such accounts.\n\nIf this recommendation is approved, we will issue the necessary instructions to Mr. Ross.\n\nJ.M.

He stated that when the joints were filled, the standard practice of applying tape over the joints before painting was not observed. It should be stated that this phase and construction was carried out while our supervising officer was unavoidably recalled to Ottawa, at which time Indian Agent Rice was endeavouring to observe and report on progress. It is evident that Mr. Rice was unable to interpret our specification.\n\nThere is no doubt that the existing situation is unpleasant and it was as the suggestion to this Service through Mr. Ross, that a tender for refilling and taping the joints was to have been obtained.\n\nIt was not our opinion however, that complete interior re-painting would need to be carried out, or hardwood floors re-varnished, although these items have been included in the tender submitted.\n\nWhen Mr. Ross was in Ottawa recently, he stated that the exterior paintwork had not stood up, and that interior paintwork appeared to be an unsatisfactory job.\n\nWhen it is considered that the Contractor D.A. McDonald submitted a tender for $17,000 for this school which was accepted and that a similar school recently completed at Eskasoni cost in the neighbourhood of $85,000, it is obvious that through his poor estimating McDonald lost money and it now appears that the paintwork is one item on which he skimped.\n\nThe tender for refilling and taping the joints and for re-executing a large portion of the school paintwork obtained by the Indian Agent and forwarded here by\n\nJ.M.Wardle,Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6052, file 206-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nMr. Ross quoting an amount of $1832 for all items is reasonable for the amount of work involved and the school should benefit greatly by the expenditure; however, if the joint filling and taping is carried out and painting is restricted to the necessary retouching, the price could be considerably reduced.\n\nIt is felt, however, that Indian Affairs would be well advised to authorize Indian Agent Rice to have all the work covered by the tender carried out.\n\nWhile Mr. Ross could provide supervision, the accounts after certification by the Indian Agent, should be forwarded directly to the Indian Affairs Branch for payment.\n\nWhen we are advised that a decision has been reached, we will issue the necessary instructions to Mr. Ross.\n\nChief Engineer,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Also, it would seem that when the contractor learned he was going to lose money on the project, he skimped on the paint job, probably on the quality of the paint, and which job may not have been sufficiently closely inspected.\n\nThe combination of these two causes has resulted in the present unsatisfactory condition. I may say that similar conditions exist in many recently erected buildings in Ottawa.\n\nIn view of all the circumstances we concur in Mr. Mills' opinion that Indian Agent Rice should be authorized to have all the work covered by Mr. Russell's tender carried out.\n\nIf you should decide to have this done and wish for supervision by Mr. Ross, will you kindly so advise us.\n\nGeneral Executive Assistant.\n\nEnc.\nIndian Education\n\nAugust 7, 1947\n\n516 47 48\n10-691 260\n51-1-5\n\nPainting and other Repairs to the Shubenacadie Day School \u2014 $1,832.00\n\n(This work being done under the supervision of the Surveys and Engineering Branch.)\n\nIndian Affairs.

These requests have been rejected and our policy has been to provide only pianos for day schools of at least three rooms and more in size. This policy has been adopted because of the change over in teachers which occurs in our Indian day schools. This has resulted in our providing a piano for a school one year, to find that next year the teacher with musical ability had moved on elsewhere leaving no one capable of using the piano for musical instruction.\n\nTo date the only piano authorized for purchase was at the four-room Eskasoni Day School. During my recent inspection trip to the Maritimes I advised Mr. Indian Agent Rice to be on the lookout for a cheap recommissioned piano and to try and advise me if possible, so that the necessary purchase order could be obtained. However, this apparently was not possible, as most second hand piano dealers naturally want a decision immediately as to whether the instrument is to be sold or not.\n\nTherefore I would recommend the issuance of a purchase order to cover this recommissioned piano. It has been examined by the music teacher at the school and found to be entirely satisfactory. There will be no difficulty in the Shubenacadie School with regard to a music teacher, as three of the four teachers on the staff are capable musicians.\n\nBernard F.

These requests have been rejected and our policy has been to provide only pianos for day schools of at least three rooms and more in size. This policy has been adopted because of the change over in teachers which occurs in our Indian day schools. This has resulted in our providing a piano for a school one year, to find that next year the teacher with musical ability had moved on elsewhere leaving no one capable of using the piano for musical instruction.\n\nTo date the only piano authorized for purchase was at the four room Eskasoni Day School. During my recent inspection trip to the Maritimes I advised Mr. Indian Agent Rice to be on the lookout for a cheap reconditioned piano and to try and advise me if possible, so that the necessary purchase order could be obtained. However, this apparently was not possible, as most second hand piano dealers naturally want a decision immediately as to whether the instrument is to be sold or not.\n\nTherefore I would recommend the issuance of a purchase order to cover this reconditioned piano. It has been examined by the music teacher at the school and found to be entirely satisfactory. There will be no difficulty in the Shubenacadie School with regard to a music teacher, as three of the four teachers on the staff are capable musicians.\n\nBernard F.

His work has not proved to be satisfactory.\n\nA memorandum from Surveys and Engineering dated 30th July, reads as follows:\n\n\"It would appear that during construction of the school lumber was used which was not completely dry partly due to uncontrollable circumstances. Also, it would seem that when the contractor learned he was going to lose money on the project, he skimped on the paint job, probably on the quality of the paint, and which job may not have been sufficiently closely inspected.\n\n\"The combination of these two causes has resulted in the present unsatisfactory condition. I may say that similar conditions exist in many recently erected buildings in Ottawa.\"\n\nMr. H.B.

S.\n\nBefore the commencement of the next Academic Year it is desirable that the following items be considered:\n\n(1) The present heating system is inadequate for this School and it was understood that the present unit was to be replaced by a Hot Water System. We have received some materials from the Mount Pleasant Air Port which can be used in this conversion, however, the Furnace is not here and not nearly enough pipe to complete the job.\n\n(2) You will no doubt remember that last Fall an accountable advance was received at this Office to effect the necessary repairs to the outside lavatories. Due to the fact that an early winter set in the amount of frost in the ground made it impossible to attempt this work. The money advanced was returned at the end of the fiscal year. It is felt that this work should be proceeded with at once so that a convenient sanitary set-up can be erected.\n\nIt is proposed to construct a large cribbed well under the present buildings which will be removed to a new site in order that a better play ground can be provided. From this well irrigation pipe will lead to a suitable disposal bed. The front of the present buildings when moved to their new Con. Sheet # 2.\nlocation will be suitably camouflaged with lattic work to create good display.\n\n(3) It is absolutely necessary that a suitable play ground be completed this year. The lavatories are to be moved from their present site to allow for this work, but although some ground will be gained much work will have to be done behind the School and on the North side. Most of this work can be done with the Agency Tractor and Truck, but some other expenditure for equipment Etc., will be necessary to bring the play ground up to the standard desired.\n\nMay these requests receive favourable consideration and could we be advised at your earliest convenience your decision and recommendations in respect to these matters.\n\n(H. C. RICE) Superintendent,\nShubenacadie Indian Agency.\nJuly 22, 1948.\n\nMr. H.C. Rice, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Shubenacadie, N.S.\n\nWe have your letter of the 20th instant regarding the Shubenacadie Day School. We are communicating with the Lands and Development Services Branch regarding the change in the heating system.\n\nIn connection with moving the toilets, you do not give us any estimate of the cost. In your letter of November 19, 1947, you stated the cost would be $200.00. Will this amount be sufficient?\n\nWe note your recommendation regarding the playground but before issuing authority we would appreciate having an estimate of the expenditure that will be necessary.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOttawa, July 22, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS & DEVELOPMENT SERVICES\n\nRe: Shubenacadie Indian Day School, Shubenacadie, N.S.\n\nWe have just received a letter from Superintendent Rice which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"The present heating system is inadequate for this school and it was understood that the present unit was to be replaced by a Hot Water System. We have received some materials from the Mount Pleasant Air Port which can be used in this conversion, however, the furnace is not here and not nearly enough pipe to complete the job.\"\n\nWe do not appear to have any correspondence on file regarding the change in the heating system at the above school. Possibly you have some information available and if so, we would be pleased to hear from you. This matter should be allowed to stand until your officer visits Shubenacadie which you state in your memorandum of July 8th, will be early in September.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP/MCD\nShubenacadie, N.

The construction of a play-ground as previously stated can be done by the Agency Bull-dozers and truck at a minimum of costs; however, the equipment for this play-ground, other than such items as swings, teeters, trapeze rings, horizontal bars, etc., will have to be purchased.\n\nAttached hereto you will find a requisition listing the articles which the Principal and his staff would like to obtain.\n\nH.

Rice,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\n\nMr. J.E. Morris advised me today that the pipes and radiators are available at Shubenacadie in order to install hot water heating. We are endeavouring to place an order for the boiler required.\n\nWe are further advised by Mr. Morris that the installation of the hot water heating can be done by day labour. You can arrange for the workmen. It should be understood that we will depend on you to keep the total cost as low as possible.\n\nUnder separate cover we are forwarding you a plan of the heating and also a plan of the electric wiring.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Four-roomed Day School, Shubenacadie Indian Agency, Nova Scotia.\n\nIn your notation on Mr. Hoey's memorandum dated the 11th instant, in connection with the above, you ask to be advised.\n\nWe may say in this connection that the school was the first unit, of what now is a substantial development at the Shubenacadie Agency. At the time of construction no water or power services were available, and as a consequence only a gravity hot air system could be installed.\n\nFrom Mr. Hoey's memorandum, it is now apparent that the Indian Affairs Branch have decided to install electric wiring and hot water heating, from a design this Division prepared and installed in a similar building at the Eskasoni Indian Agency in Nova Scotia.\n\nThe work is evidently to be carried out by employees of the Agency staff and local tradesmen under the direction of Mr. George Johnson, Carpenter Grade 5, with salvaged materials, to which will be added a new boiler and other materials required.\n\nIn accordance with Mr. Hoey's request copies of the blueprints and specifications as used for the Eskasoni project were handed to Mr. E. Morris, Acting Superintendent of Indian Agencies for the Maritime Provinces, through whom the operations will be processed.\n\nWhile Mr. Hoey gives assurance that the drawings and specifications will be followed, this Branch should assume no responsibility for the installations or their operation.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nR.A.

As you are possibly aware we did receive certain amount of equipment by box-car during the past winter from Mount Pleasant Airport, P.E.I.\n\nFurther we dispatched our truck to Lennox Island on August 9th last to take up the balance of the surplus equipment there. Although Mr. Daley was not on hand to supervise the loading it is understood that we obtained all the surplus equipment that was available.\n\nWe possibly have enough radiators on hand at the present time to complete the job, however, a considerable amount of pipes will have to be purchased. We have written Mr. Daley sometime ago requesting information as to whether we can expect to receive anything further in the line of plumbing equipment from his Agency. To date we have not received a reply and it is felt that in view of the short time that is left before the opening of school, this matter should be drawn to your attention so that we can obtain further instructions from you as to what action is to be taken.\nShould we hear from Mr. Daley within the next day or two the contents of his letter will be wired to you so that you will be in a better position to advise us in this problem.\n\nThere is a plumber at present employed on the Reserve who would be available to commence the job as soon as the plans arrive at this office and your further instructions are received.\n\nH. C. RICE, Superintendent,\nShubenacadie Indian Agency.\nSeptember 1, 1948.\n\nMr. H.C. Rice,\nSupt.

We should also like to know the approximate cost of the labour for which you state a plumber is available.\n\nIn the last paragraph of your letter you refer to the plans.

Attached hereto you will find a list of the materials which will have to be purchased either locally or through the Purchasing Agent.\n\nIt will be noted that the Elliptical Angle Reflectors and Vapourproof Fittings are not included in the price list due to the fact that quotations could not be obtained up to writing time. However, it is anticipated that the total expenditure for requirements over and above stock on hand will be approximately $225.00.\n\nMay we be advised at your earliest convenience what your decision is regarding the purchasing of our articles and equipment not on hand at this Agency.\n\nH.

Rice, Supt. of Indian Agency, Shubenacadie, N.S.,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th ultimo, the Department approves an expenditure not exceeding $225. for securing additional electric equipment required to complete the work at the Shubenacadie Day School.\n\nWith reference to your letter of September 22nd submitting a tender from J.D. Barrett in which he offers to supply the balance of the material required for the plumbing and heating and also to install the furnace for an amount of \u00a31736.67, in conversation with Mr. Morris yesterday afternoon he stated that it was his understanding that the work would be done for a considerably smaller amount than that quoted by Mr. Barrett.\n\nThe furnace being purchased will cost approximately $800, and we were hopeful that the balance of the material needed and the installation would cost approximately the same amount. In view of the information given to us by Mr. Morris we would like you to review the matter and endeavour to obtain further tenders from other firms.\n\nAs a matter of fact, Mr. Morris says it was his understanding with you that the work could be done by day labour much cheaper than by obtaining a tender.\n\nBernard F.

Phelan.\n\nRe: Installation of hot-water system in\nthe Indian Day School -\nShubenacadie, N.S.\n\nWe are returning herewith Voucher No. 82 which\nyou forwarded to this office, with a request that our Mr.\nJ. E. Hall investigate the prices shown in the invoices of\nJ. D. Barrett of Truro, N.S.\n\nWhile in Shubenacadie, Mr. Hall inspected the\ninstallation of the hot-water system and found the system\nworking satisfactorily in the school rooms on the second\nfloor. However, one-third of the radiators on the ground\nfloor are not working satisfactorily, and the contractor,\nBarrett, states that this is due to the fact that certain\nchanges were requested in the installation by Mr. Hargreaves\nof the Engineering Services, which changes also increased\nthe cost of installation considerably. It appears that the\ncontractor had prepared to install radiators at or near the\nceiling of the ground floor, and Mr. Hargreaves insisted on\nhaving the radiators placed on the floor, which necessitated\nconsiderable additional work.\n\nAt the same time, it was pointed out that it was\nnecessary to transport labour from Truro to Shubenacadie,\nwhich required 3/4 of an hour each way, as well as transpor-\ntation charges. This, of course, also increased the cost of\ninstallation. Otherwise, the prices shown on the Barrett\ninvoices appear to be fair and reasonable.\n\nCont'd......\nIt is believed that Mr. Rice, the Superintendent at Shubenacadie, is to have the contractor, Barrett, investigate the actual reasons for the unsatisfactory heating by one-third of the radiators on the first floor, and just what action will be taken I cannot predict. However, it is recommended that your Branch should contact Superintendent Rice and give him your instructions, and request any further information which you may require in this connection.\n\nW. J. F. Pratt,\nGeneral Executive Assistant.\n\nEncl.\nAIR MAIL\n\n5th April, 1949.\n\nMr. H.C. Rice,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nMicmac, Hants Co., N.S.\n\nWe have your Voucher No. 82 in connection with the installation of a hot water system in the Indian Day School at Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia. We have reviewed the account from Mr. Barrett, and it appears that the following expenditures were incurred:\n\n1. Labour .................. $1,150.25\n2. Mileage to and from Truro .................. 173.60\n3. Material ................. 1,138.16\n\n$2,462.01\n\nBefore we can submit this Voucher for payment we will require three Vouchers for the amounts and services mentioned above. In connection with the charge for labour, it will be necessary for you to forward a labour return showing the exact dates on which the work was done, the number of men employed, and the rate per hour paid each employee. As just stated, separate Vouchers should be forwarded for the transportation and for the material.\n\nPlease give this matter your immediate attention and return the three Vouchers to this office not later than April 14th.\n\nBernard P.

Tel. & Tel. Co., Ltd., Halifax - copy of which was received by me.\n\nShortly after receiving this letter we received two cheques which cleared the accounts for 27-2 and 27-3 and covered part of the charges on 79-3 and 79-4. Your kind cooperation in following this matter up is greatly appreciated and since that time subsequent bills have been paid as rendered.\n\nHowever, at that time it was found that the Exchange Service charges on both 79-3 and 79-4 still remained unpaid from the date of installation - November 17, 1947 to June 30, 1948, excluding the month of May 1948 which was paid in August.\n\nI took this matter up by letter with Mr. Rice in your Shubenacadie Office on November 24, 1948 - and as yet he has not been able to give us anything definite except that he has \"passed the information along\".\n\nFor your information, I am attaching statements to cover the amount of $22.94 on both 79-3 and 79-4. Both telephones are for the teacher's residence, and toll charges are paid locally.\n\nI would be pleased to assist in any way that you might suggest, to have this matter cleared up as I am anxious to have these 1947 and early 1948 charges removed from my files.\n\nThanking you in advance for your usual cooperation,\n\nI remain\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(M.

At the time the work commenced, there were on hand at Shubenacadie radiators, valves, pipes, etc., which had been salvaged from the Mt. Pleasant Airport Hospital which had been previously turned over to the Indian Affairs Branch. It was also expected that our caretaker at Shubenacadie could do a considerable amount of the work.\n\nHowever, as the season was advancing and the work was proceeding very slowly, Indian Superintendent Rice made arrangements with Mr. J.D. Barrett, Truro, Nova Scotia, to take over the work in order to have it completed before the cold weather set in. It was also found when the work was actually started that a considerable amount of additional material was required. This was also supplied by Mr. Barrett. When the work was completed, the Indian Superintendent submitted three Vouchers issued in favour of Mr. Barrett, which were as follows:\n\n(1) Materials.......................... $1,138.16\n(2) Labour............................ 1,150.25\n(3) Transportation of labourers from Truro to Shubenacadie... 173.60\n\n$2,462.01\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6052, file 260-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe amounts mentioned above were much higher than the Departmental officials expected, and we had the newly installed system inspected. We learned that the system which had been in use during most of the past winter, had proved satisfactory. It was also ascertained that the cost was increased due to the fact that certain changes were requested in the installation by an officer of the engineering services of the Lands & Development Services Branch. It appears that the contractor had been prepared to install the radiators at or near the ceiling on the ground floor, but the engineer from the Lands & Development Services Branch insisted on having the radiators placed on the floor, which necessitated considerable additional work.\n\nWe also ascertained that it was necessary, in order to complete the work, to transport labourers from Truro to Shubenacadie, which required three-quarters of an hour each way as well as transportation charges. This, of course, also increased the cost of installation.\n\nThe prices shown on the Invoices received from Mr. Barrett appear to be fair and reasonable. We would, therefore, appreciate it if you would approve payment of the accounts which have been submitted by Mr. Barrett, in an amount of $2,462.01. He is urging immediate payment as the work has been completed for some time, but submission of the matter to you has been delayed until our officials had made a thorough investigation and decided that the expenditure was reasonable for the amount of work performed.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, June 11th, 1949.\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Shubenacadie Four-Room Indian Day School,\nShubenacadie Indian Agency, Province of Nova Scotia.\n\nLast August it was decided to change the heating unit from hot air to hot water at the above mentioned school.

Since the memorandum was returned, I have consulted the Superintendent of Education and also Mr. Morris, who was the Acting Regional Supervisor for the Maritime Provinces at the time this change-over was made. Mr. Morris has prepared a memorandum under date of July 4th, which you will find on file immediately hereunder.\n\nApparently the question of getting authority was not thought of at the time, as it was felt that when the purchase order was issued for the purchase of a hot water boiler this approved the principle of the change-over. You will note from Mr. Morris' memorandum that the hot air system was entirely inadequate to heat the school, and particularly the two basement rooms, in the proper manner. Although the change-over cost a considerable amount of money, the total cost of this school is still only a little more than half the cost of a similar building at Eskasoni.\n\nMr. Barrett, who did the heating and plumbing work, has forwarded a further telegram to the Branch indicating that the non-payment of his account is jeopardising his credit with his suppliers. While we realize that authority should have been obtained from Head Office prior to authority having been given for the work, I would recommend that approval be now given, in order that we may pay Mr. Barrett's account. As set out in memorandum of June 11th, it is felt that the expenditure was reasonable for the work performed.\n\nActing Director.\nMemorandum:\n\nActing Director.\n\nRe: Installation of hot water heating unit - Shubenacadie 4-room day school.\n\nThe following is a brief explanation for the necessity of installing the hot water heating system in the above mentioned school.\n\nThe Shubenacadie 4-room school was constructed at a very low cost of approximately $20,000. A hot air heating unit was installed last to keep the cost down and 2nd electricity or water was not then available. The hot air heating unit proved that it was unable to heat the building adequately, in fact, it was never possible at any time to heat the two basement rooms, which were to be used for Manual Training and Domestic Science. I held several meetings with the Indians in the basement during the winter of 1948 and despite the fact that all the heating was turned on in the basement rooms, we had to conduct the meetings with overcoats and mufflers on.\n\nWhen we were dismantling the hospital at Mount Pleasant Airport, at Prince Edward Island, we had a surplus quantity of radiators, pipes, elbows, tees, and valves. I pointed this fact out to the officers of the School Division and suggested that consideration should be given to installing a hot water heating system using these materials, which would substantially reduce the cost. At the time it was considered that Mr. George Johnston, the caretaker, would be able to do the work himself in his spare time without additional cost for the labour. He did not work out for the reason that when Mr. Johnston went through the blueprints he stated that he was unable to do the work properly. It was discovered during the summer of 1948 that the fire pot in the hot air furnace was burnt out and could not be used again during the winter of 1948-1949, as it would be a fire hazard. With Mr. Johnston unable to carry out the work, Superintendent Rice was instructed to investigate the possibilities of securing the services of a competent furnace man, or steam fitter who, with Mr. Johnston's assistance, would install the new heating unit. In the meantime, a hot water heating boiler was purchased, Order #3788.\n\nMr. Rice was unable to fulfil my request and as it was getting late in the season, it was imperative that something would have to be done. He sent in a quotation from Mr. J. D. Barrett, which we considered was too high. He was again asked to further investigate the possibility of securing a lower tender, but was unable to do so for the reason that it was very difficult for a contractor to make an estimate of the cost of a job of this kind keeping in mind that he had to use second-hand material and supply new material where required. After checking over the job, it was discovered that an extra quantity of radiators were required, Purchase Order #35739, dated November 10, 1948, was placed with Mr. Barrett for them.\nActing Director.\n\nOttawa, July 4, 1949.\n\nThis extra radiation was required to meet the specifications of the plans, as set out by the Engineering Division for the Eskasoni School, which are identical to the Shubenacadie 4-room school.\n\nIt is my personal opinion that this building could have been adequately heated with less radiation than was shown on the blueprints for the reason that Shubenacadie is located in an area where they have very mild winters, as the temperature very seldom goes below zero. However, the work has now been done and from reports is entirely satisfactory. The cost was considerably less because of the materials supplied from Mount Pleasant Airport.\n\nI would, therefore, recommend that payment be made at the earliest possible date.\n\nJ. Z.

Sometimes the weather is bad and the road impassable from swollen streams.

He now suggests that a new teacher's residence be erected and that the small house occupied by the teacher be taken for a woodshed and that you go into the question with him.

I may say it is not very explicit but I conclude therefrom that the cost of finishing the room inside to match with painting both inside and outside would be about $160. However, the department declined to pay out his request.\n\nI may also say that he communicated me with regard to his statement that he had authority leaving the building to Mr. Boyd.\n\nIf I remember rightly he told me that he had been authorized by Mr. Smith that it would be better to build a new house for the teacher and take the old one for a woodhouse and I believe him. I had no authority from the department to that effect and if Mr. Boyd had any such intention to make it would be doubtless done at the right time and place.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is filled out flush with the door and window casing; there would have to be a moulding or stripe of some kind go on around the door and window casing. I estimate the cost at about $160 or perhaps more. I don't think it would be any less that includes painting inside and outside. The outside is in bad condition; the shingles is getting weather worn and porous and will take a lot of paint and work and I think that when the banking is taken away there will be none of the shingles rotten.\nOttawa, May 16, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant in further reference to the probable cost of providing quarters for the teacher of the Shubenacadie Indian School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as you have already been informed, Mr. Superintendent Boyd has been instructed to consult with you in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nAlonzo Wallace, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 13th inst., I beg to say that it is not necessary for me to confer with Mr. Agent Wallace in order to arrive at a conclusion as to what is needed at Shubenacadie Reserve in the way of living quarters for the teacher. I know the situation well and would say that the proper thing to do is to erect a new teacher's residence, even if no use could be made of the present one, which, however, would serve the purpose of a woodshed very well, but which I am convinced a teacher cannot be got to occupy any longer. It is out of repair, entirely too small, and otherwise not at all suitable for a dwelling.\n\nBut I think that a less roomy and expensive building than any of those recently erected for teachers on other Reserves would fully meet the requirements in this case; and if the Department should decide upon the construction of a new residence, which I consider absolutely necessary if the school at Shubenacadie is to be kept in operation, I would undertake to submit a rough plan or sketch of a building that would amply meet the present and future requirements of the situation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.

Trucking teacher's desk, and stove for school house from Shubenacadie Ry. Station to Reserve $2.00\n\n1913. Trucking furniture for teacher's residence from Shubenacadie Ry.

Closet, 6\u00bd days, @ 1.50, 9.75\nHalf charge for cleaning teacher's residence, 1.00 -\n\nNoel McDonald.\n\n1914. Trucking saw dust for banking school house, 2.00\n\nTotal -$42.00\n\nMost of the expenditure was authorized through me before Mr. Foster's appointment as Superintendent, and for that reason, it is said, he refused to certify the accounts, which I understand were submitted to him.\n\nThe charges for truckage, and for labour on W. Closets appear somewhat familiar to me, and I would ask the Department to kindly look up its files and ascertain if these items are not included in accounts submitted through me previous to October 1914 for expenditure in connection with the Shubenacadie school. Before that time I frequently forwarded the original accounts with\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nwith the Vouchers, and I think to that cause may be attributed the fact that I can find nothing on file in my office to guide me in this case.\n\nKindly acknowledge receipt of this at an early date, furnishing the desired information if possible, and oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nMr. Giffin,\n\nI can find no record of these accounts.\n\nG.M.S.\nOttawa, July 13th., 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, with regard to certain accounts in favour respectively of Simon Basque, Peter Glode and Noel McDonald; and in reply I beg to say that seemingly these accounts were never presented to the Department for payment. It is desired that you will look carefully into this matter and if you are satisfied that the persons named are entitled to receive the respective payments claimed, you may submit duly certified vouchers for payment. Your particular attention is directed to the charge for cleaning the teacher's residence. This charge requires explanation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McCauley\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N. S.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 13th inst,\nI beg to say that I never was in doubt as to whether the services specified in the Vouchers enclosed herewith were duly performed or not, because the expenditures were authorized by me to meet cases of necessity; but I had a suspicion that the accounts had been handled by me already, which is why I thought it advisable to submit them to the Department as a precautionary measure before certifying them as correct. The expenditures were authorized previous to Mr. Foster's appointment as Indian Superintendent for western Nova Scotia which includes Shubenacadie.\n\nThere is a teacher's residence in connection with the Indian school at Shubenacadie, which was occupied for a time by the present teacher. To make the building habitable, after being tenantless for a time, it had to be scrubbed and cleaned throughout, which was done by Mrs. Basque and Mrs. Glode for the sum of $2.00 - $1.00 to each.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 5th., 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith accounts in favour of Noel McDonald $2.00, Peter Glode $10.75 and Simon Basque $29.35, as it is necessary to give on the face of each account the month and date for which each charge is made. It is not sufficient to give on the voucher simply the year in which the expenditure was incurred. The vouchers as they stand at present would not be accepted by the Audit Office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nBrookfield, Cal. Co. N.S.\nAug. 11th, '16\n\nMr. A. J. Boyd, Indian Sup't.,\nRiver Bourgeois.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just been advised that I will not be able to board this term, where I was boarded during the two past years, and as it is the only boarding place nearer than Mill Village (2 and 2\u00bd miles away), I write to ask you what can be done in the matter of providing a residence for the coming term. I would be able to live somehow until such a house was built. The present residence is totally unfit to live in. Even if it kept the rain out (which it does not), there is no cellar in which to keep supplies, nothing but a little cupboard in the corner of the room.\n\nIt would also be necessary to dig a well, as the nearest well is at McDonald's, which is too far away to\ncarry water from especially in stormy weather.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nMary A. Shortt\nSir,\n\nThe enclosed letter explains itself. Miss Shortt describes the condition of teacher's residence at Shubenacadie very well. Besides being out of repair the building is too small for the purpose intended. Its dimensions are about 12 x 15 ft. and the wall is very low. If the roof were repaired, it would make a very good place for storing fuel for both school and teacher. There is no fuel shed at present and one is required. It would be regrettable if anything should happen to close the Indian Day School at Shubenacadie, because it is doing good work, under the capable management of Miss Shortt.\n\nIf the Department's finances would permit, I would advise the construction of a plain building 19 x 25 ft. and 14 ft. post for the accommodation of the teacher, at a cost not to exceed $800. All the interior of the building need not be completed for the present. A bedroom, dining room, and small kitchen below stairs, would suffice.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nP.S. Miss Shortt's remarks concerning cellar and well, which please note, have my approval.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In purchasing the materials direct and having the work done by day labour, it is thought a well may also be provided and repairs made to the old building, which you suggest should be used for a woodshed.\n\nA separate estimate of the cost of well and repairs to shed should, however, be submitted for the Department's consideration before authorizing this.\n\nThe erection of the building should be proceeded with as soon as possible.\n\nMinor changes may be made to the plan with your approval.

Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 11, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, also blue prints for the proposed teacher's residence at Shubenacadie and which you have returned, and in reply to inform you that the Department cannot understand why you have returned the blue prints and specifications as you were informed that it was the intention of the Department to erect the building by day labour under the Superintendent of Michael Short who would also purchase the materials.\n\nIt is the intention of the Department that the work should be directed by you and it was thought that the Department's letter of September 15th was clear on this point, until the return of the plans and specifications to the Department yet when it was surmised that you had not given instructions in connection with the building to Mr. Short. As the building should be finished as soon as possible, I have to request that you will issue the necessary instructions to Mr. Short as soon as possible.\n\nThe bills for materials, etc., are to be sent to the Department certified by you.\n\nThe plans and specifications are returned to you by separate registered mail.\n\nThe additional door between kitchen and bed-room recommended by you is approved.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois,\nN. S.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th inst., which was before me on my arrival at head-quarters last night after a week's absence on official business; and to express my sincere regret for not having grasped the real import of your letter dated September 18th when I read it first.\n\nAs I understood it, the blue prints were sent to me only for approval or amendment, with the information that Mr. Michael Short of Shubenacadie had been appointed by the Department to exercise complete supervision in the building of the teacher's residence at Indian Brook reserve - both with regard to the purchase of materials and to the work of construction. I am sorry for my mistake, because valuable time has been lost. I shall communicate with Mr. Short by letter today about the matter, and will visit Shubenacadie myself on Monday, 23rd, to expedite operations as much as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.

I had an opportunity on Dec. 9th of observing what Mr. Shortt had accomplished up to that date under very unfavourable conditions, and would say that the work is being well done. If progress is not more rapid, the fact is entirely due to the difficulty of procuring suitable labour.\n\nSo far, the specifications have been adhered to, with one unavoidable exception: Siding was not obtainable, and with my approval shingles were substituted. As the result of experience, both personal and otherwise, I am convinced that shingles on the walls of a building are fully as durable as siding, and give better satisfaction.\n\nMr. Shortt suggests again the position of the flue in this case. He argues that it would be an advantage in heating the building to have it placed as near the centre of the house as possible, and built from a basement foundation. From what\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nwhat I have seen of flues resting on brackets, as shown in the plan, I would recommend making the alteration as suggested, which would entail an extra expenditure of about eight dollars.\n\nI think it would be advisable to postpone the work of finishing the interior of the building till the Spring, because plastering cannot be properly done during the winter season in the country, where there is no sure way of keeping the putty from being chilled and frozen without going to considerable expense which would not be warranted in this case. But if the work cannot be discontinued for a couple of months, I would strongly advise substituting Beaver Board for the Plaster. I am aware that the former is being extensively used on the interior walls of new, up-to-date residences, as finishing, and it is claimed, with excellent satisfaction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nCERTIFIED CORRECT,\nCharges fair and just.\nSigned...\nOttawa, February 5, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated 20th ultimo in reference to teacher's residence at Shubenacadie, N.S.\n\nThe Department is pleased to learn that the work on the building is reported by you as being well done and that the specifications have been complied with excepting that shingles have been used on the exterior of the building instead of clapboards which could not be procured. The use of the shingles is commended under the circumstances and if these are suitably stained or painted will meet the requirements.\n\nThe Department will also approve of the extending of the chimney to foundation in the position shown, but cannot approve of the chimney being placed at the centre of the building as this will interfere with the arrangement planned and which cannot be improved on in this particular.\n\nThe work should be discontinued until more favourable weather, and before commencing, arrangements should be made for the necessary assistance as the pay of the foreman is altogether out of proportion to the cost of assistants.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.J.

This portion of the work will, therefore, be delayed until the weather will permit of this being safely done.\n\nIn the accounts submitted for payment it is noted that the bill for labour and supervision is greatly in excess of the average proportional cost of labour and material, and it is expected that when work on this building is again resumed that the necessary assistance will be arranged for and the work completed within a reasonable time, and not to exceed the estimated cost which was figured on a very liberal basis.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ.D.

If you have paid her at this rate you should obtain a receipt, in duplicate, from her and forward it to Mr. Boyd, who will transmit it to the Department and the amount you paid her will then be refunded to you.

(RG 10; Volume 6652, file 260-6, part 1)\nOttawa, March 25, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Mrs. William Tanner, in which she requests payment of an account for $10.00 for cleaning the teacher's residence in connection with the Amherst School. Miss Shortt, teacher of this school, who was written to in regard to this matter, states that she engaged Mrs. Tanner on your suggestion and that she made a very excessive charge, and that upon receipt of Mrs. Tanner's bill you wrote her to pay Mrs. Tanner for the work she had engaged her to do, saying that you would allow her twenty cents an hour.\n\nMiss Shortt is being advised that the Department will pay Mrs. Tanner for the work she did at the rate you mentioned, viz., twenty cents an hour, and that, if she has paid Mrs. Tanner at this rate, she should obtain a receipt, in duplicate, from her and forward it to you for transmission to the Department, when the amount she paid Mrs. Tanner would be refunded to her. Miss Shortt is also being informed that, if she has not paid Mrs. Tanner yet, she should forward to you an account, in duplicate, for the amount due Mrs. Tanner at the rate mentioned above. Upon receipt of this account you will be good enough to certify it and transmit it to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI have just received from Miss Mary A. Shortt, teacher of the Indian day school at Shubenacadie, N.S., your letter to her of the 11th inst. with reference to cleaning the teacher's residence recently erected there.\n\nI instructed Miss Shortt to get the work done and, therefore, she has no responsibility in the matter. I did not think it any part of the janitor's duty to do this work, and am of the same opinion still. He is paid to furnish fuel to the school and to keep the school room in proper condition; and in view of the present price of hardwood fuel, he is certainly not too well paid for these services. There was no thought of a teacher's residence at Shubenacadie reserve when he was appointed.\n\nMrs. Tanner made a demand on me for $10.00, which I refused to consider until she would submit a proper statement of her claim, which she has finally done, and accordingly I forward herewith a Voucher in her favour for $2.00.\n\nI need hardly mention that a new building finished in plaster wants cleaning very much before it can be occupied, and that the process involves a great deal of rubbing and scrubbing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.

Now do you not think the Dept. would allow something towards the papering & finishing walls and painting floors?\n\nI am quite willing to do all the work gratis, if only they will supply the material.\n\nHoping you will give this letter very best attention.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMrs. A. King\nSir\u2014\n\nThe letter inclosed herewith explains itself. With regard to the cellar or basement of the teacher's residence at Shubenacadie Reserve, N.S., I beg to report that I examined last month and, therefore, have reason to think that Mrs. King's description of its condition is rather exaggerated. The outlet or drain from it seems to be choked, and any surface water getting into the cellar does not readily escape, which leaves the place damp and practically useless for the purpose it is intended\u2014the storage of vegetables, etc., in cold weather.\n\nI recommend that the drain be opened up and repaired at a cost not to exceed $20.00. I recommend also that an expenditure of $30.00 be authorized for the purchase of necessary materials to paper and paint the inside of the teacher's residence, where the work may be most required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.

The damaged platforms and door locks were caused by the work of parties unknown on Halloween night. I cannot give an accurate estimate of what all the material and work for above will cost, but would estimate approximately Twenty-five dollars would cover same.\n\nD. B. Lawler.\nAgent.\nOttawa, April 1st, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, relative to the stove, fuel supply and repairs, etc., required at the school and teacher's residence at the Shubenacadie Indian Bay School.\n\nRelative to the stove, it is noted that at a small cost the same can be put in a satisfactory condition. The quantity of stove pipe required is also noted. You may purchase the number of lengths of pipe, elbows and wire required and have this new pipe installed, and the stove repaired. You may also purchase the number of panes of window glass of the size required and the quantity of putty necessary to install same.\n\nYou may also purchase a strong padlock, with key, and have same installed on the woodshed.\n\nWith reference to the teacher's residence, you may have locks installed on the front and rear doors, and the wooden platforms at the front and rear of the building repaired and placed in good condition. The cellar drain should be cleaned out. We note that the cost of these repairs will be approximately $25. You should purchase the materials required in making the above repairs, and you may engage the services of a competent man to do all of the work mentioned above. When this work has been done to your satisfaction, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the materials and for the labour in having the work done. It is expected that you will keep the expense down to the lowest possible point.\n\nWith reference to the wood supply for the use of the school, you may purchase this wood on the basis of 10 cords for the year, buying part dry wood during the summer months and part green wood in the early part of next winter. You should obtain competitive prices, if possible, for the supplying of the wood, and the purchase should be made from the person quoting the lowest price. Vouchers should be forwarded in the usual manner covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAust. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nD. B. Lawlor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nShubenacadie,\nN.

Boyd informed me of this, after his visit to the Reservation last week.\n\nI consulted, one of our local men here in connection with same, and he informs me that he would do the work and furnish the paint, for $50. This does not provide the color to be brown, but white trimming only, and that the work be performed the last of this present month, weather permitting.\n\nHe agrees to supply a good quality paint which he explained to me, should be obtained in brown only, and that same would cost $2.50 per gallon and would require about 8 gallons.\n\nThe best quality paint here usually costs about $5.00 per gallon.\n\nIf this meets with your approval I would recommend that this offer be accepted and the necessary authority be forwarded.\nAt .........................................\n\n........................................ 19.....\n\nfurnished me to accept this offer.\n\nAfter March this man's services will not be available and if the painting is done afterwards, it will cost considerably more.\n\nI am aware that he has painted two buildings here in our village with the same paint and it is giving good satisfaction.\n\nIt is also necessary this Spring that the School House be given a thorough cleaning and worked over again to place forward the necessary authority to have this attended to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.B. Fowler\nAgent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, recommending that the teacher's residence on the Shubenacadie Indian Reserve be painted on the outside and giving an estimate of the cost of the material and labour required in having this work done. In reply I beg to say that the Department approves of having this work carried out and you can arrange with a local man to supply the paint and perform the labour as soon as weather conditions permit. A good quality of paint should be used, the colour to be brown with white trimming. We note that the work and material will cost, approximately, $55. You should see that the painting is satisfactorily completed and should forward a properly certified voucher, in duplicate, covering the cost of having the work performed.\n\nYou may also arrange to have the toilet at the school thoroughly cleaned and placed in a sanitary condition and this work should be carried out when the weather conditions permit. Accounts in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering the cost of having the toilet cleaned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nD.

They are not very sanitary and much less comfortable.\n\nI really don't know when they were supplied but as they had been patched before I came here Jan. 1923, I think they must be quite old.\n\nThey are just lumps and hollows. Will it be necessary for me to write more about them? You know as the children imagine their state.\n\nI wrote the Sup't Boyd in March last. So far he has not answered. I don't know why, but there is\nlittle satisfaction in writing or\ntaking to the middle-men.\nThis is what always will direct\nwhere this will meet with\napproval, and thanking you\nin advance.\n\nRemain\n\nJ.

By sunset we had overtaken two of the four, but Noel Julian and Peter Labobe of P.E.I. got into deep woods and we could not find them. About eight o'clock that night I went out over the ground with two officers of the R.C.M.P. We picked up their trail and kept after them until near midnight. Monday morning we found out that they had called at a house at 2 A.M. Monday. Before leaving there at 5 A.M. they at least had taken the old man's tobacco. They crossed Shubenacadie River on the ice, and were headed for Truro. On Monday morning the R.C.M.P. picked up their trail on the other side of the River, and we travelled miles after them. Whenever they found themselves near the main highway, they went back to the woods. I was getting over a cold, and all this travelling on Sunday and Monday, getting overheated and coming back and sitting in the car, has given me another, so I am in bed today.\n\nThere is no need to tell you what to do if they turn up in your Agency.\n\nThis is the fifth time for Noel Julian during the past two years, and I feel that Saint Patrick's Home is the only place for that imbecile.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Patrol was made to this spot, and the track of the boys was picked up, and followed by P.A. Perky. The track was followed for about \u00bd of a mile when it was learned that the boys had been seen further up the road. We immediately went to this spot and the trail picked up again, and followed through the bush for a distance of approximately six miles in a circular direction.\n\nThe two boys parted, the trail of W. LeBellois being followed by the dog, eventually freeing the boy. Dog was returned to the place where the two boys split, and an attempt was made to pick up the trail of the other boy, but the dog was too tired to work.\n\nL/Cpl. Cheeseman was contacted and the return trip was made to the school with the boy. At this time lunch was obtained, and a change of clothing for Cst. Roland.\n\nAbout 4 p.m. a phone call was received from one of the farms along the road to the effect that the boy had been seen crossing the road near Ryans Creek. We returned immediately to this spot and the trail of the second boy was picked up by the dog, and followed for about \u00bd or \u00be of a mile through the bush, the boy being found after a short time.\n\nThis boy was returned to the authorities at the school and supper was obtained in Shubenacadie. Return to Halifax being made in P.O. Code No. 1695, driven by Cst. Tunney.\n\nDuring the time the dog was searching in the woods, L/Cpl. Cheeseman and Cst. Tunney and Cst. MacKenzie patrolled the roads in the vicinity, keeping a lookout for the boys. During the search the writer was accompanied by L. Parker, one of the men from the school who was familiar with the country and the two boys.\n\nIn the opinion of the writer, the dog did a very efficient job under difficult circumstances, it being the first time he had done any work in the bush. The dog was bewildered at first, but soon settled down and followed the trail very well.\n\nJ.O. Roland\nCst.\nReg.

The Chief Inspector immediately dispatched Constable Smith to Northerton, N.S., to investigate the matter. Constable Smith arrived at Northerton at approximately 10:00 p.m. and proceeded to the Indian Agent's residence. After a brief conversation with the Indian Agent, Constable Smith learned that Noel Julian had been seen earlier that day by a local resident near the Shubenacadie River. Constable Smith then returned to the police station and reported his findings to the Chief Inspector.\n\n2.

This date, following receipt of a telephone message at about 6:45 A.M., from Sister Superior of the Indian Residential School, Shubenacadie, N.S., that Wallace LeBILLIUS and Leo TONNY, subject of separate report, had failed to return for their breakfast, immediate patrol was made in P/C CODE 1691 accomplished by Cst. Roland in the direction of Newtown in an effort to locate the two boys. Sister Superior also stated that she had started their car and several of the older boys down the mainland road.\n\n2. It was soon apparent that the two boys had left the Institution and communication with Father MacKey later in the morning revealed that the two had left a note stating they were on their way to \"U.S.A.\"\n\n3. The U.C.O. L/C Halifax detachment was contacted by telephone to ascertain whether or not it would be possible to obtain the services of Cst. Roland and P/D KBY. The U.C.O. advised that Cst. Roland would be immediately dispatched to Shubenacadie.\n\n4. The trail of the two boys was picked up at Ryan's Creek some 6 or 6 miles from the school. A few minutes later information came to hand that the boys had been seen on the main road a mile or so up the road. Patrol continued to the place and Cst. Roland again started out with \"Perky\".\n\n5. It was eventually established that the two boys were in a dense woods in the Admiral Rock district. No man from the Residential school accompanied Cst. Roland in the woods and the number of the men, into darkness and members of this detachment took places along roads and good trails where watch could be kept in order that the two boys might not slip out of the woods which were some 2 to 3 miles in width and 5 or 6 miles in length.\n\n6. The two made one attempt to break out of the woods but they were able to slip back into the woods and elude capture.\n\n7. Cst. Roland \"treed\" LeBILLIUS late in the afternoon had separated from his companion and members of party returned to Shubenacadie for refreshment (no being made for lunch at noon).\n\n8.

Tunnah to the Stewiacke District. A party from the school went out the Haitland Road.\n\nThe services of Cst. Boland and P/D K 27 \"Perky\" were obtained from N.C.O. Halifax Detachment.

The whole party returned to Shubenacadie for refreshments no stop being made at noon for lunch.\n\nA telephone message was received, whilst having lunch, that an Indian boy had been noticed near New Dublin (Shubenacadie side of Admiral Rock).

Boland and P/D K 27 to Halifax in the Late P.M., via P/C CODE 1691.\n\nP/D K 27 \"Perky\" under the direction of Cst. Boland made an excellent showing and it is thought the performance will have a salutary affect on the boys at the school who might have notions of playing truants. The two boys that left were no amateurs in the woods and they employed many tricks to throw off pursuit. The boys would enter the thickest brush, under low branches, through swamps and over such humps as, and, as they approached. The boys at the school have been assured that a dog would be obtained to patrol them and the presence of a dog has been lauded. One may conscientiously state the results attained by Csts. Boland and P/D K 27 was most gratifying and over shadowed any exaggeration that might have been made to previous truants as to the results that would follow when a dog might be brought into service.\n\nN.E.I.

Mackey at Indian Residential School, Shubenacadie, regarding the admission of Rita Pieton in that school.\n\nThe application has been accepted by Father Mackey and arrangements have been completed for him to meet the child in Halifax and proceed with her to Shubenacadie School.\n\nClosing this note with your approval,\n\nYours Truly,\n\nThomas Murray, D.A.\nOttawa,\nJune 16, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 10th instant with reference to the admission of Mary Anne Louis to the Shubenacadie Indian residential school. In view of Father Mackey's statement that he would prefer having her admitted after the summer holidays I feel that if you can make arrangements for her remaining for the next two months in the same place that she is located at present it would possibly be the best procedure to follow. If, however, this is not possible you might write again to Father Mackey and I feel certain that he will do everything possible to cooperate with you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nN. A. McDougall, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSummerside, P.E.I.\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nJune 12, 1939.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of June 8th, and the enclosed letter of Noel Sark, concerning the matter of vacation for his three children, Hannah, Laura May, and Harry.\n\nWe have already written all Agents who have children in the school about the matter of vacation, with the exception of Agent Darros of Bear River, Digby County. Last year he wrote direct to the Department about vacation for the five Louise children, and was refused. As we told Mr. Phelan when he was here, had Agent Darros written to us recommending vacation for the children, we would have sent them. This year we did not write to him.\n\nNow to get back to the matter of our letter. We had a reply from Mr. Hudson saying that he did not want vacation for any of the children from his district. Further, the oldest Sark girl, Hannah, is sixteen, and we sent word in the same letter to Mr. Hudson that Hannah was eligible for discharge. In reply Mr. Hudson stated that he had not heard from the father for some time, and did not know where he was located. We informed him that the father was at Petitcodiac, and he advised us to send her there. So in any case, one will go.\n\nWe think the following information is true. The mother of these children died on the road a few years ago, and the story was that her death was caused by lack of nutrition. The father has married again, and judging\nfrom his letter to you, and his letters to the children, he must be doing better. We might say that all three children when they came here were poorly nourished, and indicated in many ways that they had very little care.\n\nThe way we feel about vacation is that since the Agent in the different localities send the children here, they, the Agents, know the home conditions, and we leave it to them to say whether or not any child will go home for vacation. As far as we are concerned, we would be glad to see them all go home for vacation.\n\nSo we are sending Mr. Hudson a copy of this letter, and enclosing the letter of Mr. Sark. If Mr. Hudson wishes Laura May and Harry to go home for vacation, we will send them along with the rest of the children at the end of the month, provided that Mr. Sark lives up to his end of the bargain, and sends us the railway fare for the three, or even for the two younger ones, because the oldest Hannah will be sent in any case.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I should appreciate it if you would arrange to see Sark and reply to Rev. Father Mackey's letter at the earliest possible date.

In reply I beg to inform you that it does not appear to me to be advisable to have these children leave school for vacation, as they have a very poor home to go to. The oldest, Hannah, is over school age and will go to her father but the others should remain at school.\n\nThis Noel Sark is an Indian of P.E.I., and is moving around from place to place in New Brunswick and has no fit abode for children, and neither will he try to take care of them if he does get them. What this Indian is trying to work out, is to have the children with him in order that he will have a reason to apply for relief, and then he will live on such relief and neglect the children.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nyour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

J.F. Mackey,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have one boy and two little girls at Shubenacadie Indian Residential School, and I would like to keep them at that school until they reach the age of 16. To come out of the school, I live about one mile and a half from the place where they are talking about to build the school house.\nat the Reserve there through the woods and rivers and meadows between no bridge for the children to get across and they go round the road is five miles. And I a man now sixty years of age with three broken ribs my wife is in a doctor's care. I have no way to support them if they should be discharged from the Indian Residential School Please answer direct to John Knockwood\nRichibucto, N.B.\nJune 16th,\n1939.\n\nDear Father Mackey:\n\nI have the copy of a letter you sent the Department re the Sark Children. With regard to sending Laura May and Harry, home for vacation, I cannot yet see that it would be to their advantage, or pleasure either, that they should go.\n\nAs for any improvement in this Noel Sark, none can be expected, as I do not believe he will take any care of those children if they do go to him. What he is trying for, is to have the children go home, and then apply to the Department for relief, and out of what he would probably get, he would live himself and let the children go hungry as he did when his first wife was alive.\n\nI would like to see the children have a vacation, but when I know it would mean to them nothing but hardship I cannot agree to give them any, that is if it is left to me to decide. So I would let Hannah go to her father but keep the younger ones.\n\nYours respectfully\n\nSigned Chas. Hudson\nIndian Agent\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated June 19th. File 51-0-10 referring to a letter from the Principal of the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School concerning the Sark children. In reply I have to say that Father Mackey's letter of the 12th instant was replied to on June 16th, and I am enclosing a copy of the letter. I presume this is the copy you asked for. If it is not, please write again.\n\nWith reference to the one named Hannah, she is 16 years of age and I presume she will be discharged, but the other two little ones, I believe it would only be a hardship for them if they should go to their father for vacation.\n\nIf there is any further information that I can give you about these children I will be pleased to do so.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have placed in the last four years some thirty girls in white homes as domestics. Some of them have let me down and been failures, but I am more than satisfied with the average.

However, we propose the following, and hope it will meet with your approval.\n\nIf you would arrange with the mother and pay her expenses to come to Cape Tormentine, we would take the girl from here to the boat by car, and the mother could look after her from there on. We would pay Mary Ann's fare, and if you would let us know the expenses for the mother, we would send you a cheque for that amount. The greatest difficulty would be getting the girl aboard and off the train. Between here and the boat it would mean six changes, so if we took her by car to the boat, it would be much more convenient and would save the mother the trip by train from the boat down here and back. We would have to have a few days notice so that there would be no hitch in meeting the mother. Will you please let us know what you think about it.\n\nWe are enclosing admission form for the Bernard children. They are complete except for your signature.

CAMERON\nWHOLESALE\nFlour and Feed A Specialty\n\nNov 20 Cash for three tickets\nfrom St Peters to Shubenacadie $480\n(For Robert Paul and children)\nDear Sir:\n\nShortly after Mrs. Michael Denny's death on August 30th, I investigated as to how Mr. Denny would take care of his children. He made the statement at the time that Mr. & Mrs. Mathew Sapier were moving in with him and would look after the children. They did but did not stay there very long with the result that his two boys, Francis, age 12 and Gordon John are very neglected.\n\nFrancis goes to school occasionally; last week it was reported to me that he was intoxicated. Gordon John goes to school fairly regularly but the both children have no one to prepare their meals as the father is away most of the time. Mr. Denny does not want to have his children sent to Shubenacadie school, believing wrongly of course, that children there are not well cared for, especially since the triple escape of an older son, Gregory, who is now at St. Patrick's school, Halifax.\n\nIn view of the above facts, I strongly recommend that these two children be sent to Shubenacadie school, and ask the Department how to proceed to have the children sent there. I understand that forms (which I have on hand) are to be filled, but I know that Mr. Denny will not sign his name to them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. E. Chiasson,\nIndian agent\nOttawa,\nDecember 13, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 7th instant with reference to Francis and Gordon Denny.

His father No. G27478 Pte. Dan Peters, Mt. Stewart, P.E.I., has enlisted for Overseas service.\n\nI would point out that this boy's mother is dead and this is the only son. It may be possible that he will receive the regular separation allowance of $35.00 per month.\n\nIn any event, will you kindly advise me whether the fact that the Government is paying for his tuition at the school, will interfere with his separation allowance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant regarding Schurman Peters.\n\nIf this boy's mother is dead and there is no one to care for him the Department doubts the advisability of discharging him from the Shubenacadie Residential School simply for the purpose of obtaining an extra $12.00 a month separation allowance. Even if this amount were paid it would not go to the father but would go to the boy or whoever was looking after him. If he were placed with an Indian it is doubtful if he would receive as good attention as he is receiving in the Shubenacadie School.\n\nYou should take up with the military authorities the question of whether or not they will pay the separation allowance in the event of the boy remaining in the Shubenacadie School. Such procedure was followed during the last war and the money so obtained was paid to the Department and funded to the credit of the recipient and used for assistance when discharge was finally granted from the residential school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

If they decide to allow separation allowance it is felt that the money should be remitted to this office and will be retained for the use of the son who is at present a pupil of the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School. The Department does not see any necessity for giving the separation allowance to Daniel Peters' sister who is not maintaining his son.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

As long ago as April 1, 1936, the Indian Agent at Christmas Island was directed to endeavour to arrange to have those of the orphans who were between seven and fifteen years of age placed in the Soubenacodie Indian Residential School, but it would appear that he took no action to carry out these directions.

E. Robertson. It is noted that both these communications relate to the children of Henry Charles, Seymout, N. S.\n\nI am anxious that there should be no misunderstanding in your mind with respect to sending telegrams to this Department. The officials of this Bureau are acting under explicit orders from the office of the Minister when, in dealing with Indian agents, they insist that only in very urgent and exceptional cases should telegrams be sent to this Department and that on such occasions the messages should be very brief.\n\nIt is noted that you received a letter relating to the welfare of these children on March 18 from Dr. Robertson and it is also noted that you did not send forward the telegram until April 5th.\n\nIf you consult my letter to you dated April 5th, 1943, you will note I stated in that communication that it was your responsibility to discuss this matter very thoroughly with the Indian himself and to make the best possible arrangements you could make, in view of all the circumstances. I have nothing to add to these instructions. You should make provision for the care of these children in an Indian home, if possible. Toward the middle of August you should submit an application forms for the three children ranging in age from 8 to 10 for admission to the Shubenacadie residential school. I regret that it is not possible to enroll these children at the residential school until the end of the present academic year. The younger children, who are not of school age, can not be admitted to the Shubenacadie school.\n\nIf Charles succeeds in securing employment and refuses to contribute to the support of his children, you, as Indian agent, should take the ordinary court action usually taken in such cases. The Department is not asking you to do the impossible, but in times such as these, even Indian parents must assume some responsibility for the support of their children. In the meantime, any arrangement you make for the support of these children in a home, where they may be in satisfactory conditions, will be acceptable to the Department. If Weldon Charles and Moses Charles, both of whom are referred to by Dr. Robertson in his communication, need medical care, you should submit a specific recommendation on both cases to the Superintendent of Medical Services of this Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. S. E. Darros,\nIndian Agent,\nBear River,\nNova Scotia.\nOttawa,\nMay 11, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nOwing to a drastic reduction in our appropriation for the current fiscal year the item of transportation of children will have to be reduced. I realize that you have been extremely fair in this regard and my only purpose in writing to you at the present time is to point out the necessity of taking advantage of every possible means of transporting children to and from the school without expense to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J. P. Mackey,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N. S.\nDear Sir,\n\nSarah Baqwe of Shubenacadie came from the Residential School at Shubenacadie in 1934. She has since lived with her grandparents, mother and two sisters. She has a desire to go back to the school and the grandparents are very anxious to have her go back. She did very well while at school and was a very nice looking girl tall and slender. A young woman came into the house as the result of her uncle and she does not get along well. We have a little girl named Pauline from a nearby community staying at Reddeck at the home of her aunt and uncle and she is proving to be a success. Louise Pauline has splendid success. She was 17 years old at the school till she was 17 years old and I hope she will be able to go back for a year or two more. That she may come back equally prepared to do useful work.\n\nThanking you for an early reply.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

If the information on our files is correct this girl is now over 17 years of age.\n\nIn view of the number of applicants for admission to Shubenacadie as well as other Indian residential schools it has been found necessary to adhere as strictly as possible to the requirements of the Indian Act designating 16 years of age as the one for discharge.

The others did not return from vacation.\n\nWith the exception of Joe Copage, No. 152, of Cambridge, Kings Co., No. 3, Agent Spinney, all the others are from P.E.I. Agent Murray.\n\nWe had written to Agent MacDougall on September 12th, and sent you a copy of that letter. We have had no reply from Agent MacDougall. The fact that these children \"are long overdue and must therefore be considered lost\" is the reason we have placed their names on the Discharge Sheet. We would like to see some of these children returned to school. If they are not returned, then we will inform Agent Murray and Agent Cameron to send the new children from their districts.\n\nThere are two girls, Clara Bernard, No. 0810, and Bernetta Feehan, No. 0211, and three boys, Moses Bernard, 205; Albert Bernard, No. 206; and Charles Bernard, No. 207.

Those applications are herewith enclosed. In the case of the other three children numbers 207, 021C and 021L I was not aware that they were living in the vicinity of Summerside. Numbers 207 and 021C Clara and Charles Bernard had previously attended school in the Mount Rose district, west of Alberton where they had been camping for some years. The other child Bernice Necham with her mother was absent from the province for the past five months and stepfather was back on the Rocky Point Reserve for the winter months. As in the case of the Bernard children I will endeavor to have applications completed for those children at an early date.\n\nI have had several disappointments in connection with my work in the past two months due to the fact that I have been sick with pleural pneumonia since the last week in August and it is only in this last week that I have been feeling fit to attend to my different obligations. I am sorry for the case of Michael Sark's children who were attending Summerside School for the past years but our Indian Dr. has told me that he was responsible for them not returning to School because they were infected with the lice and have not yet been completely cured.\n\nWill forward above mentioned applications immediately on completion.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Is it your desire that the Principal be informed not to accept any children from Prince Edward Island unless he has first heard from you?\n\nI feel that there must be some definite decision made regarding when children are to be admitted from Prince Edward Island to Shubenacadie. It is rather unsatisfactory to have them enter the school without any approval having been granted.

Although at the time, we had in the school the number of children for which grant is allowed, we advised these Agents to send on the children. When Mr. Spinney wrote we thought it possible that some of these children from Parrsboro, Pictou, and Richibucto, may not come, so we wrote to Mr. Spinney to make application to the Department, and if approved, then it might be possible for us to accept some or all of them. However, it so happened that all the children from Parrsboro, Pictou, Antigonish, and Richibucto arrived. So at the present time we have seventy eight girls, and eighty one boys, a total of a hundred and fifty nine, well above the number for which \"grant\" is allowed.\n\nWe have completed blood tests, vaccinations, and Schick test, and toxoid treatment is well under way.

It is a long lonely 4 miles, for a girl.\nto travel all alone, anyhow.\n\nMy daughters and I went up to see the College on Nov. 12th, and the sisters showed us all through, and I thought it was a wonderful place, everything they teach here is useful knowledge.\n\nI am 55 years old myself, but I would like to have a few years there, because one is never too old to learn something new, especially the beautiful pottery they do there. So I hope to get my daughters there as soon as I possibly can, in a couple more years, she will be old enough to register, and perhaps get in an ammunition factory somewhere in Canada. I would like to have a job in an ammunition factory too. It would be the greatest thrill to me if I knew that my hands helped to polish the bomb or shell that would smash Hitler.

It is doubtful if he will last very long, and he wants his boys to come home from school at Shubenacadie.

Our translation of the enclosed letter is that Agent Cyr wants the three Jacob children to go to Gaspe for vacation.\n\nThe mother of these children is dead, and the father, we understand is French, not Indian. The father has been going from pillar to post for years. His last stopping place was Cambridge, Nova Scotia. We understand from Agent Spinney that he was going to chase Jacobs away from the Cambridge Reserve. The old fellow passed through here about a week ago on his way to Quebec. Apparently, he went directly to the Agent and put up a good story.\n\nUsually when an Agent asks for vacation for any children from his Agency, we are only too glad to send them, but this is a little out of the ordinary. Please let us know whether we should send the children or not.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Total rations cancelled amount to $125.66 per month.\n\nNew lists were then prepared for each of the three approved merchants and copies left with the agent, with a letter of explanation and instructions. You will also find annexed, copies of such lists and letter.\n\nThis revision should take care of the relief required in the said agency. As a matter of fact, the Agent himself admitted some changes since we made drastic cuts in relief last January. The Indians appear to realize that it means business, and therefore, more of them have been going out to work than ever in the past.\n\nRE: Peter Jacobs\n\nPeter Jacobs was born at Guysboro N.S. He married at Buctouche, N.B., but had no children. A second marriage, at Richibucto, and five children were born, all of them died. He married a third time at Prince Edward Island, had five children; two died as well as the mother; the three living girls are: Sarah 16, Bertha 13, and Mary Laura 11.\n\nHe lived in many places and as a rolling stone, gathered no moss. He informed me that he had been living in the following places: Bathurst, N.B., 30 years; Ashland, Me., U.S.A., 7 years; Gaspe, P.Q., 1 year; Cambridge, N.S., a few months.\n\nThe man today is over seventy. The three girls have been staying at Shubenacadie School for some years, and this summer, the old man claimed them, pretending to be lonesome for them. He has been staying here and there at Maria Reserve, but Indians are getting fed up with him, as he is not a member of the Band; as a matter of fact he belongs to no band and has no house to live in, and there appears to be no permanent house on the reserve. The man impressed me as being of a demanding type of Indian, the kind who believes that we owe it all to him and is expecting to get it wherever he feels like living, without any effort on his part.\n\nAs to the girls, the oldest one is visiting here and there and appears to be free to go without much control; the second has poor eyesight, the father said that she received treatment while at Shubenacadie, but her eyes are getting worse all the time; as to the youngest, she stays also with her father who claims she is not properly dressed to go to school.\n\nMy suggestion that he go back where he was born, was turned down by the old man.\n\nBefore leaving, I authorized the Agent to give him light relief, until he is advised of the Department's decision on the case.\nThe agent informed me that he had notified the Shubenacadie School that Mr. Jacobs wanted his girls back with him and the School wired back to meet them the next day at Campbellton, N.B., but he did not go. However they were on the Reserve a few days later with their father.\n\nI was told the night that I was surprised that he had not taken this matter up with the Department first, and he informed me that the former Agent, Mr. J. Adhemar Cyr, told him all he had to do was to notify the school and they would let the girls go.\n\nAlthough not familiar with proceedings in such cases, I thought that so long as the Department had placed the children in the school and paid for their upkeep, it was only fair that the Department should be consulted in such cases previous to taking the children out.\n\nMr. Napoleon Cyr was told that in future, he should be careful to consult the Department, in matters of which he was in doubt, in preference to any one else.\n\nJude Thibault\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nQuebec Inspectorate.\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nNovember 4th, 1941.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nAfter a vacation from June 30th until November 3rd,\nTeresa Joe and Frank Joe, from Barra Head, C.B.,\nMr. Langley, Agent, arrived at the school last evening.\n\nIn the last quarterly discharge form we had them listed\nas discharged.

We don't just know what to make of it. Sometime ago we sent you all correspondence we had concerning these three Jacobs girls. At the time we said we were not anxious to have them back, unless it turned out that it would cost the Department more to keep them in Quebec than it would in the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. Rather interesting the people who are getting cost of living bonus.\nOttawa,\nNovember 19, 1941.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant with reference to the Jacobs girls. The information contained in Constable Gideon's letter is the same as that which we received from Mr. Thibault, Inspector of Indian Agencies for the Province of Quebec, who visited the Maria Reserve recently.\n\nIndian Agent Cyr had no authority to write to you in the manner he did last June. The father of the Jacobs girls is in no position to support them and they should have been left in the Shubenacadie School. We have made inquiries but find it impossible to place them in an institution near the reserve. I presume that under these circumstances you will be prepared to accept them again and instructions are being issued to have them returned to Shubenacadie at an early date.\n\nIt is quite possible that the re-admission of these children will bring the total pupilage at this school over the number for which grant is allowed. However, we will adjust this when paying the March quarter per capita allowance and at that time we will provide supernumerary grant if your returns for the December and March quarter show that such action is necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J.F. Mackey,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nNovember 19, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn a letter dated June 25 last you directed the Principal of the Shubenacadie Residential School to return Sarah, Bertha and Mary Laura Jacobs. As a result of this letter the children were sent home to the father and we are now informed that he is unable to properly look after them.\n\nYou should, therefore, make immediate arrangements to return the children to the Shubenacadie School and payment of their transportation from Campbellton to Shubenacadie will be made on receipt from you of a properly certified account in triplicate.\n\nI would also direct your attention to the fact that you have no authority to authorize discharge of children from residential schools. Very serious consideration was given to deducting the cost of their transportation from your salary. However, it has been decided not to take such action this time but if there is any recurrence of this matter the amount of expense involved will be so deducted.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. N.

My father and 2 youngest sisters are at present on this Reserve, not having a home here or and no home on the Cambridge Reserve.

I wonder if it is wise under the circumstances to send them to Nova Scotia. The Indian constable Milton Gordon has statements from the above mentioned girls that Anthony Martin, an Indian 75 years old, has been acting in an indecent manner with them. This apparently has been going on for some time. The father and the children had been living with this old man. At present these girls are with a respectable family.\n\nThe case is now in the hands of the Provincial Police and there seems to be nothing can be done till the investigation has taken place.

At the same time we requested the discharge of four who were well under sixteen years of age, and gave the reasons for our request. The letter from the Department, dated September 21st, approved the discharge of those whom we had requested.\n\nWe will send to the Department a copy of this letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Murray's store when he had been taken suddenly ill with spinal meningitis but returned shortly afterwards when found to be free from the infection.\n\nIn regard to Bernice Popey, I refer you to letter of July 4, file no 450-1 N.S. (W. L. Falconer M.D.) giving authority for treatment of this girl, at the time of returning to school she apparently was not considered quite ready to return, but now from what I can observe, is very well and healthy and really should be in school.\n\nIn reply to a letter I wrote Rev J.P. Mackey for the admission of this child to the Shubenacadie Residential School he states that he had made a request from you for her discharge which you approved.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nEarl Brown\nIndian agent\nOttawa,\nOctober 16, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Indian Agent Earl Brown in which he states that Bernice Toney, No. 0226, and Mari Evangeline Paul, No. 0227, are now in good health and he considers that it would be in their best interests to return to the Shubenacadie School. I am writing to him requesting that these children be medically examined and, if they are pronounced physically fit, they may be sent to Shubenacadie when you advise there is accommodation for them. Please communicate with Mr. Brown in regard to these children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J.P.

I am writing to Father Mackey asking him to communicate with you. If he states that he can provide accommodation for them, you should have them medically examined before they leave your Agency.

However, this child has been in the school for sometime. Although late returning from vacation, we think it was about the middle of September when she did arrive. Number 0227 is Stella Paul from Cumberland County, and she returned to school just a week ago, on October 12th.\n\nOur letter from Agent Earl Brown of Kings Co., spoke about Bernide Toney, No. 0226, and we are writing to him in accordance with the instructions in your letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

By the time he finished Grade 8 work, he was not sixteen years of age. The next term, we sent him to the school in the village, to attend Grade 9. At the close of the school term, he led the boys in the class, and was second in the whole class, one girl having higher marks than he had. It was during that year that we had the permission of the Department to send him to High School. During the next year, he held his place, and the last report for Grade XI, he was leading the class, having finally caught up with the girl who had previously led.\n\nAs far as we know, at the present time, when he finished Grade XI he intended to try for the Air Force. He will be eighteen on February 10th. He is an illegitimate child; we understand that the mother is now married to a white man. We do not remember any of his people ever coming to see him, and he doesn't hear from any of them by letter.\n\nNo. 665, Mary Clare, is an orphan, and has always been a delicate child. When about fifteen years old, she developed a sort of fainting spell. After observation at the Victoria General Hospital in Halifax, they seemed to think there was pressure felt the brain. They recommended that she be taken to certain brain specialists in Montreal. The department concurred and advised us that she should go, and have a companion, to Montreal. When the word came, the youngster said that she would not go, as she hoped to die here. She is not on the same routine as the others. She seems to know when the attack is coming on, and she goes to bed, and rests, with perhaps a little bromide. She has not had any attack now for at least six months. We doubt very much if she could go out\ngo out and earn her own living, for any length of time. However, if you think that she should be discharged, we could find out from the Agent if he could find a suitable place for her. She was eighteen in October, and we would like to see her remain here until she is twenty years old.\n\nNo. 229, Roland Patrick Peters, comes from P.E.I. and he has been here since September 8th.

Denny.\n\nThis girl will be sixteen years old on December 10th, 1943. Under ordinary circumstances, this girl would be discharged from the school at the close of this term, on June 30th. But, in view of the fact that she is an orphan, and very small for her age, we think it best to refer the matter to the Department. From your letter, we would judge that the home conditions of Mr. Denny are not suitable.\n\nBy April 1st, we hope to furnish you with a list of those from your district who ordinarily would be discharged this year. This will give you time to look over the situation for each individual, and let us know whether they should be discharged or not. It would be a help to both of us if we also make a list of those going home for vacation, but who would be expected back to school by September 1st.\n\nIf you have any children there, whom you think should be here, will you please let us know not later than mid-summer.\n\nHoping you are making good progress, and that we shall have the pleasure of meeting you soon,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Michael, who is in the army, wishes to have his sister, Mary Julia Michael, a pupil of your school, come to live with him (M.R. Denny) and receive his monthly allowance of assigned pay.\n\nPersonally, I am of the opinion that she is better off where she is, as Mr. Denny has a large family living in a small house. However, his request is stated as received, and I would be pleased to have your reply regarding the matter.\n\nThere is a possibility that the matter may be a scheme on the part of either of the three concerned in order to get the assigned pay, so I leave the matter to your own judgment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSIGNED - J.A.

She has here a younger sister, and two brothers.\n\nThis girl was one of a group whose parents were drowned while crossing a lake. The children were placed among neighbors and relatives for some time. This did not work out very well, because when they came here, they were in very poor condition. Whether this Mr. Denny would do better is a question.\n\nWill you please let us know what you want done about the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I discussed the letter with them in a general way but did not have an opportunity to review specific cases. I feel certain that both of them are anxious to co-operate with you, and I suggest, if there is any doubt regarding home conditions or the best arrangements to make, that you communicate with the agent concerned. You know Mr. Rice, at Shubenacadie, of course, and the other agent is Mr. J. A. MacLean, Eskasoni. The new agent for Prince Edward Island is James F. Daly, Charlottetown.\n\nWith the above in mind, the Department approves the discharge of pupils numbered 116, 125, 130, 158, 0103, 0116, 0136, 0189 and 0190.\n\nI am pleased to note that James Prosper, No. 69, expects to complete his high school Grade XI at the end of June and intends to join the Armed Forces. He may remain at the school until he officially joins the Armed Services.\n\nFrom the information contained in your letter, I feel that you wish to retain pupils numbered 085, 0127, 0117 and 0155. This permission is granted, but if at any time during the year you feel you can place any or all of these girls to their own advantage, the Department will be prepared to allow their discharge.\n\nIt is noted that you have written Indian Agent Whalen regarding Lillian Polchis, No. 0182.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

She is in Maine, U.S.A., at present, but is liable to return at any time and I would strongly recommend that, if she return, she be sent to Shubenacadie. She is only thirteen, but is quite tough, as you know. Her mother is irresponsible and not only allows Joyce to run the streets and roads at night and sleep until noon, but rather encourages it.\n\nAs I feel the girl needs supervision and I have done everything possible, I shall be glad if you will take this up with the Department for her sake, as well as the example to the other children.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRegina McElligott.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Canada.\n\nThe above named girl who is an illegitimate child of Mrs. William Meuse, would not go to school and was very saucy with the teacher. When her mother, who always backs her, received a warning regarding this girl's truancy, she had the grandmother, who resides in Maine, take the girl to her place. Last week the mother and father also moved to Maine, therefore I do not expect Joyce to return for sometime, however if she does, and gives us trouble, I would recommend that she be sent to Shubenacadie for her own good as well as an example to the others.\n\nEdward J.

A word from you would help a lot.\n\nAgent Rice interviewed Mr. and Mrs. Knockwood, parents of No. 195 Noel Knockwood. Among other things, he was told by Mr. Knockwood that no one was going to tell him what he was to do with his children. The mother brought back the two girls, Imbell and Rosie, but the father says that the boy can go to the day school, on the Reserve, and, in fact, he has already been at the day school. We are of the opinion that the teacher there, knowing that this boy was registered here, should not have accepted him, without a discharge from the Residential School.\n\nA few days ago we received a list of names from Agent MacLean, thirty-two in all. Application for eight have already been made to the Department. However, in talking to Miss Gallagher, teacher of the Indian School at Sydney, she said that she had recommended thirteen of those thirty-two names, but, on learning of conditions here, she would say that six of the thirteen should come here, if possible.\n\nAgain, the Island, P.E.I., are up to their old tricks. Half-past one, on the afternoon of September 1st, we had a telephone call from Agent Daley, that seven were on the way. He could not hear a word that I was saying, so he said, but I don't believe he wanted to hear anything. A Quarter of twelve that night, these seven new ones arrived with those coming back from vacation. We hope that you have the applications for them, but we doubt it.\n\nAs our Quota has been reduced to 148, we do not, under present conditions, feel like taking many more than that number. However, we will look things over, and recommend as many as possible of those on Mr. MacLean's list.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

With reference to pupils 138, 215, 0176 and 0203, they should retain their old numbers. As requested, the Indian Agents concerned are being written regarding pupils who have not returned. As you state, the teacher at the Shubenacadie Day School should not have registered Noel Knockwood.\n\nRegarding the 32 applications received from J.A. MacLean, he is being informed that you will advise him how many of the children you are prepared to accept. You might let me know later the names of those whom you accept.\n\nI am also writing the Indian Agent at Prince Edward Island again, pointing out to him that children should not be sent to the Shubenacadie School from that agency unless he has previously forwarded the applications to this office and received approval.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J.F. Mackey,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 13, 1943.\n\nMr. J.A. MacLean, Indian Agent, Eskasoni Chapel, N.S.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, enclosing applications for the admission of 24 children to the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School. I visited this school recently and found that, owing to many demands for admission, it will not be possible to accept all the children whose applications you forwarded. I am advising Rev. J.P. Mackey, the Principal, to communicate with you and advise how many of the number mentioned he can accept. It will probably be about 8. In that event you should select those whose home conditions are unsuitable, or who are not residing close to an Indian day school.\n\nPeter J. Gould, No. 136, and Eva Morris, No. 0187, who were allowed home on leave, have not yet been returned to the school. Accommodation is being reserved for these two children and they should be returned immediately. If they are not physically fit, you should advise Father Mackey, in order that he may allot their accommodation to other applicants.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 13, 1943.\n\nMr. J.E. Daly, Indian Agent, Charlottetown, P.E.I.\n\nI understand that you recently sent seven children to the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School without first forwarding their applications for our consideration and without being advised that accommodation was available for them. It is difficult for the Department to understand why you have overlooked specific instructions given to you regarding the admission of children to Shubenacadie. Please forward the usual forms for our consideration and at the same time you should definitely note that in future no children should be sent to the Shubenacadie School from Prince Edward Island unless you have submitted the applications to this office and you have received formal permission for their admission to the school.\n\nEva Tuplin, No. 0131, Olive Tuplin, No. 0149, Denzil Feehan, No. 156, Roland Peters, No. 229 and Leo Peters, No. 193, who were allowed home on leave, had not returned to the school on September 7, on which date I was at the school. You should arrange for their return immediately but, if they are not physically fit or you do not consider it advisable to return them for some other reason, you should advise this office at once.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\u2014\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Shubenacadie Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Department of Indian Affairs may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child: None\nEnglish name: Hilda Copage\nAge: 11\nName of Band: Cambridge\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid:\nFather's full name and No.: John Copage\nMother's full name and No.: Mary Peters\nParents living or dead: Living\nState of child's health: Good\nReligion: Catholic\nDoes applicant speak English?: Yes\nPreviously attended: No school for \u2014 years\n\nNote\u2014If mother or guardian signs, agent must forward full explanatory note.\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parents or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\nSignature of Missionary or other Witness\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nNOTE\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

One of two children, Mary Ann Sebattis, Age 8 and her sister Rose Marie, Age 6.\n\nThese children were borne on the Oromocto Reserve, to Mr & Mrs Louis Sebattis.\n\nOn August 6, 1941 Louis Sebattis died, and on April 11, 1942 his widow married Albert Herbert McCoy, a white man on the Killarney Road, about two miles from F'nton. She took her two children to live with her.\n\nOn Sept 9, 1943 Mrs McCoy, mother of the children, died and their foster father, McCoy, does not wish to look after the children. He says he has so many bills to look after that he cannot keep house and is obliged to go to the woods to work. He also said that the children are Indians and he feels they should be looked after by the Indian Affairs Branch where they would be with their own.\n\nI told Mr McCoy it was rather a strange case and I would have to take it up with the Department before I could take any steps, but I would write to them and let him know as soon as I had a reply.\n\nIf these children are to be looked after by the Department I would recommend that they be placed in the Residential School at Shubenacadie as the Mc Coys are of a very low class and I would like to get the children away from them if we were to look after their welfare.\n\nWould you please advise the Departments wishes at an early date.\n\nEdward J.

Dr. Moore has been in communication with the Indian Agent and has not succeeded at this date in securing an Indian who would be willing to provide this boy with board and lodging. As a matter of fact so many of our Indians are gainfully employed that they are not willing, for the time being at least, to assume such responsibilities.\n\nIn addition to the case of Joseph Johnston, we are in receipt of a letter from the Indian Agent at Fredericton, in which he states that Mary Ann Sebattis, age 5, and her sister, Rose Marie, age 6, are urgently in need of institutional care. The Agent in his letter states:\n\n\"On August 8, 1941, Louis Sebattis died and on April 11, 1942, his widow married Albert Herbert McCoy, a white man on the Killarney Road about two miles from Fredericton. She took her two children to live with her. On September 9, 1943, Mrs. McCoy, mother\n\nRev. J.P. Mackey,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nof the children, died and their foster father, McCoy, does not wish to look after the children. He has stated that the children are Indians and he feels they should be looked after by the Indian Affairs Branch.\"\n\nI am of the opinion that these orphan children have a peculiar claim upon the Department and I have been wondering if it would not be possible to make provision for these three children at Shubenacadie, even though you had to discharge three of the senior pupils. I am communicating with you by air mail and would appreciate an immediate reply. We are making provision for the board and lodging of Joseph Johnston in Montreal until we hear from you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

This morning we received your telegram stating that you would accept the three children.\n\nIn the interval Dr. Moore has made arrangements for the maintenance of Joseph Johnston and it will not be necessary to send him to school at the present time. We are advising Indian Agent Whalen at Fredericton to have the two Sebattis children sent to Shubenacadie.\n\nI desire to take this opportunity of thanking you for co-operating with us in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Whalen, Indian Agent, Fredericton, N.B.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th instant, arrangements have now been made to have Mary Ann Sebattis and Rose Marie Sebattis admitted to the Shubenacadie Residential School. You should have them medically examined and the usual application forms and certificates of health forwarded to this office. I believe you should accompany the children at least as far as Saint John and to the school if you consider this necessary. Payment of the transportation costs will be made on receipt from you of the usual voucher.

He in turn became very nasty about it, so much so, that during the year the mother had a nervous breakdown.

It is the second time this year that he has been involved in the same kind of thing. Previous to this, he made a key to fit all the doors, got up during the night, and visited the storerooms. He made a second key, unlocked the dormitory and outside doors, took the two younger boys with him, as well as a supply of food and blankets, and was missed at five A.M. We immediately notified Mr. Rice and the R.C.M.P. and they were able to pick up William Copage on Saturday, in Antigonish, and Harry Sark Sunday, in Mulgrave. Today, John Thomas is back again at the school, having been located at Antigonish. After talking the matter over with Mr. Rice, we decided that the best place for this boy is Saint Patrick's Home, in Halifax, and we are sending him there tomorrow morning. We hope that this action will meet with your approval.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP.S. Since writing the above, John Thomas made another getaway. We planned on having him locked up with the R.C.M.P. tonight, and in the meantime, had him locked in the dormitory, on the top floor. He managed to get out the window by means of the fire hose, and at the present time, Mr. Rice, the R.C.M.P., and all concerned are scouring the neighborhood for him. This time he was missed within ten minutes, but it is after dark.\nOttawa,\nNovember 29, 1943.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, in which you report regarding the truancy of pupils 147, 154 and 196.

Unless\nhome conditions are extremely bad, I suggest that\nthese children remain at home until the end of\nthe current academic year. If, at that time,\nyou consider the children should have institutional\ncare for the academic year 1944-45, you should\nwrite to me early in July, forwarding the usual\napplication forms for our consideration. If you\nrecommend the admission of the children to the\nShubenacadie School, there is no doubt we can\narrange it at that time.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Mr. Whalen:\n\nI have been thinking a great deal about Robt Paul's family and feel that something should be done about the two younger children, Hubert 9 and Joan 11. The example in that house with Mildred and her companions is not good and seems to be encouraged by the father; and the younger ones seem to be neglected.\n\nI feel sorry for Bobby; he works very hard and is very fond of his children; but the future of these little ones should be considered, and I would recommend that they be sent away for a few years or until they are better able to look out for themselves.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRegina McEllegott,\nTeacher.\nOttawa,\nMarch 30, 1946.\n\nMr. H.C. Rice, Indian Agent, Shubenacadie, N.S.\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, regarding the children of Mrs. Duncan Labrador. In the event of the children being turned over to the Children's Aid Society the Department approves the admission of the three oldest to the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School. We also approve making arrangements for the youngest child to be placed in the Home of the Guardian Angel, Halifax.\n\nWhen the three children are placed in the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School there will be no need to worry about the dependents' allowance for them, as the Dependents' Allowance Board does not make any payments for Indian children when they are being maintained in an Indian residential school to which the Department pays per capita grant. However, I cannot see any reason why the dependents' allowance could not be used for the maintenance of the youngest child, either in a home on the reserve or in the orphanage mentioned above.\n\nHowever, that particular phase of the matter would have to be straightened out with the Dependents' Allowance Board. You may advise me later exactly what action has been taken in this matter.\n\nI am returning the report as requested.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, April 17, 1944.\n\nMr. H. C.

McIntosh) Insp.\nComm'g Yarmouth Sub/Div'n\nChildren of Mrs. Stephen BARTLETT,\nYarmouth Indian Reservation.\n(Ass't. to Dept. of Mines & Resources.)\n\n1. With reference to the above heading and correspondence received from the R.C.M.P., under date of 21-3-44, with copy of letter attached from Mr. H.O. Indian Agent at Shubenacadie, N.S., acting on instructions the writer interviewed Dr. J. Wilson of Yarmouth, N.S., in connection with this case. He having corresponded with Dr. Wilson in this case, it was learned from Dr. Wilson that no charges had been preferred against Mrs. Bartlett and that she had refused to sign forms No. 1-A 466 R 924 which had been filled in by Dr. Wilson in connection with the two Bartlett children, namely, Dorothy & Ann Pauline.\n\n2. Mrs. Bartlett was also interviewed by the writer and stated that she did not want the children taken to Shubenacadie School. That they were getting on well at home, were well clothed and fed and were attending school regularly. She stated that she had work in the town of Yarmouth, N.S., (house cleaning and mending) Mrs. Charles ROBERTS of Cliff St., Mrs. Charles MILL also of Cliff St., and a Mrs. Collburne as people she worked for. Mrs. Bartlett's husband has been away for about a year and since that time it is understood she has associated to some extent with members of the Armed Services stationed at Yarmouth, N.S. There has in the past been a number of these service men seen at her home and believed to have spent the nights there.\n\n3. A check was made at Arcadia School at which point the children in question are supposed to attend. Mrs. Mary LYNN (Teacher of the Primary Dept.) advised the writer that these children have not been giving good attendance, claiming that they did not have clothes. This was reported to the Attendance Dept., Education Branch and clothing was obtained for the children, however this had not improved their attendance and she gave the following from the register of her school:\n   Dorothy BARTLETT - Sept. 3 days; Oct. 3 days; Nov. 3 days; Dec. 3 days; Jan. 4 days; Feb. 6 days and March 13 days.\n   Pauline BARTLETT - Sept. 2\u00bd days; Oct. 1 day; Nov. 1 day; Dec. 1 day; Jan. 1 day; Mar. 7 days. This was not in keeping with other children from this Reservation who attend the same school. Mrs. Bartlett had told that she intended moving to Ictou, but this had not happened. The attendance of these children had been reported to the Department of Education on various occasions.\n\n4. In the late P.M. of 1-4-44, the writer called at the Bartlett Home, but there was no one at home, however inquiries revealed that Mrs. Bartlett was in Yarmouth Town while the children were at a neighbouring house on the Reservation. Again on the late P.M. of 2-4-44, I again called and on this occasion Mrs. Bartlett and the children were at home. The only male occupant being an Elderly Indian (Henry BARTLETT).

Amitage, Insp.\nAssistant Director,\nCriminal Investigation.\n\nThe Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nEnc.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't. of Mines & Res., Ottawa.\n\nOn or about January 22nd-44 I received a letter from Rev. Fr. Smith, P.P. at Amherst, N.S. in which he reported to me some alleged mistreatment of a 12 year old Indian child. This child, Rita Bernard, was staying with her elder brother William Bernard at Oxford Jct., Cumb. Co., N.S. Her parents were both dead and the family were scattered. His information came from the wife of the Chief of this band and he asked me to investigate.\n\nI arranged with Rev. Fr. Brown for her admittance to the Residential School and sent Wm. Bernard the necessary form to have completed. He declined to send her at the time. On April 25th I received another letter from a merchant, Mrs Rogers of Oxford Jct. written on behalf of Rita, and, at her request, In this letter Rita complained of being mistreated, overworked, kept from school, etc and asked that I come up and take her away. A few days later I received another from Rita herself asking to be taken away from her brother's wife as quickly as possible. In the meantime I had acknowledged Mrs. Roger's letter stating that I would go up on May 3rd to investigate and take whatever action I thought necessary.\n\nOn the 3rd inst. I took with me a member of the R.C.M.P. detachment at Springhill and called on all parties concerned. I met Mrs. Rogers who told me that she believed Rita's story as she was quite familiar with Mrs. Bernard. Rita had been expecting me and expressed a desire to go at once to the Res. School. I went to interview Mrs. Bernard and found her absent picking Mayflowers. I also met with Rita's teacher who stated that she thought the Residential School was the best place for her and in view of all the evidence I left a note for Mrs. Bernard stating that I was taking the child with me to the school in Shubenacadie. The R.C.M.P. concurred with me and consequently I placed Rita in the Res. School on May 3rd.\nI might mention that whenever Mr. & Mrs. Bernard were away from home simultaneously the child was left with an old blind Indian. On one occasion both this couple were arrested for being intoxicated and while serving their time Rita was again left with this old blind man.\n\nIn view of the fact that Rita's older brothers and sisters were not capable of looking after her, the one of them now, Reggie, is serving a 3 mos. jail sentence in Truro, that another, Annabel, is an immoral young woman working in and around Halifax, I consider that the school is the only satisfactory environment for this child, for the next four or five years.\n\nH.

White, Sussex, New Brunswick, recommending the discharge of Teresa Ginnish from the Shubenacadie Residential School. He states that her mother, Mrs. Isobel Ginnish, formerly of Bel Ground, is now residing at Dunsinane, Kings County. The girl is only 15 years of age and ordinarily should remain in the Shubenacadie School for another year. However, if you think that the mother is able to provide properly for the girl you should write to the Principal of the Shubenacadie School, Reverend J.W. Brown, requesting that she be sent home at the end of June.

In view of the information contained in your letter the Department feels that this girl should remain in the school.\n\nThere is a new Principal at Shubenacadie and it is just possible that if the mother writes direct to him the discharge might be allowed before we were consulted. I, therefore, suggest that you write the Principal, Reverend J.W. Brown, and advise him that this girl is not to be discharged this year.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDuring the last week of April the R.C.M.P. took action against Mrs. Stephen Bartlett an Indian of Yarmouth band. This did not go to court but resulted in her two minor children being escorted to the Residential school on the first day of May. I later requested the assistance of this force to remove from the Yarmouth reservation an unwanted trespasser who reputedly held a liquor permit and was bringing intoxicants on the reserve. He left the reserve before their arrival but they are watching for his return. I went personally to Cumberland County and took a child, who was being abused by her guardians, back with me to the Residential school. In the past month there was only one conviction to my knowledge and the Indian concerned paid a ten dollar fine for assault. Luckily this case was tried in a police court in Halifax where it was not known that the accused was under a one years suspended sentence for the same offence.\n\nH.C.

We did not include her in with the list of those eligible for discharge this year, but we find that in looking over our files, we mentioned her last year, and received permission to keep her. We should have mentioned her this year.\n\nPerhaps you recall the case. Father Mackey called this girl over, and you spoke to her on your visit to the school last year. The Department gave permission a few years ago for this girl to go to Montreal for an operation, but the girl herself did not want it. She was taking fits, similar to epileptic fits, and if she were discharged from the school, would not be able to support herself, and the Department would have had to find a home, and pay her board.\n\nHowever, in view of the fact that she has not taken one of these turns for over a year now, perhaps the Department wishes her discharge. If so, we shall try to get in touch with her relatives. She has no parents, but has an Aunt, in Red Bank, N.B.\n\nPlease let us know what you wish done in this case.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nREVEREND J.W.

It is noted that all these children come from reserves where day schools are located.

With regard to the others we would like to know if there are any special reasons why these children should receive institutional care.

I knew this family would require attention, but I had been trying to keep the father interested in his children and encourage him to look after them. I knew they were not getting 100% care, but I don't think things were as bad as they appear in the letter. The family received an allowance monthly, and the father worked quite regularly with Mr. Bridges of Majerville, a market gardener.\n\nHe had worked there for a number of years and came home nights. This past year, however, he stayed away a lot and was boarding in a camp with a George Nash, a half-breed who worked for the same man. The two got drinking, according to Mr. Bridges and became no good, so he discharged them. Since that time, Sylvester Sabattis had been slipping and lost interest in his home and children.\n\nI stopped his allowance August 1st, and gave the girl, age 9, to John S. Paul to look after at $2.00 a week, and the boy, age 4, to John M. Paul at $2.00 a week. The oldest girl was away staying with her uncle, William Meuse, and the two boys I left with the father. I was in hopes he would straighten up and ask for the children and his allowance again, but he has now gone to Maine and left them behind.\n\nI feel the best place for the three children, Harry, Stephen and Lillian, is Shubenacadie School, and to that end, I have had them examined and am forwarding application forms for their admission, should room be available at the school.\n\np.t.e.\nAs stated above, the father is away in Maine and cannot be contacted to sign the application forms. However, according to Miss Delaney's letter, he is willing for them to go.\n\nI am now boarding these children at $2.00 a week in Indian homes, and would ask for authority to leave Jesse Robert, age 4, at John M. Paul's, as he is too young to go to Shubenacadie, rate - $2.00 weekly in groceries, and clothing periodically.\n\nEdward J. Whalen,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 12, 1944.\n\nMr. Edward J.

Whalen, Indian Agent, Fredericton, N.B.\n\nIn my letter of the 19th instant I informed you that we had no record of the application forms for the admission of the Lafferty children to the Shubenacadie Residential School. In conversation with Doctor Falconer this morning I find that the application forms for Harold and Henry reached the office but were placed on the medical file. I was at the Shubenacadie School about ten days ago and at that time they appeared to have their full quota of pupils. However, I am writing to the Principal today advising him that we feel that these two boys should receive institutional care and suggesting to him that even though they have their full quota the boys be accepted as supernumerary pupils. I suggest that you also write to the Principal and he will give you his decision. If the boys could not be placed in the Shubenacadie School is there any white institution in which accommodation could be secured for them.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 20, 1944.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of applications for the admission of Harold and Henry Lafferty of Kings County, New Brunswick, to the Shubenacadie School. These two boys require institutional care at the earliest possible date. I remember that you were under the impression that you had your full quota of pupils. However, as this is such a deserving case I thought it advisable to bring the matter to your attention and I trust that you will be able to provide accommodation for them. If necessary we will allow supernumerary grant for these two boys. I am suggesting to the Indian Agent, Mr. E.J. Whelan, Fredericton, New Brunswick, that he communicate with you and, if you accept these boys, you should advise Mr. Whelan so that he can bring them to the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

No applications were forwarded for the other children as John and Elizabeth were too young and the blood test of the other one, Mary, was positive.\n\nIt would appear from the file numbers shown that you have two files on the correspondence of these children and it might be possible that the applications were put on the other file.\n\nI am forwarding copies of the applications which were sent on September 15th. and trust they will fill the requirements as new application forms are hard to get.\n\nEdward J.

Labrador - 9 yrs\nVirginia - 6 yrs\nKatherine - 6 yrs\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYou will notice Stephen Sabattis, Age 12, is not mentioned as one of the children taken to Shubenacadie, October 2nd, although he was to have gone.\n\nThis boy, also his sister Lillian, went to Maine with an Indian family September 19th as they did not want to go to the residential school. When I heard this I made inquiries as to where they went and learned they were in Hodgson, Maine. On September 22nd I went to Hodgson and got these two children. I warned them to stay on the Creemecte Reserve as I expected word to take them at any time and I wanted them handy when the time came to go. Lillian remained as instructed but Stephen broke into his uncle's house stole a bicycle and left the Reserve September 27th. This was not reported to me until Sept 30th, when I immediately notified the R.C.M.P. Police. As Stephen was not located on October 2nd and I had planned on taking the children that day I took the other four.\n\nI learned this morning that Stephen Sabattis is at Gagetown with his aunt Mrs Jim Nash. Mr Nash told me he was willing to take the boy and try to do something with him as he had been neglected by the father. Nash told me he has settled for the bicycle that had been stolen and if I was willing he would send the boy to school. I told him I was quite willing but would report the case to Ottawa.\n\nTom Nash is a halfbreed and has been living around Gagetown for a great many years. He has no status as an Indian but seems to be quite prosperous and I think if he can manage this boy, will give him a good home.\n\nMay I have your comments please.\n\nEdward J. Whalen,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 12, 1944.\n\nMr. Edward J. Whalen, Indian Agent, Fredericton, N. B.\n\nRe: Stephen Sabattis.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of October 9 and have noted with interest the information contained therein.\n\nIt would appear that this boy has a good home for the time being and the inclination of the Department at the moment is not to disturb him. This boy, in our judgment, however, will require careful watching, and you should receive from time to time a report on his attendance at school and his general conduct. Should he show a tendency toward waywardness at any time, he should be sent either to the Shubenacadie Residential School or to a correctional institution.\n\nR. A. Hosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nOn October 2nd., accompanied by my wife as a matron, I left by car, for Shubenacadie to take Lillian and Harry Sabbatis, Cremecto reserve also Harold and Henry Lafferty of Fairvale Station to the Indian Residential School.\n\nI had sent word to the Lafferty family, Mrs Lafferty, to have her children ready and at the Post Office - Fairvale Station. When I arrived at this place there was no sign of the Lafferty children and I was obliged to go to their camp about 1\u00bd miles in the woods. On my arrival I found Mrs Lafferty washing the clothes the children were to wear. This delay caused us to have to stop all night on the way. (Derchester N.B.)\n\nOn the morning of October 3rd before we arrived at Truro, N.S. I had a blow out which ruined one of my synthetic tires and I was obliged to purchase a new one. The time spent in getting authority to buy this tire delayed us so much that my wife and I were obliged to remain another night on the return trip. (Truro)\n\nWe returned to Fredericton Wednesday evening, October 4th.\n\nExpenses were as follows:\n\nOct 2nd. To 4 Lunches. Tims Lunch Saint John $40\u00a2 $1.60\n6 Suppers Blue Bird Rest. Moncton $50\u00a2 3.00\n\n3rd To Rooms & B for 6, Miltons Camps, Derchester 7.40\nTo 6 Dinners Sullivans Rest. Truro $50\u00a2 3.00\n\n4th. To room, Mrs A.

As usual I requested the assistance of the R.C.M.P., which resulted in five arrests on liquor charges. Convictions were obtained in all but the sentences were almost the minimum in every case. On Shubenacadie reserve we had a case of assault in which the accused was found guilty and fined $7.00, I think, with costs. In Queens County the Children's Aid Soc'y re-opened a case against an Indian woman, the wife of a soldier overseas and the mother of four children. They were given custody of the children and promptly passed them over to me. As arranged with your office previously the three eldest, of school age, were placed in the Residential School and the youngest placed in the Home of the Guardian Angel, an orphanage in Halifax.

(Asst. to Indian Dept.)\n\n1. At 8:30 A.M., this date, Father Brown, Supt., of the Shubenacadie Indian School telephoned to the effect that four of his Indian boys had escaped from the Institution during the night, and that a checkup has failed to reveal their whereabouts. He and the Indian Agent, Mr. C. Rice, requested our assistance.\n\n2. These Indian boys are described as follows:\n   (1) Peter SAPPIER, mother residing at the Caribou Indian Reserve in Maine. Age 14 yrs, very fair, tall & slim. Heavy black shoes, blue bib overalls, black jackets, light cotton shirt. Fur lined cloth caps with ear flaps.\n   (2) John Gilbert JULIEN, parents at Bayfield, N.S. Very dark skin, very sore eyes. Two front upper teeth missing. Age 14 yrs, black hair, short & stocky. Dressed as SAPPIER.\n   (3) Preston COPAGE, father at Shubenacadie Indian Reserve. Age 14 yrs, auburn hair, pug nose, short & stocky. Companion to SAPPIER and may go with him to Cambridge, N.S. Dressed same.\n   (4) Ruddie KNOCKWOOD, family at Pictou Landing, N.S. Age 13 yrs, fair, blue eyes, very long thin and narrow face. Short and slim build. Dressed same as SAPPIER.\n\n3. Enquiries made revealed that these boys had been at the Railway Station at Stewiacke, N.S., during the early hours of the morning, and not seen again. It is assumed that they secured a ride on a freight going through, either to Halifax or in the direction of Truro, N.S.\n\n4. The Truro and New Glasgow Detachments were advised by telephone to be on the lookout for these Indian boys.\n\n5. A few hours after receipt of this complaint, a telephone call was received by the Indian Agent from Mr. Wallace of Wolfville, N.S., to the effect that he was holding three Indian boys who refuse to give their names and whom he suspects are from the Shubenacadie Indian School. Further enquiries made by the Indian Agent and Fr. Brown identified these three Indian boys to be SAPPIER, JULIEN and COPAGE. They were subsequently returned to the School by the Indian Agent.\n\n6. Ruddie KNOCKWOOD is still at large and believed to be at or around his home in the Pictou Landing district. This boy did not take the same train as the other three, who took a freight to Halifax and then the D.A.R. out, and enroute to Cambridge were held aboard the train by the Conductor who handed them over to the Wolfville Town Police.\n\n7. In view of the above, it is requested that enquiries be made in the Pictou Landing district by the Detachment concerned.\n\n8. Extra copies attached.\n\n9.

Apparently the information given to the police was that the boy came from the vicinity of Pictou Landing. On making inquiries they ascertained that he only remained at Pictou Landing for a day and then proceeded, with his older brother Albert, to Portland, Maine, where his father, Joseph Knockwood, is employed in the shipyards. Subsequently it was learned that Knockwood had relatives living at Lennox Island. The police made inquiries there and were very definitely informed that he was not on the Lennox Island Reserve.\n\nI thought you would like to have the above information, as you may not receive copies of the police report.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

When you obtain the information you desire, it would be appreciated if you would return the form to this office.\n\nMr. Hoey and I have discussed this case today, and it is quite similar to several cases we have had at other Indian residential schools throughout Canada within the last few months. We have been adopting the attitude that unless the circumstances are very exceptional there is not much advantage in going to a great deal of expense in returning boys of this age who have truanted. It is very unlikely that they would be satisfied if they were brought back, and if this supposition is correct they would be a constant source of trouble to the school staff and, in addition would have a bad effect on general discipline. This applies particularly where the boy has gone out of the country. In the present case, as stated in my letter of the 4th instant, our information is to the effect that the father is working in the State of Maine. It is presumed that he is able to keep the boy and I do not feel that there is any particular advantage in spending considerable funds in returning him to Shubenacadie at the present time. As you know, the R.C.M. Police are extremely co-operative with us, but the expense they incur in returning truant pupils is a charge against this Branch.\n\nIf the boy returns to Canada within the\n\nReverend J. W. Brown,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N. S.\n\np.t.o.\nnext few months and is residing on his home reserve, then action should be taken to return him to the school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\nShubenacadie, N.S., January 16, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nSometime during the night of Friday, November 24th, 1944, four youths ran away from the Residential School. Three were picked up shortly in Wolfville, N.S., and the fourth, Roddie MacLeod of Pictou Landing, N.S., remained at large, whereabouts unknown. The RCMP Police have been looking for this boy and recently Mr. Brown was advised that he was picked up by the police in the city of Portland, Maine, U.S.A., and placed in some parochial school there.\n\nThe Principal of the School, Rev. Mr. Brown, considers this boy to be the ring-leader and chiefly responsible for the run-away incident. He feels that he should be brought back to the School. Before leaving he broke into the store-room and stole numerous articles. Mr. Brown's opinion is that he should be made to come back for the principle of the thing at least for a time and if necessary he could be placed in St. Patrick's Home, a boy's reformatory operated by the Christian Brother's, in Halifax, N.S.\n\nHis suggestion is that I go to Portland, at his expense and personally escort the boy back. I am willing to do this and he suggested that since the week of Jan 22nd is most suitable for all concerned I should proceed there then.\n\nI would be away for about three days and all expenses incurred would be taken care of by the Principal. Please advise, airmail, if this action on my part would meet with your approval.\n\nH. C. Rice,\nIndian Agent.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, January 19, 1945.\n\nMr. H. C. Rice, Indian Agent, Shubenacadie, N. S.\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 16th instant, I am enclosing copy of a letter sent to Reverend Father Brown, dated January 17. This letter is self-explanatory, as you will notice. There is but one point in favour of bringing this boy back and that would be on the plea that the example given might be conducive to the delinquency of others. However, I believe that the disadvantages greatly outweigh this point. The possibility of that example can be obviated by certain steps and instructions to the other pupils in the school. Therefore, I do not think it is advisable for you to take this trouble and for the school to incur this expense.\n\nEncl.\n\nActing Director.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\u2014I hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Shubenacadie Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child: Roddie Knockwood\nEnglish name:\nAge: 7\nName of Band: Micmac\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid:\nFather's full name and No:\nMother's full name and No:\nParents living or dead:\nState of child's health:\nReligion:\nDoes applicant speak English?\nPreviously attended: Indian Board School school for 1 year\n\n(Signature of father)\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\nSignature of Missionary or other Witness\n\nNote\u2014If mother or guardian signs, agent must forward full explanatory note.\n\nI recommend the admission of the above child, who is of good moral character and is eligible to be admitted as a grant-earning pupil.\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nNote\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

I understand that the boy would still want to get away, and might not be satisfied here. Since he is not returned, I think others will try in the Spring.\n\nHowever, since your decision is at hand, that closes Roderick's case, unless we hear of his returning to Pictou Landing.

In addition to this information Father BROWN stated that he had the address of this subject's father in Portland and that the location of Ruddie KNOCKWOOD would not present a very difficult problem provided assistance was given him by the American authorities.

It is believed that she was attempting to make her way to Truro and then to Pistou Landing, her former home.\n\nFather Brown is of the opinion that this escape was pre-arranged and that possibly some one with a car was to wait at some point, as it has since been learned that the father, Joseph Knockwood, Portland, Maine, has been endeavouring to get his family together into Maine.

J. W. Brown, notified the R.C.M.P., myself and then requested the railway police to be on the look-out for her. Nothing further was heard of this girl and it looked as if this runaway had been well planned as she seemed to disappear altogether.\n\nFour days later word was received that there was an Indian girl hiding in a small white settlement between Shubenacadie and Stewiacke, no more than 3 miles from the School. The R.C.M.P. investigated and picked up the girl returning her to the school.\n\nThe girl is a sister of Roddie Knockwood the boy who made a recent escape and joined his family in Maine. (Your file 51-0-10, letter dated Jan 19-45) An older brother also caused similar trouble when in attendance. The Principal thought, and I concur, that disciplinary action should be taken in this case to act as a deterrent should any other similar plans be in the making and the girl was taken to the Good Shepherd Reformatory for a time.

The boy has been neglected all through life and is consequently showing the results of same.\n\nOn February 10th., Dr. Myers of Moncton telephoned me that this boy was at his office, destitute, suffering from scabies. He had been living with an immigrant family at Salisbury for the last three weeks. The doctor told me that he had arranged with the police in Moncton to give him protection that night. I then called the police and asked them to keep him over Sunday.\n\nOn Monday morning I called Father Brown at Shubenacadie, and he agreed to take him in if I would receive your authority. I then went to Moncton and when I got there I found, through the Mounted Police, that the boy had stolen a number of articles from the family with whom he had been living. Those goods to a great part were still in his possession, and were turned over to Constable Bryenton of the Moncton detachment R.C.M.P. As it was getting well on into the afternoon when I was through with the Police, I started for Shubenacadie with the boy, stopping over night at Truro and delivering the boy to Shubenacadie School on Tuesday morning Feb. 13th.,\n\nI am enclosing application for admission re this boy for your approval. You will note that it is signed only by myself, as the whereabouts of the father and mother are unknown at the present time.\n\nIn reference to this case, I am forwarding shortly,\na bill from the Moncton Police Department for 3 meals amounting to $1.20 and a bill from Mrs. Maclean of Salisbury for the amount of $20.00 for board for this boy while he was at her home.\n\nI shall not forward these bills until I have authority covering same from your Department.\n\nIt was my pleasure, while at Shubenacadie, to inspect briefly the institution, and I feel that a great deal of good work is being accomplished there. I would like to see, at some later date, this the largest agency in N.B. being afforded an opportunity of having more of our destitute Indians admitted to this school, than we are now being allowed.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 5, 1945.\n\nMr. A.

He gave a description of the girl and requested that some assistance be given by this detachment in locating her. This was immediately done, patrol being made to Pictou Landing Indian Reservation, as far as could be made by car, then on foot.\n\nThe complete reserve was covered this date by Cst. Drayton and the writer, but at none of the homes could any information be gained in regard to the girl, all stating that they knew her but that they had not seen her. She has two sisters living on the reservation, namely Mrs. John Henry RAPPEL and Mrs. Rod MCKENZIE. These women stated that if she should come to the reservation they would send her back, but this of course is very unlikely as the Indians here are not at all truthful.\n\nAnother sister of Hazel HOCKWOOD, Mrs. Martin FRANCIS lives just out of Trenton, N.S., and patrol was also made there but without result. A few Indian families who live in the \"Pre Pub\" district of New Glasgow were visited, and one man especially, Mr. WILSON who is considered to be fairly truthful stated that if he heard any word of her he would immediately call his office.\n\nOn this date patrol was again made to Pictou Landing and all of the places already mentioned above were again visited. No news of the girl was obtained however, so the families in Trenton and New Glasgow were visited a second time, but also without results. It is now thought that this girl did not come to this district or some word would undoubtedly have come to light. In view of this then, one copy of report is being forwarded direct to Shubenacadie Detachment, and unless otherwise instructed the file will be considered closed at this point.\n\nCONCLUDED.

This date, on receipt of information from the East Shubenacadie District to the effect that a young Indian girl was staying at the home of one Mrs. Calvin Nose, a neighbor, who could not advise us of her name but the description tallied closely with that of the above named. A check-up was immediately made with the result that the above named was located and returned to the Indian School and handed over to the Authorities in charge.\n\nThe residence of Mrs. Nose is about three miles from the Indian School, and Mrs Nose advises that this girl arrived at her house shortly after 10:00 P.M. of the 17-2-45. The girl asked for a drink of water and stated that she was on her way to Truro. Mrs. Nose asked her in for the night and that it would be far better to continue her trip in the morning. The following morning she learned from the girl that she had escaped from the School and was on her way to join her father in Maine, U.S.A. This girl being of a very timid disposition was persuaded to remain by Mrs Nose until found by the School Authorities or by the Police. However, Mrs Nose made no effort herself to notify the proper authorities of this Indian girls whereabouts after having knowledge of her escape.\n\nAfter handing this girl over to the School Authorities, Fr. Brown was advised of the above and that Mrs Nose apparently harboured this girl or at least made no effort to advise of her whereabouts. Fr. Brown stated that he desires no further action be taken and expressed his appreciation of having this girl returned as it has a great morale effect on the students.\n\nExtra copy of this report direct to the N.C.O. in Charge, New Glasgow Detachment, for his information.\n\nNo Expenses Incurred.\n\nCONCLUDED - HANDED OVER.\n\nFORWARDED for your information.\n\nHalifax, N.

J.W. Brown, Principal of the Indian Residential School Shubenacadie, N.S., contents of which are self explanatory.\n\nAs you know, Louis Lafforty also his son, Francis Joseph are in the Saint John Tuberculosis hospital. Two of the boys, Harold and Henry were placed in the residential school this Fall. Susan (Mrs. Louis) Lafforty and three of her children, Mary Ann, age 9; Annie Elizabeth, age 5 and John Joseph, age 3, were living near Fairvale Station and receiving help monthly from the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nComplaints were received to the effect that Mrs. Lafforty was going to Saint John often and leaving the small children alone even sometimes all night. I investigated and found this to be true although a Mr. Noel J. Gould was there at the time. He was Mrs. Lafforty's father. I persuaded this man to stay with the family and get wood for them also cover the shack with tar paper and line it inside with sheathing paper. Mr. Gould had agreed to stay all winter and for this I was to give him one adult ration. This was on November 15th. On November 20th I received a call from the Saint John police stating that the C.N.R. police had picked up Mrs. Lafforty and handed her over to them but as she had started to hemorrhage she was placed in the Saint John Gen. hospital. They asked me about the children but I assured them that the children were not alone as I had been there the week previous and hired their grandfather to stay with them. They then told me that it would be some time before Mrs. Lafforty would be able to go home.\n\nI went to Fairvale Station and talked to Mr. Gould who told me he would not manage there alone and asked me to let him go back to his home in Sydney, N.S., stating he was too old to do everything. I went to Bloomfield Station and Plumswell where some Indian families were living but none would take the children to board. I then returned to Hampton and phoned to Rev. F. Brown\nPrincipal of the Shubenacadie Residential School and asked him if he would take the oldest girl. (See letter attached). I made arrangements for her transportation and then brought the two smaller children to Oromocto where I placed them in the home of Mrs. David Paul, an Indian woman who agreed to keep them for $5.00 a week plus a few clothes when needed. The $5.00 to be taken in groceries from F.F. McElroy's Store.\n\nMrs. Lafforty had a miscarriage according to the Police Matron, Saint John, N.B. She was also drunk. This woman had been reporting to the Health Centre weekly for treatment (Venereal)\n\nExtra expenses were as follows.\n\nTelephone call Hampton to Shubenacadie .......... 1.50\nTicket, C.N.R., Rothesay, N.B. to Truro, N.S.

His wife died about five years ago and for the past three years these boys have been in the Resident Indian School at Shubenacadie. A year ago Mr. Brooks says that Mr. Rice, the Indian Agent for that district, advised him that the boys after they had completed this year at school would not be required to return. He now understands that it is the intention to return these boys to the Resident Indian School at the end of the summer holidays.\n\nMr. Brooks having remarried and established a home on the reservation at Shubenacadie in which he has accommodation for these two boys is very anxious to keep them at home with him and allow them to attend the new school being completed on the Reserve.\n\nI am advised that Mr. Brooks is a good provider and is a registered stevedore in Halifax. Also that there is no suggestion that these boys are in need of correction or detention. In view of the above it would seem reasonable that this man should be allowed to maintain these two children in his own home. Would you make inquiries about this matter and advise me if there is any reason why this can not be done.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRichard A. Donahoe\nOttawa, July 30th, 1945.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, with reference to the two children of Benjamin J. Brooks.\n\nI am communicating with the Indian Agent at Shubenacadie and on receipt of his reply you will be further advised.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Richard A. Donahoe,\nBarrister and Solicitor,\nTramway Building,\nHalifax, N.S.\nOttawa, July 30th, 1945.\n\nMr. H.C. Rice, Indian Agent, Shubenacadie, N.S.\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter received from Richard A. Demahoe, Barrister, Halifax, Nova Scotia, with reference to the sons of Benjamin J. Brooks.\n\nIf the information given in the letter is correct it might be advisable to discharge the boys from the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School provided you feel assured that they will regularly attend the day school. Please let me hear from you in regard to this matter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nI wish to refer to your letter dated July 30, 1945, File 5I-D-IO, regarding children of Ben Brooks returning to the Indian Residential School.\n\nI have been advised that four Sisters will be taking over at the new Day School on the Reserve when it opens in September. Therefore I have advised Mr. Brooks that his children can be kept at home and attend the new School.\n\nH. C.

This lad is 10 years old. Further, that this lad had been traced as far as the river about 200 yards away where cast-off clothing belonging to the lad were picked up. The Writer immediately checked the railway station and highway in the immediate vicinity as the lad had less than an hour start. In the meantime Cst. H.R.Babson and P.D. \"Chin\" directed their activities to where footprints of this lad's were discernible along the sand bars of the river shore. The P.D. worked his way along over the railway embankment and towards the main highway of Route No. 2, where the trail and scent was lost. As the only logical way for this lad to have continued his trip was northward on the main highway or in the woods skirting the highway, the Dog Section continued along northward where practical while the Writer advised certain persons further along to be on the look-out for this Indian lad.\n\nThis A.M. Sgt. Rowley of Division Headquarters advised that one Angus FRANCIS (Indian) age 10 years was picked up in Halifax, and on learning that this lad was an escapee from the School at this point, arrangements were made to hold him pending escort by the Indian School. Fr. Brown, Bp., of the Indian School, made the trip to Halifax and returned with this Indian lad to the School.\n\nEnquiries made since reveals that this Indian lad was picked up by a truck enroute to Truro, at a point near the highway river bridge at Shubenacadie and dropped off near the Mill Brook Reserve at Truro. The Train conductor advises the Station Master here that an Indian lad did get on the train at Truro when his back was turned and managed to continue the trip unaffected passed Shubenacadie, and from here on to Halifax, N.S.\n\nFr. Brown advises the Writer that as this lad has escaped from the School twice within a short time, and this School does not lock its doors, FRANCIS will be committed to St. Patrick's Home for Boys at Halifax, N.S., in the near future.\n\nNo Expenses Incurred.\n\nCONCLUDED - HANDED OVER.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You are requested to complete same and forward to Ottawa. Also notify the Regional Director of Family Allowances, Quebec, of this child's attendance at the Residential School, Shubenacadie.\n\nJ. E. Morris,\nWelfare and Training.\nSCHOOL - two-rooms. This is a good building with a bright basement kept in excellent condition. Sister Mary of the Holy Eucharist is in charge, and with the assistance of teaching Sisters the children are orderly and well behaved. As is usual, when visiting schools under their supervision, the children rendered songs. The attendance is good and the Sister reported that there are only two families not making their children attend regularly. She stated that the Family Allowance is certainly having a good effect in this respect.\n\nAgent Arsenault was requested to interview the parents and advise them that their children must attend school regularly and on time. If not the Family Allowance cheques will be administered through the agent's office. All the children appeared to be in good health, well fed, and well dressed.\n\nTwo boys, eleven and twelve, sons of Joseph H. Isaac, have not been attending school. The father reported that his wife has been in the hospital for several years, and as he was unable to obtain the services of a housekeeper it was necessary to keep the boys at home to look after fires. He is receiving Family Allowances for these boys and they should be in school. There is little likelihood of Isaac getting a housekeeper; therefore, the two boys should be sent to the Shubenacadie Residential School.\n\nATTENTION - MR. PHILAN. Father Brown and Sister Superior of the Residential School have been consulted, and they stated that there is room for these two boys. It is recommended that Agent Arsenault be instructed to provide the children with transportation and advise the Family Allowance officials accordingly.\nOttawa, 5th November, 1945.\n\nMr. A.E. Arsenault, Indian Agent,\nRestigouche, Quebec.\n\nI am advised that two boys of Joseph H. Isaac are not attending school.

Father:\n\nReferring to my telegram of March the 16th, regarding the case of Marian and Gertrude Beadle for their admission at your residential school, I wish to secure you some other information concerning the family.\n\nMrs. Beadle (Jennie) was an Indian woman of Pietou Landing, and she came on Restigouche Reserve last fall with her four children.\n\nThey were staying in a very poor house on the Reserve, and as Mrs. Beadle was working in the town of Campbellton for her living, the children were obliged to stay home alone and were not attending school.\n\nWhen Mr. J.E. Morris, of the Welfare Division, Indian Affairs Branch Ottawa, has visited the families, he has realized the situation of the children, and it is why he asked me to take the necessary steps to have the children admitted at your school at once.\n\nI enclose for your information, a declaration signed by the mother, Mrs. Jennie Beadle.\n\nHoping the poor children are now under your supervision and they will appreciate their living condition.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEdgar Arsenault, Agent,\nOttawa, March 22, 1946.\n\nDear Father Brown:\n\nIndian Agent Arsenault has forwarded me a copy of his letter to you dated March 18th, with reference to the Beadle children. I inferred from his letter that the children have already been taken to the Shubenacadie school. If so, the usual application forms and certificates of health should be submitted for our file.\n\nAs the mother is stated to have come from Pictou Landing, you should consult Agent Rice with a view to ascertaining definitely if she and her children are recognized Indians.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

The three returned, but Mr. Rice requested that Sandy remain home, as the father died, and left the mother alone with an older brother, who is a probable patient for the N.S.

According to arrangements made by the Department, through Mr. Fraser, the Indian Agent, for New Brunswick, we are sending this girl to the Sanatorium, in Bathurst, N.B., Monday, March 25th.\n\nWill you please let us know if it is too late for us to put in to the Department, our account, for travel for those who were discharged, or send home for vacation during the summer of 1945?

Mrs. Francis has already taken the girl to the Indian Residential School at Shubenacadie. I sent these forms to Mrs. Francis telling her to take the child to Dr. Martin at Mt. Stewart and have her given a physical examination, and then return the forms to me so I could forward them to Ottawa. In the meantime I asked Father Brown if there was a place for her at the school; he assured me there would be a place when the application was approved by Ottawa. Mrs. Francis called at the office here on her way to N.S.; unfortunately I was out at the Hospital at the time and did not see her. Fr. Brown then returned the application to me.

One form you will note is signed by Mrs Bridget Howe, this is one of her illegitimate children, the rest are supposed to belong to him.\n\nThe husband has been overseas for the past three years but arrived back about two months ago. While he was overseas his wife was behaving in a very bad manner, drinking and consorting with other men. She also had one child while he was away by another man. I considered the living conditions very bad and had warned her several times that I would take her children from her.\n\nIf this hadn't been such a problem of finding places for nine children they would have been taken from her long ago.\n\nWhen he returned I thought conditions would improve but apparently they continued in the same line so I decided to take these six and put them in the Residential School for awhile until conditions improved, if they do.\n\nTrust this is satisfactory to you.\n\nH.C. Rice\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 15th, 1946.\n\nMr. H. C. Rice, Indian Agent,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\n\nIn view of the contents of your letter of the 11th of April, 1946, you may inform the Principal of the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School, the Department approves the admission of the following pupils:\n\nGordon Howe    Marie Howe\nNancy Howe     Victoria Howe\nReta Howe      Thomas Howe\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\nQuarter Report for the months of January, February and March\n\nConstable:\n\nThe Constable is doing a good job on the reserve, and there is less beer, drunkenness, etc. He seems to be watching this very sharp, and there is also very few fights. He is also giving a sharp check on school attendance. I had to take six children of Mrs. Ernest Howe and put them in the Indian Residential School. This woman has not been behaving herself for some time; she had one illegitimate child while her husband was overseas. I thought on his return that conditions would improve but if anything they were worse. Checking over the house, etc., I decided it was no place for the children so I had to have arrangements for them to stay at the school.\n\nH. G. Rice\nIndian Agent.\nQuarter Report for the months of January, February and March\n\nEskimo's\n\nThe three eskimo children in the Children's Hospital, Halifax, at the present time are being held there on account of measles. I expect to have them removed in about two weeks and placed in the Indian Residential School until time for the sailing of the steamer to take them to their homes, which I understand will be some time in July.\n\nH. C. Rice\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Residential School\nShubenacadie, Nova Scotia\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nWe beg to inform you that the following are eligible for discharge at the end of this school year:-\n\n209 ... Joseph Michael, Eskasoni, C.B.\n127 ... Stephen Morris, Shubenacadie Reserve\n250 ... Noel Simon, Newcastle, N.B.\n\n0193 ... Clara Bernard, Newcastle, N.B.\n0200 ... Laura Jacobs\n0205 ... Myrtle Sacobia.\n\nRe: 0193. We obtained permission from the Department last year to hold this girl over for another year, owing to her home conditions. We have advised the Agent, and have been advised by him to send this girl to Newcastle for the present, and he will place her.\n\nRe: 0200. Laura Jacobs came here from P.E.I. originally. Her father, Peter Jacobs, or Jacob Boucher, has been travelling around N.B. and N.S. He is no fit parent for this girl. We sent an older girl home a couple of years ago, had her placed, but she finally wound up with the father. The girl in question, Laura, is physically strong and robust, but mentally very weak. We feel that this girl should have some protection, and have made known the circumstances to Mr. Rice.\n\nWe do not feel that we should keep her here at this school any longer. We shall abide by the Agent's directions in this matter. We understand that he has taken it up with you.\n\nWe have advised the Agents concerning the dismissal of the others.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nREVEREND J.M. Rice, Principal.\nJune 25, 1946.\n\nDear Father Brown:\n\nWith reference to your recent letter, the Department approves the discharge from the Shubenacadie Residential School of pupils numbered as follows:\n\n209; 127; 250; 0193; 0200;\n0205; 0193.\n\nI have not yet heard from Indian Agent Rice regarding Laura Jacobs, No. 0200. No action will be taken in connection with her discharge until we hear from the Agent.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend J. W.

Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nOn the Woodstock reserve a few of the children are near sighted, two especially so, William Polches and Helen Polches, and both need spectacles.\n\nThe sewing and knitting lessons given the girls on the different reservations are very much liked by them, and excellent progress is being made especially among the older girls.\n\nLessons on personal cleanliness have also been given by the teachers from time to time, with excellent results.\n\nWhile, however, the girls are being taught the uses of the sewing and knitting needles - the boys unfortunately have no means of improvement at their disposal - and therefore it is that I am of the opinion that if a central Industrial school were built where the boys could be taught useful trades, carpentering, blacksmithry, tailoring, etc., in addition to farming that much good might result.\n\nIt seems to me that the Tobique reservation would offer a splendid location for such a school, as there is both land and wood available in large measure there.\n\nOne thing badly needed in the Province is a furniture factory, and it seems to me that if in connection with an Industrial School there was a wood working factory, the native genius of the Indian might be turned to good account, for there is no doubt that in the matter of carving he easily excels, and there would be a good market for his carved work.\n\nFrom the Agent at Tobique Point, I learned that he was successful in cultivating a taste for vegetable gardening among some of the younger men of that reserve, and that he had great hopes for the incoming year in that branch of industry. In regard to getting them, however, to keep to their own particular line of\nwork, he was not so successful, as the feeling spread among them that he was trying to keep them down instead of advancing them in life. Were a Central School (Industrial) established here however, where the young men could go after grading from the new schools, I feel this idea would disappear, and the Indian boy retain the practical use of the few tools he knows how to work so well with now, and acquiring the use of others which would fit him for the battle of life and make him a useful citizen of whatever place he afterwards resided in.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJno.

It would not be a matter of experiment in view of the Department's experience with such schools in other parts of Canada. I understand that institutions of that kind have been highly successful not only in teaching the three \"R's\", but also in providing young Indians with a technical education that enables them when they go out in the world, to become self-sustaining and useful citizens of their country. What has been done in other parts of this Dominion should be susceptible of accomplishment also in Nova Scotia.\n\nA. J. Boyd,\nIndian Superintendent\n\nMay 19, 1924.\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit my report on farming operations among the Indians of Nova Scotia during the season of 1924.\n\nHowever, notwithstanding the discouraging results of last year's operations, I regard farming as the particular occupation most likely to bring a reasonable measure of prosperity to our Indians in the end, but under changed conditions. They must be taught to farm intelligently. I am quite persuaded that the spasmodic efforts, made from time to time, with that object in view, have been of very little, if any, practical benefit. Such education to be effective should begin at an early age and be continued for a certain necessary period. Therefore, I would advise the establishment of an industrial school, centrally located, to accommodate the Indian girls and boys of the three Maritime Provinces, where they would receive a common school education and vocational training to fit them for useful citizenship. The initial expense connected with such an institution would no doubt be considerable, but I believe it would be amply justified by results.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) A. J. Boyd.\nIndian Superintendent.\nWhat would the Department think about a Residential School?\u2014\n\nThere are 22 children who receive relief from the Department\u2014viz. \u00a31320.00 a year\u2014and 7 at Edmonton viz. \u00a3420.00 giving a total amount of \u00a31740.00 a year.\n\nWill it give more time to the parents to work?\n\nHall Assistant on Tobique School\u2014Mr Ryan.\n\nNote\n\nThis was handed in by Father Sylvester Tobique who wanted the Dept to pay.\n\n22/4/25\n\nMr. Lutheland\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Agent Cameron, Heatherton, N.S., in a communication dated May 20th, 1925, states that there are 6 children of school age at Cock's Cove, Guysboro Co., N.S., who live in such a remote place that the nearest school is over 2 miles away. There is no institution available for these children and they are receiving no education. A residential school is a necessity to meet cases of this kind in the Maritime Provinces. See Agent's letter on Files No. 96-46 and 46-1-1.\n\nOTTAWA,\nMay 28/25.\nDuring my visit in August last to the various schools and reserves in the Maritime Provinces, I was impressed with the need of the establishment of a Residential School for the education and care of the orphans and neglected children from the various reserves.\n\nAt the present time we have no institution in which to place such cases. There are some thirty-five children in institutions in Halifax for whom we are paying a grant for maintenance and tuition at the rate of $260.00 per capita per annum. Besides, we have several children in institutions in St. John and elsewhere in the Province of New Brunswick. We have three children in institutions in Prince Edward Island. There are quite a number of children for whom it was necessary to obtain homes with the Indians for which we pay them an allowance. Besides, there are in towns and villages Indian children who do not attend any school.\n\nI am of the opinion that a Residential School should be built at a central point convenient to the railways and of a size sufficient to accommodate eighty children. This matter was brought to my attention by several of our agents and Father Ryan, Inspector of Indian Schools for the Province of New Brunswick. They all emphasized the need of an institution of this kind being established at an early date.\n\nI think this question should receive consideration.\nand when the necessary funds can be provided by Parliament that steps be taken to establish a residential School for the benefit of Indian children of the Maritime Provinces. If such school is built it could be conducted under the auspices of the orders of the Catholic Church as all Indians in the Maritime Provinces belong to that faith.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6054, file 265-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOur whole school system in New Brunswick as well as in the Maritime Provinces is tied up, and it seems a huge waste of money to continue if we are not provided with an Industrial School to care for our delinquent Indian children, orphans and those who will not go to school, but run wild about the shores. We have prosecuted Indians after Indians, little good seems to come from such a course; everyone is kept hot water. Jails refuse to take in Indians, Industrial Houses also refuse - everything is at \"sea\", i.e., a vast wastage is going on and will continue as long as we have no Indian Industrial School. Our Educational System is only good for a few, and these few are soon overcome by the conduct of the delinquents, so in the end there cannot be an advancement, but rather a retrograde movement, all due to the want of this one Institution, the sole base of success. This building would complete our educational system and fill a long sad requirement, check a huge wastage, and assure the highest efficiency. At present we have about 100 children on our Reserves in N.B. alone who should be sent to some such home. Something must be done at once to care for such children.\nOttawa, November 26, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to refer to that portion of your letter of the 8th ultimo relative to the advisability of establishing an Indian residential school in the Maritime Provinces.

One of his chief recommendations is that a residential school be constructed on one of the larger Reserves, and he recommends near Truro.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am satisfied that a residential school for the Maritimes is required but cannot recommend a vocational school for boys only, situated at Halifax. I am informed that the purchase of a suitable farm for our work, if we took over the old building, would require a large appropriation. Further, the building is quite large and very old and would hardly be suitable for our purposes.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORTS OF INSPECTION MADE BY\nReverend F.C. Ryan, on the Indian Schools\nin the Province of New Brunswick.\n\nOriginal on File 55-5-6.\n\nIndustrial School.\n\n\"I feel that we are now up against a great problem for the most of our reserves, in not having an industrial school to care for about 50 of our school children (or more) who are not attending school. It is that the Dept. has provided schools, teachers and books, but to them the next step is to get some to attend school. Parents take their children away with them to different places, while others will not send their children at all to school. Why? They say the children do not like to go. It seems a pity, for in many cases, it is the brightest children who remain away from school, and that, at the early age of 12 or 13.\n\nWhat is the result? Their children exercise a very bad influence on those going to school. I think the Government can readily understand what their children are doing about the reserve and all say long in idleness. Now, can we proceed under such relaxation in bringing about better conditions among our Indians? There are many orphans cast into the hands of other Indian families to care for - for which the Dept. pays certain sums of money. Very often this money only promotes idleness among such Indian families while the poor little orphans get little or nothing.\n\nI should think the Maritime Provinces should have such a school at once. In fact, the absence of this Industrial School has, in the past 20 years, proven a grave financial drainage to the Dept. and more than that, new avenues of alarming financial waste have been opened up to no good purpose. That can only be closed by such an Industrial home. Could the Government be made see this, I feel that in less than twenty years from the time this home was built, that such a financial leakage would be checked as to almost pay for such a home, besides the Indian question in the Maritime Provinces would then, and only then, be solved for all time.\n\nEvery day we remain without this Industrial School, we are going back, and education is costing more with but little results.\"\n\n(Signed) F. C. Ryan\nInspector of Indian Schools for N. B.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6054, file 265-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nApril 23, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Boyd:\n\nPursuant to our conversation, I have to inform you that it is my intention to arrange for the early erection of an Indian residential school in Nova Scotia. As you are well aware, there are many Indian children, for whom a suitable home must be provided if they are to receive an education. We already have a large number of children in institutions in Halifax and elsewhere and there are others for whom we are paying board while they reside in foster homes on the reserve.\n\nI believe that an institution to accommodate 125 children is required. There should be a suitable farm with plenty of pasture land. In addition to the main building there will be required a barn, hen house, implement shed, cold storage and other outbuildings. The children would receive academic training, as well as instruction in farming, gardening, care of stock, carpentry in the case of the boys and for the girls, domestic activity.\n\nSuch an institution would require a reverend principal, an assistant, a farm instructor, an engineer-carpenter and perhaps one labourer. The domestic and classroom activities should be in the hands of from eight to ten Sisters, who would, of course, be under the general supervision of the Rev. Principal.\n\nThe Department is prepared to undertake the capital expenditure necessary for such an institution and its equipment as soon as Parliament provides the necessary funds. There is an appropriation to commence the activity this fiscal year and I am hopeful that arrangements can be made for a suitable site and for some building activity this summer.\n\nIt is the practice, with institutions of this kind, to meet the major portion of the current expenses by a per capita grant - so much per child per annum, based upon the actual attendance. In the case of this school, I believe a grant of $150 should be allowed.\n\nAttached you will find a set of plans for a Roman Catholic Indian residential school lately erected by this Department, and you may show these to any interested parties, so that they will have a general idea as to the type of main building the Department erects for this purpose.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Captain Millett has had experience in budget work and is at present attached to Militia of Nova Scotia.\n\nThe application for the position of matron comes from myself, Mrs. G. Millett, wife of Captain A.C. Millett. As regards my qualifications for the position I may state the following facts:\n\nI have had practical experience in home economics during my married life, and although institutional budgeting is on a larger scale I feel that I would be successful in that matter; I have had practical experience in discipline as I have taught school for over six years; I have had\nexperience with Indians as I spent one year teaching in the Indian Boarding School at Portage la Prairie, and I think I understand the Indian character quite well. I understand thoroughly the system employed by the Indian schools in the West \u2014 the industrial-educational system. I also like the work with Indians very much and would like to engage in it permanently.\n\nPlease let me know if your department will consider these applications, also normal salaries paid.\n\nThanking you,\n\nYours truly,\n\nMuriel G.

In consequence of his physical condition, the administration of the temporal affairs of the Halifax archdiocese is in the hands of an advisory committee, composed chiefly of Monsignor Courtney, V.

His Grace was then in Bermuda; but I interviewed Father McMannus and left the plans and prospectus of the proposed school with him. He has submitted them to the advisory committee, and they have been approved.\n\nIt is the intention of the Halifax ecclesiastical authorities to appoint Sisters of Charity as teachers of the institution. These have an enviable reputation as successful teachers; and one of the Order, who is now in western Canada, has instructions to visit the Blood River school for the purpose of obtaining first-hand knowledge of the methods used in conducting it.\n\nThe plans and prospectus in question\n\nDuncan C.

Rev. Father C. E. McManus, of St. Mary's Cathedral, Halifax, Chairman of the committee, gave assurances of their eagerness to cooperate and appeared quite willing to have the proposed institution come under our regular scheme for schools of this class. After going somewhat into details concerning the management and financing of an Indian residential school, we discussed the service that can be given to the Indian children who might be enrolled there. A set of plans and literature concerning Indian residential schools were left with Father McManus.\n\nIt is proposed to secure the Sisters of Charity for the domestic and classroom activity, and we visited their Mother House on the Bedford Road, near Halifax. Their institution and the Sisters we met made a very favourable impression and they, too, seemed quite eager to go into Indian work. We left with them, also, a set of plans and literature concerning residential schools. The Mother General of the Order is at present in Western Canada, and she and her staff arranged to visit the Blood Indian Residential School, to get firsthand information concerning its conduct.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nDepartment Architect.\nJuly 28, 1927.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. SCOTT,\n\nOn Tuesday, the 19th instant, we arrived at Shubenacadie, N.S., to examine properties there for the proposed Indian residential school. J. L. Ilsley, LL.B., of Kentville, M.P. for Hants-Kings, met us there and assisted until a final selection was made. At that point, we had a preliminary look at the various sites that had been brought to our attention by letter and, without much hesitation, some confirmed our interest to the Etter and Gay Farms, which were carefully examined. Certain local persons with some influence were desirous that the Davis property be included in the final examination, but Mr. Ilsley and ourselves could not agree that it was suitable enough to be worthy of comparison with the other two.\n\nIt was considered advisable to proceed to Halifax for the 20th and 21st, for the purpose of meeting the church authorities and to look into building materials and sources of supply. The final selection of a site was postponed until Friday, the 22nd. On that date the Etter and Gay Farms were examined with considerable care. While the first named property appeared to possess more possibilities as a productive farm - a much wider choice of acreage being available for purchase - from every other angle the Gay property was more suitable.\n\nThe Gay property is situated one-half mile from the station at Shubenacadie - immediately on the outskirts of the village. The site is reached by good roads leading directly from the village. A distinct advantage over the other properties is that it is not necessary to cross the railroad when travelling to and from Shubenacadie. When it is pointed out that this railroad is the main line of the C.N.R., over which there is heavy traffic, the importance of this to the staff and children will be understood. The farm consists of approximately 65 acres of cultivated upland, 50 acres of woodland - 10 of which have already been cleared sufficiently for pasture and 5 acres of marshland, which produces hay perennially without attention. The property as a whole appears to be clean and well cultivated. We consider this Gay farm, which consists of 130 acres, more or less, large enough for the needs of the proposed institution for some time to come. The land appears to be clean and productive and is in one block. It should be mentioned that a fresh water lake, suitable for bathing, boating and fishing, just touches the northern boundary of the Gay farm.\n\nOn this property is an ideal building site. It commands a view of the countryside in all directions and the building will be seen from the railroad and from all of the\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 604, file 265-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nlive roads running in and out of Shubenacadie. The site selected also provides ample opportunity for excellent drainage and water supply, the Shubenacadie river being less than 100 yards from the spot for the building. Electric current and telephone connection are available.\n\nWe wish to point out that it was impossible to locate a building site on the Etter property which was at all close to the railroad or main highway, and the drainage facilities were not at all comparable with those of the Gay property. This also applies with more force to the Davis property, but, in addition, the Davis property's only possible site for the building was immediately over disfiguring gravel pits and generally rough ground. It was represented to us that a siding which was close to the Davis property would be a big advantage. However, this feature was not worthy of serious thought as all materials would have to be unloaded from the cars into a vehicle and hauled up a difficult grade to the building. The Gay property without railroad to cross and only a short hundred yards farther from a railroad station had the distinct advantage of being near a post office and business community. We were warned by certain interested parties that the road leading to the Gay property, which happens to be the main road to Maitland, was flooded at certain seasons of the year. We made several inquiries from independent sources in this connection and we learned that the road was flooded for an hour or two a day in the spring of certain years only, but that it was not impassable even when flooded.\n\nMr. S. J. Etter wanted $13,500 for his farm, which consists of 270 acres. A lot of the value of this property is tied up in the buildings, the most important of which would have to be removed in the event of an Indian residential school being erected there. Mr. George Gay in his written offer to Mr. Indian Agent Taylor, asked $9,000 for his 130 acres, but we were able to secure from him an option on the property at $7,000, provided he be allowed to harvest this year's crop. He promised to do the fall ploughing and otherwise prepare the fields for next year's farming operations.\n\nWe wish to recommend that the farm of George Gay be surveyed at an early date, with a view to determining not only the exact size of the property but also the best building site. If everything is found as has been represented to us and the title is satisfactory, we believe it advisable to arrange the purchase. In our opinion it is easily the best property near Shubenacadie for an Indian residential school. When title is being searched, it should be ascertained what privileges the owners have in connection with the lake that touches the property and if there is a right of way around its southern extremity.\n\nSome time ago, approximately one-eighth of an acre of this farm was sold for the site of a residence. Three\nor four years ago, the purchaser, Mr. Allan S. Bitter, erected a residence, which would make a very suitable house for the farm instructor and other male members of the staff of the proposed school. This residence and lot, which is situate on the entrance road to the property can be purchased for $4,000, which sum is less than would be required to erect a suitable farmer's residence. We strongly recommend that this property, also, be purchased.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nDepartment Architect.\nPugwash, N.

At the present time I do not intend making a trip to the Maritimes within the next few months and it will not likely be necessary for Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Indian Education, to go to Shubenacadie until the building is about ready for occupation. I believe that the earliest date at which pupils can be admitted will be approximately a year from now.\n\nThere are, of course, many subjects that should be discussed in the not distant future. In the spring, it would be advisable for the church authorities to arrange for the farm activity. The Department will allow a certain amount of live stock and agricultural machinery, so that there will be farm and garden products for the use of the school during the following winter. Taking everything into consideration, I believe it advisable for you to come to Ottawa some time during the next three months. If you will intimate what time would be suitable for you, I shall be able to name a definite date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. P.

It will not be necessary to prepare a bill of sale in either case, as we are not acquiring any chattels.\n\nI understand that Mr. McKenzie is one of the best informed surveyors in Nova Scotia, and he has made such a careful and detailed report, that I believe it advisable to forward the enclosures mentioned for the attention of your agent. May I refer to enclosure marked \"A\" on the second page of this draft, bearing a suggestion of Mr. McKenzie's that a narrow strip of the Gay property be included in the conveyance under a separate quit claim deed. Please have your agent comment on our right to dispose of sewage in the Shubenacadie river at this point. He should also ascertain what bathing and other rights we would have in the small body of water known as Snide Lake, which touches the Gay farm on the north.\n\nWhereas funds are available this fiscal year, I should be grateful if you would ask your agent to use despatch in the matter.

I shall leave Halifax on Monday Feb. 13th and hope to be at the offices of the Indian Department on the following Wednesday morning.\n\nTrusting that this will be satisfactory to the department and the gentlemen concerned,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6054, file 265-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa, February 17th, 1928.\n\nDear Father MacKay,\n\nI overlooked the advisability of reviewing with you yesterday certain circulars and forms that we have prepared from time to time. These are going forward to you under separate cover, along with the Census and Indian Act.\n\n(1) is the application for admission form, which should go to Indian Agents as soon as filled in properly. In the case of the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School, you will find that most of these applications are filled in, in the first place by Agents themselves. (2) has reference to recruiting, one section of which is obsolete and I have struck it out. (3) is the formal notice to be used if expulsion, under Section 10 of the Act, is to be enforced in any individual case. Until you are thoroughly acquainted with our practice in this connection, it would be advisable to have Indian Agents correspond with the Department concerning each case to which this section of the Act should be applied. (4) emphasizes that applicants must be medically fit. (5) has to do with half-breeds. The Catholic question in the latter will not be a real worry in Nova Scotia as practically all our wards there are Catholic. You will have many half-breeds brought to your attention, however, and much care will have to be exercised here. Each case should be referred back to the Indian Agent so that the status of the applicant can be definitely determined, if possible.\n\n(6), with the deletions that are necessary in the case of your school, has to do with purchases when the accounts are being forwarded to the Department for payment direct to the firm. You will note that the third paragraph has to do with the requirements of the Purchasing Committee. This Commission is defunct, but the principles that guided it guide us at the present time. (7) has to do with classroom material, books, stationery, etc., of all kinds. Principals should anticipate their requirements a few weeks in this connection as all such equipment must be ordered from the King's Printer here. This means some delay in the filling of orders. It will not be necessary for you to have the certificate of the Indian Agent on this requisition. (8) is a recent circular which has reference to drugs, a reasonable supply of which is provided by the Department.\n\n(9) is a recent circular with reference to fire protection and fire escapes. (10) and (11), respectively, have to do with dietary scale and Red Cross activity.\n\n(12) is the form that is prepared once every quarter. Much care should attend its preparation as the per capita grant will be paid after it is checked. Form marked (13) accompanies this return. I intend to circularise all Principals in the near future with\n\nRev. J.F. MacKay,\nSt. Mary's Cathedral,\nHalifax, N.S.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 605H, file 265-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nparticular reference to this. (14) has to do with the keeping of the classroom register and the posting to the quarterly return. One of our registers will go forward to you under separate cover. (15) has to do with the annual leave.\n\nI have attached a draft of this letter to these forms so that you can keep all in your office for reference purposes.\n\nI am enclosing, in duplicate, the memo we prepared which has reference to the number and duties of the staff. I filled in, in pencil, from the latest annual statement of the Blood School, which was recently visited by a committee of the Sisters of Charity. You will note that they have seven Sisters on the staff. Most such schools would prefer to have a Sister in the senior boys' classroom as well. This would make eight. It is possible that the laundry duties are divided among the Sisters. Most schools would have a Sister for the laundry activity. Personally, I like the establishment as shown on the tabular statement for a school with a pupilage of 90. The senior teacher would be for both boys and girls - we believe in co-education, of course. This teacher would have the oldest pupils who are not seniors but have a class. If there were 60 in the senior category, that would make 30 in each of the morning and afternoon classes. This would give a junior classroom 40 pupils, or they could be divided into two groups so that more personal attention could be given by the Sisters in charge. If one Sister could fill the dual position of nurse and boys' matron, (See my bracket), it might be well for the girls' supervisor to assist in the kitchen or in the sewing room, wherever her time was most needed. Such an establishment of Sisters would not necessarily be increased until the pupilage was approaching 120.\n\nI trust that you have had a profitable visit to the Mohawk Institute and that your journey home was not monotonous.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. P. Mackey,\nSt. Mary's Cathedral,\nHalifax, N. S.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I should be grateful if you could arrange to take up residence there on or about the first of May, at which time the Department will be prepared to provide a temporary supply of live stock and agricultural implements. A reasonable amount of furnishings will be allowed for the residence. You will then be in a position to supervise the farming and gardening activity and to arrange for a root cellar and other improvements that may be found necessary. Further, it will be of much advantage to you to be at Shubenacadie when the new main building is being erected. The Department undertakes to meet all reasonable expenses in connection with getting the school started.\n\nI believe it advisable for you to make yourself known to Mr. Indian Agent Lawlor, of Shubenacadie, who will be in a position to advise you concerning the keeping of accounts and forwarding vouchers that will be satisfactory to the Department. When the school is in operation, Mr. Lawlor will be instructed to make a visit once a month so that he can forward a report to the Department. It is not my present intention to hold him responsible, in any way, for the conduct of the institution, but I know that he will assist if, at any time, you approach him. When materials are to be purchased or labour engaged, the Department will send you the authority direct and wishes you to be responsible for every phase of the school activity.\n\nI trust that you will be able to make satisfactory arrangements with the Sisters of Charity, who have so kindly offered to co-operate. Please give my best wishes to His Grace.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J.P. Mackey,\nSt. Mary's Cathedral,\nHalifax, N.S.\nOttawa, February 16th, 1928.\n\nSir,-\n\nThis is to inform you that the Department has approved of the appointment of the Rev. J. P. Mackey as principal of the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School. It is Father Mackey's present intention to take up residence in the Ritter house on or about the first of May so that he can supervise the farm and garden activity, effect improvements and so that he will be on the ground when the new main building is being erected. I am sure that you will assist him whenever he comes to you for advice.\n\nAt the present time, it is not the intention to ask you to be responsible in any way for the school activity. At a later date, I may request you to pay a visit to the school once a month and give the Department a report. When materials are to be purchased for the school and labour engaged, the Department will write to the Reverend Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

During those years he worked on a small farm of about thirty acres. He is honest, sober, he and the family enjoy a good name in this district.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMr. J. D. MacLean\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn connection with the appointment of a carpenter-engineer for the school here, I beg leave to recommend Edward McLeod.\n\nEven before the contract for the school was let I had this fellow in mind for that position. With that intention I approached Rhodes Curry Co. and McLeod started work as a carpenter early in July. When the pipe-fitters and plumbers started their work I figured that he could get valuable experience there, with the result that he went with them sometime in September. He is working with them at the present time, in spite of the fact that on account of getting too far advanced with that end of the work, they have left some of their men go. His work in that line has been entirely satisfactory. Besides his ability as a carpenter and plumber, I can vouch for his ability as a painter, some years experience as a blacksmith and wheelwright. Add to that his honesty, sobriety and industry, I firmly believe that he would make the most satisfactory carpenter-engineer that could be found in these parts. (That is saying a lot, but it is true)\n\nFor verification, I wish you would refer to Mr. J.M. Dunne, Supt. for Rhodes Curry Co., Mr. Ira Heckman, foreman of the pipe-fitters, and Mr. Wm. Crowell, inspector for the school.\n\nShould this recommendation be accepted by the Dept. I feel certain I could make satisfactory arrangements so far as wages are concerned.\n\nYours very truly\n\nMr. J. D. Maclean\nAsst.

As this position will not be filled until the school is about ready to be placed on the per capita grant basis, the Department will rely on you to secure a properly qualified man.

You may be interested in the brief review of Indian education in Canada and the place in the Department's programme of the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School.\n\nEncl.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. P. MacKay,\nShubenacadie,\nN. S.\nMarch 1st, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Lisley:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to the purpose of the new Indian residential School at Shuswap Lake, B.C. You may be interested in a very brief review of Indian education in Canada, which will suggest the Department's general programme and will indicate the purposes and aims of the boarding school for Indian children in the East.\n\nPrior to Confederation, Indian schools were supported, for the most part, by missionary societies, religious orders and the Indian bands themselves, little financial assistance being given by the legislatures. Low salaries were paid and the attendance was irregular and, as a consequence, the schools were not very effective. The British North America Act placed the responsibility for the Indians of Canada with the Federal Government, and this Department began to support existing schools and to establish others. By 1885, in eastern Canada, where the Indian was no longer living largely by the chase, day schools were conducted on reserves wherever it was possible to secure a worthwhile attendance. The Roman Catholic, Church of England, Methodist and Presbyterian Missionary Societies and Societies were associated with the Department in the conduct of most of these schools. The major portion of the expense was borne by Parliamentary Appropriation.\n\nThe problem of educating the children of the nomadic Indian groups of northwestern Ontario and of western Canada, generally, was largely unsolved, and the missionary societies and orders interested continued the establishment of boarding schools to supplement the day schools on the reserves. The advantages are rather keen on institutional activity, which has the advantage of placing child under Christian influence and supervision for 24 hours of the day. The Department of Indian Affairs soon recognized the socio-economic advantage of the residential school. Ordered habits, domestic arts for girls, farming, gardening, care of live stock, carpentry and other trades for boys were of much interest to the State. The Department supported these residential schools and established others, placing emphasis on vocational as well as academic training, and today they\n\nJ. L.

(RG 10, Volume 605h, file 265-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nare the chief factor in our Indian educational programme west of the Great Lakes.\n\nTo return to the problem in eastern Canada, where the day school has, and will have, the more important part, there remains the provision for orphans, illegitimates and neglected children. Further, many Indian children live too distant from Indian or public day schools to attend regularly. To care for all these under-privileged children, the residential school has been found the most satisfactory solution. There are 6 such schools in the vicinity of the Great Lakes.\n\nIt is for the under-privileged Indian child of Nova Scotia and the other Maritime Provinces that the Indian Residential School at Shubenacadie is being established.\n\nThe Department conducts 22 Indian day schools on the reserves in the Maritimes - 11 in Nova Scotia, 10 in New Brunswick and one on Prince Edward Island. These institutions solve the ordinary problems. There remain the under-privileged children. Over 50 of the most urgent cases are in convents and orphanages in Halifax and other centres. There are now 30 additional children needing maintenance as well as education. These will form the nucleus for the pupilage of the Shubenacadie School. Accommodation for 125 is being provided. The 45 children required to fill the school will be recruited from among those who are of or with families in a semi-institute condition. The cost of maintaining pupils in their own schools will be less than the fees paid to private institutions. Further, at Shubenacadie, the physical equipment and the courses of instruction are especially designed to meet the particular needs of our wards.\n\nThe educational activity at Shubenacadie will be academic and vocational. Classroom work will be comparable to that in the public schools of Nova Scotia and will be inspected, at request, by officers of the Provincial Department of Education. Girls will be trained in the domestic arts; and boys, in farming, gardening and the care of stock. Later, it may be possible to give a thorough course in manual training. It is the object and desire of the Department that graduates of this school will become self-supporting and will not return to their old environment.\n\nPractically 100% of the Indians in the Maritimes are Roman Catholic and the Department has secured the services of the Reverend Father Mackey for principal and the Sisters of Charity for the inside staff.\nstaff. These church workers will be responsible for the school activity, generally, and will see that the pupils receive a training in religious education.\n\nAt these residential schools, the Department provides the buildings, farm and stock and whatever furnishings and equipment are necessary at the outset for their satisfactory conduct. There is also given a per capita grant, based on the average attendance. This grant and the farm or other school earnings care for all current expenses except classroom equipment, medical services and drugs, and are used for replacing worn out equipment. Major repairs to buildings and mechanical plant are made by the Department and are not a charge on school grant or other earnings. The management is expected to look after minor repairs and to keep all property in good condition.\n\nIt is necessary for me to be in British Columbia this month and I leave Ottawa on Tuesday morning. Some time in April, I shall be glad to enlarge on this subject whenever an interview is convenient. In the meantime, I have instructed Mr. Perrier to make an appointment with you to discuss any phase of the activity in which you are especially interested.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are planning on publishing in the Halifax Chronicle and Daily Star in the very near future, a special section dealing with the construction of the new Indian College now being completed at Shubenacadie, N.S. We would like very much to elaborate on the establishment of this school and to tell just what the Federal Government at Ottawa are doing in this regard, and with your co-operation we can accomplish this purpose. What we would like you to do is to give us a page or even a half page advertisement. We have already been in touch with the various contractors who have volunteered to take advertising space in this edition, and now with some advertising co-operation from your Department, we can put over a nice section. We thought possibly your Department would be willing to authorize a page but if not, a three-quarter page or even a half page space would enable us to put over the story.\n\nIt is planned to publish this section on Saturday April 6th or not later than the following Saturday, April 13th. Therefore we shall appreciate it very much if you will let us have copy and necessary instructions at your very earliest convenience. You can also if you will, send us a story dealing with your Department and its connection with the establishment of this school. We are sure your Department will appreciate the excellent opportunity this edition will afford you in telling the people of the Maritimes what real good your Department is doing.\n\nThe charge for a full page space would $285.00. A three-quarter page space would cost $214.00 and a half page space would cost $145.00. The section of course will be published in both the Chronicle and Star and will have a circulation in excess of 33,000 copies.\n\nThanking you in anticipation of your favorable consideration, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE CHRONICLE COMPANY LIMITED.\n\nAdvertising Manager.\n\nGPG/GL.\nThe Indian Residential School at Shubenacadie, which will be opened in the near future, has been erected by the Department of Indian Affairs for the academic instruction and vocational training of those Indian children in the Maritimes whose needs are not being satisfied by the day schools which are conducted on the Indian reserves. Accommodation has been provided for 125 children and the necessary staff of instructors.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs conducts 22 day schools on the Indian reserves of the Maritimes - 11 in Nova Scotia, 10 in New Brunswick and one on Prince Edward Island. These schools solve the ordinary problem. There remains the necessity of providing for orphans, neglected children and those who live too distant from day schools to attend regularly. It is for these underprivileged children that the residential school has been erected at Shubenacadie. There are 6 such institutions in the vicinity of the Great Lakes in Ontario and many in Western Canada, but the one lately constructed in Nova Scotia is the first residential school for Indian children in the East. For some time it has been known at Ottawa that a school of this kind was needed in the Maritimes. The present Superintendent General of the Department, the Honourable Charles Stewart, satisfied that the time had come when something should be done, secured an appropriation from Parliament. In a few months, the school will be equipped and ready for the reception of pupils.\n\nFollowing the well-established policy, this school will be conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church, as the Indians for whom it is to provide education are all adherents of that faith. From the establishment of the first industrial school, nearly one hundred years ago, there has been cooperation between the Government and the various denominations interested in missionary work among the Indians. The benefit arising from this system is that the Department obtains the zealous assistance of those interested in the evangelization of the Indians, and the general education and civilization go hand in hand with Christianization. Very marked success has followed the association of these two forces working towards one and the same end.\n\nRev. Father J. P. Mackey has been appointed principal and under the Department's direction he will have general charge of the school. The Sisters of Charity will conduct the domestic and classroom activities; teachers and all other instructors will be fully qualified for their respective duties. The managers of the school will be expected to conduct the institution upon the revenue derived from a per capita grant without further assistance from Parliamentary Appropriation. It is found that this method insures economical management.\n\nOnly Indian children, wards of the Dominion Government, are eligible for admission, and, before being placed on the roll,\nwill undergo a careful physical examination by a competent physician.\n\nThe educational activity at Shubenacadie will be academic and vocational. The classroom work will be comparable to that in the public schools of Nova Scotia and will be inspected, at the Department's request, by officers of the Provincial Department of Education. Girls will be trained in the domestic arts; and boys, in farming, gardening and the care of stock. Later, it may be possible to give a thorough course in manual training. The physical equipment and the courses of instruction are especially designed to meet the particular needs of Indian children. It is the object and desire of the Department that graduates of this school will become self-supporting and will not return to their old environment and habits.\n\nThe Dominion Government has provided the farm and main building. This building will house the pupils and instructors and provides all the accommodation necessary for classroom and domestic instruction. In due course, there will be erected barns, workshops and the other outbuildings that are necessary for this type of school. Furnishings, equipment and live stock will be purchased in the near future. The capital expenditure was provided in the appropriation for Indian education and there will be a yearly grant for current expenses.\nApril 4, 1929.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the special section in the Halifax Chronicle and the Daily Star dealing with the new Indian Residential School at Shubenacadie.

I have to say that it is hoped to have this new residential school completed and ready to receive pupils in the latter part of the summer. This school is established for the education and training of Indian children from each of the Maritime Provinces. It is intended, primarily, for the benefit of orphaned and neglected Indian children of school age whose children whose parents are in destitute circumstances or unable from other causes to have them attend day schools on their reserves.\n\nRev. J. A. McDonald, Indian Agent, Grand River, has been requested to make enquiries regarding any Indian children in Prince Edward Island who should be placed in the new Shubenacadie School.

Markey has been appointed principal, and, under the Department's direction, he will have general charge of the school. The Sisters of Charity will conduct the domestic and classroom activities; teachers and all other instructors will be fully qualified for their respective duties. The entire staff will be nominated by the Catholic Church authorities, under whose auspices this school will be conducted. It is not likely that there will be any position in the school or on the outside staff, to which Chief Isaac Peters could be appointed.\nOttawa, May 4th, 1929.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith regard to the Shubenacadie Residential school the Department hopes to have this completed in the latter part of the summer of this year.

MacLean, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons, Ottawa.\nIndian School For Maritimes\n\nGovernment Opens Residential School For the Children at Shubenacadie\n\nHalifax, June 28.\u2014A residential school for Indian children to be established in the Maritime Provinces has just been announced by the Hon. Mr. H. A. Murray, Minister of Indian Affairs for the administration of Indian Affairs for the academic year 1929-30. The school will be located in Nova Scotia, and will be opened shortly.\n\nThe building costs $200,000. The Dominion Government has provided the land and main building. This building will also serve as a dormitory and provides all the accommodation necessary for the school. The specific construction bars, work shops and other facilities required for a school of this type will be erected in due course. The necessary funds for the erection of these facilities was provided in the appropriation bill. The Dominion Government will provide a yearly grant for current expenses.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs conducts 22 day schools on the Indians in the Maritime Provinces. There are 11 in Nova Scotia, 10 in New Brunswick and 3 in Prince Edward Island. It has recently been felt for establishment of residential schools for orphaned or neglected children or those who live too far from the day schools or who are unable to attend them. These underprivileged children that the residential school will be located at Shubenacadie. There are six such institutions in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, and many in Western Canada. The residential school at Shubenacadie is the first such school for Indian children in the east.\nMODERN SCHOOL IS ESTABLISHED\n\n(Continued From Page 5)\n\nwas abandoned in 1856 after twenty years of effort.\n\nRAPHAEL'S METHODS OF EARLY DAYS\n\nPrior to Confederation there was practically no organization of Indian schools in Canada. The Roman Catholic Missionaries interested in this work were scattered throughout the country wherever and whenever the activity gave promise of success. The Anglican Church of England chaplain to the Hudson's Bay Company opened the first school for Indian children on the Red River in 1820. In 1834 Father Laval, a French priest tried an agricultural school at St. Boniface near Fort St. Paul, now St. Boniface, Man., in 1834. There were also missionary schools in various parts of the West, all conducted by Roman Catholic, Anglican, Presbyterian and Methodist missionaries. In British Columbia the Anglican Church of England chaplain to the Hudson's Bay Company began work early in the 19th century, and founded what is now the present Lytton Indian Residential School.\n\nAt the time of Confederation the Indians were taught in small schools with small salaries, and attendance was irregular, thus making the schools ineffective.\n\nDuring the year ended March 31st, 1927 there were 16 residential schools and 200 day schools in operation in Canada, attended by 1,470 pupils. In addition the Department of Indian Affairs has approved the opening of 15 combined white and Indian schools. The total number of pupils attending these schools during the year was 14,710, and the average attendance per school was 986. These schools were actively engaged in the maintenance of the regular day schools. This co-operation of the churches has resulted in the establishment of several new schools such as the one now established at Shubenacadie, N.S., as follows: Roman Catholic, 42; Church of England, 39; United Church, 13; Presbyterian, 2.\n\nVOCATIONAL TRAINING AT THE SCHOOLS\n\nIn addition to the regular academic work at all Indian schools, there is vocational training at all the residential schools. At the new institution at Shubenacadie there will be farming, carpentry, blacksmithing, stock, manual training and domestic instruction. The Vocational Division of the Department of Indian Affairs assists the schools in preparing students to start farming and housekeeping. At the present time, in all other Indian residential schools, the provincial Departments of Education have fully qualified teachers will be engaged. Arrangements have been made with the Provincial Department of Education for the appointment of inspectors and separate school inspectors for supervision of the vocational instruction, and Department officers will constantly supervise the vocational training.\n\nAll developments in the new structure along educational lines will be made under the best possible facilities for the education of the underprivileged Indian will be provided.\n\nThe expenditure for Indian education was approximately $1,000,000 appropriation for the fiscal year ended March 31st, 1927, of which $24,125.61 was spent in Nova Scotia, $1,000,000 in Ontario, $1,000,000 in Quebec, and $1,000,000 in Prince Edward Island.\nFIRST INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL IN EAST\n\nModern School Is Established At Shubenacadie For Children Of Maritime Province Indians\n\nREV. J. P. MACKEY IS SCHOOL PRINCIPAL\n\nChurch And State Co-operate To Teach And Care For The Young Micmac\n\nBy RUSSELL G. EHRHART\n\nWith the opening of the new school building at Shubenacadie, the religious and educational life of the Micmac Indians of Nova Scotia has been greatly improved. The new school, located near the town of Shubenacadie, will provide a modern facility for the education of the Micmac children of the region.\n\nThe school was constructed by the Government of Nova Scotia, and is being operated by the Department of Indian Affairs. The school will be staffed by both Micmac and non-Micmac teachers, ensuring a balanced approach to education.\n\nThe new school building is situated on a large plot of land, providing ample space for outdoor activities and sports. The building itself is a modern structure, featuring large windows and a spacious interior. It is equipped with all necessary facilities for teaching and learning.\n\nThe school will provide an education that is tailored to the needs of the Micmac children. The curriculum will include both traditional Micmac teachings and modern academic subjects. The school will also offer vocational training, preparing the children for future employment.\n\nThe school will be administered by competent staff, ensuring high standards of education and care. The school will provide a safe and supportive environment for the children, allowing them to grow and develop in a positive manner.\n\nThe opening of the new school is a significant step forward in the education of the Micmac children. It represents a commitment to improving the lives of these children and their families. The school will provide a foundation for a brighter future for the Micmac people of Nova Scotia.\nARTICLE RE SHUBENACADIE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nunderneath.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The enclosed forms should be filled in by yourself, if he was employed by you, and, if not, you should hand same to the contractor to be filled in and forwarded to the Claims Officer of the Workmen's Compensation Board of Nova Scotia.

School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nNovember 20, 1929.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nIt is desired that you have general supervision over the Department's educational work in your inspectorate. You have already been given a list of the day schools in your inspectorate, showing locality, names of teachers, salaries, etc. There was attached a statement showing where Indian children are receiving tuition in white schools.\n\nThe Department is not satisfied that the Indian day schools are giving the best possible service. They have been under the supervision of the local Indian agents and are inspected semi-annually by provincial school inspectors. The provincial officers give advice to the teachers and make an independent report to the Department concerning the academic progress. It is your duty and that of the Indian agents to see that buildings and equipment are satisfactory and to improve the attendance and the general efficiency. Whenever you find that a teacher is not making the most of his or her opportunity, you should report to the Department.\n\nIt is particularly desired that you cooperate with the Indian agent in the matter of attendance. In the past, irregular schooling has militated against the success of our work. In this connection, you should give attention to the Indian children who are attending white schools as well as to our own institutions.\n\nThere is, at Shubenacadie, N.S., an Indian Residential School recently established and about to be opened, for the benefit of the orphan and neglected children of Nova Scotia and the Maritimes generally. You should visit this school from time to time, so that you will become acquainted with the work there and so that you will be able to assist our agents, at the outset with recruiting and later in the determination of those that should be granted admission. Preference will be given to those applicants for this school who are clearly wards of the Department and who are orphan or neglected. Favorable consideration will be given also to those applicants who live too far from any day school to attend regularly. I have to instruct you to undertake a special duty in connection with the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School. Once every fiscal quarter, you will make a general inspection of the school and make a report to the Department. On these occasions, you should certify to the correctness of the quarterly fiscal report, which is prepared by the Reverend Principal. Your duties will be to check receipts or cancelled cheques with the items appearing on the report. At the same time, I am not asking you to assume any responsibility for the financial management or general conduct of this school.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Shubenacadie Indian Residential School is located in the district under the inspectorate of Mr. Maxner. He has been instructed to visit and undertake special duties in connection with the school. Once each quarter he is to make a general inspection and report to the Department. On these occasions he will certify to the correctness of the quarterly fiscal report, which is to be prepared by yourself. He will check receipts or cancelled cheques with the items appearing on this report. He is also to assist the agents in his inspectorate with recruiting and in determining those pupils who should be granted admission. At the present time he is not asked to assume any responsibility for the financial management or general conduct of the school. I have to request that on the occasion of Mr. Maxner's visits to your school you will give him every facility in his inspection of the accounts and the information he may require regarding the work of the school generally.\n\nMr. McNeil will also visit the school from time to time. He will have no special duties in connection with the work of the school. His visits are in order that he will become acquainted with the work and be able to assist the agents in his inspectorate with recruiting and in the determination of those pupils who should be granted admission.

You should forward the quarterly report for the months of May and June, showing the attendance of all pupils, etc. At the end of June, you should also forward the financial statement, as explained by Mr. Phelan. Each subsequent fiscal quarter, it will be necessary for you to forward the report and the financial statement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. P. Mackey,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N. S.\nEDUCATING OUR INDIANS IS AN IMPORTANT TASK\n\nNEW SCHOOL IN THE MARITIMES\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs Conducts Day and Residential Schools Throughout Canada\n\nOne of the very important functions of the Department of Indian Affairs is the providing of educational facilities for Indian children throughout the Dominion. Day schools are conducted on reserves in every province and where conditions permit residential schools are also operated. In order to provide academic instruction and vocational training for those living on the Maritime reserves whose needs are not met by the twenty-two day schools conducted in that part of the country, a new residential school has been erected at Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia. There are six such institutions in Ontario, three in the Great Lakes in Ontario and many in Western Canada but the one lately erected is the first in the Maritimes.\n\nThe new school, which will house 125 pupils and the necessary teaching staff, will be opened about the middle of September. Classroom and domestic instruction will be opened about the middle of September, together with the barns, workshops, and other equipment necessary for the vocational courses.\n\nAccording to reports received by the Department of Indian Affairs in the Maritime Provinces, eleven are located in New Brunswick, five in Nova Scotia, two in New Brunswick, and one on Prince Edward Island. These schools solve the ordinary problems of the Indian children residing in close proximity to the schools. There remains the necessity of providing for orphans, widows' children, and those who live too far from the day schools to be regular attendants. It is for these underprivileged children that the residential school has been established.\n\nFrom the establishment of the first industrial school nearly one hundred years ago, there has been cooperation between the Dominion Government and the various religious bodies interested in missionary work among the Indians. In following this well established policy the new residential school will be conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church, as the Indian bands in the Maritimes are all adherents of that faith.\n\nRev. Father J. P. MacKey has been appointed principal and has been called in from Quebec. Under the Department's direction he will have general charge of the institution. The Sisters of Charity, who will conduct the domestic and classroom activities, will move into their quarters about the middle of August.\n\nIt is anticipated that the teachers will be fully qualified, and the educational activities will be academic and vocational. The vocational work will be comparable to that in the public schools of the province. At the Department's request the school will be affiliated with the Provincial Department of Education. The vocational training will include carpentry, blacksmithing, sewing, etc., for the boys, farming, gardening, care of stock, and possibly manual training. It is planned that children from the school in a position to become self-supporting and independent.\n\n* Prepared at the direction of Dr. Duncan C. Scott, Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, and Mr. F. E. Foster, Superintendent of Indian Education.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing to tell you about an Indian school at Shubenacadie. I thought that school was built for Indians' children to learn read and write, not for black and brown ones like that also get harsh stuff.

The older boys and girls, especially, will have certain duties to perform. The boys have to assist in the work on the farm and the girls, with the work in the school, as part of their training.\n\nI would suggest that you visit the school and I am sure that Rev. Father Mackey, the Principal, will be glad to explain to you the work being done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nFor Secretary.\n\nChief Dan. L. Francis,\nBox 31, Cambridge,\nKings Co., N. S.\nOttawa, August 30, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication, signed Chief Dan. L. Francis, Cambridge, Kings Co., N. S., complaining that the pupils at the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School are overworked. He states, further, that one of the Indian boys from his reserve was beaten by the Principal and, as a consequence, was laid up for several days. His letter is rather indefinite regarding some of his statements.\n\nHowever, the Department considers that it would be advisable for you to see this man, ascertain from him the nature of his complaints and on what grounds he bases them. I may say that the Department does not place much reliance in his charges, as this school is under the management of a competent staff, who have the best interests of the children in mind. It is expected that the older children at least will help with the work, both on the farm and in the school, as this is part of the training which they receive at all residential schools. You might explain to the Chief the purposes for which this school is being carried on. I shall be pleased to hear from you after you have discussed this matter with Dan Francis.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. S. Prince, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKentville, N. S.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nFor Secretary.\nOttawa, August 30, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from Chief Dan. L. Francis, Cambridge, Kings Co., N. S., making certain complaints against the work which he states the pupils are called upon to perform at the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School. The Chief is being informed that it is expected the pupils, as part of their training, will do certain duties on the farm and in the school. Further, the Department is suggesting to the Chief that he visit the school to see what is being done for the Indian children. If he does so, I shall be pleased if you will give him an opportunity to see through the school, in order to satisfy him that there is no ground for any complaints. In order to facilitate future recruiting, the Department desires that the Indians themselves will be favourably disposed and given every opportunity to see that the Indian children are being well cared for in every respect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nFor Secretary.\n\nRev. J. P. Mackey,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N. S.\nYour letter 51-0-1 Aug. 30, 1930.\n\nFollowing receipt of your letter of above date and number, I communicated with Mr. L. Fran\u00e7ois of Cambridge reserve, and the following are his statements regarding definite cases at the Shubenacadie Residential School as he gave them to me this morning:\n\nMARY ANN PETERS Sent home to Cambridge a short time ago on account of illness. Had to work hard while she was there and didn't get enough to eat.\n\nJOAN BRADFORD Is homesick and wants to come home.\n\nKATE KOPAGE and REGINA KOPAGE Their father, John Kopage, says he would be more contented to see his children attending Cambridge School and thinks they would learn more there. These girls are lonesome and want to come home.\n\nHELVINA PAUL Her mother, Mrs. Frank Paul, wants her to come home to help with the work, carry milk, run errands, etc., and go to Cambridge School. Her mother visited her at Shubenacadie and reports her lousy and dirty.\n\nABRAM SMITH and VIOLA SMITH Their parents, Mr. and Mrs. John Smith, called on them at Shubenacadie. Children's heads lousy and parents will be more satisfied to have them home attending school at Cambridge. Abram Smith's hands blistered from work with shovel.\n\nGeneral reports from the children complain of too much work and not enough study.\n\nYou will understand that these reports are word for word as given to me by Mr. Fran\u00e7ois this morning and I obtained none of them from any other source.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 10, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, relative to the complaint of Chief Dan L. Francis, Cambridge Reserve, regarding the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School. The Department has noted the statements made by Chief Francis relative to the pupils mentioned in your letter.\n\nI may say that very little reliance is placed on the Chief's statements. The pupils at this school are well treated, and we are sure the reverend sisters would not permit any uncleanliness or vermin on the children under their charge. The fact that a child is homesick, or that the parents want their children home to run errands, etc., can receive little consideration. You should explain to Francis that this school is regularly inspected, and that it is being conducted in the best interests of the children. The Department suggested, when replying to his letter of the 30th ultimo, that he visit the school, and the Principal would be glad to explain to him the work being done and give him any information he wanted regarding the treatment the children are receiving. The Principal was also written and asked to give him an opportunity to see through the school in order that he would be satisfied there are no grounds for complaint. You might also suggest to him that he visit the school and see for himself the work that is being done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. S. Prinde, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKentville, N.S.\nINDIAN WRITES ABOUT BUILDING OF COLLEGE\n\nTruro, N.S. \u2014 Claiming that \"fishing, trapping, hunting and making\" are the natural trades of his people, an aboriginal man in Truro, Nova Scotia, using under the nom de plume \"Ghoosecap,\" expressed his views in the Letter column of the January 26 issue of the Truro News on the proposed Indian College to be built at Shubenacadie, N.S.\n\n\"Not very long ago,\" the letter states, \"we Indians thought of our some thousand dollars Indian College fund as something like the final touches of our long drawn out civilization is to be given, where everything was to be obliterated or cast into the Bottomless Pit. But now, however, at least at this time, some smart young Indians can become Priests, Doctors, and teachers, secretaries and sales ladies just like the whites.\"\n\n\"Remembering my own experience of the fleecing or the kindness of White Men's education upon an Indian and knowing how unchangeable is the nature of the savage, I utter one of my great-great grand Father's grants and pray God will send Father Ghoosecap to come and save us which I hope he will do, for to be an Indian is to be nothing more than a loafer on, longing to see the wonders of this world which he sees but never can get. He is nearly forty years old. The Indians have been introduced in all our Reservations in Nova Scotia. Millions of dollars have been spent to educate 'The Indian.' Today we have a few educated Injin who eat his bread and butter through or by the use of his pen. After about two or three months after an Indian Priest is ordained and Indians' Doctor is graduated, the latter graduate will find the three working together at baskets and chopsticks. We must try to improve the condition of Micmac Indians in Nova Scotia by associating with them and everything else 'Indian.'\n\n\"Our last Christmas in the reserve here was a little different. Go to church in the morning, go back to your own house and go to bed. You see any Indian done it sixty years ago no prayers could have saved his soul. For our ancestors old Indian Christmas was all 'Indian,' all sane, while now they are being civilized from the Holy of Holies where flesh upon flesh is eaten day before Christmas until New Year. A New Year was always a reconciliation and a new beginning. So our modern Indian Christmas here was a mere shadow of our former ones.\"\nIndian Affairs.

Looking over the space we can find room for possibly twenty more beds. As for the other equipment in the school supplied by the Department it was sufficient for one hundred twenty-five children. This number was to be the capacity of the school according to your letter or February 17, 1928, 51-0-1, and the copy of Dr. Scott's letter to Mr. Ilsley of March 1st, 1929. By this I do not mean to infer that we should not take more children, but only to prepare you for additional equipment for which we are asking. At the present time we are very much understaffed, as we know from experience and you will readily admit when you compare our staff with the memorandum given to me two years ago. In that memo, you show 10 Sisters for 100 pupils and 12 Sisters for 125, the highest average is one Sister to 12\u00bd children.

Pressure of business since my return has prevented my making an earlier acknowledgment. Permit me to say that I was very pleased indeed with your school and the work which is being conducted in such an excellent manner.\n\nMrs. McGill and I wish to be remembered to the Reverend Sisters and other members of your staff whom we met during an exceedingly pleasant visit.\n\nWith kindest personal regards, I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nReverend J. P. Mackey,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nChubenaadie, N.S.\nAugust 4, 1933.\n\nReferring to your memorandum of the 26th ultimo, with attached correspondence from Colonel Cantley, R.F., to the Honourable the Minister, regarding the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School, I have to say that this school was established for the benefit of the Indian children who are unable to attend our day schools. It is primarily for the purpose of educating orphan and neglected children, or children whose parents are unable to properly provide for them or those who are unable to attend our Indian day schools.\n\nEach case is brought to our attention by the local Indian agent, who forwards an application on the form for that purpose. These children are kept in the school until they reach the age of 16 years. The case of each child is dealt with on its merits.\n\nThe school age and the authority under which children are placed in a residential school are set forth in Section 10 of the Indian Act.\n\nIn cases where the parents neglect to send their children to school, the Department can have them committed, under the Section of the Indian Act referred to above. It is only in exceptional cases, however, that this action is necessary. It is stated on the application for admission in each case that the child will remain in the school, under the guardianship of the Principal, for such term as the Department of Indian Affairs may deem proper.\n\nWith reference to communication received from Colonel Cantley, regarding the two Indians, Michael Paul and Peter Wilmot, who desire to have their daughters home for a holiday. I have to say that, as our funds for transportation of pupils for holidays have been so greatly reduced, the question of allowing holidays this year was left in the hands of the Principal, with the request that he would make the arrangements considered by him to be in the best interests of all concerned, and the parents to provide the cost of the transportation in going to the school and returning to the school, permission is granted for the children to go home on holiday. As the two Indians above referred to were unable to provide the cost of the transportation, the Principal kept their children at the school. Michael Paul has one daughter, Louise, 14 years of age, at the school, and Peter Wilmot has two daughters, Kate, aged 12, and Annie, aged 16.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nPicton, N.S.\nJuly 16, 1935.\n\nMr. Thomas L. Cantley, M.P.,\nNew Glasgow, N.S.\n\nDear Mr. Cantley:\n\nIn reply to your letter of July 12th I wish to thank you for your kindly interest in the two Indians mentioned, Michael Paul and Peter Wilmot.\n\nMonday, June 12th, I interviewed the Reverend J. Mackay, Superintendent of the Indian Residential School at Shubenacadie, and was informed by him that no children from this agency would be granted vacation this summer. When the parents of these children commit their charges to that institution they sign over the care of the children to the Superintendent, who has authority to judge how long the children must be kept there, and under what conditions they may be granted vacations.\n\nDuring my short term of office I have not made any promises that houses would be built for any Indians, for the good reason that it is not within my power to make such promises. Last autumn I made several recommendations to the Department of Indian Affairs, and was plainly told that the Department had no funds with which to build houses. At that time this agency was granted some fifty-one dollars for very necessary building repairs, and in the month of January of this year a further fifty-one dollars was authorized to build a shack for an Indian whose children were suffering from exposure to the elements.\n\nPerhaps you can sympathize with the unenviable position of an Indian Agent. There are really a number of Indians for whom houses should be built, and many others whose homes need repairs; but always I am informed that the Department has no funds for exceptional expenditures, and that expenses must be kept down. Added to all this, I am given the disconcerting notice that these poor wards of the Government...\nmust apply only through their agent, and that they are to be given notice to that effect. Only a couple of weeks ago I was given the discouraging notice that my expenditure for relief in this agency is entirely too high, and that I must reduce the amount, telling the Indians to be self-reliant and attempt to support themselves and their families by agriculture, fishing and other work. I feel for these poor creatures, believing that the present time of depression has made their lot a particularly hard one, since it is impossible for them to get remunerative work or to sell their handiwork, and so I believe that the Government should give them extraordinary aid in these extraordinary times, but what can I do?\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nsigned: A. A. Johnston.\n\nRev. A. A. Johnston,\nIndian Agent.\nNew Glasgow, N.S.,\nJuly 12th, 1935.\n\nRev. A. A. Johnston, P.P.,\nPictou, N.S.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have had a visit from two Indians, Michael Paul and Peter Wilmot, who are anxious to have their girls home from Shubenacadie School for a while at least.\n\nMichael Paul's story is that his daughter, Louise Paul, now about fourteen years of age, has spent three years at the school and that his wife and he are very anxious to have her home with them for a while, she being the only child.\n\nPeter Wilmot states that two of his children, Kate aged twelve and Annie aged fifteen, are also at the School and that last year they were allowed home for one month, from July 14th to August 14th. His wife at the present time not being strong, they are anxious to have the girls home with them for as long a period as possible.\n\nWilmot also states that he has two other children aged seven and five, who are or soon will be of school age. Further, that he was promised that a house would be built for him at Pictou Landing. This he is anxious to have so that the young children can have the advantage of attending the Indian School there.\n\nI know nothing of the facts above stated, but promised to call the matter to your attention and will feel obliged if you will be good enough to do what you can along the line indicated by the parties named.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT. Cantley\nHonourable T. G. Murphy,\nMinister of the Interior,\nSuperintendent General Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nMy dear Minister:\n\nI have recently had a visit from two very respectable Indians who live at Woodburn, Pictou County, namely; Peter Wilmot and Michael Paul, in regard to whose case I wrote Reverent A. A. Johnston, Indian Agent, Pictou, as per copy enclosed, and am now in receipt of his reply, copy of which I also enclose.\n\nHaving no definite knowledge as to the conditions under which Indian children are admitted to the Residential School, Shubenacadie, I am of course not in a position to form a judgment as to the Superintendent's statement contained in the second paragraph of Father Johnston's letter of July 13th, but the statement certainly does not correspond with that made by the parents of the children, the two Indians above named.\n\nI come now to the matter dealt with in the third and following paragraphs of Father Johnston's letter which I am bound to endorse. Father Johnston's statement in regard to the situation is in no case overdrawn, and I am quite satisfied it was not the intention of the Prime Minister that conditions such as described should prevail and continue in this district.\n\nI am asking you therefore to give Father Johnston authority to meet cases of destitution such as referred to by him.

I note from your recent memorandum that the parents are now prepared to pay their transportation.\n\nClasses have now been resumed at the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School, and I consider it inadvisable to allow these children to go home. Besides, it is doubtful if the parents are able to properly care for them, and, in view of the approach of colder weather, it is quite possible that they would have to be returned to the school at departmental expense. I consider Colonel Cantley should be informed that the Department is not prepared to authorize these children being granted holidays at the present time.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nWe had to make an apology to Miss MacDonald, daughter of my friend, the Agent. When the young boys were out for a walk, and, as usual, two Sisters at the end of the line, two of MacDonald's daughters passed, and, while passing, threw the remark - \"You would think that they would be trained better than that\".\n\nThe Sisters knew it was for them, and wondered why, so, after enquiries, we found out, as the young ladies were passing - one is deformed - a \"hunchback\" - two of the boys said something to them.\n\nAfter finding this out, I sent a note of apology to the young lady and the two boys to apologize in person. Mr. Agent MacDonald told them that if they made any more remarks, he would attend to them, so look out for more trouble.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDecember 11, 1935.\n\nDR.

I.\nDear Sir,\n\nWhilst doing my visiting I have met quite a few ex pupils of the school at Shubenacadie. I am rather disappointed at the results.\n\nWhether the fault is on the pupils or the method of teaching is hard to say, but I have met bright and sharp children of 14 years only doing Grade 5 work. I have met a lad who was at school until he was seventeen & he was in grade 8 when he came home now this lad is as bright and intelligent as any white lad in the locality.\n\nWhen the school reopens I would like your permission to visit the school, and I hope make\ncontinuation\n\na discovery as to the cause of what I term\npoor results.\n\nI feel very interested in children's learning\nand believe that whatever their creed or color\nthe best education is none too good for them.\n\nSincerely I will get your sympathy in this\nmatter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nEdward C. Harvey\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, August 5, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, with reference to the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School.\n\nThis school is visited regularly by departmental officials and it is felt that the staff are putting forth their best possible efforts on behalf of the children. I am inclined to feel that the fault is due to themselves\u2014not lack of work by the staff.\n\nIndian agents are at liberty to visit the Shubenacadie School at any time, and the Principal, no doubt, will be pleased to show you over the entire building.\n\nIt might be well for you to communicate with Reverend J. P. Mackey, Principal of the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School, stating the names of the children to whom you refer in your letter in order that he can advise you regarding their work while at the Shubenacadie School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

MCGILL\n\nRe my visit to the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School, Shubenacadie, N.S.\n\nI wish to report that, during my inspection of Nova Scotia, I spent a whole afternoon at the above institution. This is a fine institution, built, I believe, on practically the same plan as the St. Mary's Indian Residential School (Blood R.C.), on the Blood Reserve.\n\nThere is a farm connected with the school and the staff was busy preparing the land for seeding. They have a fine herd of Ayrshire cows - all T.B. tested - and, therefore, the children are given all the milk they can drink.\n\nI went over the school building from top to bottom and found everything in good order and the furnishings well taken care of. I noticed, however, that in several rooms the rain had beaten through the walls and the paint and kalsomine had become discoloured. The Principal has been in communication with the Department regarding this matter.\n\nThe heating plant, machinery, etc., were all in good order.\n\nIn the Principal, Rev. J. P. Mackey, the Department has, I believe, a good official. I also talked with the Sisters and other members of the staff and my opinion is that there is a very efficient staff at this school.\nThe girls are instructed in domestic science and the boys receive a certain amount of manual training.\n\nThere is, however, one thing that I wish to bring to the attention of the Department and that is the future of the pupils who are attending this school. The Department is well aware of the conditions that exist among the Indians in Nova Scotia and, unless a change is brought about, the young men and women graduating from this school from year to year will return to their people and in a short time will be asking for relief.\n\nYou will see from my general report that the Indians all over Nova Scotia are depending, for a livelihood, on what relief they get from the Department and the sale of Indian handicraft, such as baskets, axe and pick handles, and other articles too numerous to mention, and both men and women are quite expert in this work. The children attending Shubenacadie are not given this training. Therefore, they will have absolutely no means of making a living when they return to their homes, but will have to depend on their parents and the Department to assist them. I am of the opinion that this is a matter that needs careful consideration, as the book-learning they receive at school will not make them any more efficient to earn their living than the others.\n\nI shall discuss this matter fully with Mr. Hoey, and I am sure the Principal and his staff will cooperate in any endeavour which will be of benefit to the boys and girls attending the Shubenacadie School.\n\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, June 14, 1937.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report from Mr. M. Christianson, General Superintendent of Indian Agencies, with reference to his recent visit to the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School.\n\nMr. Christianson was favourably impressed with general conditions at the school. However, he feels that, in view of conditions that now exist among the Indians in Nova Scotia, it is advisable to encourage more vocational training for both boys and girls.\n\nI feel certain that you and the other members of the staff will cooperate with the Department in this regard. It is difficult, however, for us to decide exactly what should be done along these lines. I would appreciate receiving any recommendations in this connection that you care to make, and I can assure you that your proposals will receive sympathetic consideration,\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

I realize that this is unfair criticism due to the fact that the Department is fully aware of the manner in which the lay staff of the school was selected. At the same time I felt it was advisable to bring the matter to your attention in order that you may make whatever comments you consider advisable.\n\nIn replying I should appreciate receiving a report regarding the vocational training given both the boys and girls. In this connection I wish to have up-to-date information on file. You will remember that I wrote to you in regard to vocational training on June 14, 1937.\n\nThe present Minister is continually urging that increased attention be given to vocational training of pupils in Indian residential schools. I know that this involves extra equipment and possibly an additional member on the staff and while our funds are limited we are prepared to assist at least as far as money available will permit. As a matter of fact it is neither necessary nor advisable to install expensive equipment as very valuable training can be given with a comparatively small outlay of funds.\n\nI shall await your report with interest.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

From among all the pupils in attendance since that date to the present time, we have recently and most recently approved from the Department of Indian Affairs that one girl go on for higher education. This girl, Elsie Charles, is now a qualified teacher for this province. Two years ago there was an opening in an Indian day school. We recommended at the time that the girl be given this school. The Agent of the district was very much opposed to such procedure, saying emphatically that he had tried Indian teachers on previous occasions and found either that they were no good, or that the Indians themselves refused to co-operate in the least. At that time we thought the matter over thoroughly of employing the girl as a last resort at the school here. After we had considered the matter, we came to the conclusion that it would not work out to the advantage of anyone.\n\nThis may be the matter to which you have reference in your letter. Had you let us know the source of the complaint, and the exact matter complained about, we would be in a much better position to reply definitely. As it is we will cover as much ground as we think necessary, but even at that, we may be far astray from the point.\n\nAs for the men employed, three on full time, and the night fireman, for about five months out of the year. They are the farmer, assistant farmer, and carpenter-engineer. These men have been employed since 1929-1930 and have given satisfactory service. As for extra labor, in all building operations, there has been no extra labor, except for plasterers and electricians. Until this last summer we have done all farm work without any extra help. But this last year we had very few big boys here during haying time, and haying work was delayed on account of rainy weather. The situation as far as the hay was concerned was getting serious, and so we decided that as soon as the weather cleared, we would hire two extra men and rush the operation. Our own male staff worked sixteen hours a day, and the hired help ten to thirteen hours a day. One of the hired men was Al Gass who has been employed on the staff as night fireman for the past few years, so we really hired only one extra man. No kind of no Indian who in any way could take the place of any of our regular staff, and at the time we required the extra labor, most of the Indians capable of doing the work, were on the road making their way to Maine for picking potatoes.\nWe may have missed the point in the complaint made to you, but we think that we have covered fairly well the matter of the staff and the question of extra labor.\n\nAs for the vocational training, or manual training - as we understand it, that would mean all work other than reading, writing and arithmetic done in the class room. We will try and cover that in a general sort of way and enclose with this letter our schedule of work outside the regular class room.\n\nAt the opening of school in September, we make a list of the older boys, usually numbering from twenty to thirty boys, divide them into teams of five or six, mixing up the experienced with the inexperienced, having each team as nearly equal to the other as possible. A copy of the team list is posted in the dairy recreation room, and we hang it up in the office. Their duties are the barn chores and milking, morning and evening for one week at a time. It usually works out to be about ten weeks for each team. If the farm work calls for boys, we usually try to use these same boys who are on for milking duty. It sometimes happens that in one team of five or six boys, that two or three may be in different classes in school and sometimes different rooms. So in that case we try to have boys of the same class out of school at the same time. In the early fall when the root crop is gathered in, there would be twelve to twenty of the bigger boys out of the classroom until this work is cleared up. Then of course there are days and weeks when not more than one or two boys would be employed at farm work during the time when classes are held. In the spring, for the planting, the same applies as for the fall. As you well know, a good part of the farm work is done during July and August when so many of the older boys, because they have reached the age for discharge, are not here. Also so many more have gone hom for vacation. So there are only a few boys who get the in-between work, that is, between the planting and harvesting. Again, as you would expect, we have the boy who has reached the age of fourteen, and yet is small of stature and not a strong constitution, and therefore, it cannot be expected that he would take his turn at the heavier work. These are usually employed around the house, from taking meals to those who may be sick, to washing dishes and cleaning up refectory, recreation, toilet, and wash rooms. We feel that every child capable of work should be impressed with the idea that if they are to get along, they must work.\n\nAs for the manual training - from the time the school opened, we have built two dwelling houses, a hog house about seventy-five feet long by eighteen wide, a dairy and ice house, about 18 x 32, an addition to the feed room. As we have said before the only outdoor work we had for these buildings were for plastering and electric wiring, and the exception for excavation and cement work of one house. At that time we had very few big boys. All the bigger boys had their share in the work of erecting those buildings, from beginning to end, and the ones who were anxious to learn, did learn, but what can anyone do with a boy who does not want to learn.\nAgain, as far as work in the school is concerned, we had outside painters in for the painting in the Chapel, but our carpenter-engineer and the boys worked under their instructions. Our carpenter-engineer learned something from that job, as can be seen from the painting done since that time in the class rooms, sewing rooms, and other rooms in the house. All the bigger boys, of course, help with the painting. All repairs, replacing window frames, glass, etc., is done with the help of the boys, which, by the way, is a very practical thing for an Indian to learn. All our sleds, twenty double runners were made here, but we could not have the runners, bunks, bunks and beams because we have no band. The painting and keeping in repair these sleds during the skating season makes up quite a bit of work, and naturally the boys use the hammer, saw, screwdriver, wrench, etc., at this work. We don't know whether or not you noticed it, but we have had no outside help for plumbing and heating. We have had considerable work with leaky pipes, clogged drains, and many necessary replacements here and there. This work has been done by the carpenter-engineer and the boys. There are many more things along this same line which I should mention, but we don't think that is necessary. With the equipment we have, we think, that all things considered, these boys have an opportunity to learn many things which should stand them in good stead at a future time.\n\nIt is true that we do not make a particular drive at making baskets and axe handles. The market for these things in this locality is over supplied, and if we can teach the boys here to do some of the things that the boys on the reserve do not do, then we are bettering our own chances, and leaving the market for baskets, etc., to those who need it most. Again, these boys are only sixteen years of age when they leave here, and if they want to learn basket making for a living, it is not too late. During the two months they are home for vacation, they learn the business, because we have no trouble in getting baskets and other things made for our own use here.\n\nIn the manual training room, we have a harness sewing machine, a boot and shoe sewing machine, a boot repairer stand, and part of a lathe which we picked up at the Navy Yard in Halifax. All out foot wear is repaired here, and the boys have the opportunity of learning. The lathe or part of the lathe which we have, we use for repairing chairs, etc., turning rungs, etc. The tools used in turning out this wood work are borrowed and have been used here for the past few years. The boys see this work done but do not actually do the finer part of the work, because the fixtures are such that one has to be most careful and it is not safe enough to cover their carelessness.\n\nWe have been told by one who has had charge of an Indian School for nearly twenty years, that this school is in excellent condition, and better than some which were built about the same time. We don't know whether this is true or not, because we have only had the opportunity of visiting one other Indian Residential School and that only for a short time. However, the day may come soon when we will be given the opportunity of visiting some of the long established schools and learn from them how we can improve matters here.\nWe are getting tired of writing this, and no doubt you are weary from reading it. Nevertheless, we are going on to the work of the girls and follow that with some suggestions which may or may not be practical.\n\nAs with the boys, so with the girls. At the beginning of the school term we make a list of the bigger girls, placing the few who have been here during the summer at the bottom of the list. During the regular work, four girls and two Sisters are in the kitchen. Each week one girl leaves and another goes in, so that each girl has one month of kitchen work. For the girl going to the kitchen for the first time, her work does not require much experience, but by the end of the month, she will, if she wants to, have learned a good deal. The list is not so long but that each girl will have two turns during the school term. During the time preserving, two or more girls with experience are employed at the work. The girl leaving the kitchen, comes to my dining room, with a Sister present. She is taught how to set the table, and serve the meal. Entering the kitchen, say, two years before leaving the school, we feel that each girl, again if she wants to learn, can gain valuable experience. As would be expected we have to consider the girl who is small for her age, and not strong enough for the work. The laundry work works out quite regularly. The mending and darning, and there is plenty of that, is done by whole classes at a time. The new work in sewing blouses, middies, skirts and pants, requiring the use of sewing machines is done mostly by the same girls, who are on the list for kitchen work. To this is added knitting for both boys and girls, so that all mittens and winter stockings are made here. Again there is what we call the fancy work, hem stitching, tatting, crocheting, cut-work, mat hooking and quilting. In the Spring of each year we get the patterns of five or six dresses. The girls who are leading toward June, pick their pattern, do the cutting and sewing, in order to make the dress to suit and fit themselves. These dresses are then their own property to wear or take home with them. With the mats and quilts, we hold a drawing to decide who should have them.\n\nBy the time we have ball playing, coasting, skating, and keeping the house clean, the day is pretty well used up, and what is left we want for sleep. We are enclosing a copy of the list for kitchen, sewing, mending and laundry, showing the days on which this work is done.\n\nNow for our suggestions. We have for the boys about what could be called an average carpenter outfit, together with the harness sewing machine, boot and shoe sewing machine and repair outfit, and an electric drill. We are enclosing a blue print of a small manual training outfit. We are sorry that it comes from the U.S.A., but if any of the longer established schools have a regular manual training outfit, it would be similar to this. With the outfit, we could make all sorts of furniture. While our own carpenter does not hold any diploma for manual training work, we feel certain that with a book to guide him, he could make an excellent showing at the work. Give him a picture, not a blue print of anything in furniture, and he will make it. So the matter of add-\ning to the staff for that work would not be necessary.\n\nAlthough it may be necessary to hire someone to do the farm work which he under the present circumstances does. We have no idea of what this outfit would cost but before this letter is finished it may be possible that we can get this information. With this outfit and the necessary constructive and repair work on the building, well, to be honest about it, we feel that these boys would have many advantages over the average white boy. We would not say that out loud, but nevertheless, that is what we think about it.\n\nAs for the girls, if we had the woods, where we could have the boys obtain the material for baskets, that work could be undertaken in opposition to what is being done by the Indians on the Reserves.\n\nFor the past two years with the attendance up to and sometimes over 160, we consider that it is asking too much of any woman to supervise eighty children, running in ages from six to sixteen. So this year we are going to apply for two more Sisters, bringing the staff of Sisters up to twelve. For the assistant principal and the girls, we hope to have a domestic Science teacher who on at least two afternoons of each week, will be able to take a class of girls and provide a system whereby each girl will do her own cooking, etc., from beginning to end.\n\nThis is the last suggestion but we do not think it the least valuable. It is the matter of teaching as far as possible, first-aid. With the cooperation of the Doctor and the assistance of a registered nurse, and a book or two, we ought to be able to teach the more ambitious ones, something that would be helpful to them and perhaps others.\n\nWe hope that we have given you the information you have asked for, and that you will find out suggestions not too fantastic.\n\nYours very truly,\nDear Father Mackey:\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo replying to our letter of January 21. As stated in our previous letter you were not written in a spirit of criticism but simply for the purpose of having on file a complete report from you. Your recent letter gives the exact information that we require for our records.\n\nI expect to visit the Indian schools in New Brunswick during the latter part of May and at that time will also visit Shubenacadie school when further consideration can be given to the question of increasing the facilities for vocational training for the boys.\n\nNo doubt you have visited technical schools but, if not, it might be advisable for us to visit the technical school in Halifax where it is quite possible several suggestions could be obtained and it might even be advisable to endeavour to make arrangements for one of their qualified instructors to visit Shubenacadie a few days a week during the fall term in order to assist your staff in having this work properly started.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

They were very excited when they heard that the Indian Residential School was being built.\n\nMODERN BUILDING\n\nThe Shubenacadie Indian Residential School is now being constructed. It will be completed by next year. The school was opened in 1930 for boys and girls between the ages of 6 and 18.\n\nFarming and manual training supplement the academic curriculum. For the boys, farming and woodworking are emphasized; for the girls, sewing and dressmaking are taught. A special class is offered for those who want to learn more about farming.\n\nINTELLIGENTLY RUN\n\n\"We don't know whether we are doing enough,\" said Father MacKay, the principal. \"We need more teachers and more facilities. We are doing our best, but we need more help.\"\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nCopy sent to Mr. A.J. Campbell\n\nOttawa,\nMarch 18, 1941.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nA letter has just been received from the Director of Publicity for the Province of Nova Scotia in which he states that he has received a letter from you requesting information regarding the Indians near Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia.\n\nThe Indians in the Province of Nova Scotia belong to the Mic Mac Tribe and number 2157 according to the 1939 census. There are 19 Indian Agencies conforming to the boundaries of the several counties, 47 small Indian reserves, 11 day schools and the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School. The latter school was completed in 1930. There is an enrolment of 160. In the academic course the first 8 grades are taught by qualified teachers. In addition vocational training is given. This school is intended primarily for Indian children in the Maritime Provinces who, for various reasons, are unable to regularly attend the Indian day schools operated by this Department.\n\nI trust that this letter supplies the information you require but, if not, I will be pleased to hear from you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMrs. W. Wallace Wilder,\n634 Belmont Avenue,\nWestmount,\nMontreal, Que.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nSUPERINTENDENT\nWELFARE AND TRAINING\n\nI note from a hospital report that Christine Nichols, pupil of the Shubenacadie Indian School, was injured last December by having her hand caught in a mangle. I wondered if the Department received any report from the school authorities on this accident? The hospital expenses involved are in excess of $350.00.\n\nP. E. Moore, M.D., D.P.H.,\nActing Superintendent of Medical Services.\nDear Father Mackey:\n\nThe Acting Superintendent of Medical Services has brought to my attention the fact that since last December an amount of $350.00 has been paid for hospitalization expenses of Christine Nichols, who is stated to have injured her hand in a mangle at the Shubenacadie School.\n\nI have reviewed several of our files but I cannot find any report that you submitted to the Department regarding this accident. In view of the heavy expense for hospitalization, it would appear that this girl suffered serious injury. I should appreciate having a complete report from you regarding the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.P.

As far as we can find out, she warmed her hands on the mangle, and remarked that she was nearly caught. The next time she warmed her hands, she was caught. We immediately called Doctor MacInnis, and after doing some bandaging, he ordered her to the hospital. The hospital did not send us any account of her injuries. They may have supplied Dr. MacInnis with this information. Month followed month, and there was no sign of her coming home. She was seen by Sisters of the school at different times, and quite often by the former Superior of the Sisters here, who is now living in Halifax. We were all puzzled by the length of time it was taking to heal the hand. She returned to the school April 27th, with the hand bandaged, and the fingers still quite stiff, and bent towards the palm of the hand. While she was at the hospital we heard about the Doctors being quite annoyed because she would not exercise the hand, and also, that a certain amount of experimentation was being tried out. All this is just hearsay, so take it that way.\n\nSince returning to the school, she has improved generally, and by doing some crochet work, she is getting movement in the fingers, and is now able to take a grip with the hand.\n\nShe is due back at the hospital May 27th, and we hope that they will be satisfied with the progress made.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Accompanied by Father Murphy, we visited all the homes on the Island, paid the help for picking potatoes, made arrangements for distributing some of the potatoes to those Indians who are in need.\n\nOn November 17, I again visited Lennox Island, arranged with Mr. Gillis, our Foreman to procure more help to have our building program speeded up, on the 19th accompanied by Father Murphy, we visited the residential school at Subansacadi, as I wanted to see the Indian children from our reserve here who are going to the school. Accompanied by Father Mackey, we visited the Indian reserve at Subansacadi, and may say that I was very much impressed by the general set up and feel my visit to both the school and the reserve there will be of great value to our centralization plan here.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\nJ.E.

This is the first information that we appear to have received regarding Cooper leaving our employ on January 1 last. As he has been employed at the school for several years I would appreciate your advising his reasons for quitting. At the same time you might let me have more specific information regarding Charles Crowell, stating his age and qualifications for the position.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

However, for the past few years he had told me that he was going to leave, as he felt that he needed more money. I did not offer any more money, as I felt that throughout the years, he had been treated very well. So when he had the opportunity to get on the Railroad, he decided to go. That was January first of this year. We thought that we could get along with the assistant farmer, Lawrence Parker, until the Spring work would begin. We did not inform the Department about Cooper leaving, because in the past, we have been told what person to hire.\n\nAs for Charles Crowell, age about thirty one, married, and has worked on different farms in this vicinity for years. He is an experienced truck driver, and we hope will be a good operator for the tractor. Cooper never did learn to operate the tractor. We think that, locally, at least, he was the best man available, and as far as we know, should be acceptable to a certain individual; not that it would make a particle of difference to us, if it were otherwise.\n\nNeedless to say, Lawrence Parker will be the head farmer, taking Cooper's place and pay, and Crowell will be the Assistant.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Brown of Kentville.\n\nThe matter has come so suddenly and the information regarding Father Brown's qualifications is so vague that we are in a quandary as to what action should be taken. If at all possible, I should appreciate hearing from you by return mail.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J.P. Mackey,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nDear Mr. Wilson,\n\nI am glad to hear that by now, the Dept. has received word from the Chief Bishop that my days at the Indian Residential School are over. I have not been well, and I did not have what it takes to continue further.\n\nSome of my years there were really enjoyable and we had smooth sailing, others were tough going. Father Brown, who will take over about the middle of this month, will do better than I did or ever could do.\n\nMy sincere thanks to you, Doctor McGill, Mr. Hoyt, Mr. Amel, and all the others, for their kindness and consideration given to me during the past fifteen years.\n\nI am going back to a small parish, with mixed feelings, some of relief.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEC 28 194\nOttawa,\nDecember 14, 1943.\n\nDear Father Burns:\n\nIt was with great regret that the Department received your letter of the 8th instant, advising that Reverend J.P. Mackey has been obliged to give up duties as Principal of the Shubenacadie Residential School owing to ill health. Father Mackey's services have always been very satisfactory to us and his relations with Departmental officials have been most cordial.\n\nThe appointment of Reverend J.W. Brown as Principal of the Shubenacadie School is approved. I note from your letter that he will reach Shubenacadie about December 17.\n\nI should appreciate it if you would advise Father Brown to come to Ottawa some time between January 15 and 31, 1944, in order that he may meet the Departmental officials and at that time we will be able to discuss the work with him. He can advise us later the exact dates on which he will be in Ottawa in order to ensure that the officials that he should meet will be here at that time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. W.J.

Brown\nSUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES AT THE SHUBENACADIE INDIAN AGENCY FROM OCTOBER - 43 TO JANUARY - 44.\n\nOn December 14th this centralization project lost, to a great extent, the services of a good friend and an experienced adviser, Rev. Fr. Mackie, principal of the Residential School since its founding, was forced by recurring illnesses to relinquish his place as Principal and revert again to light parish work. Practically all summer his stomach condition bothered him and was aggravated, I believe, by a series of regrettable occurrences. First blow was the accidental drowning of two young girls of the school. He felt this very keenly. Next came an epidemic of diphtheria at the school, then three runaway attempts in extremely cold weather by children who were ill clothed for the temperatures we were then experiencing. Finally just home from the hospital he was unfortunate enough to meet the doctor, on the doorstep of the school, coming out with a child on a stretcher. The idea which had been milling in his mind for some time suddenly became a decision and he forthwith sent in his resignation. We here at the agency and all of Shubenacadie were sorry to see him go, but we feel that due to his health the step he took was necessary. It is well known that the work of the present successor or any other in fact, will be made much easier because of the good will and respect enjoyed in this community by Fr. Mackie.\n\nHis successor, Fr. Brown, was my parish priest in Kentville and served for a time in Enfield 14 miles from here. His knowledge of the Cambridge Indians is extensive and it is well known that he always had a liking for what he calls \"the poor Indian\". He is a favourite of all children regardless of color or creed and in my opinion will have more trouble with ration coupons and pedigrees than managing 160 children. He too is a backer of the centralization idea and will do all in his power to help and speed the project along.\n\nH.C. Rice,\nIndian Agent.\nMr. R.H. Hoey  \nSup't. Mikakine & Training\n\nApril 5th 44\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nForwarding by some mail pictures of boys and girls in the pottery room, the kiln, pottery display and the Halifax Herald write up of our pottery work at the school. I do hope the above may be helpful in your records.\n\nWe will have a good picture in mid-summer of our Iyothine herd of cattle and will forward same for your records.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nJ. M. Brown\nOttawa, April 8, 1944.\n\nDear Father Brown:\n\nPlease accept my sincere thanks for your letter of the 5th instant and for the photographs, which reached me by the same mail.\n\nIt is unnecessary to state that I found the photographs and the Press clippings very interesting and, if I may say so, rather encouraging. Publicity such as this is very helpful at a time when a great many of our residential schools throughout the Dominion are subjected to a great deal of criticism.\n\nI am particularly anxious that you should inform the members of the staff, and particularly the Sister responsible for the organization of this work, that their efforts are very much appreciated by the officials of this Branch. It would prove helpful also if you could let us have somewhat similar newspaper excerpts if such are published from time to time.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend J. W. Brown,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N. S.\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: Shubenacadie Indian Residential School\n\nI inspected this school very carefully on September 7 and found everything running smoothly.\n\nI must point out, however, that the Principal, Reverend Father J.W. Brown, is 64 years of age and, while he is quite vigorous, at the same time it is evident that the smooth operation is depending, to a large extent, upon the Reverend Sisters. During the course of an interview with Most Reverend J.T. McHale, Archbishop of Halifax, on September 5, I pointed out to him that, while we realize the difficulty of securing young men at the present time, owing to the number of priests from this diocese in the Armed Forces, at the same time the Department hopes that conditions will make it possible for a young man to be secured in the near future.\n\nThe pottery programme is proceeding very satisfactorily and a number of articles are being sold to people who call at the school. The Principal of the Province of Nova Scotia Technical College, at which pottery is taught visits Shubenacadie frequently and is extremely interested in the work that is being done at the school. Due to the fact that several of the pupils who make pottery will eventually reside on the Shubenacadie Reserve, it is quite likely that this industry could be further encouraged on the reserve when the Sisters take charge of the day school. It is understood that one of the teachers who will go to the Shubenacadie Day School eventually will be able to continue the pottery training.\n\nYou will recall that there was some correspondence regarding the purchase of additional land for the school and at the time the request was made to us we expressed the opinion that no additional land should be secured at the present time. I discussed this matter with the former Principal, Reverend J.F. Mackey, whom I met in Halifax on September 6, and he stated that there was approximately ten acres of land adjacent to the school which could be desirable to purchase at such time, but that, as the school has done very well with the amount of land they have, he did not see any particular reason for making the purchase at the present time, other than it might stop anyone else from securing it. In discussing the matter further with Father Brown it appears that he has lately purchased five acres of this ten-acre plot. Evidently, following our refusal to purchase land, he purchased the five acres from his own funds. He paid $100 an acre for it, or a total of $500. He stated that...\nif the Department wished to secure this from him at any time he was quite willing to transfer title to us for the amount just stated.\n\nThere is a continuation school in the village of Shubenacadie, which is situated about a mile from the school where instruction is given as far as Grade II. Pupils who take Grade II in the Nova Scotia schools can then proceed to Normal School for a year's training and obtain a teacher's certificate. A few years ago one of the pupils of the Shubenacadie School, James Prosper, resided at the Shubenacadie Residential School and took Grade II at the village school. He is now in the Air Force.\n\nIt is interesting to know that 55 former pupils of the Shubenacadie Residential School are now in the Canadian Army. Of these 3 have been killed. One, Jimmy Foster mentioned above, is in the Air Force and 2 ex-pupils are in the United States Navy.\n\nBoth the main building and the outbuildings are in good condition, with the exception of the trouble that they have been having with the wall. Mr. Sparks of the Survey Engineering Branch who has been at Shubenacadie in connection with the erection of the new day school, made a careful inspection of the wall and roof and it is his opinion that the coping at the top of the walls should be fixed. He claims that if this is done the leaking of water into the building will be prevented. He had representatives of two firms inspect the roof with him and their quotations have not yet been received, but he estimated the expenditure would probably amount to $2000.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, November 9, 1944.\n\nDear Father Brown:\n\nPlease accept my sincere thanks for your letter of recent date and for the very fine snapshots sent forward therewith. It is certainly gratifying to note that you have 42 head of cattle at the school and that this is the largest number since the herd was established.\n\nI have this morning discussed with the officials of the Welfare Division the desirability of having a few of these snapshots enlarged and returned to you. These officials are of the opinion, however, that these snapshots would scarcely lend themselves to enlargement, with the facilities at our disposal for such work here. They do suggest, though, that when one of our officials next visits the school, he might take a number of similar snapshots that could be enlarged and returned to you in due course. It is my intention to make this suggestion to Inspector Arneil, just as soon as he returns to Ottawa. In the meantime, many thanks for your courtesy in sending forward the pictures.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend J. W. Brown,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N. S.\nIndian Residential School\nShubenacadie, Nova Scotia\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nEnclosing snaps of some of our Ayrshire stock which may be of interest to yourself and the Department. The snaps were taken as we were preparing for the Exhibition at Truro, and are at their best. We have forty-two head of cattle at this time, the largest number since the herd was established.\n\nFrom the snaps, the \"Grain Fields\" compare well with the West; it is really one field. If the snaps are enlarged, I would be glad to have copies for our records here.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

A \"Kidney Infection\" was the ailment, as reported from the Halifax Infirmary, where he spent some six weeks and lived only three weeks following his return from the hospital. May I inquire if any Departmental consideration is given for the grave illness, hospital or funeral costs, of a faithful servant of many years standing?\n\nI do not know what the Department procedure is, in his replacement.\n\nMr. L. Parker, our farmer, would quit the management of the farm, and take over the Engineer work and repairs. He is a very handy man, had helped Mr. McLeod over the years, knows steam boilers, pumps, and electrical set-up around the building and barns. I think he would care for the work well. If the Department accepts the suggestion, it would be satisfactory to me. Mr. Parker suggested the change himself.\n\nMr. Growell, Assistant farmer, advised me recently that he is giving up his work on April 15th. He has had a lot of illness since last November, and feels he might not be strong enough to carry on the Spring and Summer work.\nIndian Residential School\nShubenacadie, Nova Scotia\n\nI feel sure I can secure the services of a good farmer; he may have to be a Veteran of the First War. I need not insist that these positions need not have to do with Local Politicians, nor even returned men. Whoever is paid for the work here must be competent, and again, (most important) I have to live with the man and his family -- very important factors in our home life on the hill.\n\nIf I have any Political inquiries, much more appointments, my reply will be \"The Department will make the appointments\" and no one goes to work without my direction; I sign the Department checks.\n\nI have asked Rev. Dr. MacPherson, Agricultural Director at Antigonish, to find a suitable assistant farmer, and now I will have him interview a prospective farmer to assume management of the farm and stock. He must be an \"Ayrshire\" expert.\n\nI submit this to the Department, and await your directions.\n\nIn the meantime, I will look for quality men to fill the positions.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

If so, I would like to apply for same.\n\nI am a carpenter by trade, and have done a little plumbing.\n\nI also worked on the above building from start to finish.\nhave a little idea of the lay of the building, if there is any application for same, please forward me one to the following address:\n\nYour Truly,\n\nFrank Austin,\nShubenacadie,\nHants Co\n\nN. O.\nOttawa, July 12, 1946.\n\nDear Father Brown:\n\nPrevious to the appointment of the present Indian Agent at Shubenacadie, we employed only a part-time agent, and, as he was not thoroughly familiar with all conditions, the Principal of the Shubenacadie Residential School corresponded direct with the Department.\n\nIt has been decided that the time has now arrived for placing more responsibility on Mr. Rice, who is a full-time agent. Consequently, he will visit the school at regular intervals in the future, inspect all departments and report to the Department.\n\nAny matter requiring attention, either in connection with the building or with the general operation of the school, should be brought to Mr. Rice's attention, so that he can write to this office.\n\nThe Quarterly Return and the Quarterly Financial Statement should be forwarded to Mr. Rice, who, in turn, will send it here.\n\nI have recently reviewed your June quarter financial statement and compared same with previous years. This comparison shows the following results:\n\nJune quarter expenditure 1944 - $6,348.99\nJune quarter expenditure 1945 - $6,382.73\nJune quarter expenditure 1946 - $6,704.41\n\nOn the occasion of Mr. Rice's next visit to the school, you\n\nReverend J. W. Brown,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, Nova Scotia.\nshould explain fully to him why the expenditure has shown a considerable increase during the quarter just closed.\n\nIn your statement of receipts for the June quarter it is noted that the tractor was sold for $1,200.00. You should explain to Mr. Rice why this machine was sold without first securing departmental authority.\n\nThe Auditor's report for the 12 month period August 1, 1944, to July 31, 1945, showed that the school had on hand Victory Bonds which cost $10,000.00. I presume these have not yet been sold.\n\nThe Surveys and Engineering Branch advise that you informed their Engineer that you did not have the funds to pay for the very extensive repairs to the water system. In view of the large balance in Victory Bonds, it is considered that $5,000.00 worth of these should be sold and the money used for the expenditure just mentioned.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDirector\nOttawa, July 11, 1946.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPrevious to your appointment as Indian Agent the Principal of the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School corresponded direct with the Department in connection with any matter requiring attention.\n\nI feel the time has now arrived for you to take a more active interest in the school and I enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter which is being forwarded to the Principal, Reverend J. W. Brown.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEncl.\n\nMr. H.C.

The cost for board would be the same as paid by the Community for Sister-Students attending other Summer Schools.\n\nThe Community is anxious to have the Sisters complete their course, so that they in turn may take up Pottery classes at Mount Saint Vincent, and other schools.\n\nMy inquiry is to have your direction in the matter. Your decision will be a policy to be followed in future years.\n\nMay I have your advice at the earliest convenience?\n\nMany thanks!\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nREVEREND J.M.

You may so inform Father Brown.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, August 3, 1946.\n\nMr. H.C. Rice, Indian Agent, Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia.\n\nI desire to refer you to Mr. Hoey's letter of July 11th, enclosing copy of letter written to the Reverend Principal of the Shubenacadie Residential School.\n\nEnclosed is a letter which reached us today. I am anxious to know if the expenditure mentioned has been made.\n\nI understand that Mr. Berthe, the Auditor will be in your agency next week. Please show him Mr. Hoey's letter of July 11th and also the copy of the letter written to the Reverend Principal. You should also show him the attached letter.\n\nPlease tell Mr. Berthe that we wish him to make an extra special survey of the financial situation of the Shubenacadie School.\n\nWhen you have shown Mr. Berthe the enclosed letter you should return it to the Department.\n\nEX'D.\n\nBernard F.

I want to report to yourself first, before I report to Mr. Rice, as directed, regarding the expenditure of the $10,000. May I insist again that this money was saved because wartime requirements could not be obtained. That money still belong to the House in that it will soon be required to purchase much that is urgently needed for the school.\n\nFollowing expenditures make up the money we had in the Bank.\n\n| Item                  | Cost   |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Purchase Pumps        | $1173.50 |\n| Installation          | 649.98  |\n| Galvanized Iron Pipe  | 235.86  |\n| Express Costs         | 120.00  |\n| Boiler                | 590.00  |\n| Boiler                | 375.00  |\n| Difference for New Tractor | 400.00 |\n| Copper Roofing for Coal Shed | 600.00 |\n| Doonhue Contact       | 6903.00 |\n| Roofing Bldg.         | 710.00  |\n\nTotal: $11,757.34\n\nIt should be clear that we have spent over $1700.00 more in the above items, than the value of the Victory Bonds. Bonds are all sold and credits placed to the credit of I.R.S. account. Water system costs, pipe, and placement, will be taken up by Mr. Rice.\n\nThe Tractor (old) was sold to the Department, or transferred to Eskasoni by Mr. Morris. I am sure he had authority to buy. For myself, he WAS the Department. Your presumption that bonds in Royal Bank were not sold is an error.\n\nJune Quarter expenses were more this year than preceding two years, just because all costs are up, and bills came due during this Quarter. Three things, J & M Murphy, Clothing, at $500; Reid and Son, feed and seed costs, at $1000; New Bull $300; and St. John Milling Co., $523 more than make up the difference.\nIndian Residential School\nShubenacadie, Nova Scotia\n\nYou make no mention of the Credits, which should be of as much concern to you as the Expenditures. The improvements to our properties, the splendid results in our Ayrshire Stock, general health condition of the children, months of care of the Eskimo children -- all this greater value does not show at the Royal Bank, but is of the greatest worth in the general well being of the Indians.\n\nThe recent letter of Mr. Rice did bring results in our hot and cold water pipes, and general run down condition of the building. All Department representatives in my three years have been advised, and they saw for themselves, the over-all inroads of our weather, and just nothing was done. I am glad Mr. Rice shall have all such responsibility for the future.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nREVEREND J.

Kerr\nInspector of Agencies\nQuebec and Maritimes.\n\nJes/J\nOttawa, December 23, 1947.\n\nDear Bishop Boyle:\n\nMr. J. E. Morris, our Inspector for the Maritimes, has recently reported favourably upon the work being done by the Reverend P.W.O. Murphy among the Indians at Lennox Island. It would seem that he is very fond of Indian work and is genuinely interested in their welfare. There are only some two hundred and fifty Indians at Lennox Island and consequently there will be no position to which the Department could appoint him. However, in view of Father Murphy's interest in and apparent ability for Indian mission work, it has been suggested that he be considered for full time employment elsewhere in the Maritimes.\n\nWe are very anxious to promote in every way the welfare of these Indians and realize only too well the great importance of having young, vigorous and interested Priests in our schools and reserves as leaders of every phase of community life.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMost Reverend James Boyle, D.D.,\nBishop of Charlottetown,\nCharlottetown, P.E.I.\nOttawa, December 22, 1947.\n\nDear Archbishop McNally:\n\nYou will recall that Mr. Phelan visited you last year to discuss the matter of replacing the Reverend Father Brown as principal of the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School.\n\nReports from our field officials indicate that Father Brown's health is not as good as it should be for one in such a responsible position. He is now over sixty-five years of age. Changes in the Civil Service Superannuation Act are such that only under very special and extenuating circumstances are we permitted to retain as civil servants anyone over the age of sixty-five. While these regulations do not apply naturally to such positions as principals of these schools, nevertheless, it is felt that where possible we should conform with this policy.\n\nWe realize that Father Brown has done very fine work at this school in the past. Our officials all agree that no one could show a more fatherly interest in the Indians. He has endeared himself to these people and has always been their champion.\n\nHowever, we feel that in the interests of the school administration and of the children therein, you should consider replacing him with a younger man. We fully appreciate the shortage of Priests and the difficulties\n\nMost Reverend J. T. McNally, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Halifax,\nHalifax, Nova Scotia.\n\n..... you\nyou might experience in obtaining a suitable successor.\n\nOur field officials have had opportunities of assessing the abilities of several Priests labouring in Indian mission work and might, if you so desired, be able to suggest the name of a satisfactory replacement.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector\nArchbishop's House  \nHalifax, N.S.  \nJanuary 8th, 1948\n\nMr. R.

Paul (no permanent place of abode)\".\n\nThe return for the quarter ended June 30th, 1947 stated that this girl was 16 years of age and we feel that before placing her in charge of her father who had no permanent place of abode, the Department should have been consulted. In this connection I would refer you to the latter part of Section 10 of the Indian Act which reads as follows:\n\n\"Provided that where it has been made to appear to the satisfaction of the Superintendent General (Minister) that it would be detrimental to any particular Indian child to have it discharged from school on attaining the full age of sixteen years, the Superintendent General (Minister) may direct that such child be detained at school for such further period as may seem to be advisable but not beyond the full age of eighteen years.\"\nThis part of Section 10 refers to cases such as the one under discussion and we feel that the management should be advised that in future they should keep this part of Section 10 in mind when pupils are being discharged, especially girls.\n\nBernard F.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended December 1st, 1941.\n\nPrincipal: ____________________________\n\nDated: January 1st, 1942.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: ____________________________\n\nDated: ...........................................\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY Certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shubenacadie Ind. Res. School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1941.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Jan. 12th, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at:\n\nthis\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shubenacadie Indian Res.

When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shubenacadie Ind.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered in the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 2nd 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 2nd 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 10\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: ____________________________\n\nDated: ____________________________\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: ____________________________\n\nDated: ____________________________\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1942.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: July 4th 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Quarter:** $\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.

When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Schoolnameand its School for the Quarter ended: December 31st 1942.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: January 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 1st 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this date 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residences of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 12, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this date, 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on this Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Signature]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading 'Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter'.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the 'Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter' by the 'Total number of days in quarter'.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the 'Average attendance of pupils during quarter' by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2; and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 15th 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagin No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Schoolname and Address School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1924.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 14th, 1925\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shubenacadie Ind.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.
