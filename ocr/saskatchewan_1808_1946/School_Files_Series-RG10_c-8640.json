The teacher's residence has about 8\" of water in the basement. This water has been pumped out several times but comes in again within 24 hours. This trouble arose after the well was drilled at the school over a year ago. It not only keeps the house damp but apparently is affecting the cement wall as the foundation at one corner is crumbling badly. It looks as though the gravel used in the wall was not free from clay and probably this is why the water has caused it to crumble. It is perhaps too late now to carry out the repair work necessary, but certainly the matter should be attended to next spring.\"\n\nIn reviewing our files the only reference to the above matter is contained in your letter of November 30, 1939, in which you stated that there was a slight leak around the casing but that you had managed to check it. The Department is surprised that you have allowed the condition mentioned by Inspector Hamilton to continue. Please let me know at once if there is any way of correcting the matter to which the Inspector refers.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. F.J. Clarke,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson, Man.\n\nR.A.

It would appear that the casing is loose as the water to the basement comes from outside the casing. I am of the opinion that before any work is done on the well we should call in someone experienced in this particular work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. J.

Clarke, Indian Agent,\nHodgson, Man.\n\nWith reference to requisition received from the teacher of the Peguis Centre Indian Day School, there is a request for 6 desks. These are made in three sizes: large, medium and small. Please let me know which size is needed.\n\nIt is also stated that the interior of the teacher's residence needs redecorating and that a galvanized tank is required for the residence. Please give me more specific information regarding the type and size of tank required. If this can be purchased locally, you should let me know its approximate cost. You should also state what expenditure would be required to redecorate the interior of the teacher's residence.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n528 Dominion Public School,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba,\nSeptember 15th, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Centre School - Peguis Reserve,\nFisher River Agency.\n\nI called at the Centre School on the Peguis Reserve on September 11th. I found 52 pupils present. 47 were Treaty and 5 non-treaty; of these two belonged to the Farmin G Instructor, Mr. Paterson, and three to the Missionary, Mr. Smith. There are seats for about 28. Of the 52 pupils about 25 are in Grade 1.\n\nTo relieve the situation I would suggest authority be granted to purchase a table 6'x3' with benches for the sides and ends. This table is for the pupils in Grade 1, and it could be placed at the front of the room near the teacher's desk. The Dowse Lumber Company, St. Boniface, have quoted the price of $69.00 f.o.b. Winnipeg. No other companies wished to do the work. I enclose the only quotation I could get.\n\nThe North and South Schools were not in operation as the teachers had not arrived. No doubt the same condition will exist. If tables are needed may they be supplied?\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nfor Manitoba.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, September 17, 1945.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nIn view of the large attendance at\nthe Peguis Centre School, the Department approves\nthe purchase of the table with benches, as suggested\nin the second paragraph of your letter. It is noted\nthat the cost of this equipment will be $69.00, f.o.b.\nWinnipeg.\n\nIf similar conditions exist at the\nPeguis North and South Schools and the same equipment\nis required, you may purchase same. When submitting\naccounts, you should forward a separate one for\neach school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| Item Description                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|----------------------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| brooms at 85\u00a2                    | 4        |            | 3.40  |\n| bars soap at 7\u00a2                  | 36       |            | 2.52  |\n| Chloride of lime at 13\u00a2          | 6        |            | 0.78  |\n| combs at 9\u00a2                      | 24       |            | 2.16  |\n| gallons floor oil at 85\u00a2         | 3        |            | 2.55  |\n\nTotal: $11.41\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\nPay to: **L.

It is understood that it will require two vans to do the work and the driver will provide teams, vans and heating for the vans.\n\nThis expenditure is approved and it is expected that you will arrange with the teachers to report to you any pupil who fails to attend school, especially in view of the fact that we are providing driving facilities for them.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDATE: NOV 1944\n\nM.

Hoey,\nDirector Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith reports of my annual inspection of Peguis and Fisher River Schools.\n\nSince payments of family Allowances have come into effect the three schools on Peguis Reserve are badly overcrowded, the one having an enrolment of 72 where 40 could conveniently be accommodated. These three schools have no transom windows nor other ventilation system.\n\nWould it be possible to have transom windows installed as soon as possible?\n\nYours truly,\n\nC.J. Muller.\nOttawa, 27th December, 1945.\n\nMr. P.G. Lazenby, Indian Agent, Hodgson, Manitoba.\n\nWhat the Inspector said regarding South Peguis School applies also to Centre Peguis School although the enrolment is not as large at the latter school.\n\nTo improve the ventilation, Inspector Muller suggests a transom window should be installed during the Christmas holidays. Authority is granted for you to have this work done.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Canada.\n\nWe refer to your letter of 27th December 1945 in regard to Centre Peguis School and note Mr Muller requests a transom window. We doubt if we could have this done till summer holidays, but will try and have this done over a week end.\n\nLike South Peguis, we could secure the W A Centre Hall for a second room. There is a good stove in this hall, but we would require complete school equipment otherwise, also fuel which could be purchased from the Indians. The rental would be $15.00 per month for the Hall. It's very near Centre School, maybe a quarter of a mile away.\n\nPGL/OT\n\nP G Lazenby, Indian Agent\n\nNote: The teacher for this room would have to live with Miss Clarke, at the Nurses residence, or have a room in the hospital or elsewhere if no accommodation there.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is noted that at each place you can secure a building which would be suitable for a temporary classroom.\n\nI am sending an Air Mail letter to Most Reverend L. R. Sherman, D.D., Archbishop of Rupert's Land, Bishop's Court, Winnipeg, Man., with a view to ascertaining if he can nominate two teachers.

I would certainly recommend that two classrooms be built to take care of these pupils. I do not think we should build expensive buildings. If classrooms could be built without basements and the floors insulated and heated by stoves, one residence would do the two teachers. These classrooms could be built alongside the existing schools.\n\nIf you will refer to my report on these schools, dated June 18th, it will give you a fair idea of the existing setup. These buildings could be purchased from the North American Lumber Company and put up for use this winter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.M.

Would you kindly advise if we could get Mr Dow from the Dominion water works branch.\n\nI was talking to Mr Dow about the situation and he is under the opinion that we would have to move the building from this site but before he could state definitely he would have to investigate the situation.\n\nFor your information the water in basement is about 6 ft deep now and the foundation is starting to deteriorate badly since the frost started to come out,\n\nI would recommend that an engineer come out and give his opinion of the situation.\n\nYour obedient.\n\nF. J. Clarke,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary.\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nDept. of Mines & Resources.\nOttawa Ont.\nOttawa,\nMay 18, 1942.\n\nEX'D A\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the teacher's residence at the Peguis Centre School. To secure the services of Mr. Dow it would be necessary to pay his expenses and the work involved hardly justifies this expenditure. I presume that the building to which he refers is not very large and it is felt that some competent man could be secured locally to do what work is necessary. Please make further inquiries in this regard and advise me later.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F.J. Clarke,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson, Man.\nDear Sir;-\n\nWith reference your letter 136-6-5 dated May 18th in my reply to mine of the 12th of May, regarding the services of Mr Gow engineer I think you mis-understood me there would be no expense other than possibly his car expense charged to our Dept, as Mr Gow I meant is with the Dominion Water & Power. I know Mr Gow would gladly come out and give us his opinion of the situation if he had permission from his department to do so.\n\nYour obedient,\n\nF. J. Clarke.\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nDept. of Mines & Resources.\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 17, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSurveys & Engineering Branch.\n\nI am sending forward herewith copy of a letter received by this Branch from Indian Agent Clarke, Hodgson, Manitoba. The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you could have an engineer undertake an inspection of the teacher's residence at the Peguis Centre Indian Day School on the Peguis Reserve. We are anxious that the repairs to this residence should be undertaken and completed prior to the opening of the school year on October first.\n\nEncl.\n\nDirector.\nDecember 2nd, 1942.\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Teacher's Residence, Peguis Centre Indian Day School, Fisher River Agency, Manitoba.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your memorandum of August 17th relative to the above. In the meantime we have been getting reports on this residence, the nature of its site and conditions prevailing there, but before making any recommendation to you we would ask to be advised whether you consider it important that there should be a basement or cellar under this residence.\n\nBriefly the site is not a good one for a residence. It is situated on a narrow strip of flat land between Fisher river and a swamp. The soil is water-logged with water from a swamp, from an open ditch near the residence, and from a flowing well near the residence which was sunk without the necessary casings having been placed in the well when it was drilled.\n\nProbably the best course to follow would be to put a new foundation without any basement under the house either on its present site or on a site a short distance away. If a basement is essential a drain from it to the river would have to be installed with a valve to prevent water backing up into the basement from the river during periods of high water. During such periods water from the surrounding soil would probably seep into the basement and would have to be pumped or bailed out. Another alternative might be to construct the basement with its floor very little below the natural surface of the ground which would necessitate a very large amount of filling being piled about the outside of the house, which would mean considerable expense and would result in a long set of steps from the house down to the road in front being necessary.\n\nWould you kindly advise if you consider a basement under this residence important or essential. If such a basement was intended only for the storage of roots or vegetables for winter use,\n\n(over)\nthis could probably be taken care of by the construction of a separate root house near the residence.\n\nJ. M. Wardle,\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nDecember 7, 1942.\n\nMr. F.J. Clarke, Indian Agent, Hedgson, Man.\n\nWith reference to your letter of August 11, I attach copy of report received from the Surveys & Engineering Branch in connection with the teacher's residence at the Peguis Centre Day School. I should appreciate your comments on this report.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI am in receipt of the copy of the report from the Surveys & Engineering Branch re the residence at the Peguis Centre School.\n\nI am of the opinion that it would be best to put a new foundation under this building without a basement either on the same ground or close to the same ground. This work however would now have to wait until spring.\n\nW. J. Clarke,\nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nDecember 28, 1942.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Teacher's residence, Peguis Centre\nIndian Day School, Fisher River\nAgency, Man.\n\nOn receipt of your memorandum of the 2nd instant I wrote to the Indian Agent. He states that he considers a foundation is necessary but that a basement is not required.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you could have your engineer let me have an estimate of the probable cost of doing this work next spring.\n\nActing Director.\nDecember 29th, 1942.\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Teacher's residence, Peguis Centre\nIndian Day School, Fisher River\nAgency, Man.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your memorandum of December 22nd, advising that the Indian Agent considers a foundation under this building necessary but that a basement is not required.\n\nAs you know this matter has been under consideration by our Engineering and Construction Service and to meet the needs of the situation, bearing in mind the fact that no basement is required, they have advised as follows:\n\n\"Under the circumstances, it is felt that as recommended by Mr. Storsater in his report dated September 18th, the building should be moved west approximately 20'. This distance is approximately as far as the property line permits, and would be clear of the existing basement excavation, which should be filled.\n\n\"The existing superstructure should be placed on a new concrete foundation 3'6\" high and 9\" thick, having a footing 1'6\" wide and 9\" thick. The footing should be placed not lower than the 99 foot elevation shown on Mr. Storsater's profile. This would be approximately 2' below the average existing grade in the vicinity of the residence. After moving the superstructure, the area surrounding the new foundation should be graded for a width of 10' on all sides to elevation 103.

M. Wardle,\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 2, 1943.\n\nMr. F.J. Clarke, Indian Agent, Hodgson, Man.\n\nOn receipt of your letter of December 16, with reference to the teacher's residence at the Peguis Centre School, we again took up the matter with the Surveys & Engineering Branch. They reply as follows:\n\n\"As you know this matter has been under consideration by our Engineering and Construction Service and to meet the needs of the situation, bearing in mind the fact that no basement is required, they have advised as follows:\n\n\"'Under the circumstances, it is felt that as recommended by Mr. Storsater in his report dated September 18th, the building should be moved west approximately 20'. This distance is approximately as far as the property line permits, and would be clear of the existing basement excavation, which should be filled.\n\n\"The existing superstructure should be placed on a new concrete foundation 3'6\" high and 9\" thick, having a footing 1'6\" wide and 9\" thick. The footing should be placed not lower than the 99 foot elevation shown on Mr. Storsater's profile. This would be approximately 2' below the average existing grade in the vicinity of the residence. After moving the superstructure, the area surrounding the new foundation should be graded for a width of 10' on all sides to elevation 103. By this method the foundation walls would have 4' of protection against frost penetration, and the footings would be higher than the reported high water level of the Fisher River, while the main floor of the house would be maintained at the existing 104 foot elevation.'\"\n\"The cost of the work involved would likely be in the neighbourhood of $800, but it is possible that repairs to the house which might become necessary as a result of moving it, might amount to an additional $100.\"\n\nIf the suggestion of the Surveys & Engineering Branch is carried out you will note that the expenditure will be in the neighbourhood of $900.00. Do you think it advisable to incur this expenditure on the present building? It is possible that the erection of a new building would be cheaper and more satisfactory. Your comments would be appreciated.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nThe secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI have your letter 136-6-8 of Jan 2/43 re the moving of the residence at the reguis Centre Day School.\n\nIn my opinion the suggestion of the Surveys & Engineering Branch is quite practical and this building is in good repair other than the foundation. A similar building could not be erected for $900.00 at present prices of material.\n\nF. J.

I told them I would write the Department advising them of the fact and endeavour to ascertain their intentions.\n\nI am inclined to think their haste to have a school-house is with a view of getting Councillor Prince, who is an educated man, the position of teacher.\n\nWhen Inspector Semmens returned from Ottawa, he told me there was a possibility of another Indian Agent being appointed for the reserves in the middle of Lake Winnipeg with headquarters at the Peguis Reserve. If the Department have this still in view I think it would be well to wait until the Agent was appointed before taking any steps in the matter, because it is hard to decide the best place for building a school-house just from a visit to the reserve, and in all probability there will eventually be enough children on the reserve for two or more schools, in which event great care should be taken to see they are properly located.\n\nI am Sir,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I think we had better correspond with Inspector Semmens and if we decide to take action we can provide the money from our current Vote without making any special appropriation as there is a certain margin available.\n\nOttawa, 14th November, 1910.\nBishop's Court,\nWinnipeg, Man., Dec. 17, 1910.\n\nCan you kindly let me know whether any steps are taken towards establishing a school at the new reserve at Fisher River?\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n(Signed) S.

Mr. Simmons, who recently visited this reserve. Having in view the recommendations made by this officer the Department has decided to erect next summer two day schools to meet the needs of these people and detailed estimates of the cost have been asked for.

No information is given as to Prince's qualifications, but it is presumed that he is an Indian.

He is a fair scholar and as he is a cripple having lost one hand it was thought that the appointment might serve the double purpose of keeping him from want and keeping the school going.\n\nIt will be remembered that I reported a short time ago that it would be difficult to get a suitable boarding house for a white teacher at or near this school but Angus Prince lives quite near and can reach the school without difficulty.\n\nIt is not presumed that he will continue teaching after it becomes convenient to send a properly qualified teacher in to take charge.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector Indian Agencies\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nOttawa, November 24, 1911.\n\nRev.

Flett, Miles Ochran, Jacob Thomas and Isaac Asham, Mr Albert Spence and John Settee, trustees of the North Peguis School made the following charges against Mr Angus Prince, Teacher of the North Peguis School:\n\n1. That the teacher closes the school frequently without permission.\n\n2. That the teacher does not distribute the yarn justly.\n\n3. That the teacher acts in an unbecoming manner towards the girls attending the school.\n\nHarriet Stevenson, present, stated that the teacher had upon several occasions placed his hands upon her legs and person in a suggestive manner. Alice Settee, present, stated that the teacher upon one occasion lifted up her clothes, she pushed him away when the teacher told her he loved her the best of all the girls in the school and gave her a pair of rubbers and 5\u00a2 telling her not to say anything about his act.\n\nSarah Stevenson stated that the teacher had upon several occasions acted in an unbecoming manner towards her, lifting up her clothes and placing his hand upon her in a suggestive way and had given her 5\u00a2 more than once.\n\nAlex Stevenson, present, stated that he would not send his children to school so long as Mr A. Prince was the teacher.\n\nJohn H. Flett and Alfred Stevenson also stated they would not send their children to school under Mr Prince.\n\nMr George Stevenson stated that Mr Prince had sent his boy home from school for no reason whatever.\n\nRemanded to April 19th for the presence of the teacher and further evidence.\nPaguis Reserve.\n\nApril 19th/13.\n\nChristie Passage stated that the teacher had once taken hold of her lifted up her clothes and commenced to unfasten his own, then suddenly releasing her had prayed to The Almighty to forgive him.\n\nHarriet Stevenson, recalled, and questioned stated that in December last she had apologised to the teacher for the circulation of charges made by her against the teacher who told her that she must repeat her apology before the whole school which she did denying that the teacher had ever acted as stated towards her, but that it was after her apology that the teacher had committed the acts complained of when she was attending school; this was denied by the teacher, also the register shows that Harriet Stevenson has not attended school since her apology.\n\nMr A. Prince stated that when school had been closed without permission was when there was no wood cut for heating the school.\n\nMr Prince had only received yarn (4 skeins) once which he accounted for.\n\nMr Prince denied that he had ever acted towards the girls attending the school as charged against him but that it was jealousy and spite on the part of some of the parents of children attending school which had caused the trouble, and that the parents and Mr A. Settee had induced and posted the girls to make the charges and what to say.\n\nThis was denied by Mr Settee.\nOttawa, May 14, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ult., inclosing statements of charges made against the teacher of the North Peguis school, Mr. Angus Prince, and a resolution of council relative to his resignation.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, without going into the merits of the charges made against Mr. Prince, the Department is of opinion that it would be in the interests of the school to have a change of teacher. When Mr. Prince was first appointed it was understood that the appointment was temporary, pending the obtaining of the services of one with better qualifications.\n\nYou may, therefore, inform Mr. Prince that his services will not be required after June 30, next, and you will be good enough to institute enquiries with a view to securing a successor. You might communicate with Mr. Inspector Bunn, who will consult the Anglican Church authorities. All applications should be submitted to the Department.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nT. H.

His attendance at the school for the quarter ending December 31st 1913, was 25.94%, this means that, by his work and close attention to the duties, he has almost doubled the attendance. He is also bringing the pupils along very well; he enjoys the confidence of the parents and pupils to a very marked degree, so that his usefulness as a teacher can be expected to continue. I beg therefore to recommend that this young man should have his request for the increase he asks for, granted, and that his salary, commencing the 1st April 1914, should be at the rate of $500.00 per annum.

I have no intention whatever of resigning my position as teacher as I do not deem it at all necessary.\n\nI have today made enquiries and find it a clear case of jealousy owing to my keeping young Kenneth at my house which prompted these two people to play a trick on me. I am however quite satisfied now as Mrs Flett came and owned to the whole thing and said she was sorry but was sometimes unaccountable for her actions. I told her however to go and see you. I would therefore ask you to favour me by overlooking the whole matter, and I shall endeavour to do my work to the best of my ability for I know there has been no real harm done seeing the people refuse to believe it, and I shall in future dismiss all children from my home if my sister comes, if not, I shall give up the house and go somewhere to board as I am all the time troubled with my heart.\n\nI hope, Sir, this will meet with your entire approval and to all parties concerned, but however should you believe the statements made, I shall be quite prepared to fight the case to clear my name, if you will allow me time to consult a Winnipeg Solicitor.\n\nBut I trust you will favour me by overlooking this matter entirely.\n\nI beg to remain\n\nyours very sincerely\n\n(Signed) H.J.Ayres.\n\nT.H.Carter Esqr,\nIndian Agent,\nPeguis Reserve, Man.\n\n478218\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant having reference to relations between yourself and Indians and Indian boys in the Peguis band.\n\nI greatly regret having to take any steps whatever in the matter, but owing to the most serious condition of affairs to which the words of your letter would seem to infer, I feel it to be my duty to order an investigation.\n\nI would also strongly advise your early resignation from the office of teacher, as, without the slightest thought or wish to even hint at the possibility of your being guilty of the charges of which you seem to think it possible may be made against you, you must see that, with such awful reports evidently already in circulation, your usefulness as a teacher is most seriously handicapped and your continuation in office will be very unpleasant for yourself.\n\nI must report the matter to the Department, as if the people are simply as you state, trying to work up a case against you without foundation, they must be punished, but I must say I think you have been unwise to give colour to the reports by having the young Indian boys at your home.\n\nPlease let me hear from you before the mail goes out.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nyour obedient servant\n\nMr. F.J.

There are some young men and Mrs John Flett and Stevenson who hate me on account of me stopping the bad doings with the small boys. Now I must add Mrs Flett has tried to work this thing for quite a long time.\n\nWell last night I was alone, Kenneth Prince having gone to Hodgson, so Mrs Flett asked me would I like her boy here in case of course I took sick again, I said alright. In the evening we played cards with Albert (Mrs Stevenson's boy) who knew of this all the time. All went well, we went to bed; now it is true I got wrestling and playing and tickling this boy, but as far as any bad intentions towards him I say I am entirely innocent.\n\nI do not know whether they claim I did anything actually to the boy or not but I do know they are trying to make a lot out of it. He got up and asked me for a drink of water which he got he then said I must go outside and then ran home without coat or hat or shoes to try and shew he was frightened. But Mr Carter I know enough about that same boy to know that had I really meant anything bad he would not have run off.\n\nNow I can only leave the matter to your judgement if it is brought to you, but all that I have said is an exact and true history of what happened. I am awfully sorry for all these happenings but some people seem bent on getting me into trouble if they can. However I shall hope to have my sister here in about three weeks when I will dispense with any Indians being here. Hoping you will believe my word as I assure you I have never done any bad thing to boys in my life and hope to be able to refrain from such a thing. But these people hate young Kenneth being with me as I have stopped and practically made it\nit impossible for the boys to touch him and they would like to catch me on the same case.\n\nHoping my returns were all in order and that you are all well.\n\nAsking your forgiveness for there coming up so much trouble through I suppose my not understanding the people, I remain\n\ny ours very sincerely\n\n(Signed) H.J.Ayres\n\nI think if you will ask these people they must own they have planned at this for weeks.\n\n478218\nSir,\n\nI respectfully beg to enclose copies of letters between the Teacher of the North Peguis School and myself regarding alleged proceedings at the home of the teacher.\n\nThe letters will explain themselves, but I may remark that I advised Mr Ayres not to have these boys at his home and not to play cards with them; this he promised to stop but he admits in his letter of the 10th that he indulged in the practice with Albert Stevenson and the Flett boy.\n\nI am of the opinion that it would be advisable to terminate Mr Ayres services but will leave for your judgement, with the request that the Department will advise Mr Ayres direct as it may be possible I shall be away in connection with the annuity payments in the Fisher River Agency when your letter arrives.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, April 20th, 1915.\n\nDear Sir -\n\nI have your communication of the 15th instant, with enclosures, in reference to Mr. Ayres, teacher of the North Peguis School, and in reply, I beg to say that Mr. Ayres' services are to be dispensed with immediately upon receipt of this communication, and you will advise him accordingly, and submit a return for the time that the school has been opened during the present quarter, so that the balance of salary due him may be made.\n\nYou might communicate with Inspector Bunn and ask him to consult with Archbishop Macdonald with a view to securing the services of a competent successor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

For some time during the past year there were quite serious complaints made against Mr. Asham, the teacher at the North Peguis School. So strong were the complaints that Mr. Carter advised, and I agreed with him, that it would be prudent to secure a new teacher for the beginning of the year. Though I endeavored to procure one I was not successful until a day or two ago when a Mr. Charles R. Harbord, a returned soldier, applied for one of our Schools. After examining carefully into his credentials, and also his Scholarship I have no hesitation in recommending him. If the Department approves of my nomination will you kindly intimate the same to Archdeacon Thomas, 901 Somerset Block, Winnipeg, who will be acting in my absence while I am away at the Pacific Coast. With kind regards, I am,\n\nMost sincerely yours,\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nIndian Office,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, January 17, 1922.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Scott:\n\nMr. Nathaniel Asham, an Indian, has been teaching at the North Peguis Indian Day School. He has been in the employ of the Department as a teacher for 4\u00bd years. He is not professionally qualified. The salary paid is $500 per annum, plus bonus. A short time ago he made an unsuccessful application for an increase.\n\nThe serious complaints against Mr. Asham, mentioned in the Bishop's letter, have not been brought to the attention of the Department. Mr. Asham's home is near the school and one-half the pupils in regular attendance are of the same name as himself.\n\nR.T.F.\nOttawa, Jan. 17th\n\nMr. Schorlo\n\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\nJanuary 17th, 1922.\n\nDear Archbishop Matheson,\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant with reference to the North Peguis day school, and note that you have an application for this position from Mr. Charles R.

It is noted that you will have the assistance of a friend, a teacher possessing first class qualifications, in the work. The Department will continue your salary, but you will have to make your own arrangements for any remuneration necessary for assistance. It is also noted that you have taken up this matter with His Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land and that it will be satisfactory to His Grace for you to remain until the end of June.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The Department requested her to reconsider the matter, and, if possible, to remain and complete the balance of the present school year. Miss Collen now informs the Department that she will remain until the end of the school term and that she has arranged with a friend, a teacher holding first class qualifications, to help her. She also states that she has consulted Your Grace in the matter. Her resignation will be accepted as from June 30th, next.\n\nI would request that Your Grace kindly arrange to nominate a qualified teacher in due time to succeed Miss Collen, and to begin duties when the school reopens after the summer holidays, on or about September 1st, next.

Colson, teacher of the North Peguis Indian Day School. Miss Colson had written me saying that she would have to give up, but a few days afterwards she wrote saying that she would stay on till the end of June.\n\nI shall endeavor to nominate a qualified teacher to take the place of Miss Colson, and to begin duties after the Summer holidays on or about the first of September.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nIsaac O. Rupert Land\nWinnipeg, Man., October 16th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith my report on the Peguis North Day School which was inspected on September 28th, 1936.\n\nMiss Eaton had received permission to leave for Winnipeg to consult an Eye Specialist, consequently the school was not in operation. The two days will be made up later.\n\nA. G. Hamilton.\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDear Sir:\n\nPeguis North Indian Day School\nFisher River Agency\n\nI wish to submit the following report on the above school which was inspected February 25, 1941:\n\nMiss A. Eaton is in charge of this school. She met with an accident before Christmas and was off duty for a few weeks, but is now apparently quite well again. Miss Eaton has had years of experience in teaching and is doing good work, not only in the classroom but also among the Indians.\n\nThere are 23 pupils enrolled, but I found only 9 present. The average attendance for December was 20.36. The poor attendance is due to the \"flu\" and bad colds. Two small children died during the week of my visit and many more were sick.\n\nThe children are making fair progress. They were clean, but some were poorly clad. All the pupils are instructed in spinning yarn and knitting, and the work seen was indeed quite good. The pupils are also knitting socks and scarves for the Red Cross.\n\nSome plaster is off one side of the room, and when possible, this should be repaired. It is difficult in these outlying districts to secure a competent man to do this work. The stove is also warped beyond repair and is unsafe. A new stove should be provided. A flag is also needed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA,\nCanada.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to submit the following report on the schools in the Fisher River Agency, inspected during the week of November 17, 1941:\n\nPEGUIS NORTH INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nMiss Eaton is in charge of this school and is doing splendid work. She has made marked progress with these children and has also done good work with her Women's Club. There are 26 pupils enrolled, and 19 were present. The grades are arranged as follows:\n\nGrade 1 - 18 pupils\n2 - 1 \"\n3 - 2 \"\n4 - 3 \"\n5 - 2 \"\n\nThe classroom work is good. The children were clean but scantily clad.\n\nRed Cross work is carried on and already five small children have each knit one sock. They have also knit almost enough squares for an afghan.\n\nThe school and residence are in good repair. The repair carried out on the classroom walls by the use of wall board has made a big improvement and looks well.\n\nA.G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI wish to report as follows on the North Peguis Indian Day School, inspected July 17th, 1943.\n\nMiss Eaton is in charge and she is doing very excellent work. The grades are as follows:\n\n| Grade | Pupils |\n|-------|--------|\n| 1     | 16     |\n| 2     | 6      |\n| 3     | 2      |\n| 5     | 2      |\n| 6     | 2      |\n\n28\n\nSeventeen were present. A few of those absent were off the Reserve with their parents.\n\nThe exercises in their work-books were neatly set down. The writing was good and the work well done.\n\nThe classroom was tidy and the floor clean. The building is in good repair.\n\nThe teacher's residence is in good condition and the yards were tidy. There is about three feet of water in the basement. Perhaps when the Dominion Water Power men are working on the South Peguis School we could have them take levels and find out if there is sufficient drop to allow putting a drain line from the basement. This condition should be corrected if at all possible.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI submit the following report on the Schools of\nthe Fisher River Agency, inspected between January 17th and 21st:\n\nNorth Peguis Indian Day School\n\nMiss Eaton is in charge. There were eighteen\npresent - nine boys and nine girls. The grades were as follows:\n\nGrade 1 - 7 pupils\n\" 2 - 5 \"\n\" 3 - 5 \"\n\" 6 - 1 \"\n\nThe children were well dressed, clean and neat\nin appearance. They speak out quite clearly and read with understanding.\nI am convinced they are making fair progress.\n\nThe school needs interior painting. The upper\nhalf of the walls was covered last year with ten-test and it has never\nbeen painted. The ceiling is badly discoloured so that the room has a\ndull, dismal appearance.\n\nThe exterior of the school and residence was\npainted last year and is in good condition. The basement of the teacher's\nresidence is now dry and we hope the work done last year to drain it will\nbe of lasting benefit.\n\nCentre Peguis Indian Day School\n\nMiss Alice Clarke is the teacher in charge, and\nI find her greatly interested in all the children.\n\nThere are twenty-nine enrolled and nineteen were\npresent. The grades are as follows:\n\nGrade 1 - 9 pupils\n2 - 7 \"\n3 - 3 \"\n4 - 1 \"\n5 - 2 \"\n6 - 1 \"\n7 - 5 \"\n8 - 1 \"\n\nThe room was tidy and well aired. All the pupils\nwere well dressed and clean in appearance. They appear to be well along in\ntheir respective grades and steady progress is maintained.\n\nThe interior needs decorating and if possible this\nshould be painted this coming summer.\n\nLast summer both the school and residence were\npainted outside. Repairs were made to the school foundation and the joists\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6243, file 533-1, part 2)\nrenewed. The school residence was moved and placed on a complete new foundation. All this work has apparently been well done and the buildings are now in good repair.\n\nSouth Peguis Indian Day School\n\nMrs. Shergold is the teacher in charge. She has a very pleasing personality and is well liked by the pupils.\n\nThe roll calls for fifty pupils and the grades are as follows:\n\n| Grade | Pupils |\n|-------|--------|\n| 1     | 26     |\n| 2     | 12     |\n| 3     | 6      |\n| 4     | 6      |\n\nThe attendance has been poor due to the fact that some children live three and four miles away and in addition during November and December many were sick with the \"Flu\". The pupils attending regularly are making good progress.\n\nThis school also needs interior painting. The walls are dark and the ceiling badly discoloured. The exteriors of the school and residence were painted a year ago and are in good condition.\n\nA special effort should be made both by the teacher and Agent to secure better attendance. Perhaps some children enrolled live too far away; but if there is no unusual sickness, the attendance should range around thirty. To date this has not been the case.\n\nIndian Improved Day School - Fisher River\n\nIn this school we have Miss Smith-Windsor in charge of the senior room, with thirty-three enrolled, and Miss Macsell in the junior room with forty-three pupils. The attendance has been fair, but there is room for improvement. A number of the Indians have been camped with their families near the lake where they are fishing, and consequently the children could not get to school; however, most of these people have moved back now so that the attendance should be much better.\n\nThe pupils are well along in their respective grades and the work seen was well done and neatly set down. I am certain the children are making good progress.\n\nThe pupils were all well dressed; many with dresses, skirts, coats and windbreakers made from Army clothing. These were all re-modelled, and the average person would never know the material was from old Army clothes. The sewing Club under the direction of Miss Smith-Windsor has done some excellent work.\n\nThe school building is badly in need of exterior painting and if at all possible this should be done during the coming summer. The front and back steps are also badly rotted and must be renewed.\n\nThe furnaces appear in good condition and the building was warm and comfortable.\n\nA.G.

Consequently it is very difficult to accommodate them.\n\nI would recommend that the beginners at these schools, who are in the majority, be divided and given half day instruction - half in the mornings and the other half in the afternoons. This would relieve the congestion and give the teacher a better chance, as well as giving all the pupils at least some education, and some comfort.\n\nPlease advise me if the Department approves of this suggestion.\n\nP.G.

In view of the conditions existing, you may carry out the suggestion contained in your letter. However, if there are prospects that the enrolment will remain as high in future years as it is at present, I would like to have some special recommendation from you regarding what action you think can be taken to relieve the situation.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division\nIN reply to Mr Phelan's letter of October 17th last file 136-4-1 in regard to large attendance's in our Reserve Schools, I have no special recommendation that I could put forward to relieve the situation, except to build.\n\nWe have every reason to believe that the enrolment of children will remain high in these Schools, as the parents are anxious to collect their Family Allowances. As long as Children have to go to school to be eligible for the Allowance, just so long will our attendance remain high.\n\nPGL/OT\n\nF G Lazenby, Indian Agent\nOttawa, 17th January, 1946.\n\nMost Reverend Sir:\n\nRegarding my recent letter with reference to securing two teachers for the schools on the Peguis Reserve, the Indian Agent has now recommended a second classroom be opened if possible at the Peguis North School. We are prepared to do this if we can secure another teacher. Any assistance that you can give us in this regard will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMost Rev. L.R. Sherman, M.A., B. Litt., D.D.,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nTrinity Hall,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nREPORT ON FISHER RIVER AGENCY\n\nPeguis Reserve:\n\nThe Family Allowance is certainly a blessing. The teachers state those bringing lunches have fruit, cheese, eggs and good bread. They are much better clothed and indeed the parents state they have sent orders for clothing which could not be supplied. Right now many children have no high rubbers or rubber boots and so are kept home. For days the roads have been almost impassable to walk on except with high rubber boots. I saw a twelve-year old girl come home last week wet to the knees. If we insist on the children going to school under all conditions, we will have plenty of sickness and no doubt many cases of pneumonia.\n\nThe Indians have tried to purchase high rubbers locally and from Eaton's and Simpsons. Only the odd pair has been secured. Many children travel from two to four miles, which is a long way even under good conditions. I am convinced the Indians are trying to co-operate and I hope distance, roads, weather and health will be considered on judging results.\n\nMore schools are required. On Peguis we need at least three. The building of more accommodation should receive early consideration.\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept' of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to advise the Department that from present indications, there will be at least five new day school teachers required for the school of this agency after the summer holidays, and probably six, as follows:\n\nPeguis North School - 1\nPeguis Centre \" 2\nPeguis South \" 2\n\nThe above, provided we are able to equip the three Anglican Church Halls for use as day schools, and get teachers for them as well as for the schools already established, and which are much overcrowded.\n\nMiss Una McDonald, who is the present teacher at the Peguis North School, says she will come back again next term, provided another teacher can be secured and the school divided.\n\nThere is no teacher at all now at the Peguis Centre School, and this school too should be divided and two teachers provided, one to teach in the church hall.\n\nThe present teacher at the Peguis South school, Mrs Hamrlik, has already sent in her resignation, as she wishes to stay with her family on their farm. This school also, should be divided, and two teachers provided.\n\nI have been told, though I have not verified, that Miss Wakentin, one of the teachers at the Fisher River United Church School is not returning after the holidays. If this turns out to be the case, another teacher will be required for this school. I will definitely advise the Department as to this later, after I have seen Miss Wakentin.\n\nAs I have already advised the Department, we can rent the three Anglican Church Halls on the Peguis reserve to use for day schools. However, if we are unable to secure the necessary number of teachers, it would be no use equipping these halls with school furnishings. I would therefore respectfully recommend that an early effort be made by the Department to secure the teachers required, and then the equipping of the halls could be proceeded with, and completed before the new school term begins in September next.\n\nP.G. Lazenby\nIndian Agent.\nJune 27, 1946.\n\nMr. P. G. Lazenby, Indian Agent,\nHodgson, Manitoba.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to the three day schools on the Peguis Reserve.\n\nThe Department is communicating with Most Reverend L.R. Sherman, Archbishop of Rupert's Land, requesting him to nominate five new teachers. As soon as we have definite information regarding the new nominees, you will be advised so that, if we secure the number required, you can arrange for renting the three church halls for the academic year 1946-47.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, 25 September 1946.\n\nDear Archbishop Sherman:\n\nPlease refer to official letter of June 26th requesting you to nominate a second teacher for the Peguis South School. We have not heard from you regarding this nomination and today we are in receipt of a letter from the Indian Agent pointing out the necessity for a second teacher. Under the circumstances it would be appreciated if you would let us know what likelihood there is of securing the teacher mentioned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMost Reverend L.R. Sherman, M.A., B.Litt., D.D.,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nTrinity Hall,\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba\nOttawa, July 7, 1947.\n\nMr. P. G. Lazenby, Indian Agent,\nHodgson, Manitoba.\n\nPeguis North Indian Day School -\n\nAs pointed out in our letter concerning the Peguis South School, it is our policy to consider the opening of an extra classroom when the average attendance at a school is over 30. Our records show the following attendance at Peguis North School:\n\nDecember Quarter - 32.8\nMarch Quarter - 28.6\n\nThe opening of an extra classroom would seem to be a borderline case. However, we would appreciate receiving from you the same information as required at Peguis South.\n\nPeguis Centre Day School\n\nYou will soon be receiving details of our proposals for erecting a clerk's residence at Peguis Centre. We are giving this construction priority over the Fisher River Indian Day School, so that we will be able to open the Peguis Centre School in September.\n\nBernard F.

(RG 10, Volume 6243, file 533-1, part 2)\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDep't of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Peguis North Indian Day School.\n\nI beg to refer to Mr. B.F. Neary's letter, File 136-4-1 (W T) of the 7th July last regarding the above noted subject.\n\nOn examining the church hall connected with the Anglican North Peguis Church, to see if it could be used as an extra class room for this school, I found the building in very bad condition. The roof leaks badly, all the windows are broken including some of the frames, a new door and door frame would have to be provided, and part of the floor would have to be repaired or relaid with new flooring. It is estimated that the materials and labour required to put this building in good enough shape for use as an extra class room, would cost approximately between $300.00 and $400.00, and I do not consider that the building is worth this expenditure.\n\nI would therefore recommend, seeing that this is described by Mr. Neary as a 'borderline case', that no change be made this year at this school.

I trust that the Department will approve of the holiday as stated above.\n\nI would also request that some action be instituted immediately to provide another teacher for this school, to take over when Mr. Pomeroy leaves on August 31st.\n\nP.G.

I am returning, attached hereto, her Inspector's report dated May, 1912.\n\nWe hesitate to accept the application of Mrs. Bell, in view of the fact that she has not taught school since 1919. Our experience with teachers who have been absent from teaching duties for so long a period of time is such that great care must be taken before hiring such applicants.\n\nIf you have not already done so, I suggest that you contact our Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies for Manitoba, Mr. R. S. Davis, 538 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Man., and discuss with him the personal suitability of Mrs. Bell for teaching in Indian day schools. Actually it is a matter which can best be settled after a personal interview with the applicant, and a decision can then be reached as to her suitability. I will expect to hear further from you concerning this matter.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Heary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMr. F.G.

It appears that you are uncertain as to the meaning of some sections of the return:\n\n1. Section 4, the average daily attendance is found by dividing the total actual attendance for the whole school by the number of days the school was in session. The quotient thus obtained need not be divided by two, as you have done, since you have already found the average daily attendance for the school.\n\n2. Section 6 refers to the number of pupils attending school some time during the month. Section 17 also refers only to those pupils who attended school during the month, and their numbers are shown in a breakdown according to grades. Therefore, sections 6 and 17 must agree. If any children are absent during the whole month they will not be included in either section 6 or 17.\n\nWe trust that this information will be helpful to you in completing monthly returns in the future and we are enclosing your March and April returns for correction.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nEnclosure:\nJuly 21, 1949.\n\nMr. R.

Nield,\nA/Superintendent, Indian Agency,\nHodgson, Manitoba.\n\nPeguis No. 4 Indian Day School\nMurdoch Indian Day School\n\nWe have checked over the list of school attached to your letter of October 15 and are clear on everything but one point. Before taking definite action with the Treasury, would you please confirm the statement made in paragraph one of your letter. Miss Aime (Mrs. Breule) was placed on our pay list as the junior teacher of the Peguis No. 4 School effective November 15, 1948. We had no knowledge whatsoever that she resigned in February and we are wondering whether there has been some mistake. We have already advised you concerning the return of the two cheques sent to this teacher in over-payment for the month of September.\n\nIf the information in your letter of October 15 is correct, then this teacher has been overpaid ever since February as she has not been teaching since than time.\n\nHowever, our records indicate that Miss Jone was never at the Peguis No. 4 School but that she was appointed on April 25 at the Murdoch School (see Mr. Bowell's letter of April 26, your file 73 (136)). As we sent her a salary letter at the Murdoch School, it is presumed that she must have reported there and taught there until the end of June.\n\nShe is, of course, now at the Lake St. Martin Indian Day School.\nWe will expect to hear from you verifying the statement made in paragraph one of your letter.\n\nThere is one other small point raised in your letter with regard to Miss Phoenix. Our records show that she was transferred to the Peguis No. 2 School and that she left the No. 4 School at the end of June. I presume this transfer must never have taken place.\n\nBernard F.

Aimee. We have now been advised by the Indian Superintendent that she resigned effective July 1, 1949. She has married and her name is Mrs. E.J. Breule.\n\nIn a letter dated October 26 the local Indian Superintendent informs us that he has requested her to return her salary cheque or cheques to Ottawa. When these have been received by you they may be deposited, and you may then forward her Retirement Fund Deduction cheque to her in care of Mr. D.A.H.

You should state how many Indians are now located on the reserve and whether they are so situated that a school can be erected at a central site. If so you should deal fully with the matter of location as well as the size and style of building that would be required to accommodate the children.\n\nThe Indians are pressing for the establishment of a day school and the Department is prepared to meet their wishes if the time is now opportune.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\n\nRev. J. Samsara,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nAs an objection to this class of school it might be urged that it will take much time to get it started. All the next summer would pass before it could be prepared for active work and in the meantime the children would be without any advantage.\n\nAgain it would cost very much more than the day schools even if two of them were built.\n\nA third objection might arise out of the fact that any school of this type should have a large constituency to draw from.\n\nStill another difficulty arises from the fact that the situation is remote and at present rather inaccessible by boat or rail routes and Officers might object to the location and freighting would be expensive.\n\nAll this is granted and these things are worthy of consideration, however Old Fisher River Reserve has a population has a population of nearly 500 and the New Reserve has about 25 making 725 people with 325 children and if the proposed school has accommodation for say 50 children it will be seen that there need be no lack of pupils.\n\nThen the railroad is now within forty miles of the New Reserve and is coming nearer every year and boats land at the present time within twenty miles of Peguis and they enter the Old Reserve at the present time, without difficulty. This makes the question of transportation more simple than it appears at first sight.\n\nPersonally I would be disposed to recommend that the School be erected on Government land between the Reserves and that it be made to serve them both and that it be a non denominational institution from the start and all the way through. This would I think do away with all feelings of jealousy between the Reserves and would allow of the closing of the present day School at Old Fisher River and would in the long run be the most effective way of educating the Indian children of the locality.\nThe religion of the old Reserve is Methodist and Shaker. The new Reserve is wholly Episcopalian and there must be an air of independence maintained so as to suit the parties interested.\n\nThe people at Peguis are really the pick of the St Peters people and are worthy of consideration.\n\nNow I have reviewed the situation as I see it and have made recommendations from my point of view and am prepared to receive any direction the Department may wish to give and see that orders are carried out whether they are in accord with my views or not.\n\nIf Day Schools are ordered the building should be 30 ft long by 32 feet wide and 10 ft high with an arched ceiling so as to admit of ample breathing space.\n\nIf only one School is built it should be built at the east end where the greatest number of people are found. I would also say that the site chosen should be nearly two miles from the eastern boundary.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nCanada\nInspector Semmens' Report on the Fisher River School Question.\n\nInspectors Office\n376142 Winnipeg Manitoba\nNovember 22nd 1910\n\nReply to your favor No 347989 of Nov 19th 1910\n\nSir,\n\nHaving recently visited the Fisher River Country especially the Peguis Reserve and having met the Indians in Council and reviewed with them the great need of school privileges; I am constrained to make a few observations in regard to the educational question, all the more so because the Department is anxious to act promptly in the way most suited to the needs of the people.\n\nThe number of houses now built at Fisher River on the new Reserve is 41. The population is 225 and the number of children is about 100. These children at the present time are running wild and the parents are clamoring for the benefits of a School and a properly qualified teacher. The need of action is very apparent.\n\nThe important question however is how to act so as to meet the requirements of the case and secure the greatest good for the greatest number.\n\nAs Day Schools are all that these people have had so far, it is perhaps wise to think first of them. They are most easily supplied and are the cheapest form of accommodation furnished by the Department and may be thought most advisable by some because they can be set in motion in the shortest possible space.\n\nIt is clear that one School will not do for this Reserve. The people are settled at opposite ends of\nthe Reserve. When the first comers arrived they entered from the Old Fisher Reserve side. There was ahead of them some 6 miles of old Reserve 4 miles of space between Reserves and naturally enough they were glad to camp and select locations on the easterly side of the Peguis Reserve. After one or two had settled there others followed until a large cluster of houses was found not far inside the lines of their new heritage. Others coming later were compelled to go farther in.\n\nThen there came a time when it was found that a nearer road could be found and men came in from Ardal and Vedder to the westerly limit of the Peguis Reserve and finding excellent land there choose locations far west and their friends and relations followed them and a large cluster of houses sprang up on or near the western boundary.\n\nThe Government building now called \"Halfway\" was built on a fractional lot near the centre of the Reserve and there is a considerable space on either side of this building not yet settled upon.\n\nHere then you have two distinct sections one east one west. One School will not do. If we have Day School work done, it is plain that there must be two Schools built not one, for one School could not be so placed as to meet the needs of the opposite sections.\n\nOr putting it differently, the Reserve is say 12 miles across. Most of the people live in the first three miles of either side and the spaces between represent about 6 miles. Children could not walk to a central School without being compelled to go from three to six miles to School and the same number of miles to return. Indian children are not ambitious enough to do this and the parents are too lenient towards their offspring to ask them to do it and I fear it would not be wise for us to ask it.\nThe kind of School House to be built would of course be log walls dovetailed at the corners on a foundation of stone. Logs are cheap the Indians will haul them and be glad of the labor involved which brings them food and clothing. Indians will erect the building and if need be the lumber now in our yard may be used to cover and complete them. Not a days skilled labor from outside will be necessary. It can all be done by the people of the Reserve. It can all be done quickly. If built wholly frame more quickly still.\n\nThe cost of building will not be great. I should say that the following estimate is sufficiently generous:\n\n| Item                          | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|\n| 60 logs at 40 cents per log   | $24.00 |\n| 50 days work at 1.50 per day  | 75.00  |\n| 4 cords of stone at 4 dollars  | 16.00  |\n| 10 Bushels of lime at 1.00 per B.| 10.00  |\n| Rations for 50 days at 50 cts per D.| 25.00  |\n| Unforeseen expense            | 25.00  |\n| **Total**                     | **175.00** |\n\nNote\n\nAll lumber and other material to be supplied from our own Yard at Peguis.\n\nAs a matter of fact however the people do not want day Schools. They ask the Department for a Government managed Boarding School. They are averse to Church management of any School. They ask for Government supervision and that only. They wish for a Boarding School and that only.\n\nI am inclined to second their request for in my experience it is The School that accomplishes the most good and is the most satisfactory to all concerned.\n\nThis might be placed in the centre of the Reserve and be entirely satisfactory. There is good drainage and good pure water and good soil and good hay privilege and plenty of children to fill it in the first month.\nOttawa, December 23, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo reporting on the matter of establishing schools on the Peguis reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is not the intention of the Department to erect a boarding school at this point and it is thought advisable to carry out your suggestion to put up in the meantime two log buildings. The sites for these should be carefully chosen, should be high and dry, easily drained and have suitable lands surrounding them for gardening operations. As to the construction the Department would like you to go more carefully into the matter and obtain a detailed estimate of the cost of all material that will be used. In the meantime the necessary logs may be got out so that active building operations can be commenced as soon as conditions will permit in the spring. When making your estimate you should include the necessary doors, windows, etc., and the Department thinks also that it would be well to sheet the interior.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

This arose from the fact that most of the Peguis men are engaged at Arborg cutting cordwood at .65 cents per cord and as they cut four cords a day they earn $3.40 per day and board themselves. It was impossible therefore to induce them to work for $1.50 per day and board, an amount which hitherto has been regarded as fair wages when men are rationed.\n\nJust as I was leaving for Peguis Mr Sinclair came in to the Office followed by Mr Harper the Farm Instructor and Chief William Prince.

August 31st 1911\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that in accordance with my promise in my letter of XXXXX August 15th No 4 I proceeded to Leguis Reserve Fisher River via Arborg Station on the 19th inst returning on the 22nd. This journey was undertaken so that I might make satisfactory answer to your letter No 347980 of August 10th 1911.\n\nI found that both the Schools ordered to be built are in course of erection and well under way.\n\nThe North School about completed. Roof on, floor down, doors and windows in place, everything done but chinking with moss and plastering. The Church of England are holding service in this building and it is substantial and roomy. Size 20 by 30 and 12 feet high.\n\nI think that the Windows must be refitted and that stone must be placed underneath and the building be allowed to settle before the plaster is put on between the logs and for this purpose we are allowing about two weeks more to elapse but it will be ready for use October 1st 1911.\n\nThe South School is not so far advanced but the Chief and the Farming Instructor have promised to have it ready by the same date October 1st.\n\nAt present the walls are up, roof on, shingles complete, windows in floor ready to lay boards. No stone under yet and no chinking with moss done.\n\nThe logs are fine and the walls are well built and the building is substantial and will last for many years.\n\nI recommend that a strong rod with tightening Screw be placed in each of these Schools across the centre ow-\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6244, file 533-5, part 1)\nowing to the length of the building (30 feet). There might be some sag outward from the centre if this were not done and it would be well to prevent the possibility of this. These rods should be of inch iron with heads and braces outside and strong double Screw Joiners in the middle of the interior to draw the sides well in.\n\nI enquired about a boarding place for the Teachers and found that it would not be desirable to send lady teachers for the present. Gentlemen could only find poor accommodation and might have to walk miles each day to get that.\n\nThis difficulty suggested the idea to my mind that perhaps Indian Teachers might do for the first winter. Some of the Indians are in favor of this but the majority are opposed to it. It was thought that Indian teachers become high-headed when placed in a superior position, that the children would take advantage of them and would not be subordinate, and that there would not be proper guarantee of proper moral supervision.\n\nThis then presents the whole question before the Department and I may add to what has been said that there can not be found one certificated teacher among the Indian people, resident at Fisher River, though some might be able to conduct the very elementary work necessary.\n\nIt will of course be necessary to order desks and other school supplies for both these schools at an early date. It is desirable that these supplies be sent in by way of Arborg Station C.F.R. because nearer and cheaper than any other way. They can be bought in Winnipeg from the Moyer Company if thought desirable and sent direct from here.\n\nCeiling and Collar Beams must be added before the cold weather but at present there is no lumber available for these purposes and it must be purchased and shipped out and an order to do this must be sent by the Department to the Agent or Inspector without much delay.\n\nNails will also be necessary and stoves and piping.\nStorm Windows will be required and there are none available at Peguis. Some one should be authorized to purchase all these necessary things and see them through and see them placed in position.\n\nIn my judgement a carpenter should be employed to put on the finishing touches and make the schools presentable and it would take a months work to complete everything. Indians can not be relied upon to work when and how we may please. Especially will this be true as the fall fishing comes on. Mr Harper is not a mechanic and Mr Sinclair is certainly not.\n\nBe it understood by the Department that the only way of moving freight from Arborg to Peguis is by team and the roads are abominable and teams are valued at $6.00 per day and found which equals $6.25 six dollars and twenty five cents.\n\nI wish that general instructions should be issued and a certain sum of money be placed at disposal of proper Officer to carry out these instructions and present statements and receipts after as it has been difficult to run ones face for work required the Department will consider this and direct accordingly.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nJohn [Signature]\nInspector Indian Agencies\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nCanada\nOttawa, August 30th., 1911.\n\nWith Cheque.\n\nRev.

In reply I beg to say that the Department wishes you to undertake the work of seeing to the completion of these buildings. Your recommendation with reference to the iron rods is approved and you may order the double desks from the E.M. Moyer, Co. Ltd., Winnipeg. A table fitted with a lock and drawer and a medium priced chair for the teacher should be supplied for each school.\n\nYou may purchase lumber for the ceiling and collar beams and engage a carpenter to do the finishing work on the buildings.

(RG 10, Volume 6244, file 533-5, part 1)\nIt was impossible to employ Indians during the harvest time and after that came the fall fishery when most of them go down to the lake to lay up supplies of fish. As soon as they returned from the fisheries we got them to work and both schools are now under way.\n\nI am submitting herewith an account showing work done under the superintendence of Farm Instructor Peter Harper. This account will speak for itself as to the cost of doing the work which I must admit was greater than I anticipated. This increase of expense resulted from the fact that in order to secure the services of the Indians we were compelled as per your permission by telegraph to pay $2.00 a day for the work done by all Indians.\n\nAs directed by you I sent in lumber for cellar beams and ceiling and with that sent a carpenter to complete the work and leave everything shipshape so that the schools might be properly warmed in the cold winter weather. Stoves have been sent up, good heavy stoves with plenty of piping so that I think there is no doubt about their being able to keep warm. I am writing to the Indian Chief asking him to see that his people may supply wood immediately and plentifully for use in the cold weather.\n\nI have, &c.,\n\nJohn Semmens,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTo:\n\n38528\n\nArborg, Man.\n\nIn Account with The ARBORG DRAY COMPANY,\nFEED AND LIVERY STABLE\nBLACKSMITH SHOP IN CONNECTION.\n\nMATERIAL SUPPLIED\n\nWORK PERFORMED\n\nCharges fair and just\n\nTOTAL,\n\nI Hummey Crampe that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed, and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6244, file 533-5, part 1)\nI have the honor of presenting herewith Voucher No 466 in favor of Omar Dupont for work done by him on the Peguis Schools amounting in all to $229.50 less $100.00 paid to him in cash by me for which receipts are attached.\n\nIn connection herewith I beg to explain that I found as per my last report that some of the work done by the Indians was not well done and that I thought a Carpenter should be sent out to finish. He had to take in the lumber and see it delivered and put up build closets, put the leaks together, and furnish storm doors. He also had lime burned plastered the walls and made the foundations secured.\n\nAs will be seen by the voucher he began his work Sept 7th was absent 9 days began again October 4th and closed up his work Nov 18th. He worked in all not counting the Sundays 51 days at $4.50 per day and provided for himself paying his own board and keep.\n\nShould the Department think this a high rate of wages I must explain that I tried in many directions to employ a man at a lower rate but when wages in the city of Winnipeg were being paid at 50 cents an hour for nine hour days it was not possible to induce any one to go to Peguis and work and board himself for less. This amount was accordingly agreed upon.\n\nAs Mr Dupont has no home and is going here and there as work opens he has asked that his Cheques be sent to this office where he will call.

December 19th, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that I have made a trip of Inspection to the Peguis Reserve on the Fisher River, Manitoba.\n\nSchools.\n\nI sent forward yesterday reports showing Inspection of the two Schools recently completed and I need not refer to that matter here. I only wish to deal in this letter with the work of erecting the buildings.\n\nWhen I went out in August last I asked Mr. Farm Instructor Harper how long it would take to complete the buildings. He said he could have them ready by the first of September. I gave him until the first of October and reported to the Department that the Schools would certainly be ready by that time. Difficulty arose over Harvesting and Fishing and I saw that the Schools would be delayed unless we had someone to depend upon other than Indians. Hence my recommendation that a carpenter be sent in to finish. Dupont was sent and the work was hastened.\n\nOn arrival of the Carpenter it was found that much of the work done on the North School was imperfect and would have to be done over again. He went to work with a will and has done very good work in completing the Schools. He had the assistance of John Sinclair whenever he required it but for some reason Mr. Harper was not very favorable to him. However the work progressed and was at last completed. The apparent cost has already been submitted to the Department. I shall in a few days be able to show expenditure of the monies advanced on account of these Schools.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I was under the impression that I sent this with my letter of November 27th, but find duplicates on my file today and fear that they may not have been inclosed. If so they are given herewith. If already sent it will not matter.\n\nThere have been sent to me on this account $300.00 and the cost is as follows:\n\n| Expense          | Under Harper North School Labor | 200.00 |\n|------------------|---------------------------------|--------|\n|                  | South                           | 185.00 |\n|                  | Dupont North School             | 68.80  |\n|                  | South                           | 66.20  |\n| TOTAL            |                                 | $537.00|\n\nThis leaves an unmet balance of $37.00 which I will pay as soon as the Department can send it to me. I should be obliged if $200.00 of this can be sent at the early convenience of the Department so that all may be settled with.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

The other receipts are incomplete as there is no evidence that the Indians, who worked on the buildings and were paid by orders on the stores, received value in goods or cash to the amount of the orders.

The second item in the voucher amounted to $1.00, was for \"Hinges and hasps and screws for closet and storm doors Peguis Schools, pairs.\" This item was paid by cheque No 1789 for $1.00. The above mentioned cheque which you returned is re-enclosed herewith, if there has been a mistake you should communicate with Rev.

A number of these receipts are not yet to hand but have been applied for and may be expected any day. The merchants are a little slow in procuring them owing to the difficulty of reaching the Indians.\n\nI wish to say in connection with these receipts and the orders which were issued by Mr. Farm Instruter Harper that he had no authority at any time from me to issue these orders but did so purely at his own initiative. This has given rise to all the difficulty in collecting receipts.\n\nI also enclose a voucher No. 506 showing that according to my voucher No. 466 I paid on account of the Peguis Schools Mr. Omar Dupont the sum of $100.00\nwhich amount came out of the funds advanced to me for the purpose of erecting these Schools as stated in paragraph one of this letter.\n\nAs shown on the voucher I have brought down the amount on hand from Voucher 505, and after deducting that amount from the $100.00 advanced to Mr. Dupont I have entered the balance as due Inspector, namely $77.20.\n\nTwo reasons must be given for the expenditure of more money than the $27.00 advanced to me for the purpose of building the Schools.\n\n(1) I directed that the logs be placed down at a point two miles from the North boundary but through interference of the Chief they were placed at about a mile and a quarter and they had to be moved to meet my order.\n\n(2) It was necessary to clear a site for the North School and to do some clearing at the South School and men had to be paid to do this extra work.\n\nI have done the best I could amid many pressing duties and the distance from head-quarters and my frequent absence on the road gave occasion for difficulties that were not anticipated.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nTHIS IS CLOSED\n\nPLEASE SEE\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6244)\n\nFile 533-5, part 1\nFisher River Agency - Peguis North Day Schools - Church of England - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1910 - 1912\n\nFile 533-5, part 2\nFisher River Agency - Peguis North Day Schools - Church of England - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1927 - 1936\n\nFile 533-5, part 3\nFisher River Agency - Peguis North Day Schools - Church of England - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1941 - 1949\n\nFile 533-8, part 1\nFisher River Agency - Peguis North Day School - Church of England - Teachers' Residence (Plan). 1913 - 1949\n\nFile 534-1, part 1\nFisher River Agency - Peguis South Day School - Church of England - General Administration. 1911 - 1935\nReceived from W.

Hamilton\nNORTH PEGUIS SCHOOL.\n\nI inspected this school November 2nd, and found 18 children present, the roll calling for 24. The attendance has been only fair, but is improving.\n\nThe grades range from 1 to 3 and the children appeared well up in their grades. The reading was clear and I believe the children understood what they read. The spelling and arithmetic were good and their writing and exercise books showed care and interest. I believe these children are making fair progress.\n\nThe discipline was excellent and the children were the most respectful that I visited. All the children were clean and their clothes were well kept and neat. I might say that the teacher, Mr. Harbord is a very careful man about his own personal appearance and I believe this has its effect upon the children.\n\nI might say that one could feel, on entering this school, a different atmosphere, and at a glance it was evident that the children were receiving the utmost care and attention. Each child had a towel and cup neatly arranged along one side of the school and numbered so that no mistake could be made. The towels, although used, were not dirty.\n\nThe teacher's residence at this school is perhaps the best of the three and yet it is a very poor home. Here, again, I think it a mistake to continue repairing, as the home is certainly not suitable, and after continuous repairing, year after year, we really have nothing.\n| Description       | Quantity | Price |\n|-------------------|----------|-------|\n| Looking Glass     | 1        | $65   |\n| Brown             | 1        | $65   |\n| 5# Brown          | 1        | $100  |\n| 70# Sugar         | 1        | $85   |\n| 1 Doz.            |          | $35   |\n\nTotal: $450\n\nFor Payne North School.\n\nFISHER RIVER AGENCY, MAN.\n\nNOV 18 1927\n\nVote No.......\nClass No.......\nTreaty No.......\nVoucher No.284\n### Department of Indian Affairs\n\n**Voucher No. 284**\n\nTo: The Hodgson Trading Co., Hodgson, Manitoba.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Sep. 19 | To 1 Looking Glass. | 65 |\n|       | 1 Broom. | 65 |\n|       | 5 lbs.

(RG 10, Volume 6244, file 533-5, part 2)\n\nA separate form to be used for each school.\n\nForm No. 99\nRe Requisition for School Material,\nPeguis North School.\n\nI enclose herewith copy of requisition for teaching and other supplies for the above-named school. With reference to the various items, I beg to advise as follows:\n\nBlackboard & Chalk Trough. The school is of log construction and I expect that it will be replaced by a building of frame construction in 1929, item having placed in the Estimates for this purpose. Rather than purchase a new blackboard for this old building, I am taking the old blackboard from the Peguis Centre School and placing it in the North School. There is a new frame school being erected at Peguis Centre and a new blackboard is among the material supplied for the school. The old blackboard will do very well to carry on with until next year.\n\nPupils Desks & Rears. New desks will be required at the Peguis Centre School and I am taking such as are in fair condition and placing them in the North School to take the place of the 6 desks and 2 rears required.\n\nSkipping Ropes. The teacher requests these for use of the girls in play. About 12 yds of suitable rope could be purchased locally.\n\nCocoa Kettle, Spoon, Ladle & Wash Pan. Are for use making and issuing cocoa.\n\nOther items on the requisition require no explanation other than that they are very necessary.\n\nAll kindergarten and other teaching supplies have been selected by the teacher from the catalogue of the Christie School Supply, Ltd., Brandon.\n\nKindly forward authority for purchase of items not being ordered direct from School Supply houses as early as possible. Also ship school supplies as soon as convenient.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Templeman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 20, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, enclosing a requisition from the teacher of the Peguis North Indian Day School for classroom supplies and for supplies for the use of the teacher's residence.\n\nWith reference to the blackboard and chalk trough, it is noted that you are taking the old blackboard from the Centre School and that this will serve the purpose until a new school building is erected. It is also noted that you are removing from the Centre School to the North Peguis School the old desks that are in fair condition, and this arrangement for supplying blackboard and desks will be satisfactory for the present.\n\nYou may purchase and have delivered for the use of the Peguis North School the following supplies:\n\n- 12 skipping ropes,\n- 1 cocoa kettle,\n- 1 spoon,\n- 1 ladle,\n- 36 teaspoons,\n- 1 axe,\n- 1 spare axe handle,\n- 1 enamel pail with cover,\n- 1 wash pan,\n- 2 basins,\n- 1 dipper,\n- 2 brooms,\n- 1 wire door mat,\n- 50 Lbs. Dustbane,\n- 1 school clock,\n\nRelative to the clock, it is considered that an alarm clock of the Big Ben Type would be satisfactory. The Department is not prepared to supply a wall clock.\n\nAfter you have made the above purchases, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nAn order is being forwarded to the Government Stationery Office to send to the teacher's address the classroom supplies considered necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Templeman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson, Man.\nSir:-\n\nReferring to your letter of the 3rd. instant, instructing me to have a well drilled at the North Peguis School, as well as at the Peguis Centre School, I may say that when I took this up with the Agent he informed me that he had already received instructions from the Department to proceed with the drilling of a well at the North Peguis School. Of course, I was rather surprised to hear this. I am sorry that the Department has instructed Mr. Templeman to carry out this work without first giving him specific instructions as to how he is to go about it, as he is absolutely incompetent to handle any business, and the matter of drilling wells is one where hundreds of dollars can be wasted if the Department is not safeguarded. Any drilling company will tell you this. We had an experience in drilling wells at Edmonton, where it was found that the drillers purposely passed an excellent supply of water in order to get more drilling, and it is a common practice to do this. I have never delegated any authority to Mr. Templeman without first making it quite clear as to just what was to be done, and then having him submit the whole proposition to me. He has not shown any capacity for business, and as an Agent he is an absolute failure and I, naturally, feel that the spending of money should not be entrusted to him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Templeman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Well - Peguis North School.\n\nReference your letter of the 17th September granting authority to drill a well at the above-named school, I beg to advise that this well was completed on the 31st ultimo.\n\nBedrock was struck at a depth of 36 feet with only a very light flow of surface water. This being about the depth of the old dug well at the Peguis Centre School, where the water was seepage from swamps and only fit for stock, drilling was continued until the impervious layer of rock was penetrated and the porous sandstone struck. This sandstone contains the Artesian water, which originates from Lake Manitoba, the same water as that struck at the wells at the Agency and the Peguis South School. With this well, we are assured of an excellent supply of drinking water at all times. The well casing has been driven in to the bedrock to a depth of 5 feet so that there is no danger of the well filling up with the loose strata above the bed rock. As stated in the attached voucher, the well is 74 feet deep and the cost at $5.00 per feet, inclusive of 41 feet of 6 inch casing supplied by the driller is $222.00. The water in the well is, at present, about 20 feet below the top of the well.\n\nTo make use of the water in this well, a pump will be required fitted for 1\u00bd in pipe. The majority of the pumps in the district are B-T Pumps, made by Beatty Bros. of Fergus, Ontario. These pumps give excellent satisfaction and the cost of pump complete with brass cylinder, 20 ft. length of pump rod and 2 - 20 ft. lengths of galv. iron pipe 1\u00bd\" would be $33. May the necessary authority be granted to supply this pump?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Templeman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 15, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, informing the Department that the drilling of the well at the Peguis Centre Indian Day School has been completed and that an excellent supply of water has been obtained. The account which you forwarded covering the cost of the drilling of this well to the amount of $222.00, inclusive of casing, will be paid in due course.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and installation of a pump of the type mentioned by you, which, we note, will cost approximately $33. After this pump has been installed, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nPlease instruct the teacher to see that every care is taken so that no damage will be occasioned in the future use of this well.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

To mark our continued success, a special drive is being made for new members and your share of this effort will be to hand the extra copy of your report to a likely prospect (lady or gentleman), together with a word of explanation and advice.\n\nThis having been attended to, come to the annual meeting (see report for place and date) where the movement on foot to make insurance available of $750 or $1000 is to be discussed and encouraged by your presence there those who are carrying on the Society's business in your behalf. The Publicity Committee, who are sending you this circular, while not expressing any opinion as to the desirability or otherwise of the proposed increase in benefits, do particularly stress the importance of obtaining new members on the principle of extending the Society's advantages to the greatest possible number.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Publicity Committee.\nIndian Affairs.\n\nTo Mr. Leebach, Sr.\n\nFor Hall School\n\nNew fuel oil pipe installed\nNew platform build for snow\n20 ft. 6\" Nails\nNew plumbing & shelter\n\n1929\nMar 11\n\nReed Paynt\n\nD.

INDIAN AGENT TEMPLEMAN,\nFOR THE MONTH OF APRIL, 1929, ON THE PEGUIS NORTH\nINDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 136-4-7.\n\nThe school is an old log building, the desks are pretty much past their period of usefulness and a new school is very essential here. As provision was made for a new school in this year's estimates, it is expected that this will be erected this year.\nOttawa, June 10, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to that portion of your report for the month of April, last, on the Peguis North Indian Day School regarding the condition of the present school building, I have to say that the question of the erection of a new building will have to stand over for the present year. This requirement will be noted for the estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Templeman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson, Man.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK. June 13th, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have the honour to report that while at the Fisher River Agency I visited the schools on the Fisher River and Peguis Reserves. Owing to the fact that Saturday, Sunday and Monday were holidays, there were no classes held, but I saw the teachers, buildings, etc., and everything seemed to be going very satisfactorily.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Tong, at the Fisher River Day School, are doing excellent work. The attendance is good, and the premises are kept in excellent shape. The grounds have been fixed up by the teachers and children, and in a few years, when the trees that have been planted attain a fair size, the place will look beautiful in the summertime. There is a nice lawn all around the school and flower beds have been fixed up.\n\nIt is not necessary for me to enlarge upon the buildings at the Peguis North Day School. The school is an old log affair, which is badly dilapidated, and the house is small and cold in the winter. The Church Authorities informed me that they expected new buildings would be erected this year. The teacher, Miss Collen, impresses me as being a very capable woman, and I was informed that she was getting good results with the children.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nAt the Peguis\nAt the Peguis Centre Day School we have new buildings which are very satisfactory in every way and answer the purpose for which they were built, excellently. The teacher, Miss Wright, is also, I believe, doing good work.\n\nAt the Peguis South Day School we have a new bungalow, which was built last year, and it looked very nice. The grounds around the school were fixed up by Miss Lee. They are still using the log school. The attendance here is also very encouraging, but I would say that Miss Lee, the teacher, is handicapped by being quite deaf, and I would think that it would be hard for her to hear what the children are saying.\n\nIn my opinion the teachers at the day schools on these two reserves are doing excellent work and are giving the children the same chance for an education as what the average child receives at the ordinary country school. As a whole, the children attend quite regularly, and a great change has certainly taken place in the last few years.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nD REGINA, SASK. June 24th, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a short report on the Day Schools in the Fisher River Agency, which were visited by Mr. Inspector Christianson.\n\nI would particularly draw your attention to what the Inspector has to say regarding the North Day School on the Peguis Reserve. It seems to me that this building should be replaced by one that would be in keeping with the other schools on this reserve. This is one reserve in the West here where I think a Day School might be considered the proper kind of institution for giving the Indian children an education.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 28th, 1929.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have your 203-11 of the 24th instant, enclosing Mr. Inspector Christianson's report on his visits to the day schools in the Fisher River Agency. The Department is pleased to note that the teachers at each of the day schools on the Fisher River and Peguis reserves are doing excellent work and that the children attend quite regularly.\n\nRelative to the erection of a new building for the Peguis North Indian Day School, I have to say that there are no funds provided for this purpose in our estimates for the present fiscal year. An item, however, is being noted for inclusion in the estimates for the next fiscal year to provide the funds necessary for the erection of a school building, with living accommodation for the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nREPORT\n\nre:-\n\nAlleged theft of foot-ball from the North Peguis Indian School, Nuxkik Peguis Indian Reserve, Dallas Dist., Man.\n\nProperty of the Dep't. of Indian Affairs.\n\nFurther to the report of Reg. No. 10545 Const. Calcraft, C. of the 10th. inst., I hired auto livery and proceeded to the home of John, P. Hamlik, J.P., Hodgson, Man., on the 11th. inst., accompanied by Const. Calcraft of this force, where I obtained Search Warrants to search the premises of Harry Kalyniuk, and Mike Kovenzki of the Dallas District mentioned in the report of Const. Calcraft, of the 10th. inst., and to interview Nurse Brandon at Fisher River, Man., in connection with the above matter.\n\nUpon arrival at Fisher River I interviewed Nurse Brandon who informed me that while she was at the residence of Miss. H. S. Collen, teacher at the North Peguis Indian School on the 4th. inst., at about 6pm, she noticed two men, not Indians, with a team outside the school; one got down from the waggon and kicked something on the road, later picking it up and throwing it in the waggon; the proceeding on their way, she drew the teacher's attention to it and later found out it was the school foot-ball. We then proceeded to the home of Mike Kovenzki in the Dallas Dist. Upon arrival there I was informed by Paul Kovenzki, father of Mike, that his son was away digging Seneca root and would be away for two or three days. I informed his father of my business and he appeared ignorant of the fact that there was a ball missing, a thorough search of the premises produced no results. The same answer described in Const. Calcraft's report, no ball in the yard. His father claimed it was the 5th., that his son was on the Indian Reserve, of course this is nothing to go by as the people in that district would not know one day from the other at times.\n\nI continued the patrol to the farm of Harry Kalyniuk, unfortunately any person coming up to his house can be seen across a muskog for at least half a mile and it is impossible to get a car within three quarters of a mile from the buildings. His buildings are situated on the edge of a thick bush. Upon arrival there I informed Kalyniuk of my business and proceeded to search the premises and adjacent bush. This man appeared to have a knowledge of the matter in question. He admitted stopping his team outside the school on the day in question, his excuse was that he had dropped his whip and Kovenzki had picked it up, from the evidence we have heard this whip still is not able to be believed. We made a thorough search but was unable to locate the ball, although when the bush was being searched he appeared to be uneasy.\n\nI feel confident that this man has the ball concealed somewhere on the premises and the time he had from when he first saw us and the time when we arrived was ample time to throw or place the thing in a secret place, the time would be about four minutes. Mike Stadneychuk.\nwho lives on the next farm stated when I interviewed him that this man has been seen with a football, he was seen carrying it over from Mike Krevenski's farm about a week ago, this bears out the statement of the two men with the team. I regret very much that we were unable to locate the ball, but I feel confident that Kalyniuk is the guilty party. I was unable to get the value of the ball from Indian Agent Stevenson's file or Miss. Collins who was purchasing for the Dept. at Ottawa and the invoice is there. I would respectfully request that I be furnished with the price if the Dept. desires to take further action in this matter. This is a new ball only been at the school for two weeks, it is No. 5 English hand sewn. Kalyniuk holds a bad reputation in the District he has been in the Police tails on a previous occasion and there has been a certain amount of petty thieving in the District he has been blamed for this. Unfortunately the road to Hodgson is through the Peguis Indian Reserve and there does not appear to be much use of warning him off the reserve as this is the only road from Dallas to Hodgson.\n\nWe returned to Hodgson at 10 P.M. of the same date.\n\nCorp'l.\n(E.Graves) #9257\nI/C.

Hodgson Detachment, I patrolled on the 9th inst. with S.M.2077 to the Indian Agents residence Peguis 1. From that point I proceeded in company with Indian Agent Stevenson by dept auto to the North Peguis School, and Dallas District to make investigations in regard to the above complaint.\n\nUpon arrival at the North Peguis Indian School, I interviewed the teacher Miss M.S. Collen, who stated that the foot-ball, the property of the Dept., which had been carelessly left near the road on the 4th inst., had been picked up by an unknown party who was driving past the school with his team. Miss Collen gave me the undermentioned names, Mrs. G. Mackland and Mr. Pakkoo, who were eyewitnesses of the affair. I later interviewed William Pakkoo, who stated that he was standing at the front door of his house, which is situated in the vicinity of the school; he saw two men coming along the road with a team of hay horses, one horse had a white strip on its face. He saw one man get out of the wagon and kick a foot-ball along the road, later placing it in the wagon, under some hay.\n\nI later interviewed Mrs. G. Mackland who stated that she was standing at the door of her house, which is also situated in the vicinity of the school; she saw one man kick the ball, and later place it in the wagon. Her description of the team was a corroboration of William Pakkoo's description.\n\nI later interviewed William James Flett who stated that he was coming from Hodgson on the evening in question along the road that leads past the school. He also saw a team with two men, and his description of the team was the same given as of the two previous people I interviewed. He also stated that he knew one of these men well as he had worked with him some time previously, and that was the only team he saw on the road that evening. He later gave the men's names as Harry Kalyniuk and Mike Kryvenski, both of Dallas District, to the Indian Agent. Later Mr. Stevenson Indian Agent gave me these two names.\n\nAs the Dallas Post Office is located within a couple of miles from the school I proceeded there in order that I may verify the spelling. This information I gave to Corporal Graves on returning to the detachment on the same day.\n\nC. Calcraft\nConst.\n\nThe Officer Commanding,\nR.C.M.P.

It is noted that you are obtaining an estimate of the cost and will forward same later for the consideration of the Department.\n\nRelative to the old school buildings at both the above schools, I beg to say that they may be given to any Indian who is willing to take them down and remove them from the school lot and level off the site on which they stand. It is noted that the Anglican missionary has spoken to you for these buildings. If you consider that he should have same rather than an Indian, the Department will approve of your making whatever arrangements you consider advisable. In any event, whoever removes the buildings should clear away all rubbish and level the site on which they stand.\n\nRelative to the small frame residence at the North School, you may arrange for the disposal of same, which it is noted is worth approximately $50. If you succeed in disposing of this building to an Indian, you should obtain the purchase price, which should cover the material in the building and the removal of all rubbish and the levelling of the ground on which it is situated. Any amount received for this old residence should be forwarded to the Department for credit to the Receiver General.\n\nI shall be glad if you will arrange to have these old buildings removed at an early date and the ground on which they stand properly levelled.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

There is a seepage through the cement walls at this school which occasions considerable trouble and which we are constantly having to pump out, the water coming in to the extent of 2\" to 15\" according to climatic conditions. It is impossible to entirely remove this water on the level floor, there being no drain to carry it away. I would suggest that we are allowed to sink a pit in one corner of the school basement floor where the water may drain to the one point and be bailed out as necessary with pails or force pump from time to time. To sink such a pit of cement and a cover for the pit would cost approximately twenty-two to twenty-five dollars.\n\nCan you give us authority to make this expenditure and we will do same during the winter before the spring waters will create a further flooded condition?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. H. Laverier,\nIndian Agent\n\nTHE SECRETARY,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 12, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, relative to the condition of the drainage in the basement of the Peguis North Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of your suggestion that a pit be sunk in one corner of the school basement floor, into which the water may drain and from which it could be bailed out as necessity arises. You should arrange to have a covering placed over the pit. It is noted that you estimate the cost of sinking the pit and providing a covering for same would not exceed approximately $25. You should arrange to have this work carried out when considered timely by you.\n\nAfter same has been completed, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The necessary lumber could be purchased locally and a handy Indian could do the work.\n\nI regret to inform you that Miss Wright, teacher at the South Day School, declines to prepare the meal for her 47 pupils without assistance. Miss Wright was not asked to prepare the meal herself; she was asked to supervise the preparation of the meal by the older girls, which she might well do, and it seems to me that it would be in order to inform Miss Wright that she is expected to do this. This would be a splendid training for the girls, and to have an untrained Indian woman come in to do this work would be absurd. With your permission I will instruct Miss Wright that she is expected to oversee this work as part of her duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This letter stated distinctly that an expenditure of $40 was authorized for midday meal supplies for the three schools. You have now expended more than twice as much as last year in the purchase of supplies at these three schools.\n\nI might point out that the Department does not see any necessity for purchasing raisins.\n\nConsideration of payment of the account will be withheld until your reply is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H. Lavender, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHogson, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter 1136-4-5 of Nov 16/33. With reference to your letter of Sept 23rd I must acknowledge that I construed your letter to mean $40.00 for each school and I based my construing on the fact that a grant of $50.00 had been made to the two roomed school at Fisher River. I presumed that the sum of $40.00 for each of the Peguis schools was a fair amount in comparison, especially as there are in attendance in most of the Peguis Schools, more than 50% of the attendance of Fisher River. The amounts supplied to these respective schools is not excessive if a meal is to be given. This question, in mind is a doubtful necessity.\n\nInspectors have previously recommended that these mid-day meals be provided and I have carried on under the assumption that it was the wish of the Dept. to serve a mid-day meal in the schools. The sum of $40.00 as suggested by you would be just about sufficient to supply cocoa and nothing else. If it is your desire, I will instruct the teachers of these schools, that in the future they should not ask for anything other than that commodity.\n\nRegretting my action in the matter, I am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.

With these biscuits and the supplies which you have already purchased, the Department considers that it should be possible to serve a fairly substantial midday meal at the three Peguis Schools.

As reported to you last year the plaster conditions at this school needs considerable repair. There is also carpenter work needed on portions of the wood-work, doors etc.\n\nThe walls of this school, after the plaster has been repaired, should be painted as they are in a very dirty and smoky condition.\n\nKindly advise me if we may expect any consideration along these lines.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.

Lavender, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nReference to your letter 136-4-5 dated July 7/34, I beg to submit an estimate covering the repairs required at the Peguis North, Centre and South Indian Day Schools.\n\nPEGUIS NORTH SCHOOL\nConsiderable damage has been done to the plaster on the walls of this school and I would estimate that the cost to put same in good condition would be $15.00. The interior of this school should also be painted. This would entail an expenditure for five gallons of paint at approximately $4.00 per gallon, $20.00. The labor would cost approximately $15.00. Considerable carpenter work is needed and I would estimate that $10.00 would cover this service. A total of $60.00 will be needed for the Peguis North School.\n\nPEGUIS CENTRE SCHOOL\nInterior painting is required with paint and labor as stated above $35.00 and a further $10.00 for carpenter repairs. At this school an appropriation is also needed for the cleaning out of the well and installing the pump. For this school therefore, an appropriation of $70.00 is required for upkeep of buildings and equipment.\n\nPEGUIS SOUTH SCHOOL\nInterior painting is required at an approximate cost of $25.00, repairs to desks and carpenter work a further $15.00 would be required. The estimate, therefore, for this school for upkeep would be $50.00.\n\nIf these amounts are passed I would appreciate a reply as early as possible that the work may be completed before school opens in September.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.

I am not certain to what she refers when she mentions non-Treaty, but I presume she means half-breeds. If accommodation is limited, the Treaty Indian children should receive first consideration. If there is room in the school for 42 desks, please let me know the sizes of the desks required, in order that we may place an order for the additional 22. With the granting of family allowances, it is presumed that the attendance at the day schools will increase. You have already received specific instructions regarding the action that must be taken in regard to family allowances when children do not attend school regularly. Desks are made in three sizes - large, medium and small. You should let me know the number of each size of these that is necessary.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH. DEPT MINES & RESOURCES. OTTAWA. CANADA.\n\nIn replying to your letter of June 14th file 136-4-5 in regard to additional Desks for the North Peguis School, we advise that there is very little room for any additional desks without crowding. What is really needed is another room, or an addition to the present building, as this is about central for this North End vicinity. The children at present are using benches.\n\nThe services of another teacher would be required in the event of another room, and the two teachers could live in the present Teachers Residence.\n\nThere are attending at present, 8 Non-Treaty of whom 7 are Half-Breeds and the other a son of the Pentecostal Minister. There is no Provincial School that these children could attend.\n\nThe Desks that would be required would be for the smaller children, who by reason of the Family Allowances are going to school. The starting age being 6 instead of the usual 7 years.\n\nThe Teacher could, without too much crowding, put in another 5 or 6 desks which should be small.\n\nFJC/OT\n\nF J Clarke, Indian Agent\nOttawa, June 29, 1945.\n\nMr. F. J. Clarke, Indian Agent,\nHodgson, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, with reference to the request for desks for the Peguis North School. We will arrange to order six small size single desks.\n\nWe have no funds provided in the current year's appropriation for an addition to the school or the erection of another room.\n\nIn the third paragraph of your letter you refer to 8 children for whom this Department has no responsibility with regard to education. The education of the children you mention is a provincial responsibility, and, as stated in my letter of the 14th instant, if the accommodation is limited, these children should not be allowed to attend the school during the academic year 1945-46.\n\nI am aware that the Family Allowance Act provides for children to attend school at 6 years of age. However, if you will refer to Section 10 (1) of the Indian Act, you will note that the age for compulsory attendance of Indian children at school is 7 years, and it is our intention to adhere to the Indian Act in this particular regard.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nOttawa, June 30 1945.\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF:\n\nPeguis North Indian Day School\n\nVOTE 76 ALLOTMENT 12-415 ALLOCATION SYMBOLS\n\nSHIP TO The Teacher, Peguis North Indian Day School\nHodgson, Manitoba.\n\nPurpose for which required Desks for School\n\n| QUANTITY | UNIT PRICE | TOTAL |\n|----------|------------|-------|\n| 6        |            |       |\n\nSmall Size Single School Desks\n\nNote:\nWhile the desks should be shipped as stated above, the account should be forwarded to\n\nMr. F.

The cost of painting the three Peguis schools and residences was estimated at $370.00 each, and the cost of painting the Fisher River School, at $1,000.00.\n\nWe have had a Painter and Decorator here, a Mr. A.W. Wadelius of 110 Young Street, Winnipeg to look over these buildings and give estimates on the cost of this work.\n\nWe have now received Mr. Wadelius' written quotations, which are, as per attached copies of the originals, on his own letterheads. These quotations are somewhat higher than estimated, which is no doubt due to the increase in cost of both labour and materials.\n\nAll these school and residences are badly in need of painting, and it would be appreciated if the Department would approve of the work being done during the coming summer holidays.\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nSup't: Fisher River Agency.\nJune 1st, 1948.\n\nMr. P.G. Lazenby, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Hodgson, Manitoba.\n\nWe have your letter of the 22nd ultimo with reference to painting the three day schools on the Peguis Reserve and also the Fisher River School.\n\nIt is noted in the case of the three Peguis Schools the firm requests $450.00 for material and in the case of the Fisher River School, $375.00. I am inclined to feel that we could save some money by purchasing the paint ourselves and in that event I presume that the quotation for labour would be according to the amount mentioned in the tender.\n\nYou might let me have a requisition for the paint required. We would then be in a position to decide if the saving would be effective.\n\nIt is doubtful if we can authorize the expenditure required for all four schools and if we have to delay the painting of one of them we would like to know at which school the painting could be delayed until next year.\n\nBernard F.

We have also priced the material. The quantities and the price are estimated only roughly, as it is difficult to estimate the paint required. Some of the buildings need paint badly and will soak up a lot.\n\nSome wall paper may be required, water paint or kalsomine, where some surfaces have already been treated with this finish, as it would not be advisable to paint over kalsomine.\n\nIt may be possible to effect a saving in purchasing the material ourselves, however, we would be responsible then for the distribution of it. Any left over's would be a loss, and it is just questionable if we would be much ahead. The prices quoted by this firm seem reasonable, and they look after everything.\n\nThe firm of course, is quite prepared to carry out their contract for labour, should the Department prefer to purchase the material themselves, and entirely, look after this end of it.\n\nPeguis North School looks the best, and apparently, must have had paint last. We would recommend that this school be left out of this programme this year if necessary.\n\nPGL/OT\n\nJUN 14 1948 Sup't: Fisher River Agency\n\nc.c. for Mr. Davis, Supv., Wpg.,\nJune 19, 1948.\n\nMr. P.G.

We are prepared to provide the funds required for the painting of the Peguis Center and the Peguis South schools this year and I return the requisition which you forwarded so that you may reduce the amounts of materials required.\n\nThe painting of the Fisher River School and the Peguis North School will have to be postponed until next year.\n\nBernard F.

As the Department is building a new school in very close proximity to the two schools mentioned we feel that it would be a good opportunity of having the additional accommodation provided.\n\nWill you therefore give some consideration to this matter?\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary-Treasurer.\nSTATEMENT\n\nDallas, Man.

Church Hall -\n\nThe matter of opening a second classroom in the above Hall has been discussed with the Peguis North Indians, and the W.A. are quite willing to put this hall in first class shape and rent it to us at $28.00 per month or $7.00 per week. This rate is paid by the present Picture Show man.\n\nThese Indians are working on the Hall now in hopes that we will be willing to start this second classroom. There will be no expenditure involved in repairs, we will of course have to buy our Blackboard and all items required for the classroom including Desks.\n\nIf the opening of this classroom is approved, kindly advise and we will forward an requisition covering Desks, and all supplies required to put this room into operation.\n\nS Boyne\nA/Supt - Fisher River Agency\n\nOT/\nOctober 20, 1948.\n\nMr. S.

I note that the Indians are prepared through the W.A. to put this hall in first class shape and rent it to us at $26. per month.\n\nI also understand that the only expenditure involved will be this rental fee and that the Indians will carry out the necessary repairs.\n\nWith regard to the blackboards, please find attached a standard letter sent in this regard. It is presumed that you can make the necessary purchase of masonite in Hodgson and that you can order the blackboard paint immediately.\n\nI understand that you will be forwarding shortly, a requisition for the desks. Be sure to indicate the number of small, medium and large required.\nYou might also consider, in view of the fact that you will have a large number of primary children, of building a large kindergarten table or tables. You are aware, that modern educational practice favours the use of these tables for primary classes rather than the use of individual desks. It is presumed that you could have these tables made locally by one of the Indians on the Reserve. I would suggest that they be made 23\" high with room for three children on either side and one at each end.\n\nThey could be covered with either masonite or battleship linoleum. We can then order kindergarten chairs from one of the standard school supply companies for use with these tables.\n\nBernard F.

(RG 10, Volume 6244, file 533-5, part 3)\nRe: Peguis North Day School #4  \nOpening of second class room W.A. Hall -\n\nWe are pleased to acknowledge Mr. Neary's letter of the 20th instant file 533-5 (E) approving of the opening of a second class room in the Peguis North W.A. Church Hall, at a rental of $28.00 per month. We are now proceeding on the assumption that the Department will be able to secure the services of a teacher for this room.\n\nWe do not think we will need any desks, as some can be transferred from North #4 Peguis, and we'll have a table made as suggested in Mr. Neary's letter. However, it would advisable to order about 10 kindergarten chairs, we can use benches in the meantime.\n\nApparently, we have received two shipments of blackboards for South-West #1, and we plan on using one shipment for the W.A. Halls.\n\nWe also plan on installing 2 storm windows (Sideways) on this Hall for better lighting. The cost to be deducted from the rent, unless, the W.A. want to do this themselves. Also, the heater can be replaced with one of the heaters we have which the Bookers replaced.\n\nWe should have a Teacher's Desk and chair, also a school Flag. There will be other small items but we can get these when the Teacher arrives.\n\nOT/\n\nS Boyne, A/Supt-\n\nc c Mr. Davis, WPG.\nNovember 3, 1948.\n\nMr. S.

(RG 10, Volume 6244, file 533-8, part 1)\nWe are attaching hereto a Requisition covering furniture and equipment required at the Peguis #4 School Residence. In making up this requisition, we have been guided by the suggested scale of issue for furniture for a standard One-Room Indian Day School Residence.\n\nThe stove (Kitchen Range) is in bad shape and should be re-placed as soon as possible. It is burnt out, allowing ashes to go into the baking oven. The door is also broken. It is hoped this item will be allowed to stand.\n\nThe rooms in this School residence are very dirty and we have attached a requisition covering Caseine paint (FLITE) a washable paint. We believe we can get an Indian woman to do the work, as its much the same as whitewashing. The total expenditure in this connection including the material should not be over $37.50. If this work is approved, we would appreciate receiving an accountable advance of $25.00 to cover the work.\nDecember 21, 1948.\n\nMr. S. Boyne,\nA/Superintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nHodgson, Manitoba.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant, enclosing requisition for supplies for the teacher's residence at the Peguis No. 4 School, we are not ordering the potato peeler or the dresser.\n\nOur records show that a dresser was purchased for this residence from the Ashdown Hardware Company in October, 1946. We do not consider it necessary to supply a potato peeler.\n\nWe approve a total expenditure of $37.50 covering material and labour for painting the interior of the residence. An accountable cheque will be forwarded for $25.00.\n\nBernard F.

His appointment dates from the first of October although he has been working as carpenter's assistant during that month. This school was not completed as rapidly as the North school, but was ready for occupation on the 4th of November. The delay being occasioned by the burning of lime and the time necessary to plaster the school after that was done.\n\nThe name of the teacher of the South school is H.J. Francis, a well educated young man of excellent character. I hope the Department will see its way to pay him at the rate of $400.00 per year. He left a salary of $60.00 per month here to go to that work and has only agreed to remain for six months, but if he likes the work may continue with the permission of the Department for an indefinite period.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Semmens,\n\nThe Secretary, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant in which you state that the South Peguis School has been placed in charge of Mr. H. J. Francis, a young divinity student.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this appointment is satisfactory and a salary of $400.00 per annum will be allowed to date from the 1st of October, last. Returns showing the attendance, etc., should be forwarded by the teacher and you will be kind enough to give him the necessary instructions. You should also impress upon him the necessity for teaching calisthenics and hygiene and some copies of the text books on these subjects will be sent you for this school. These latter remarks apply also to the North School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J.

Tong from the South Peguis Indian Day School to take charge of the Fisher River Indian Day School after the summer holidays, I beg to say that as the South Peguis School is conducted under the auspices of the Anglican Church, His Grace, The Archbishop of Rupert's Land, is being requested to nominate a suitable teacher to begin duties when the school re-opens after the summer holidays.\n\nAs soon as The Archbishop advises us of the name of the teacher secured, you will be advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I regret that Mr. Tong has decided to give up the school at South Peguis, and I shall do my best to procure a successor for him before September. Kindly let me know what the salary will be.\n\nRegarding Jackhead, we have experienced great difficulty in procuring a suitable man, for I am very much averse to sending a single man on account of the trouble we have had there in the past. Besides, I desire to have a missionary-minded man who can conduct the services on Sunday and assume general charge of the Mission.\n\nIf we succeed in securing such a man we can supplement his salary by a Mission Grant. In the meantime, will you kindly inform me what the salary from the Department will be provided I can secure an experienced man with educational standing not lower than a second-class certificate. I will then look out for someone with some prospect of success as teachers are more plentiful now than they have been. With kind regards, I am,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ. D.

The Indians have very little respect for him and some children from his area are going to the Central School. The Archdeacon recommended that some time in the future the Central School be moved a little south and two classrooms maintained there. This would do away with the South School.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6244, file 534-1, part 1)\nOttawa, January 9, 1925.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform Your Lordship that the Church of England missionary and the Indian agent living on the Peguis Reserve are extremely desirous of arranging for the education of their children locally. The Department has been asked to arrange, if at all possible, for the services of a well qualified teacher at the Peguis Centre School. I am corresponding with the Provincial Authorities, with a view to securing their assistance because of the nine white children who are living on the reserve. Your Lordship will remember you informed me that Mr. Packer, the teacher of the Peguis South School, has not been giving satisfaction. Would it be possible to transfer Miss Stapleton, the present incumbent at Peguis Centre, to the South School and arrange for a well qualified successor for the coming academic year? Miss Stapleton has been doing good work and, no doubt, would handle the South School satisfactorily.\n\nI should be grateful if Your Lordship would give this question your serious consideration and make a recommendation to the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRt. Rev. W. Thomas, D.D.,\nBishop of Brandon,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, December 7, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, in which you recommend that arrangements be made for the transportation to the Peguis South School of the children of the Peguis Reserve who are three miles from the nearest school and for whom arrangements could not be made to attend the Hodgson white school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that you recommend that a man with a van and team be hired to drive these children each day to and from their homes to the school. I may say that the department has in a number of similar cases in the past provided for the transportation of the Indian children and the arrangement has met with poor success owing to the driver not attending faithfully to duty or the children not meeting the van on time or a proper rig not being provided by the driver. I shall be pleased if you will state whether you can arrange a suitable route in transporting the children to the Peguis South School, also if you can obtain a reliable man with a good outfit to do the work. If so, you may obtain a price for doing this work, which you should submit to the Department. You should see that the man whom you recommend be given the work has a suitable outfit - horse and van - with robes.\n\nWhen we have full information as requested, consideration will then be given to authorizing the driving of the children referred to, to and from their homes to the school. This matter should receive your early attention as, if it is decided to arrange for the service mentioned, it should begin when the school re-opens after the coming Christmas holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Templeman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHalfway, Man.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to give notice of my intention to resign from my position as teacher at the above school, as soon as the Department finds it convenient to appoint another teacher.\n\nGiven leave of absence for two months from this date, during which my wife could substitute for me, I could keep school open until March 31, 1929.\n\nI beg to remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd.)

Mrs. Packer is not a qualified teacher but her services would be satisfactory for the period mentioned, namely two months.\n\nMr. Packer's services as teacher have been satisfactory and his reason for leaving the position is that, he has obtained employment with his brother, who is a Building Contractor in Winnipeg. With reference to second paragraph of his letter, I spoke to him with reference to this and he informed me that his employment would not carry him through the winter months and it was his intention, should the Department approve, to return and carry on school until March 31, 1929.\n\nI do not think that this would be a satisfactory arrangement and would recommend that a new teacher be appointed to take over school on or about November 1, 1928. The new residence, now under construction, will not be ready much before that date and the old building is not a habitable place, especially for a person new to the Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

It is considered that the services of a teacher should be obtained to begin duties on November 1st, next. The services of Mr. and Mrs. Packer will not be required after that date. We are taking up with His Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land the question of obtaining a suitable teacher to succeed Mr. Packer on the date mentioned.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform Mr. Packer of the acceptance of his resignation and also to inform Mrs. Packer that she may act as substitute until November 1st, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I would recommend that she\nbe transferred to the Peguis Centre School where the\nclass is smaller and there are more of the younger\npupils, Miss Wright, teacher at Peguis Centre School,\ntaking her place.\n\nThe pupils at the South School know that Miss\nLee is deaf and they take advantage of her affliction.\nSee report of Provincial School Inspector in this con-\nnection.\n\nThere is a van in operation at this school, by\nwhich 15 of the pupils, who reside over 3 miles distant\nfrom the school, are transported back and forth daily.\nThe van is efficiently and satisfactorily operated.\nOttawa, June 10, 1929.\n\nMost Rev. Sir:\n\nIn a recent report from Mr. Agent Templeman, Hodgson, he recommends an exchange of teachers in the Peguis South and Peguis Centre Indian Day Schools. He states that Miss Lee, teacher of the South School, is advanced in years and is deaf, and that there is a large attendance of pupils. He considers that she would perform better service at the Centre School, where the class is smaller and there are more younger pupils. Agent Templeman also states that Miss Wright, teacher of the Centre School, is performing excellent services; is very interested in her work and has the confidence of her pupils. He considers that she would be more suitable to teach higher grades and recommends her transfer to the South School.\n\nI shall be pleased to have Your Grace's concurrence in the exchange of these two teachers for the next school year.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nMost Rev. Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMost Rev. S. P. Matheson, D.D., LL.D., D.C.L.,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nBishop's Court, Winnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, June 10, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nRelative to your report on your inspection of the South and Centre Indian Day Schools on the Peguis Reserve, I have to say that we are taking up with His Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land the question of an exchange between the teachers of these schools. It is noted that you consider it would be in the interests of the work if Miss Wright, teacher of the Peguis Centre School, was transferred to the Peguis South School, and that Miss Lee, teacher of the last named school, be transferred to the Centre School. You will be advised later when we have the approval of His Grace for the transfer, which, if made, would take effect from the beginning of the next school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Templeman, C.E.,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6244, file 534-1, part 1)\nAt the Peguis South Day School, we have a new bungalow which was built last year and it looked very nice. The grounds around the school were fixed up by Miss Lee. They are still using the log school. The attendance here is also very encouraging, but I would say that Miss Lee, the teacher, is handicapped by being quite deaf, and I would think that it would be hard for her to hear what the children are saying.\nJune 24th, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. McLean,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of yours of June 10th. A session of my Synod has prevented me from replying sooner. I am quite willing to fall in with the suggestions which you make in regard to the disposition of the teachers in the schools on the Peguis Reserve. I take it for granted that you will inform them officially of the change.\n\nWith kindest regards, I am,\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 28, 1929.\n\nMost Rev. Sir:\n\nI have Your Grace's letter of the 24th instant, relative to the exchange of teachers between the Peguis South and Peguis Centre Indian Day Schools for the next school year. It is noted that you are in favour of this exchange, and the Department will be pleased to approve of Miss Wright being transferred from the Centre School to the South School for next year.\n\nRelative to Miss Lee, who has been teaching the South School, the Public School Inspector states that, while a capable lady, she is labouring under two handicaps - hard hearing and advanced years - and, consequently, the pupils take advantage of her affliction. I would submit for Your Grace's consideration the question of dispensing with the services of Miss Lee and securing the services of a qualified teacher for the Peguis Centre School to succeed Miss Wright, who is being transferred to the Peguis South School. When we have Your Grace's views regarding the continuing of the services of Miss Lee, the local Indian Agent will be advised of the arrangements made for teaching services on the Peguis Reserve.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMost Rev. S. P. Matheson, D.D., LL.D., D.C.L.,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nBishop's Court,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nJuly 12, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. McLean,\n\nI wrote you on June 24th approving of the suggestion made re the allocation of the teachers on the Peguis Reserve and asking you to notify all the parties concerned of the decisions which might be arrived at. Today I had a call from Miss Wright, who informs me that no action has been taken and that no teacher has received any intimation of any change. As I am leaving for my vacation on Monday, I suggested that she should write direct to you on the whole question. Apparently she is sensitive about what she terms \"ousting\" Miss Lee. I explained to her that I understood that Miss Lee's services would in any event be discontinued. Miss Fairservice also called and pressed her resignation of the Fairford school. Under certain circumstances she expressed her willingness to take one of the Peguis schools and I also told her to write direct to the Department. I of course approve of both these teachers should the Department be disposed to appoint them. Possibly the present confusion has been caused by the prolonged illness of the local agent.\n\nWith kind regards, I am,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nWinnipeg Man.\nJuly 13, 1939.\n\nMr. McLean\nActing Deputy Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to resign the position of Senior Teacher at the Haigford Indian Improved Day School and if you are contemplating building a two-roomed school at South Peguis (as I have been given to understand) I beg to apply for one of the positions providing that the salary is more than I formerly received at the Central Peguis school \u00a3237-38. I understand Miss Wright is also applying so we would be possible like to be together.\n\nIf you are not contemplating\nbuilding a two-roomed school at South Skeena. Kindly let me know if you have any other position in the Indian work which you can offer me.\n\nI am leaving on my holidays and shall be stopping off several places enroute to the coast therefore would have no definite address so would advise you to write me to Y.W.C.A., Vancouver, B.C. and I shall get your letter upon my arrival there about the end of July.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.G. Halservice.\nOttawa, July 18, 1929.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, resigning your position and applying for a post at the Peguis South Indian Day School. I regret that the Department has no funds, at the present time, for the erection of a 2-roomed school at this point, and therefore there will be no vacancy for you there. The Department has decided to have Miss Jennie Wright take over the duties of the Peguis South School, and I am transferring Miss Ellen Lee to the easier position at the Central School. Your application will be kept in mind if a suitable vacancy occurs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMiss Ida G. Fairbairn,\nY. W. C. A.,\nPortage Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, July 18, 1929.\n\nMost Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Grace's letter of the 12th instant, and, as Miss Wright will not accept transfer to the Peguis South School if Miss Lee's services are discontinued, the Department has decided to re-engage both workers. Miss Wright has written to the Department direct. She will teach at the South School, at a salary of $100 per teaching month, and Miss Lee will take over the easier position at the Centre School, at her former salary. Miss Wright has been telegraphed today, so that she will have the information before she goes on her holidays. I have asked her to notify Miss Lee if she knows her address, and I have written Miss Lee to the Indian Reserve. When Your Grace returns to Winnipeg, you might also write to Miss Lee, if you know her address.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D.

Lee is to be transferred to the central school. Miss Lee as teacher has only been here as teacher for a few months, in this short space of time the school children have made a mark of improvement in their studies. She takes great interest for the advancement of our children, she also takes great interest for the welfare of the church.\n\nIf transferred from the south school to the central school, it means that she will be put to considerable inconvenience, she has done quite a mark of improvements in the school grounds, she also has a garden, we may say generally speaking it is the first teacher we ever had that takes so much interest for the advancement of our children, and the people in general.\n\nThe children likes her, including all the people of the south school district.\nPardon us in availing ourselves of the privilege of conveying our request before Your grace, kindly asking You to use Your influence to try and persuade the authorities, that Miss H. Lee remain as teacher at the South School of the Regina Reserve.\n\nThanking You in anticipation,\n\nSigned\n\nWilliam Asham\nGeo. Hudson\nPhilip Stevenson\nOtto McCorristin\nR. Asham\nG.

Miss Lee has written pleading to be left in her present position and today I received the Petition which I enclose from the Indians. I am afraid that if you consent to her remaining in her present position it may dislocate the whole arrangement. I would therefore be inclined to advise that you abide by the arrangement which has been made. These teachers are inclined to be very troublesome, especially the ones in the Peguis district. I have no desire to intervene in the matter at all, but I am simply giving you the enclosed as information.\n\nWith kindest regards, I am,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst.

(RG 10, Volume 6244, file 534-1, part 1)\nOttawa, August 17th, 1929.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nI have Your Grace's letter of the 13th instant, relative to the allocation of the teachers on the Peguis Reserve for the coming school year and enclosing a petition which you received from the Indians protesting against the transfer of Miss Lee to the Centre School. As arrangements have been made to have Miss Wright transferred from the Centre School to the Peguis School and Miss Lee transferred to the Centre School, this Department is not prepared to make any change in this arrangement. I shall be pleased if Your Grace will inform Miss Lee definitely of this arrangement. If she refuses to abide by the Department's decision and resume duties at the Centre School when it reopens after the present summer holidays on September 3rd, next, I shall be pleased if Your Grace will nominate a qualified teacher for this school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

As you are aware, at the present time a van is engaged to transport the children from the southwest portion of the Reserve, some having to travel a distance of nearly seven miles. After enquiring fully into the best arrangements that could be made to meet the requirements, I shall be pleased to have a report stating your views.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Miss Fairservice I understand is a good teacher and I believe she is well known to your Department. I am,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6244, file 534-1, part 1)\nOttawa, June 5, 1930.\n\nMost Rev. Sir:\n\nI have Your Grace's letter of the 29th ultimo, relative to the application which you received from Miss I. G. Fairservice for the position as teacher at the new Peguis South Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I have to inform Your Grace that the Department has recently made enquiry with reference to providing adequate educational facilities for the Indian children residing on the southern part of the Reserve. It has been decided to erect two separate school buildings - one to replace the present building at the Peguis South School and the other, two miles west, which it is proposed to call the Peguis West Indian Day School. This last named school will provide educational facilities for the Indian children residing on the south western part of the Reserve. At the present time, as Your Grace may be aware, a van is engaged to transport the children from this part of the Reserve to the Peguis South School. It is the intention this summer to erect a new building at the Peguis South School, and Mr. Commissioner Graham has received the necessary instructions in regard to this work. No funds, however, were provided to erect a school building and teacher's residence at the point to be known as the Peguis West School. An item for the purpose will be noted for our Estimates for the next fiscal year, and it is hoped to be able to erect a school and residence during the summer of 1931.\n\nAs far as the Department is aware, the present teacher at the Peguis South School, Miss Jennie Wright, has given no intimation of her intention to give up duties at the end of the present school year. Should, however, there be a vacancy, consideration will be given to the application of Miss Fairservice.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

This, the Department will realize, is too large a number of children for one teacher to handle, when you take into consideration that there are something like nine different grades.\nDear Mr. [Last Name],\n\nSince a personal interview with you some years ago you asked me to write at any time I felt I needed help or advice, and it is you to whom I have always been grateful for my position at Fairford.\n\nAs you already know I resigned from my position at the Indian Day School, Fairford, in order to train as a nurse and thus fit myself for more efficient service in the Indian field.\n\nI have now completed the three years course at the Winnipeg General Hospital and graduated in May 1931, writing the University Examinations for Registered Nurses in November. Since then I have applied to the Indian Department and hope to be taken on the nursing staff when the opportunity presents itself.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6244, file 534-1, part 1)\nVery recently I received the information that Miss Wright, teacher at the South Pigeon School will be leaving at Easter on account of her health, and will be absent from her school for a few months. If another has not been appointed may I apply to act as her substitute during that time. Had it not been for my work among the Indians I would never have taken the nurse's training and therefore I feel my duty is with the Indian Department.\n\nThanking you for your exceedingly kindness in the past and trusting my letter may receive your favorable consideration,\n\nYours very truly,\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I would suggest that you arrange an early interview with His Grace, Most Rev. I. O. Stringer, D.D., Bishop's Court, Winnipeg.

Thomas, who taught for several years at the Fairford Indian Day School. Miss Thomas' services were most satisfactory during the period she was employed at the Fairford School. She resigned from that position to train as a nurse in the Winnipeg General Hospital, from which she graduated in May, 1936. She has requested to be appointed to the South Peguis School to succeed Miss Wright.\n\nI am advising Miss Thomas to call on Your Grace for a personal interview, and should be pleased, if you consider her satisfactory, if you will approve of her appointment.

The roll calls for 33 pupils, 17 boys and 16 girls. The grades range from 1 to 5.\n\nThe attendance at this school is poor. A van operates, hauling the children a distance of from six to eight miles. The pupils hauled have not been attending regularly, and often only 6 or 7 arrive in the van. Unless better attendance is obtained, it might be more economical for the Department to give a small grant to the white school at Hodgson where the Indian children from the extreme south end of the reserve could attend. This would not interfere with the south school as it would leave an enrolment of around 20 pupils, and no doubt some could be transferred from the Centre Peguis School. I have advised Mr. Lavender that it might be well to have the Mounted Police make a check-up on the truant children. A year or two ago the police made regular inspection trips, with the result that the school attendance was much better.\n\nIt will be noted that the children are all in the lower grades at this school.

The Department is taking this matter up with Mr. Agent Lavender. If he followed your advice, to have a check-up of the truant children made by the Mounted Police, it is possible the attendance would improve. As our funds are limited, we will be unable to pay for the hiring of a van, should the children not avail themselves of this service.

(RG 10, Volume 6244, file 534-1, part 2)\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWhile at Hodgson last week, I made an unofficial visit at South Peguis and Centre Peguis Schools. I have pleasure in informing you that attendance has greatly improved during the past month. At Centre Peguis the attendance is increased by an average of four; while at South Peguis the attendance for the last fortnight has been 33 to 35. This is in part due to the close of the fishing season.\n\nYours truly,\nGeo. Batllett\nInspector of Schools.\nOttawa, August 19, 1937.\n\nVenerable Sir:\n\nEX'D.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 16th instant, in which you suggest an exchange of teachers at Fairford and Peguis.\n\nMy understanding is that it is your intention to transfer Miss Skaftfeld to the Peguis South Indian Day School and Miss A. C. Eileen Field from Peguis to the Indian Day School at Fairford.\n\nI may state that this transfer is approved by the Department and it is our hope that the exchange will take place at the earliest possible date, preferably before the opening of these schools on September first.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nVenerable D. T. Parker, B.A.,\nArchdeacon of Winnipeg,\n800 Somerset Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, September 9, 1937.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nOn the recommendation of the Archbishop of Rupert's Land the Department has approved the transfer of Miss A.C. Hilsen Field from Peguis South Indian Day School to the Fairford Indian Day School.\n\nMiss Field will be replaced at the Peguis South school by Miss Shaftfield, who has been teaching at the Fairford school. It is understood that Miss Shaftfield re-opened the Peguis South school on the first instant. She will be allowed salary at the same rate as Miss Field, viz $90.00 a teaching month.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.H. Roy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nF.J.

(RG 10, Volume 6244, file 534-1, part 2)\nOttawa,\nMay 21, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reporting on his inspection of the Peguis South School on the 13th instant Inspector Bartlett remarks on the unsatisfactory attendance. In view of the fact that we have been paying for driving the children to this school it is difficult to understand why there is not sufficient interest taken by the Indian parents to have their children attend regularly. I should appreciate hearing from you in this matter because if the parents and children will not co-operate we will have no other recourse than to discontinue driving the children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F.J. Clarke,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson, Man.\nOttawa,\nMay 21, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen reading Inspector Bartlett's report regarding his inspection of the Peguis South School on the 13th of May of this year I noticed that we had overlooked writing to you in connection with a portion of Mr. Bartlett's report on his visit to the school on June 24, 1940. This read in part as follows:\n\n\"I was unable to recommend a Grade 8 pupil for promotion from lack of attendance. The teacher gave the pupil a final examination in early June and then excused her from further attendance -- an inexcusable step. Promotion must now be deferred until another month's attendance is secured.\"\n\nI presume that there has been no similar case this year or the Inspector would have commented upon it. However, the Department cannot understand why any teacher would not be familiar with the regulations which require a certain number of days' attendance during the academic year before an entrance certificate can be awarded. Your comments on this action of the teacher would be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F.J. Clarke,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter 136-5-1 of May 21/41 re Mr. Bartlett's report on the Peguis South School, June 24th., 1940.\n\nElva Thomas, the grade 8 pupil referred to completed her examinations June 21/40, which is the regulation date.

Skaftefeld at the South School on Peguis Reserve as from October 1st. Mrs. Shergold holds a Second Class Certificate of Manitoba and has taught four Rural Schools in the Province. She has 16 years experience as a teacher and her recommendations are very satisfactory. She is I think of the age of 40 to 45. It will be advantageous to the School and the children therein to have a teacher both with knowledge of the Reserve and the problems she will face on an Indian Reserve.\n\nWith sincere regard, I am,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMMH/RH\n\nIndian Affairs.

Clarke,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to submit the following report on the schools in the Fisher River Agency, inspected during the week of November 17, 1941:\n\nPEGUIS SOUTH INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nMrs. Shergold is the teacher here. She is qualified and has had several years of experience. There are 40 pupils enrolled, and the grades are arranged as follows:\n\n- Grade 1 - 26 pupils\n- Grade 2 - 7 pupils\n- Grade 3 - 3 pupils\n- Grade 4 - 1 pupil\n- Grade 5 - 2 pupils\n- Grade 9 - 1 pupil\n\nThe pupils in attendance were clean and neat in appearance. Their book work was good, and I consider they are making fair progress. It was cold and snowing during the week I was at the Agency, and consequently the attendance was poor. Nineteen were present.\n\nThe van is not yet in use, but I think should operate after Christmas. Some children have five and six miles to travel and this is altogether too far when the snow becomes deep and the temperature gets below zero.\n\nThe school and residence are in good repair. The house is scantily furnished, and I would recommend that four chairs be provided, two for the dining-room at approximately $2.25 each, and two for the living-room at approximately $8.00 each.\n\nA.G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nOttawa,\nDecember 6, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reporting on a recent inspection of the Peguis South Indian Day School Inspector Hamilton states that the teacher's residence is not well furnished and he recommends purchase of two chairs for the dining room at a cost of $2.25 each and two for the living room at a cost of $8.00 each. You may arrange for the purchase and delivery of these.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F.J.

The pupils attending regularly are making good progress.\n\nThis school also needs interior painting. The walls are dark and the ceiling badly discoloured. The exteriors of the school and residence were painted a year ago and are in good condition.\n\nA special effort should be made both by the teacher and Agent to secure better attendance. Perhaps some children enrolled live too far away; but if there is no unusual sickness, the attendance should range around thirty. To date this has not been the case.\n\nA.G.

She sent her resignation in to the Church Authorities.\n\nIn regard to Mrs Mary Brandson, we do not consider her qualified to teach the South Peguis School. She has never taught school, and would have to teach on a permit, as she has only grade II standing. In this connection therefore, I got in touch with Mr. Pooke, Secretary to the Most Reverend L.R. Sherman, Archbishop Of Rupert's Land who had on file an application from Mrs George Hamerlick, but which was received by them after they had recommended Mrs Brandson.\n\nMrs Hamerlick taught this South Peguis School for 2 years before she married, is an experienced teacher and has good qualifications.\n\nIn discussing this matter with the Church Authorities, Mr Pooke advised that the Most Reverend is recommending Mrs Hamerlick for the position, and I have therefore, arranged with Mrs Hamerlick to re-open the South Peguis School on the 4th of October.\n\nTrust this meets with the approval of the Department.\n\nFJC/OT\n\nE.J.

Kindly forward the cheque to Mrs. Shergold.\n\nL.W. McCutcheon\nChief Treasury Officer.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI submit the following report on the Peguis Indian Day Schools inspected during the week of October 16th, 1944.\n\nSouth Peguis Indian Day School\n\nMrs. Hamrlik is in charge. She is a qualified teacher and greatly interested in her work. There are thirty-four pupils enrolled, with an average attendance of around twenty-six. The grades are as follows:\n\nGrade 1 - 17\n\" 2 - 6\n\" 3 - 6\n\" 4 - 4\n\" 5 - 1\n\nThe pupils appear to enjoy their work and I believe they are making good progress.\n\nMrs. Hamrlik expects when all the Indians are back to have an enrolment of from 40 to 50. There are only seats enough for 36 pupils. Either more seats should be provided or in their place a table with six chairs.\n\nThe classroom was clean, tidy and well aired. It has recently been painted inside and this has made a vast improvement. The exterior was painted last year.\n\nThe residence needs interior cleaning. The material for the walls is on hand and Mrs. Hamrlik intends to do the work. Her appointment came rather late and up until now the classroom has claimed her full attention.\nCentre Peguis Indian Day School\n\nMiss Alice Clarke is in charge at this point. She too is a qualified teacher and I consider she is doing very excellent work.\n\nThe roll calls for thirty-two pupils and I found twenty present. The average for September was 19.4. The grades are as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| 1     | 17     |\n| 2     | 5      |\n| 3     | 3      |\n| 4     | 1      |\n| 5     | 2      |\n| 7     | 4      |\n\nThe work seen was well done, and the pupils appeared keenly interested.\n\nThe interior of the classroom had just been painted. The work was well done; and the light shades used have made the room very attractive.\n\nThe residence was put on a new foundation a year ago and is in good condition.\n\nNorth Peguis Indian Day School\n\nThere are thirty-four children enrolled. Miss Eaton is in charge. She is an excellent teacher and appears greatly admired by the pupils. I found eighteen present and the average attendance for September was 17.7. The grades were arranged as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| 1     | 17     |\n| 2     | 2      |\n| 3     | 8      |\n| 4     | 1      |\n| 5     | 5      |\n| 6     | 1      |\n\nThe children were clean and neatly dressed. The work examined was good and the children are making fair progress.\n\nThis classroom has also been re-decorated and the painting has made a wonderful change.\nThe school residence is in good repair. I found some water in the basement; but this no doubt is due to the excessive heavy rains during the late summer and fall. Miss Eaton stated this is the first showing of water since the foundation was fixed over a year ago.

Clarke, Indian Agent,\nHodgson, Manitoba.\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, forwarding the resignation of Miss A. Eaton as teacher of the Peguis North School and Mrs. Geo. Ramlik, teacher of the Peguis South School. Both of these resignations are accepted.\n\nWe have also received a letter from the Secretary-Treasurer of the Synod of the Diocese of Rupert's Land, stating that they are endeavouring to obtain replacements and hope to be able to submit names to us in due course. When we hear further, we will advise you.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAIRMAL\n\nOttawa, January 9, 1946.\n\nDear Archbishop Sherman:\n\nAt the Peguis South School and the Peguis Centre School, in the Fisher River Agency, the enrolment is so large during the current academic year that it is almost impossible for one teacher to handle the school.\n\nIndian Agent Lazenby advises us that he can secure a building at both of the schools mentioned above, which could be opened as a second classroom. We are prepared to open two new classrooms if we can obtain a teacher for each of them. I would therefore appreciate it if you would give this matter your immediate attention and let me know as soon as possible if there is any possibility of securing two teachers. The new teachers would be under the direction of the teachers at present engaged at these two schools. A recent inspector's report indicates that both these teachers are doing good work.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMost Rev. L.R.

I would appreciate it if you would nominate two qualified teachers for this school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMost Reverend L.R.

Miss Stranger is a graduate of our Residential School at Elkhorn and has GR XII standing and she will have no difficulty in obtaining a permit from the Manitoba Department of Education to teach. We understand that Miss Stranger is generally competent and quite suited for the position.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRIP:A.\nOttawa, August 14, 1946.\n\nDear Archbishop Sherman:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, nominating Miss Annabella Stranger as the second teacher at the Peguis Centre Day School. Her appointment is approved and she will be allowed salary at the same rate as the other teacher, namely, $90.00 a teaching month plus bonus.\n\nIn my letter of July 9th, I advised you that the bonus would be at the rate of seventeen percent, but recently the bonus has been raised to 24.1 percent, at which rate it will be paid for the coming academic year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\n\nMost Reverend L.R. Sherman, M.A., B.Litt., D.D.,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nTrinity Hall,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nOttawa, 13 September 1946.\n\nMr. P.G. Lazenby, Indian Agent,\nHODGSON, Manitoba.\n\nWe have your letter of the 4th instant enclosing Staff Questionnaire completed by Miss Jeffrey, one of the teachers employed at the Peguis South School.\n\nHas Miss Stranger reported for duty? If so, she should forward the usual forms immediately in order that we can place her name on the pay list.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Mr. B.F. Neary's letter, File 136-5-1 (W.T.L.) dated the 13th instant, and in reply, to advise that when the Elkhorn Residential School Bus came to Hodgson, to pick up the pupils returning to that school after the holidays, I was introduced to Miss Annabella Stranger, and in talking with her, I mentioned to her that she would no doubt be taking over her duties as teacher on the Peguis reserve. Miss Stranger then told me that the Rev. Mr. Smith, the local Anglican missionary on Peguis reserve, had informed her that she was to go to teach at the Sioux Lookout Residential School. A few days later, Miss Stranger met me in Hodgson, and asked me if I had received a letter from Dr. Alderwood, and I told her that I had not. She then stated that she had received a telegram from Dr. Alderwood, advising her that she was to go to teach at Sioux Lookout, and that he was writing me. However, to date, I have received no communication from any source regarding the sending of Miss Stranger to Sioux Lookout. Miss Stranger has gone to Sioux Lookout, and Miss Kathleen Jeffrey is teaching alone at South Peguis School, and has 53 pupils.\n\nI had been under the impression that I had already advised the Department of the foregoing, but on checking, I find that I had mentioned the matter to Inspector Hamilton, in a letter to him regarding the proposal he made, to try for authority to build a lean-to on the school for a temporary teacher's residence, provided he was able to procure the materials.\n\nThe sending of Miss Stranger to Sioux Lookout, after her nomination by the Archbishop of Rupert's Land, and the Department's approval, that she teach at Peguis Reserve, seems rather out of order, especially when no reference of any sort has been made to\nthis office. Apparently the Department also has not been advised in the matter, and it would appear that some of the Anglican Church officials are working at cross purposes in the matter of the appointing of teachers. We are four teachers short for the three Peguis Schools. There is one teacher at North school, and one at the South school, and the Centre school remains closed.\n\nP.G. Lazenby\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 25 September 1946.\n\nDear Archbishop Sherman:\n\nWith reference to your letter of August 9th and official reply of August 14th with regard to the appointment of Miss Annabella Stranger as second teacher at the Peguis South School, the Indian Agent advises us that she has not yet reached the school. He further states that she has been engaged at the Sioux Lookout Residential School.\n\nIf possible, it would be appreciated if you would nominate another teacher for the Peguis South School. We are also requiring a second teacher at the Peguis North School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMost Reverend L.R.

He stated that the teachers were doing very good work, but that the schools, especially Peguis South, were much overcrowded, of which fact of course, the Department has previously been advised from this office.\n\nMr. Patterson asked if could be furnished with the School Bulletins that are sent out by the Department every two months, as he is very interested in them. He would like to have #4 and #5 of Vol: 1 and others as they are sent out.

(RG 10, Volume 6244, file 534-1, part 2)\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept' of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI beg to report as follows regarding Day School Teachers at the day schools in this agency, for the school year beginning 1st September 1947:\n\nPEGUIS SOUTH SCHOOL. Miss Kathleen Jeffrey, the present teacher advises that she will be returning to teach this school next year. However, it would be advisable to procure an extra teacher for this school if at all possible, so that the pupils may be divided, half being taught in the Church Hall as formerly proposed, as there are over 60 pupils on the roll and the school is much overcrowded. The two teachers could occupy the teacher's residence. The Church Hall is about a half mile from the residence.\n\nPEGUIS NORTH SCHOOL. Miss Una McDonald, the present teacher will be returning to teach this school next year. This school also should be divided, and an extra teacher procured. Half the pupils could be taught in the Church Hall, which is near the school, and both teachers could occupy the residence.\n\nPEGUIS CENTRE SCHOOL. As the Department is aware, this school has been closed for over a year. The Agency Clerk and his family occupy the teacher's residence. As mentioned in previous letters, it had been hoped that a new Clerk's House would be built this summer, and this school opened again on September 1st next. If this can be done, a teacher should be engaged for this school. If this cannot be done, a teacher\nwho would be willing to walk a little over a mile to and from the school each day, might be advertised for. There are about 40 children living in the vicinity of this school, who have missed their schooling for over a year.\n\nFISHER RIVER SCHOOL. This is a two room school. Mrs Jean Scott, who has been acting as Principal, intends returning to this school on September 1st next, for the next school year. Miss Eunice White, who has been teaching the junior room for the past two months, is returning to University, and will not be available. Therefore one teacher will be required for this school.\n\nTo sum up, five teachers will be required for 1st September next, as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Peguis South School} & \\quad 1 \\\\\n\\text{Peguis North} & \\quad 1 \\\\\n\\text{Peguis Centre} & \\quad 2 (\\text{If school re-opened}) \\\\\n\\text{Fisher River} & \\quad 1 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTotal Teachers required: 5\n\nP.G.

Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson, Manitoba.\n\nPeguis South Indian Day School\n\nReference your letter, File 7, of 30 June -\n\nIt is our policy to consider the employment of an extra teacher at a day school when the average attendance is over 30. Our figures for this school show that the average attendance for the last two quarters is as follows:\n\nDecember quarter - 48.65\nMarch quarter - 49.22\n\nIt would seem very evident that an extra teacher will be required at this school for September. Therefore, would you please investigate the possibilities of opening an extra classroom in the church hall, as recommended by you. We would appreciate details of this proposed classroom and also the rental required by the denomination concerned.\n\nIt is our intention to advertise in Winnipeg newspapers concerning such vacancies.\n\nIt is noted from your letter that two teachers could occupy the teacher's residence.\n\nBernard F.

(RG 10, Volume 6244, file 534-1, part 2)\nINFORMATION FOR THE EMPLOYEE\n\n8. Dependents. Taxpayers may claim as dependents only\u2014\n\n(1) A person wholly dependent on the taxpayer for support and of whom the taxpayer was immediately before such person attained the age of twenty-one years did have, in law or in fact, the custody and control.\n\n(2) Sons, daughters, stepsons, illegitimate sons and daughters or sons-in-law or daughters-in-law, brothers and sisters or brothers-in-law or sisters-in-law, and grandchildren, if under eighteen years of age or over eighteen but twenty-one and attending school or over eighteen years of age and incapable of self-support.\n\n(3) Parents, grandparents, parents-in-law or grandparent-in-law, if wholly dependent on the taxpayer for self-support.\n\n(4) A daughter or sister under twenty-one years of age training as a nurse in a public or provincial licensed private hospital.\n\n9. If Child Under 16 Years and Not Registrable for Family Allowances. A taxpayer may claim an exemption of only $100 for a wholly dependent child that he might have been registrable under The Family Allowances Act, 1944, had an allowance under the said Act was or might have been paid in respect of the last month of the taxation year within which a few months' event occurred and 16 years of age may be registered and receive payments under The Family Allowances Act. Therefore, Form T.D.I. provides that only the $100 exemption may be claimed for a child under 16 years of age in Item 5 as having been born after November 1941.\n\nThere are isolated cases, however, of children under 16 years of age who are not registrable for family allowances. An employee supporting a dependent child is entitled to claim the $300 exemption for tax deduction purposes. Therefore, an employer receiving a T.D.I form in which an employee claims the $300 exemption for a child under 16 years of age and tax deductions accordingly made must immediately refer the T.D.I form to the District Inspector of Income Tax for confirmation, accompanied by a declaration signed by the employee outlining the facts which substantiate his claim that he is the sole support of a child who is not eligible for registration under The Family Allowances Act.\n\n10. If Income of Spouse in Excess of $750. A taxpayer is not entitled to claim married status if his (her) spouse will have an income of more than $750 during the calendar year. If the spouse's income has been more than $250 but not more than $750, the exemption permitted for married status must be reduced by the amount by which the income of the spouse will exceed $250. If the spouse's income will be less than $600, then $350 should be entered in Item 6(B) (2) (i.e., $600 less $250). If the spouse's own income for the calendar year will be no more than $250, Item 6(B) (2) will be left blank and the full marital exemption of $750 will be claimed in Item 6(B) (3).\n\n11. \"Self-contained Domestic Establishment\" means a dwelling house, apartment, or other similar place of residence, containing at least two bedrooms, in which residence amongst other things the taxpayer as a general rule sleeps and has his meals prepared and served. (See Item 10.)\n\n12. Change in Status or Dependents. If during the year any change occurs in the status or dependents of an employee, the employee must complete and file with his employer an amended Form T.D.I.\n\n13. Effect of Failure to File Form T.D.I. In cases where Form T.D.I. (Revised for Jan. 1947) is not properly filed with the employer, deductions from all salaries or wages paid on or after January 1st, 1947 must be made as if the employee were a single person without dependents even though the employee may have filed a previous Form T.D.I. Single persons without dependents need not file this form.\n\n14. Filing of Income Tax Returns. In addition to filing this form you must file your Income Tax Return Form T.1 Special or T.1 General for the calendar year on or before 30th April of the following year.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS TO THE EMPLOYER\n\n15. If Form T.D.I Not Filed By Employee. Any employee who fails to file a completed Form T.D.I. (Revised for Jan. 1947) must be regarded for tax deduction purposes as a single person without dependents and deductions made as per column I in the Table of Income Tax Deductions (1947).\n\n16. Employer to Scrutinize Claims by Single Person for Married Status. The inclusion of a \"Self-contained Domestic Establishment\" condition in Item 11 indicates clearly that a taxpayer is not entitled to claim Married Status by reason of supporting a dependent therein unless the dependent actually lives there and the taxpayer therefore, employers are instructed to check the address shown under Item 4(B) or 4(D) with the taxpayer's own address. Item 4(B) should show where he is actually living at the time of making the declaration and in every case where the addresses are not the same the employer must make deductions as if the taxpayer were a single person, with or without dependents as the case may be.\n\n17. Employer's Responsibility Regarding Form T.D.I. The employer will have regard to the instructions contained in Item 16 above will check the employee's computations of the total exemptions in Item 6 and will otherwise make certain that the form is fully completed. He may also delete as a dependent any name in the name list of persons whom the employee has already listed in Item 4 unless the claim for married status came within paragraph (B) thereof. If the employer has reason to believe that any of the information on the form is incorrect or false he will not act upon the declaration until the employee has made the appropriate confirmation or correction. In case of doubt, the matter should be referred to the District Inspector of Income Tax.\n\n18. Action upon Receipt of Amended Form T.D.I. during Currency of Year. Employees are required to file an amended Form T.D.I. if any change occurs in their status or dependents. The employer should give immediate effect to a change from 'Single' status to 'Married' status and to an increase in the number of dependents. A change from 'Married' status to 'Single' status (e.g. where the employee becomes a widow) should not be made effective until the first pay period in the next calendar year because the employee will not be entitled to claim Married Status for the whole of the calendar year in which the change took place. Similarly, a decrease in the number of dependents should not generally require a change in the deductions until the following calendar year. One important exception due to the provision that a taxpayer may not claim as a dependent any person whose own income in excess of $400 during the calendar year. If, for example, a person previously supported by an employee and was claimed as a dependent on Form T.D.I takes up employment from another employer during the calendar year, immediate effect should be given to the amended form T.D.I as otherwise the employee will be left with a substantial balance of tax to pay with his return on Form T.1 Special or T.1 General.\n\n19. Further Information or Forms with respect to deduction of tax may be obtained from any District Inspector of Income Tax.\n\n20. Completed Forms T.D.I must be kept on File by the employer in order that they may be available at all times for payroll inspection by officers of the Taxation Division.\nOttawa, September 29th, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Pook:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of July 31st nominating Miss Mildred Hodgson as second teacher at the Peguis South Indian Day School.\n\nWe have just received a letter from Indian Agent Lazenby in which he forwards Miss Hodgson's resignation but she does not state the date on which she desires to give up duties.\n\nIs it possible for you to secure a second teacher for this school immediately.

Mr. Marsh holds a second class certificate and is a good teacher with a number of years' teaching experience.\n\nHe is particularly interested in gardening and he cannot engage in this hobby at Fairford as there is practically no top-soil. There is good top-soil at the new school at South Peguis and Mr. Marsh is very interested in such a transfer. I would appreciate your comments upon this proposal.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

However, it is pointed out that at the Peguis South School it is probable that two teachers will be required and I doubt if there would be room for the second teacher to live in the teacherage with Mr. Marsh and family. However, apart from this contingency there is no objection to the transfer of Mr. Marsh to the School suggested.\"\n\nWould you please phone Mr. Pook and tell him that it is the new school to which we intend to transfer Mr. Marsh.\n\nIt would also seem most necessary that we give the new school at Peguis South another name so that we can differentiate it from the old school. We will expect a recommendation from you in this regard.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJune 28, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for answer your letter of June 22.

I taught on a permit with Mr. H.B. Dalpin of Sarnia as my inspector; because of personal difference he did not recommend me to receive my certificate. I got along very well at the school and with the board. If you wish to have knowledge of my success in the school please contact Mr. Harvey Tidball, Forest, R.R.# Sec. S.S.

I have given them some details concerning the school set up as it exists in the hall and old school at Peguis South and have asked them to write you if they desire any further details.\n\nI note from the annual report submitted by Miss Hodgson that this school is in need of interior decoration. Please have forwarded a requisition covering Kem-tone or similar wall paint to do the interior of the teacherage and possibly the classroom at this school.\n\nI also note that the furniture in the teacherage is in need of some replacement. The mattresses in particular will require discarding. Please find attached three copies of our standard list of furniture which we are now supplying for our one room Indian Day Schools. Would you please prepare a requisition for the new furniture required at this school based on the standard list. It will be necessary for you to have quotations from Simpson's and Eaton's Western catalogues substituted for this list. These were obtained from Simpson's and Eaton's Eastern catalogues.\nI am sending you this letter in duplicate in the event that you may wish to forward a copy to the Indian Superintendent concerned.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nJuly 29, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for answer your letter of July 24th.\n\nI have also had an answer by air mail from our Regional Supervisor in Manitoba with regard to the Lake St. Martin School near Gypsumville, Manitoba.\n\nUnfortunately, they already have a teacher in mind for this new school but he suggested that I write to you with regard to a vacancy for two teachers at Peguis South.\n\nThis school is situated four miles from Hodgson, Manitoba. The post office and railway station (C.N.R.) are both at Hodgson. One classroom is near the teacherage and the second classroom is in the community hall.\n\nThe teacherage is 29 x 21 and has six rooms. Both teachers have previously lived in this teacherage and one walked approximately a mile to the community hall for teaching duties every day. The teacherage is frame with a cement foundation. There is no electricity in or near the school and the water is obtained from a spring. If you want more details concerning this school, I would suggest that you write directly to Mr. R.S. Davis, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, 538 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nThe other alternative which you might consider is a vacancy which we have for two teachers at St. Clair Indian School near Sarnia, Ontario. You are, no doubt, aware of this vacancy and can get more information from Mr. McCracken.\n\nI note that you do not hold a teaching certificate. Unfortunately, our salary schedule requires the holding of a Provincial Certificate and we would be forced to classify you as a Grade 1 teacher at a salary of $1140. an academic year. Your wife would be classified as a Grade 3 teacher at a salary of $1800.00 an academic year.\nI will be glad to hear further from you concerning either of the above two schools.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

His starting salary would be at the rate of $102.00 an academic month plus free house, fuel and light (which he would share with Mr. Emerson).\n\nI do not know where Mr. Brown got the information that he could obtain a salary of $1,400.00 per annum from the Provincial Department of Education. He has no qualifications of any kind for teaching and therefore can only be classified as a Permit Teacher. Naturally, he would be entitled to a much higher salary rating, had he produced evidence of holding a teaching certificate.\n\nI am attaching Employee Questionnaire and Income Tax forms for completion by Mr. Brown and for handing to Mr. Boyne if and when he reports for duty at this school.

It is the preferable plan from an educational point of view but it has the following disadvantages:\n\n(a) The roads must be in good condition throughout the academic year, to ensure bus trips every day.\n\n(b) The cost of either maintaining our own school bus\nor hiring a school bus would be an expensive item.\n\n(e) If the Department were to purchase a bus, it would be necessary to employ a full-time caretaker-chauffeur. It is difficult to get authority for the purchase of a school bus from the Treasury Board and we prefer contracting locally for such transportation services.\n\nTo summarize, it would be preferable to build a consolidated school but the relatively slight advantages from this procedure would seem to be outweighed by the disadvantages. As we will have to make our plans for these buildings in the near future, a final decision must be reached soon. I attach for your information the average attendances at these three schools as indicated by our records here.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. R. L. Bewell Indian Superintendent, Hodgson, and would ask that we receive your considered opinion on the situation when you have had an opportunity of corresponding with him. It is quite possible that Mr. Boyne and Mr. Emerson may be able to present information which will assist in reaching a decision.\n\nBernard A.

Certainly more thought must be given to the air-ducts in the proposed plan which seems to be an attempt to do something about the heating of the present one-room schools.\n\nWith the prospect of an enlarged programme of physical, recreational and vocational training, abandonment of the consolidation at Halfway of the upper grades might well be re-considered.\n\nPresent enrolments in the first three grades are: at #2, 35; at #3, 44; at #4, 39.\n\nIn Grades above III, the total enrolment is 44.\n\nPerhaps an experiment could be made with Mr. Davis' plan at either #2 or #4 right away to determine whether a few thousand might be saved at these two points so as to make more money available at Halfway (#3).\n\nThe road and transportation aspects have not, of course, been fully studied by the officials in the area.\n\nC.A.T. Clarke\nMay 4, 1949.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor\nof Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nPeguis Indian Day Schools.\n\nReference your 203-11AG of April 28th.\n\nWe are agreed concerning the erection of three single school rooms, but we do not feel that we should add to the present buildings. I have discussed this matter with both the Supervisor of Vocational Training and the Educational Survey Officer, and we are agreed for the following reasons:\n\n1. The present school buildings were erected in 1928, and are therefore, now twenty-one years of age. We would be adding to a building now past \"middle age\". Our Engineers and Architects do not recommend that this be done to a permanent building.\n\n2. From our experience at Big Eddy, it is very difficult to add a furnace to a building which was not designed to receive one. It would be necessary to have a blower to force the hot air from the furnace to the two classrooms. A gravity feed furnace would not draw the hot air to the far ends of the two classrooms. The teachers or the children at the far ends of the classrooms would definitely not be warm enough in the winter time.\n3. The teacherages, while satisfactory for one teacher and possibly, a member of his or her family, may be rather small for two teachers unless they happened to be friends.\n\nTherefore, we feel that the following action is indicated:\n\n1. The building of three one-room schools as per plan 888 at Peguis No. 2, 3 and 4 schools.\n\n2. The insulation of the present buildings with 3\" battens on the ceiling. Where the walls of the existing schools require it, insulate them with insul brick. We could use insul brick on the outside of the new classrooms, and this would make them very similar in appearance.\n\nWe still have an open mind about the four-room school, but feel that the decision to erect three separate buildings will probably be more advisable to suit our needs for at least the next ten years.\n\nWe would be pleased to have your comments concerning the remarks made above.\n\nBernard Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nJune 24, 1949.\n\nMr. W. S. Patterson,\nPublic School Inspector,\nEriksdale, Manitoba.\n\nIndian Schools in the Fisher River Agency.\n\nI have read with much interest your reports on the schools on the Peguis and Fisher River reserves. As you are aware, we are trying to follow a definite building program which will eventually provide complete educational facilities for all the Indian children on these reserves. The Murdoch School has been completed and also the Peguis No. 1 School.\n\nTenders have been called for the construction of extra classroom units at Peguis No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4 Schools.\n\nWhen I visited these reserves with Mr. Davis, our Regional Supervisor, last year, I reviewed with him the advisability of appointing a supervising principal for all these schools from Fisher River down to Peguis No. 1. This would place the following classrooms under more effective organization and provide a uniform direction of school activities for the following classrooms:\n\n| Location     | Rooms |\n|--------------|-------|\n| Fisher River | 2     |\n| Murdoch      | 1     |\n| Peguis No. 4 | 2     |\n| Peguis No. 3 | 2     |\n| Peguis No. 2 | 2     |\n| Peguis No. 1 | 1     |\n\nTotal: 10 rooms\n\nAs a beginning I suggested that we appoint one of the senior and experienced teachers to be supervising principal at a correspondingly\nhigher rate of salary. This principal would teach in one of the schools and would be absent from his classroom one or possibly two afternoons a week to visit the other rooms and co-ordinate the classroom activities therein. We would naturally pay for his mileage on these trips.\n\nWe have followed this procedure in other reserves with much success. The Indian Superintendent has a supervising principal who not only helps him with building repairs, maintenance, etc., but who co-ordinates all educational activities and who is responsible to him for such matters as janitor supplies, classroom supplies, etc.\n\nI do appreciate the interest which you have shown in these schools and would therefore be glad to have your comments concerning the feasibility of the above program and also your views in regard to the appointment to this position of Mr. T. W. Emerson. I was favourably impressed during my short visit to this school and I also have noted your comments concerning him on your last Inspector's report. His enthusiasm and educational interest will, I hope, help to put Indian education on these reserves on a proper footing.\n\nYou will note that I have written this letter under confidential heading and you can rest assured your reply will receive the same treatment here.\n\nA copy of this letter is being sent to our Regional Supervisor in Winnipeg as he is keenly interested in these proposals.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJuly 8, 1949.\n\nMr. R.S.

It is thought that the parents could make an effort to drive their children to school, or allow them to use their ponies for the purpose.\n\nYou should refer this matter to the attention of the Department early in November, next, with full particulars as to the arrangements you can make, and the cost of same, for conveying the children during next winter, when consideration will then be given to providing this service.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Templeman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson, Man.\nSir,\n\nTransportation of Children to Peguis South School.\n\nOn account of impassability of roads transportation of pupils to the Peguis South school by sleigh ceased on March 21st past. Up until recently the roads have still been impassable on the South Boundary of the Reserve on account of overflow of ditches rendering it difficult for a loaded wheel conveyance to travel.\n\nI beg to recommend that the transportation of pupils to the Peguis South School be continued during the present fiscal year and, in this connection, beg to request authority to ask for tenders for this work for a period ending November 30th, 1928. After that date, hauling will be done by sleighs and a new tender for this work up until March 31st, 1929 should be requested. May authority also be granted to ask for tenders for this period at the expiration of transportation on wheels on October 31, 1928?\n\nIn connection with transportation on wheels, I beg to advise that no person or Indian in the vicinity is possessed of a suitable vehicle and it would be necessary for the department to supply a light spring wagon with top frame and canvas cover for wet weather. I am enclosing herewith a copy of Approved Form of Contract between School District and Van Driver as in use by Provincial School Districts and would refer you to paragraph 2 thereof which allows that the School District supplies the conveyance, the Contractor, vide para. 1, supplying horses, harness, robes, etc.\n\nI beg to recommend that the department supply the necessary conveyance, the cost of which should not exceed $150. I have made no enquiries as to the cost of such vehicles but am basing my estimate on the usual cost of a democrat. If approved, may authority be granted to have Mr. Bunn purchase a suitable vehicle in Winnipeg?\n\nWith reference to Contract, I beg to recommend that the enclosed form be used in this connection. In the case of an Indian getting the contract, it would not be possible to obtain Bond for him, but in the case of a white man, I would recommend that the form of Bond be executed. With reference to para. 7, I would recommend a period of two weeks. With reference to Bond, should it be necessary to use this, I would like to be advised as to your wishes regarding the penal sum.

Templeman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIndian Agent's Office\nFisher River Agency,\nHodgson, Manitoba,\n\nAugust 3, 1928\n\nSir,\n\nRe Transportation of Children to Peguis South School.\n\nReplying to your letter of May 21st past with reference to the above-stated matter, in which you state that the parents of the children living at too great a distance from the school should drive their children to school, or allow them the use of their ponies for this purpose, I beg to advise that the parents of such children who require transportation possess each only one team.\n\nFor the greater part of the time, the parents are dependent upon their teams to earn their living and there are few times when they would be available for the children to use. None of the parents have ponies, in fact, nearly all horses on the Peguis Reserve are in continuous use, farming, freighting, working on Provincial Roads, etc.\n\nI would again recommend very strongly that a van be placed in operation for these children for the full 200 school days in each year, the period during early spring when roads are almost impassable excepted. The cost of such operation would not exceed $700 per annum and would be much cheaper than sending the children to Boarding School, even if the parents were willing to send them.\n\nThere are 12 children who reside at too great a distance to walk to school and the cost per capita at Boarding School of $175 per head would amount to $2100 whereas the cost of van is only $700, the saving by van being $1400.\n\nIf the children are transported only during the winter months, their education is not efficiently carried out. During the six months of summer, when they are absent from school, they lose all they have gained during the winter months.\n\nI give hereunder a list of the children:\n\nReuben Cook - Age 12, Gordon Cook - Age 12,\nJas. Thomas - Age 8, Albert Cook - Age 8,\nEdgar Thomas - Age 10, xMary Cook - Age 15,\nMary Thomas - Age 11, Martha Thomas - Age 12,\nMuriel Olsen - Age 11, Lily Cook - Age 9,\nMargaret Thomas - Age 7, Roderick Olsen - Age 13.\nx This girl is still in the Primary Grade.\nThree of the children who were travelling by van last winter are now walking to school. These are not included in the above list.\nAs stated in my previous letter, there is no suitable conveyance for the children in the vicinity and this would have to be supplied as is the custom with white schools in the District. Arrangements might be made to sell the conveyance to the Van Driver, he paying so much per month on same out of his earnings from transportation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Templeman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 10, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, relative to the transportation to the Peguis South School of those children of the Peguis South Reserve who reside at too great a distance to otherwise attend. It is noted you recommend that a van be placed in operation to transport these children during the entire period the school is in operation during the next academic year. It is also noted that the cost of operating this van would be approximately $700 per annum.\n\nThe Department will approve of your making the best arrangements you can and at the lowest possible rate per day for the period beginning on or about September 1st, next, to the end of June, 1929. The Department will also approve of the purchase of a suitable conveyance for the purpose, to become the property of the driver upon his paying for same in monthly instalments out of his earnings from the transportation of the pupils. You should, if possible, obtain prices for the supplying of the conveyance, and you should make the purchase from the firm quoting the lowest price. You should state the deduction you would recommend be made from the amount due the driver each month in payment for the van. You should also inform the Department as to the rate per day arranged with the driver for the transportation of the children to and from their homes to the school. We have noted the names and ages of the children for whom it will be necessary to provide transportation.\n\nAn account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the van should be forwarded for payment. You should also forward accounts in the usual manner covering the amount due the driver for his services, with the deduction in payment of the cost of the van shown thereon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Teacher at the Peguis South School was resigning on October 30th and operation of van was therefore postponed until a new teacher had been appointed and school re-opened.\n\nSchool re-opened in January past and the operation of van commenced on January 7th. With the exception of two days in January, when children were laid up with Influenza, the van has been in continuous operation during every school day until March 27th, school being closed that evening for the Easter holidays.\n\nAll bids received on this work were at the rate of $3.50 per day. The most dependable man and the one most conveniently located for this work was selected. The operation of the van has been very successful and, had it not been for the Influenza epidemic during the months of January and February, the average attendance would have been much greater during these months.\n\nIn explanation of my paying the driver in cash as per the attached Voucher No. 435 for the amount of $192.50 covering operation of the van from Jan. 7 to March 27, 1929, I beg to advise that the driver owed money on seed and other indebtedness and paid him in cash in order to make collection of this indebtedness more convenient.\n\nI have written to Mr. Bunn in Winnipeg asking him to purchase a suitable wheeled vehicle for summer operation, said vehicle to be paid for by the Van Driver out of his earnings at so much per month. On receipt of this vehicle and knowing the price of same, I will advise the amount per month which will be collected from the Van Driver in payment of the vehicle. During the past winter, the children have been transported by sleigh. The Driver has a canvas covered in vehicle heated by a small stove and fitted with upholstered seats.

INDIAN AGENT TEMPLEMAN,\nFOR THE MONTH OF APRIL, 1929, ON THE PEGUIS SOUTH\nINDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 136-5-7.\n\nThis school is an old log building 20 x 30. It is very much overcrowded and a larger building, preferably a two-roomed school with a junior and senior room is required. In a year or two, with the children in this vicinity growing up and attaining school age, the number of pupils on the roll will be 60 or more. Pupils are huddled so close together that it is a difficult matter for the teacher to maintain discipline and keep attention.\nOttawa, June 10, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to that portion of your report for the month of April, last, on the Peguis South Indian Day School regarding the condition of the present school building, I have to say that there are no funds provided in this year's estimates for the erection of a new building. This requirement has been noted for our estimates for the next school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH.

Stevenson, 565 Peguis Band, the van driver for the South Peguis School would like very much to purchase a large democrat for the conveyance of the children to the school. As he has no money, he is asking the Dept to finance this deal for him by deducting $25.00 per month from his pay cheque until paid in full.\n\nHe was in Winnipeg a short time ago and saw a rig which he said would suit, the price being $25.00.\n\nIf the Department would furnish the money to buy, I would suggest that Inspector Bunn of Winnipeg examine the rig mentioned, before buying. The present democrat he is using is too small for the work intended.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.A. Stevenson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nTHE SECRETARY,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 22nd, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, relative to the request of George Stevenson, the van driver for the South Peguis Indian Day School, that the Department purchase a large democrat for his use in conveying the children to the school, and that the cost be deducted from his monthly pay cheque until paid in full.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of your arranging for the purchase of a suitable vehicle to transport the children to and from their homes. You should take up with Mr. Inspector Bunn, Winnipeg, the matter of his examining the rig the driver wishes to obtain before the purchase is made, and Mr. Bunn could, no doubt, arrange to complete the purchase, obtaining an account, in duplicate, which he could either certify himself or hand to you to be certified and forwarded to the Department for payment. You should see, in preparing the voucher in favour of Stevenson for the amount due him for his services each month, that the sum of $25 is deducted until full payment is made. You should clearly state on the voucher the reason for making the deduction, quoting the file number and date of this letter as your authority.\n\nThe purchase of this rig should receive early attention, in order that it can be on hand when George Stevenson starts transporting the children to school when it reopens.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Miss Wright, the teacher is very short of desks, some of the children are sitting on boxes, others have boxes in front of them. She is asking the Dept. to give her 10 new single desks, 5 fronts and 5 rears, this will take all the room in the school.\n\nI would recommend that they be granted as they can be used in a new school when it is built, which I hope will be next summer. It will require a two-room for South Peguis. I would also recommend that 6 new blinds for the windows be purchased as the present ones are very shabby and worn out.\n\nThe most of the desks in the school are the New Empire.

Miss Jenny Wright is the teacher here, and from what I saw and heard I would say that she is doing good work. A great many of the parents pointed out to me how well their children were getting along in the school since Miss Wright came there. She, however, is working under great difficulties. In the first place her health is not good, although she was feeling better than she had been at the beginning of the winter. In the second place, the school is an old log building, very cold in the wintertime. The children were packed in there like sardines, with no room to get around at all, and Miss Wright informed me that she had nine different classes to teach, which must be very difficult in an overcrowded room. From what I gathered when going around the reserve, there are in the vicinity of that school about 70 children of school age, which is sufficient for two schools, and if a new Day School is going to be built here next summer I think this matter should receive consideration. The children from the southwest portion of the reserve come to the school by van, some of them I believe coming a distance of seven miles. A number of the children living in the southeast portion of the reserve do not come to school in the winter time on account of the distance that they have to travel. If we get the necessary school accommodation there before another winter sets in I think it would be well to consider the advisability of putting on another van for the southeast portion of the reserve, especially during the winter months.\n\n-The-\nInspector Christianson's Report on Fisher River Schools.\n\nThe teacher's residence here is practically new, having been built in the Fall of 1928, and it is in a first-class state of repair.\n\nIn conclusion I wish to point out that the Day Schools above mentioned are doing good work, and I believe the children attend about as regularly as in the ordinary White settlement. In going around I found that a great many of the children could not even speak Indian, as in the majority of the homes the English language is spoken exclusively.\n\nI mentioned that at the Fisher River School a midday meal is provided for the children. I think this should be considered at the other schools also, and when new schools are built I would suggest that a leanto kitchen be erected at the end of the building to provide a place where the meal could be prepared and served to the children. We have this arrangement at several of our Day Schools and it works out very satisfactorily. I may say that all the teachers mentioned this matter to me. Miss Wright, especially, pointed out that the lunch which many of the children brought with them was not sufficient, being merely bannock spread with lard. The ordinary midday meal given at the Day Schools is not expensive, but from past experience I can say that it is of great benefit to the children.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, April 9, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your No. 203-11 of the 1st instant, enclosing the report of Mr. Inspector Christianson on his inspection of the Peguis South Indian Day School.\n\nWith reference to the Inspector's report as to the need of a new school building to provide school facilities for all children of school age on that portion of the Peguis Reserve, I have to request that you will state whether you would advise that one building, having two classrooms, be erected at a location central to the requirements, or whether, in your opinion, it would be more satisfactory to erect two school buildings, having a classroom in each, on sites the most central to meet the requirements. As you are aware, at the present time a van is engaged to transport the children from the southwest portion of the Reserve, some having to travel a distance of nearly seven miles. After enquiring fully into the best arrangements that could be made to meet the requirements, I shall be pleased to have a report stating your views.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nA new school at South Pigeon is I feel urgently needed. I believe both the Indian agent and the inspector have reported on conditions and advised building this spring. In planning the school I think some provision ought to be made for a sun porch or rest room where a couch could be kept for children who suffer from headaches etc. I have found it necessary frequently to bring children over to the teacher's cottage to rest. The children are, many of them, obliged to leave home very early and do not return until quite late. I feel that it would be a great help to have a place where they could rest if need be and it is not always possible to leave them in the cottage.\n\nMay I ask that you build me a garage also. I bought a car last fall & have secured a temporary building for a garage during the winter. It was anything but an asset to the property however and I'd be glad to have something more respectable.\n\nIt would improve the appearance of the property immensely if the ground in front of the residence could be levelled & seeded down.\n\nI appreciate it very much if these things could be done this spring.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. Wright\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing a requisition for school material from Miss Wright of the Peguis South School along with a letter received from her.\n\nIn the second paragraph of her letter Miss Wright mentions a garage which she secured for temporary protection for her car during the winter. I do not know if it is usual for the Department to supply garages in such cases, but would state that I think that some different arrangements should be made either by the Department or by Miss Wright as the present building gives a very poor appearance to the grounds.\n\nMiss Wright also mentions the grounds in front of the residence. I might explain here that this ground was always put in garden by Miss Lee when she was at the south school, but as the present teacher leaves the reserve during the summer vacation, the garden would receive very little attention and would grow up in weeds.\n\nI will be pleased to carry out any instructions I may receive in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank M. Wagner\nAgency Clerk\n\nTHE SECRETARY\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 23rd, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, enclosing a requisition for school material from the teacher of the Peguis South Indian Day School, together with a communication relative to the providing of a garage.\n\nIn reply I have to say that an order is being sent the Government Stationery Office to forward to the teacher's address the classroom material considered necessary.\n\nRelative to the providing of a garage, I have to say that the Department has no funds available for this purpose.\n\nRegarding the levelling and seeding of the grounds in front of the residence, I have to request that you will state the work required for this purpose and the approximate cost of same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Yesterday I was informed by Mr. Stevenson, the Indian Agent, that you had written\nTo say I could not have it.\n\nIn these outlying districts,\na car is almost an essential\nthing as the few white people\nthere are, live a distance apart.\nI purchased a car last fall\n& for the winter rented a small\nbuilding to keep it in, but I do\nnot feel I can continue to do\nthat. I spoke to your\ninspector Mr. Christianson\nabout a garage and he gave\nme the impression that I\nwould be able to have one put\nup for me when the new school\nwas being put up.\n\nI would be very glad if\nyou can reconsider the matter\n& allow me this. If you can\nnot well you please consider\nThis letter is my resignation to the South Regina School, and I will drop out at the end of June.\n\nYours truly,\n(Miss Jennie Wright)\nOttawa, May 16, 1930.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the third instant, with reference to a garage for the Peguis South Indian Day School.

I shall be glad to have your recommendation at an early date.\n\nThe Department has received a request that an inexpensive garage be erected at this school for the teacher's car. You might favourably consider this when you are forwarding your estimate of the total cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nReferring to your letter of the 9th ultimo No. 136-5-5 regarding the need of a new school building on the Peguis Reserve, in the Fisher River Agency, I may say that I have gone into the question as to whether it would be advisable to erect one building having two classrooms, at a location central to the requirements, or whether it would be more satisfactory to have two school buildings, having a classroom in each.\n\nAfter careful consideration of the matter I have come to the conclusion that it would be much more advisable to have two separate schools, one on the site of the old school and the second one two miles West, across the river. I am told that there are about 70 children of school age in the district, and two separate buildings, with a capacity of 35 each is what is necessary. If this second school is built, across the river, there would be no further necessity for having a van to convey the children to school.\n\nThe cost of these buildings would be about $3000.00 for the schools, and $2000.00 for the teachers' residences.\n\nIn addition to this there is another school and teacherage required at the northern end of the Peguis Reserve, for which you stated last year and item was being noted for inclusion in the Estimates. I would suggest that this work be gone on with at the same time, if at all possible. This would mean an additional $5000.00 for the two buildings, school and teacherage.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6244, file 534-5, part 2)\nOttawa, June 2, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 203-11 of the 27th ultimo, with reference to buildings required at schools on the southern part of the Peguis Reserve. I note you recommend that two schools be provided rather than a two-classroom institution. You state that the new school should be approximately two miles west of the present Peguis South Indian Day School. I presume that this general site would be in the southwest quarter of Section 18 or in the northwest quarter of Section 7. I understand that most of the children who are at present being taken to school by van are living within 1\u00bd miles or so of the southern boundary of the reserve. This suggests that the new school site should be in Section 7. Please give the question of the site for the new school your consideration and, at a later date, let the Department have a recommendation in a separate communication. There are no funds at the present time for the erection of a new school there. It is proposed to call this the Peguis West Indian Day School. It is hoped that funds can be provided next year for the purpose. Returning to the subject matter of your letter, I am pleased to inform you that funds are now available for the erection of a classroom at the Peguis South Indian Day School. The teacher's residence there is practically new and all that is required is a classroom to accommodate at least 35 children. You might refer to my letter of the 27th ultimo in this connection and erect an inexpensive garage for the protection of the teacher's car.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

I am purchasing the lumber in Winnipeg, and have also arranged for the labour with Mr. A. H. Facker and Son, who are sending two men out to supervise the construction. The erection will be done by Indian labour, as the Indians certainly need the work. The hauling etc. will also be done by the Indians. They are hauling gravel and sand at the present time.\n\nIn the latter part of your No. 136-5-5, I note that you state you hope to provide funds next year for another residence and school to be known as the Peguis West Indian Day School. In connection with the site for this school, when Inspector Christianson last visited the school he held a meeting of the Indians on the South end of the reserve. The Chief and Councillors were there, as well as all Indians concerned in the erection of a new day school. The site picked out is in the extreme N.W. corner of the N.E. \u00bc of Section 6. If a school is built on this location, the children farthest from the school are those of Percy Cook and Edwin Cook. The former lives on the S.E. \u00bc of Sec. 3, and the latter lives on the S.W. \u00bc of Sec. 2. Most of the others live on Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8. The South school is situated on the N.W. \u00bc of Sec. 16, right on the banks of the river. The Inspector informs me that, after going into the matter very thoroughly and talking it over with the resident Missionary, Mr. Morris, they agreed that the place above mentioned is the most central location. Inspector Christianson personally went over the ground and picked out the exact location. I may add that the teacher's residence at the North school is the same type that was built at Peguis Centre and Peguis South two years ago. Two day schools are, however, a little larger than the\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\none that was built at Peguis Centre in 1926. The schools being erected now are 24' x 36', whereas the one formerly erected was 22' x 30'. I have received a very good price on the material and labour, and, in fact, the schools will cost a little less than the ones erected two years ago.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

I have asked Mr. Packer, the contractor who is building here this summer for an estimate on these, which I will forward to you in a few days, as Mr. Packer has been called to Winnipeg for the present.\n\nRegarding the old school houses I would suggest that they be given away to any Indian who is willing to take them. They are practically worthless now except for the few logs which could be used again, and these would about repay the Indian for taking them down. This will apply to both the North and South Schools. There is, however a small frame residence at the north which should be worth $50 to an Indian, as it is in fair repair. Mr. Morris, the Anglican Missionary here, spoke for the old school buildings some time ago and if he still wants them I would suggest that that the Dept let him have them for the taking.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. A. Stevenson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nTHE SECRETARY,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 16, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, relative to the erection of new out houses at the Peguis South and Peguis North Indian Day Schools. It is noted that you are obtaining an estimate of the cost and will forward same later for the consideration of the Department.\n\nRelative to the old school buildings at both the above schools, I beg to say that they may be given to any Indian who is willing to take them down and remove them from the school lot and level off the site on which they stand. It is noted that the Anglican missionary has spoken to you for these buildings. If you consider that he should have same rather than an Indian, the Department will approve of your making whatever arrangements you consider advisable. In any event, whoever removes the buildings should clear away all rubbish and level the site on which they stand.\n\nRelative to the small frame residence at the North School, you may arrange for the disposal of same, which it is noted is worth approximately $50. If you succeed in disposing of this building to an Indian, you should obtain the purchase price, which should cover the material in the building and the removal of all rubbish and the levelling of the ground on which it is situated. Any amount received for this old residence should be forwarded to the Department for credit to the Receiver General.\n\nI shall be glad if you will arrange to have these old buildings removed at an early date and the ground on which they stand properly levelled.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Packer to build the schools for $800.00 each and the bungalow for $850.00. Mr. Packer has received $1400.00 leaving a balance of $1050.00 due him, and as the buildings are completed he is very anxious to have his money. It will be a hardship to ask him to wait another five weeks for payment, which would mean a total delay of nearly two months since the Acting Agent sent me the account. I trust the Department will arrange to find funds from some source so that this account may be paid without any further delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

It is regretted that Mr. Packer will be put to inconvenience by delay in payment.

According to the Inspector, the teachers in charge seem to be very enthusiastic and are getting results.\n\nOn page five, under the heading of 'General' the Inspector speaks of a proposed school that is to be erected on the south end of the Peguis Reserve. I do not know whether it is the intention of the department to go ahead with this school or not. I should like to be advised.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nPEGUIS SOUTH DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThis school is taught by Miss Jenny Wright. There are 44 children on the register, and at the time of my visit there were 34 present. The grades taught are from 1 to 6. I found that the average attendance was about 35. I spent most of an afternoon in the classroom, and was well impressed with the work carried on. I think Miss Wright has splendid qualifications - not only has she her first class certificate, but she is a University graduate as well. She is working under a great handicap as there are often over 40 children in attendance in six different classes, and it is certainly quite a task. It is much different from teaching in a classroom where there is only one grade. I can conscientiously say that Miss Wright is giving her best efforts towards advancing the children who come to this school.\n\nNo mid-day meal is served at this school; the children have to bring their own lunch, but the usual biscuits are, of course, given out, and hot cocoa is also furnished.\n\nA van brings the children from the south west corner of the reserve, but, as I have often mentioned before, the children from the north east corner of the reserve...\nPEGUIS SOUTH DAY SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nreserve have a long way to come.\n\nA new school was built here last summer on the same plan as the North School. The teacher's bungalow was built two years ago.\n\nGENERAL.\n\nLast year the Department decided that another day school would be built on the south end of the reserve, and I picked out the site last May. If the Department propose to go on with the building of a new school and teacher's residence, as anticipated, I would like to go over the ground again as I am now under the impression that I can probably find a more central location. No doubt an Agent will soon be appointed, and if I am sent there to install him, I will go into this matter.\n\nI might say that the day schools in this Agency are all carried on in a very satisfactory manner. The buildings are practically all new - both schools and dwellings. The buildings erected in 1929 and 1930 on the Peguis Reserve were all built by A. H. Packer & Sons, and I was very well satisfied with the workmanship. Mr. Packer is a first class carpenter, and all his work is done in a workmanlike manner.\n\nTo make everything complete, a mid-day meal should be served at the three schools on the Peguis Reserve. This would mean an extra expenditure at the North and South Schools as there are too many children there to enable the teacher to look after the preparation of the meal. A lean-to would also have to be built on the back of the schools to provide a kitchen and a place for the children to eat.\nGENERAL (CONT'D.)\n\nto eat their lunch. If this were done, it would certainly be of great benefit to the children. However, we can get along for the present, but I hope the Department will consider this matter some time in the near future.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

This work was placed in Mr. Graham's hands last summer, and he states that a contract was made to build the schools for $800 each and the bungalow for $350.

Miss Wright was not asked to prepare the meal herself; she was asked to supervise the preparation of the meal by the older girls, which she might well do, and it seems to me that it would be in order to inform Miss Wright that she is expected to do this. This would be a splendid training for the girls, and to have an untrained Indian woman come in to do this work would be absurd. With your permission I will instruct Miss Wright that she is expected to oversee this work as part of her duties.\nOttawa, October 28, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your 203-11A of the 20th instant, relative to the preparing and serving of a midday lunch to the pupils at the Peguis South Indian Day School, it is noted that the teacher, Miss Wright, requests that assistance be given her in carrying out this work.\n\nIn this connection I have to say it is considered that Miss Wright could have the older girls prepare and serve the meal under her supervision. She could arrange for two, or more if necessary, of the older girls to do this work each day, giving them the necessary instructions regarding the food to be prepared and in the preparing and serving of same, also in the washing and cleaning of the utensils used after the meal is served. The Department agrees with you that this would be a splendid training for the girls. It is expected that the teacher will oversee this work as part of her duties. I shall be pleased if you will instruct her accordingly.\n\nIf the supplies for the meal have not yet been obtained, I shall be pleased if you will arrange to make the purchase and have them delivered to the school at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Stevenson Jr., s/o Indian Office, Hodgson, Man., for driving Peguis South School van for 22 days during March/33.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. dated\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nOttawa, April 7th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Voucher 480, for $77.00, in favour of Geo. Stevenson, for transporting the children to the Peguis South Indian Day School during the month of March. As there is a deduction of 10% from this account, a cheque for $69.30 will be forwarded to you in payment of Stevenson's services.\n\nOur appropriation this year has been considerably reduced and it is necessary to exercise every possible economy. Do you consider that the driving of the children to this school could be discontinued? If not, would it not be possible to discontinue the transportation of children during the months of May, June, September and October?\n\nPlease give this matter your immediate consideration and let me have your recommendation with a view to curtailing the cost of this service to the greatest possible extent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H. Lavender, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nReference to your letter 136-5-5 and the question of the transportation of the children to the Peguis South Day School.\n\nI fully realize the necessity for economy and would gladly recommend the curtailment of this service if it was feasible. Attached you will find a descriptive map of the situation which I trust you will find of some benefit to you in reviewing the situation. You will note that the location of the school is not at all central and is placed in the northeastern corner of the school district thus making the attendance of the children at the school impossible without transportation.\n\nThe question of moving the school is impossible and even if the buildings could be moved there would still be distances of four and five miles for the children to travel. As shown on the map, the children at the west end of the reserve are between eight and nine miles distant from the school. Therefore, if the van route were eliminated during the months suggested none of the pupils west of Hodgson could be expected to attend school on account of the distance to travel.\n\nOne solution I had in mind was to try and make arrangements with the school Trustees of the Hodgson village school for the accommodation of the children living west of Hodgson. This, however, I was unable to accomplish for the Hodgson school is already over crowded and unable to fully accommodate local conditions.\n\nIf it is imperative that transportation be cut, I would recommend that same be eliminated during the months of January and February. At that period of the year attendance is never very high. I am not honestly recommend the elimination of the van route during the months of May, June, September and October for this would mean too much loss of schooling to the pupils concerned.\n\nThe matter of the cost of transportation can hardly be reduced for at the present time the van driver is paid $3.50 less 35\u00a2 per day of travel. He has to keep two teams, supply his own equipment, a covered van on wheels, a covered sleigh, stove and heating and his route covers about thirty miles per day from the time he leaves his home until his return and I doubt very much if we could get any body else to give this service for less money.\n\nI will gladly co-operate in the question of economy as it refers to schools generally, but in this case outside of what I have suggested I am unable to see where costs can be cut.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. H. Lavender,\nIndian Agent\n\nTHE SECRETARY,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 20, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, regarding the transportation of the children to the Peguis South Indian Day School. The descriptive map which you enclosed showing the location of the school and where the Indians reside has been noted.\n\nWhile the Department is anxious to cut expenditure for the present fiscal year at every possible point, we are, in view of your report and the distance the greater number of children have to travel, approving of the continuing of the transportation of the children to and from school during the entire school year.

Should your funds, however, have to be curtailed in the question of transportation, the children shown on the map sent with the April report would have to remain away from school for any period that the van is not running. If such must take place I would suggest that any curtailment of the service be made in either January and February when the winter is most severe or in April and May during the break-up, when roads are more or less impassible.\n\nIf it is at all feasible I would certainly recommend that the service be continued throughout the school term.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nG.

It is noted you recommend that this service be continued throughout the entire school year but that, if funds are limited, the driving of the children might be discontinued in either January and February, when the winter is most severe, or in April and May, during the break-up, when roads are more or less impassable.\n\nThe Department is anxious to cut expenditure at every possible point, and, as you are in the best position to judge conditions at this school, it is thought that the service might be discontinued for two months, either January and February or April and May. The Department will leave this matter in your hands, to arrange for transportation facilities during the present winter and coming spring months, in order that a saving can be effected in expenses, by discontinuing the services for a two month period. You might advise the Department later during which months you consider the service in transporting the children should be eliminated, in the interests of effecting a saving in cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

You will realize I have to carry on with a big family and I am not able to pay my way through. I would greatly appreciate if you would look into this matter that I should get my above mentioned cheques. I thank you in advance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo. Stevenson Jr. no. 1150\n\nper H.P.\nOttawa, March 23, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Clark:\n\nI am just in receipt of a letter from George Stevenson, Jr., No. 1150, who, I believe, drives the van down there. This letter was marked with a special delivery stamp and he states that he has not received the December, January or February cheques. Therefore, I suppose that this man is being pushed by his creditors, and as he has a large family I am quite aware that it makes it very awkward for him.\n\nI immediately checked this matter up with the Schools Branch and find that the reason Stevenson has not received the three cheques he mentions is that they are out of funds in the vote from which this is payable. They have made application to the Treasury Board to transfer funds from another vote, but this authority has not come through yet. The accounts, however, are all ready for payment just as soon as this transfer is made, and you can assure George Stevenson and his creditors that there is no danger of him not receiving the money directly on completion of this transfer. I, therefore, trust that you will be able to arrange for any credit that George Stevenson requires in the meantime until he receives the cheques in question.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Superintendent of Agencies.\n\nF.

With this in mind, I have reviewed the expenditures at the Peguis South Indian Day School and noted that there is a heavy expenditure for the transportation of children. In spite of this fact, the attendance figures show that the average attendance for the past four quarters has been only 70% of the enrolment. It might be inferred from this that the driving of the children has no appreciable effect on the attendance.\n\nIs it necessary to drive the children to this school? How many use the van? Even though it may be necessary to drive some children during the winter months, why is it necessary to drive them during the fine weather? I would appreciate receiving a report from you in regard to this matter and I am hopeful that you will offer a recommendation that will reduce the expenditure for the transportation of children to a considerable extent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. F.

Cook: 2 pupils - 6 mi one way\n- A. McPherson: 1 pupil\n- A. Thomas: 3 pupils\n- Geo. McCourtier: 2 pupils\n- H. Thomas: 2 pupils\n- W. J. Thomas: 4\n- Jack: 2\n- Joe: 3\n\nAccording to the above there will be 19 pupils to go a distance of 3 miles or more to this school. Some of the above will be new pupils, and if they attend regularly, I would recommend that the van service be continued. However, if the attendance is poor, it might be possible to discontinue the van for a period, and have some of the pupils placed in a residential school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nF. J. Clarke,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 5, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to driving children to the Peguis South School.\n\nA review of the last return of this school does not show any children by the name of Cook, McPherson or McCorrister. Presumably these are new pupils to whom you refer. The Thomas children attended for only a part of each quarter. It would therefore appear that on many days very few pupils are transported. As pointed out in official letter of June 19, conditions at present confronting us make it absolutely necessary that every possible economy be effected. It would be appreciated therefore if you would again review this matter, as it is felt that the expenditure for transporting pupils to this school can be reduced.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. F. J. Clarke,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of Sept 5/40 re the operation of the van at Peguis South School.\n\nIf this van is operated, it is a full time job and I do not think the rate per day could be cut. The only suggestion I can make is that we continue the van after the vacation and give the Indians to understand that unless attendance is regular, the van service will be discontinued.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. J. Clarke,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 21, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant with reference to the operation of the van at the Peguis South Indian Day School.\n\nIt was not the intention of official letter of the 5th instant to suggest a reduction in the daily rate of the person who drives the van. It was considered that it might be possible to reduce the number of months during which the van is operated. In many places children have to walk a considerable distance to school and it should be no hardship for Indian pupils to do the same in the fine weather. It would be appreciated if you would give this matter further consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F. J. Clarke,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson, Man.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 21, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in communication at the present time with Indian Agent Clarke regarding the operation of a van to take children to the Peguis South Indian Day School. We have allowed this service for several years but our funds are so limited this year that every possible effort must be made to economize. There is nothing definite on file to indicate how many children have attended school as a result of the operation of this van.\n\nOn the occasion of your next visit to the Peguis Reserve it would be appreciated if you would make some inquiries and advise me if you consider the Department is warranted in incurring expenditure for the purpose mentioned above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge Departmental letter dated September 21, File 136-5-5, regarding a van to take children to the South Peguis Indian Day School.\n\nI find that there are 6 or 8 children residing from four to six miles distant from the South Peguis School. I think the Department will agree that this is too far to expect children to walk. It might be advisable to see if arrangements can be made for these children to attend the public school in Hodgson. If this could be done I think the use of a van might be discontinued.\n\nIn any event, unless the weather becomes extremely cold, the attendance at school might not be greatly affected if the van were discontinued until December 31st, and then put in operation through January, February, March and April.\n\nI think this arrangement might have a good effect on the minds of the Indians. They would perhaps realize that they had not had their children make the best use of the privileges provided for them.\n\nIf the Department approves of the suggestion that the children attend the Hodgson day school, I think no doubt Mr. Clarke could make the necessary arrangements if instructed to do so.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nOctober 10, 1940.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of September 12 and previous correspondence with reference to the operation of the van at the Peguis South School.\n\nIt is understood that there are 6 or 8 children residing from 4 to 6 miles distant from this school and we have been advised that it might be possible to arrange to have these children attend the public school at Hodgson. If this could be done the use of the van might be discontinued. Please interview the authorities of the Hodgson public school and ascertain if they are willing to accept these children and, if so, the yearly amount they would charge the Department for their tuition.\n\nI am inclined to feel that the attendance at this school would not be greatly affected if the van were not operated between now and the end of December. We will, however, be prepared to favourably consider operating the van during the months of January, February, March and April provided you are not successful in arranging with the public school authorities at Hodgson to accept the children residing a comparatively short distance from that school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F. J. Clarke,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the van at the Peguis South School, would the Dept consider paying for the children who use the van attending the provincial school in Hodgson. If this were done the van could be discontinued.\n\nIf the Dept wishes I will make enquiries as to the fees asked etc by the outside school board.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. J. Clarke,\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter 136-5-5 of Oct 10th re the Peguis Souyh School.\n\nI am now in receipt of a letter from the Hodgson School Board stating that owing to the number of pupils in attendance at that school, they will not be able to take any of the children from the Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.

The cost of operating this van was $3.50 per school day.\n\nThe Indians of Peguis reserve, who have children too far from the Peguis South school have requested that if our proposed plan for renting the south church hall and dividing this school into two rooms, under two teachers, goes through, two vans be operated to convey about 26 children to school, who live from 3 to 6 miles from the school. This is a reasonable request I think, as at present there are at least that many children now, of school age, who have never had a day at school. If however, the plan of dividing this school is not consummated, it would be no use bringing these children to the school, as there would be no accommodation for them, and the one van, which was operated last term would be sufficient.

Neary's letter, File 136-6-1 (W T) of the 7th July last, I beg to advise THAT we can procure the use of the Anglican Church Hall connected with the Peguis South Church, for use as an extra class room for the Peguis South School, at a rental of $15.00 per month. This hall is in very good shape and has been well kept. It is very clean. The only drawback is, that it has only three windows on each side, which is probably not sufficient lighting for school purposes. However, it is not at all bad. The teacher for this class room, if she lives at the teacher's residence, would have to walk about three quarters of a mile each way to and from the school.\n\nIf the use of this hall is approved, it will be necessary to equip it with school desks etc; and I enclose herewith a requisition in triplicate for these items.\n\nWith reference to scribblers, text books, etc; the teacher has prepared already a requisition for these requirements for the whole school, and it is thought that the requirements for that portion of the school located in the church hall could be taken from this supply.\n\nPlease advise at an early date the decision of the Department regarding the above proposals.\n\nP.G.

Please advise the Church of England officials that we approve the payment of a rent of $15.00 a month for this classroom, effective the date this school opens.\n\nWe are arranging to forward the desks and blackboard. We will also arrange to forward extra pencils and scribblers, as these will probably be required.\n\nBernard F.
