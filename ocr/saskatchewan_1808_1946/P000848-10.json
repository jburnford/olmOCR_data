The Arctic Ocean enters deeply, in the form of gulfs, bays, etc., into the N. parts of the continent of Europe, Asia and America. The chief of these indentations are the White Sea, in Europe; Sea of Kara, Gulfs of Obi and Yenisei, in Siberia and Baffin's Bay in North America. It is united to the Pacific by Behring's Straits, and to the Atlantic by a wide sea extending from Greenland on the W., to Norway and Lapland on the E. This portion of the Arctic Ocean contains one of the largest archipelagos on the globe. The middle of it is occupied by Greenland, and on the E. is an extensive group of islands, known under the name of Spitzbergen, the small island of Jan Mayen and Iceland. West of Greenland, and divided from it by Davis's Straits and Baffin's Bay, there are a number of islands of great size belonging to the Dominion of Canada. The regions embraced by the more restricted limits of the Arctic Ocean (namely, from lat. 70\u00b0 N.) are perhaps the most dreary and desolate on the face of the globe. Their shores are covered with eternal snows, and the entire surface of their seas with large fields and huge masses of floating ice, in perpetual motion, and whose constant and tremendous collisions are attended with the most appalling sounds. Dense fogs, violent storms and endless nights, add to the horror of the scene. There is but one month in the year (July) in which snow does not fall. The Arctic Ocean freezes even in summer; and, during the eight winter months, a continuous body of ice extends in every direction from the pole, filling the area of a circle between 3,000 and 4,000 miles in diameter. Some of the masses of ice that line the shores of this ocean, extend many miles in length, and present sea fronts of 200 feet in height; while fields of ice 20 or 30 miles in diameter, and from 10 to 40 feet in thickness, are frequent, and sometimes extend over 100 miles, so closely packed together that no opening is left between them. They are also found to have a violent rotary motion, by which they are dashed against one another with tremendous force. The icebergs, of which vast numbers are seen floating about, vary from a few yards to miles in circumference, and rise to several hundreds of feet in height. The ice in these regions is very transparent and compact, and remarkable for the variety and beauty of its tint. The water of the Arctic Ocean is extremely pure, shells being distinctly visible at a depth of 80 fathoms. The first attempt to navigate this sea was made in 1500. From 1745, England, anxious to find out a shorter passage to her East India possessions than round by the Cape of Good Hope, despatched successive expeditions to the northern coast of America, and offered a reward of \u00a310,000 to the successful discoverer of a north-west passage. At length, in 1852, Sir Robert McClure made this passage; Sir John Franklin completed the passage in 1845-46, but neither himself or crew ever returned. In 1857-59 Sir Leopold McClintock found at King William's Island a record of his death and of his lost expedition.\n\nWaghorn's Time Table, Published monthly in Winnipeg, Price 10c., Compiled and revised from official sources.\nARDEN.\nA post settlement on the Man. & N.

The sliding head on our Mill is connected with the sails by a straight jointed lever, which is the simplest and most direct connection that is possible to make. In all other self-governing mills (so called) this connection is made by levers, links and quadrants, and is indirect and inefficient.\n\n2. Our sails are supported at the two extremities of the pivoting bar and also at the head of the sail, and at the same time are moved in and out of the wind, from the head of the sail, so that the longest leverage is secured; hence there is less strain on the sails, and they are firm and uniform in their motion.\n\nIn all other mills the sails are supported and moved in the line of the pivoting bar only, and therefore can neither rest firmly nor be moved readily or uniformly.\n\nIn these particulars no other mill compares with ours, and it is difficult to conceive of any possible improvement.\n\nITS SUPERIORITY CONTRASTED.\n\n1. It is simpler, stronger and more durable than any other wind-mill.\n\n2. It is under perfect control of the operator, and in his absence is so guarded that it will stop in case of any accident.\n\n3. It is held into the wind by a weighted lever within the reach of the operator, whereas in other mills the sails are held out of the wind, and the weighted lever is beyond the reach of the operator.\n\n4. Its normal state is at rest, and it only runs when the weight is upon the lever. If the weight is removed or if any of the connections between the weight and the sails are broken, the mill stops. In other mills the opposite are the facts.\n\n5. Its available power is 25 per cent. greater than any other mill.\n\n6. Its governor is more sensitive and efficient than that of any other mill.\n\n7. No possible accident can cause it to \"run away,\" and no wind can \"uncap it,\" or blow it down without taking the tower with it. In these respects it is superior to any other mill.\n\n8. Its sliding head connections are so direct, and the supporters and leverage of its sails are so perfect, that no other mill can be made to compete with it except by infringing these patented peculiarities.\n\nThe above cut shows our Pumping Mill, with sails spread ready for work, but our Geared or Power-Wind Mills are mostly \"DOUBLE HEADERS,\" this is two wheels on one shaft, and has double the power of any other mill in existence.\n\nWrite for our Catalogue and Price List of Wind-Mills, Flour and Feed Grinders, and Pumps.\n\nJOHN C.

(In Algonquin Winnipeg means \"dirty water.\") Among its affluents from the east are Red River and the large and beautiful Winnipeg River. Its only tributary from the south is Red River, and among its many tributaries from the west are Dauphin or Little Saskatchewan River and the Great Saskatchewan River. It has no affluent from the north. It discharges its own surplus waters northwardly into the Nelson River through Pigeon Green Lake, into Hudson's Bay. On its shores are several stations of the Hudson's Bay Company, the Iceland settlement on its west shore and a number of lumber mills on the east shore.

The scenery is wild and romantic in a high degree; its shores, which are much indented with bays, being faced with precipices and crowned with hills and knobs of various heights, clad with a dense foliage of shrubbery and evergreens. Its surface beautifully studded with countless islands of various sizes and forms, said to number 12,000, producing an effect surpassing that of the far-famed Thousand Islands of the St. Lawrence, disclosing between them the continued sheet of its wide-spreading waters, the extent of which enlarges upon the vision as the traveler advances upon the lake, till the mainland is shut out from view by the islands that multiply around him. On the islands and mainland the outcrops have been traced for more than twenty miles, and large deposits of gold quartz have been found. Several mining companies have been organized to work the mines, which are very valuable. There are only two mines working, owing to a want of capital, and they have not reached a depth exceeding 150 feet. The ground increases in richness, and the seam or pay streak gradually widens. The stamp mills hitherto in use are so small that correct milling returns have not yet been obtained; but they have been received show from $10 to $14 a ton. The accessibility of the locations make them capable of being worked at far less cost than any mines yet discovered upon the continent. The lake receives the Rainy River from the south, and northward gives origin to the Winnipeg River.\n\nLANGDON,\nOn the main line of the C.P.R., 819 miles west of Winnipeg. Has a telegraph office.

E. and W. by the North West Territories of the Dominion. It extends from 49\u00b0 to 52\u00b0 15' N. lat., and from 95\u00b0 to 101\u00b0 50' W. lon., and comprises an area of 86,340 square miles.\n\nThe name Manitoba, taken from a large lake, a part of which lies in the province, is a contraction made by the old French Canadian voyageurs of the Cree word Manitowahun. Manito signifies supernatural, divine spirit, and wahun means a strait. As the waters of a strait in that lake are agitated in an unusual way, the Indians believed formerly there was therein something supernatural, a spirit that moved them, and so they called the lake Manitowahun.\n\nThe agricultural capabilities of its soil cannot be exceeded for many things. The most part of the province is prairie land, perfectly level and diversified by groups of elm, ash, oak, poplar, basswood, and ash-leaf maple (negondoo from ni folio). It is a rich, black mould resting partly on a limestone formation and partly on a thick coat of hard clay. Wheat ripens in 110 days, and gives an average return of 20 to 25 bushels to the acre. All kinds of garden vegetables, as well as oats, barley, Indian corn, hops, flax, hemp, potatoes, and other root crops are easily raised. The grassy savannas of Red River afford unlimited pasturage ranges, as long as unploughed.\n\nThe climate of Manitoba, though severe in winter, is nevertheless occasionally hot in summer. The mean for the three winter months of Dec., Jan., and Feb., is 5\u00b0 below, and for the summer months of June, July, and August, 65\u00b0. Though the winter is extremely cold, it is mitigated by a dry atmosphere. A population more healthy than Manitobans cannot be met anywhere.\n\nThe principal rivers are the Assiniboine, 480 miles long, and Red River, 685 miles long, 525 of which are in the United States. The largest lakes (only a part of which, however, are in Manitoba) are Winnipeg, 280 miles long and 45 to 57 miles wide; Winnipegosass, 110 miles long and 6 to 20 miles wide; Manitoba, 110 miles long and 25 wide.\n\nManitoba is divided into five electoral districts for Dominion elections, viz.: Selkirk, Provencher, Lisgar, Marquette, and Winnipeg, each of which sends 1 member to the House of Commons.\n\nWinnipeg is the capital of the Province. There are two bishops in the Province: the Archbishop of St. Boniface (Roman Catholic), residing at St. Boniface, east side of the Red River, facing Winnipeg, and the Metropolitan Bishop of Rupert's Land (Church of England), residing at St. John, Winnipeg.\n\nThe public affairs are administered by a Lieutenant Governor, an Executive Council of 5 members, and a Legislative Assembly of 31 members, elected every 4 years. Justice is dispensed by a Chief Justice and 3 puisne judges.\n\nFor a NOBBY SUIT TO ORDER, Go to CAMERON, 490 Main Street, Winnipeg.\nAll religious denominations are represented in the Province.\n\nThe Province is well provided with educational institutions. It has three colleges, St. John's (Church of England), St. Boniface (Roman Catholic), and Manitoba (Presbyterian), a Convent, 3 Protestant Ladies Schools, and 311 common schools, 271 amongst the Protestants and 40 amongst the Roman Catholics. The Sisters of Charity from Montreal have a large Convent at St. Boniface, an academy for young ladies, and orphanage, and four missions in the Province. The school system established by law is entirely denominational or separate.\n\nThe rapid increase in schools and school attendance during the thirteen years ending in 1883 will be more easily conceived by giving the figures, which are as follows:\n\n| Year | No. of schools | Total attend. |\n|------|---------------|--------------|\n| 1871 | 16            | 816          |\n| 1872 | 17            | 1,067        |\n| 1873 | 17            | 1,108        |\n| 1874 | 22            | 1,248        |\n| 1875 | 26            | 1,595        |\n| 1876 | 30            | 1,609        |\n| 1877 | 38            | 2,027        |\n| 1878 | 50            | 2,670        |\n| 1879 | 99            | 3,614        |\n| 1880 | 101           | 3,736        |\n| 1881 | 128           | 4,919        |\n| 1882 | 182           | 6,972        |\n| 1883 | 271           | 10,831       |\n\nIt will be observed that during the last four years the increase in the number of schools, as well as attendance, has been nearly threefold, a rate of progress quite in keeping with the settlement of the province.\n\nThe Legislative grant for 1883 was $33,159.98, which, with a balance of $7,338.07 from 1882, made a total available fund of $40,498.05. After deducting from this sum the expenses of the board, for superintendence, inspection of schools, examination of teachers, and other necessary charges, there remained a sum of $22,418.28 for aid to schools, and a balance carried forward to next year of $9,753.33. The necessity of large expenditure on capital account for the provision of school accommodation for the rapidly increasing population of the province accounts for the large receipts from the issue of debentures, amounting to $176,016.80, of which $149,658.80 was for \"cities and towns.\" It is considered a matter of regret that these debentures bear interest, in most cases as high as eight per cent. The Superintendent suggests the establishment of a fund upon the credit of the school lands of the province, from which loans might be obtained at a lower rate of interest.\n\nIn 1872 telegraphic communication was established between Manitoba and the United States.\n\nEvery bona-fide settler receives a home-stead or a free grant of 160 acres of land.\n\nThis section of North America was first visited by the French. Chevalier de la Verne-drye built a fort at the mouth of the Assiniboine in 1731. The French continued to trade there alone for many years, but in 1767 the first English traders visited it, and soon several rival companies were in operation. These finally dwindled into the famous North West Company, which, in its turn, was absorbed by the Hudson's Bay Company, chartered by King Charles II. in 1670. The latter company having sold a tract of land to the Hon. Thomas Douglas, Earl of Selkirk, on both sides of the Assiniboine and of the Red River, his lordship planted there, in 1812, a colony known by the name of Selkirk Settlement, Red River Settlement also Assiniboia. In 1836 the Hudson's Bay Company repurchased from the heirs of Lord Selkirk the same tract of land ceded to his lordship in 1811, and continued to exercise authority over that portion of Rupert's Land by the appointment of the Governor and Council of Assiniboia, which, in course of time, especially after the settlers had declared independence of trade in 1849, formed a rather independent administration for the local affairs in the colony, the limits of which extended but fifty miles around Fort Garry. It is that colony that now forms the greatest part of the new province of Manitoba.\n\nThe Hudson's Bay Company never claimed any proprietary rights on the North West Territories proper. These territories formerly included nothing but the lands east of the Rocky Mountains, watered by the rivers running towards the Arctic Sea. The Charter of the Company merely included Rupert's Land, i.e., the lands watered by the tributaries of Hudson's Bay.\n\nThese two immense portions of country outside of the province of Manitoba are now known by the name of North West Territories.\n\nIn March, 1869, the Hudson's Bay Company agreed to hand to the Imperial Government the territorial rights and governing responsibilities, and on the 16th of July, 1870, England handed the whole to the Canadian Government. It was during that period that the Red River troubles took place. The transactions between England and Canada, as well as the Hudson's Bay Company, having been made without consulting and even paying any attention to the government and people of Assiniboia, a deep feeling of uneasiness arose, and the Canadian authorities coming into the country before the transfer, demanded residence. In the meantime a provisional government was formed by the settlers to secure their rights and come to an agreement with the Dominion of Canada. Delegates were sent to Ottawa for that purpose, and treated with the proper authorities. England urged the Ottawa Government to satisfy the people of Red River. Then the Bill of Manitoba and other guarantees were agreed to, and thereby the entry of Manitoba into the Confederation was effected.\n\nThe main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway passes through the centre of the Province; there is nearly 700 miles of Railway in operation in the Province, which is expected will be more than doubled in a few years.\n\nThe first missionary known as having visited the country is the Rev. P\u00e8re Messager, who ac-\n\nClark's Haricot Mutton in 2lb. tins, P.O. 342, Montreal.\ncompounded Chevalier de la Verandrye in 1734. At the time of the Conquest the Catholic missions were abandoned; they were resumed in 1818 by the Revs. J. N. Provencher and S. J. N. Dumoulin, from Quebec.\n\nThe Rev. J. N. Provencher was consecrated bishop of Joliette in 1822, and afterwards nominated bishop of St. Boniface. That see was created an Archdiocese in 1871, and is now occupied by the Most Rev. Alexandre Tach\u00e9, D.D.\n\nA Church of England bishopric was created in 1849. Rev. David Anderson was the first Bishop of Rupert's Land, and was succeeded by the Right Rev. Robert Macnary, D.D.\n\n**MANITOBA HOUSE,**  \nAn H. B. Co.'s post on N. W. angle of Lake Manitoba.\n\n**MANITOBA VILLAGE,**  \nAn Indian Reserve on the west shore of Lake Manitoba.

Co.\n\nNORTH WEST TERRITORIES\nGeographical Position.\u2014That portion of the possessions of the Dominion of Canada now generally known as the North West Territories, and which comprises an area of about 1,868,000 square miles, may be described as bounded on the east by the Province of Manitoba and that region of country known as the District of Keewatin; on the south by the dividing line between Canada and the United States, which is along the 49th parallel of latitude and which is designated and generally understood as The International Boundary; on the west by the Province of British Columbia and the Territory of Alaska; and on the north by the Frozen Ocean. To save space this country will hereafter be called the N.W. Territories.\n\nGovernment.\u2014For the due administration of law and order there is a Lieutenant-Governor over the N.W. Territories, appointed by and holding that office during the pleasure of the Governor-General of Canada, and performing his functions under instructions given him either by Order-in-Council or by the Secretary of State of Canada. The Lieutenant-Governor is assisted by a Council at present composed of 14 members, of whom 8 are electoral representatives, 3 are the survivors of the six who formed the first Council, and who were appointed by the Governor-General when the Territorial Government was inaugurated; and the remaining 3 are the Stipendiary Magistrates of the N.W. Territories, who are ex officio members of the Council. There is, in addition to these, a Clerk of the Council, appointed by the Governor-General, who also acts as secretary to the Lieutenant-Governor. The 8 elected members represent the electoral districts.\nof Lorne, Edmonton, Broadview, Fort Qu'Appelle, Regina, Moose Jaw, Carlyle and Calgary. The present Lieutenant-Governor is Lieut.-Col. the Hon. E. Dewdney, who is also Indian Commissioner for the N.W. Territories. His seat of government is at Regina, which, however, may be changed from time to time by the Governor-General in Council. It will thus be seen that, owing to the rapid increase in the population of the N.W. Territories, it has already become necessary to put into active motion the machinery of the electoral law, which may be thus briefly explained:\u2014 Whenever any district not exceeding an area of 1,000 square miles attains to a population of not less than 1,000 persons of adult age\u2014exclusive of aliens and uncivilized Indians\u2014the Lieutenant-Governor is bound by the law in that behalf to erect such district into an electoral district, which is then entitled to elect a member of the Council or the Legislative Assembly, as the case may be; and when that district shall contain a population of 2,000 persons, qualified as aforesaid, it will be entitled to elect a second member. As soon as the members so elected shall arrive at the number of 21, the Council will cease, and the members so elected will be constituted and designated as the Legislative Assembly for the Territories. These members hold their seats for two years, when, unless re-elected, they must retire and be succeeded by others. Upon the death or resignation of a member, another election must be held.\n\nMagistrates.\u2014There are 3 stipendiary Magistrates to perform the functions pertaining to such office, and in addition to them the Commissioner of the North-West Mounted Police is also a stipendiary Magistrate ex officio. Since the organization of the N.W. Territories there have been appointed 98 Justices of the Peace, of whom 40 are members of the North-West Mounted Police, 9 are notaries public, and 45 are issuers of marriage licences; 63 notaries public, of whom 7 are also issuers of marriage licences; and 43 issuers of marriage licences including the 7 notaries public.\n\nNorth-West Mounted Police.\u2014The North-West Mounted Police is a most valuable arm of the government, especially of the N.W. Territories, and is composed of 2 officers, including 3 sergeants, and 520 non-commissioned officers and men, all under the command of the commissioner, Lieut.-Col. A. G. Irvine. The force is divided into five troops, each under the direction of a superintendent and two inspectors, in addition to which the adjutant and supply-officer rank as superintendents. The superintendents are ex officio Justices of the Peace and almost all of the inspectors have received like authority from the Lieutenant-Governor of the N.W. Territories. There are no municipal police forces in the N.W. Territories, but every member of the Mounted Police is invested with the authority of an ordinary police constable. Besides their police duties they also superintend the payment of treaty money to the various Indian bands. The headquarters of the force are at Regina, and the 5\n\nClark's Vegetable Soup, in 1 and 2lb. tins.\nvery nearly along the 60th parallel of north latitude; and on the west by the Province of British Columbia.\n\nDOMINION LAND AGENCIES.\u2014Owing to the trend influx of settlers into the aforesaid provisional districts, the Dominion Government in the spring of 1884, found it absolutely necessary for the management of the lands which were being taken up in all directions, to establish smaller districts, designated Land Agencies, which have been laid out as follows:\n\nIn the eastern portion of Assiniboia\u2014Touchwood, containing about 17,000 square miles; office at Touchwood Hills; land agent, Mr. John McTaggart. Qu'Appelle, containing about 15,000 square miles; office at Regina; land agent, Mr. W. H. Stevenson. Coteau, containing about 9,806 square miles; office at Carlyle; land agent, Mr. J. J. McLough. Swift Current, containing about 32,290 square miles, and comprising the greater part of the western portion of Assiniboia (of which district certain portions were included within the duties of the land agencies of Battleford and Calgary); office at Swift Current; land agent, Mr. W. M. Hilliard.\n\nIn Saskatchewan\u2014The Land Agency of Prince Albert, situated in the eastern part of that district, containing about 28,708 square miles, with office at the Town of Prince Albert; land agent, Mr. Geo. Duff. Provision has been made for an agency called Battleford, in the western part of Saskatchewan and including within its duties a portion of the district of Assiniboia, containing about 39,663 square miles. For this land agency no agent has yet been appointed. In Alberta\u2014The Land Agency of Calgary, situated in the southern part of the district, containing about 63,900 square miles, and including within its duties portions of the Districts of A-Similkameen and Kootenay; office at Calgary; agent Mr. J. McD. Gordon. Also, the Land Agency of Edmonton, situated in the northern part of the district, containing about 59,000 square miles, and including within its duties a portion of the district of Saskatchewan; office at Edmonton; agent, Mr. L. V. Guynnean.\n\nThese agencies are controlled by the Minister of the Interior at Ottawa, but, owing to the great distance which intervenes, they are under the general supervision of an officer\u2014Mr. A. Walsh\u2014styled the Commissioner of Dominion Lands, who is assisted by another officer\u2014Mr. H. H. Smith\u2014styled the Inspector of Dominion Lands Agencies, and having their headquarters at Winnipeg, Manitoba. These two gentlemen constitute what is called the Land Board, the object of which is to settle all disputes arising between settlers in regard to the occupation of Dominion Lands, and otherwise to arrange all matters relating to the general management of the same. The immense amount of work performed by the Department of the Interior in all its branches may be justly estimated upon a perusal of the Report of the Minister for the past year, which exhibits in detail the various and comprehensive labors connected with the settlement of the N.W. Territories.\n\nREGISTRATION DISTRICTS.\u2014Previous to the division of the N.W. Territories into Provisional Districts, Mr. W. J. Scott was appointed General Registrar for the whole country in question, but so rapid have been the development and settlement of that region that it became necessary to furnish the settlers with better registration facilities, and for this purpose 7 Registration Districts have been established. They are as follows:\u2014In Saskatchewan, the Registration District of Prince Albert, with office at the town of that name; Mr. A. Sprout, registrar. In Assiniboia, the Registration Districts of Touchwood, Regina, Souris and the City of Regina, all under one registrar, Mr. G. A. Montgomery, whose office is in the City of Regina. And in Alberta, the Registration Districts of Calgary and Edmonton; for the former of these two Mr. T. A. McClean has recently been appointed registrar, with office at Calgary, but for Edmonton no appointment has yet been made. Registrations affecting lands outside the boundaries of the aforesaid 7 Registration Districts are still made by Mr. Scott, whose office is at Battleford.\n\nPOST OFFICES.\u2014There are now sixty post offices in the N.W. Territories, of which 40 are in Assiniboia, 10 in Saskatchewan and 10 in Alberta.\n\nINDIANS.\u2014When the Dominion of Canada acquired possession of the N.W. Territories there were numerous bodies of roving Indians of different tribes, with whom treaties were made, and who were gathered together in large and placed in certain suitable localities\u2014termed Indian Reservations\u2014set apart for that purpose, and such has been the beneficial result of this action of the Government towards these people that already a large percentage of them are permanently settled and steadily engaged in agricultural pursuits. Every Reservation has its resident agent and farm instructor, whose duties are to assist the Indians in acquiring a thorough knowledge of agriculture. Three Industrial Schools for the instruction of Indian children in mechanical arts and agriculture have also been established, and are situated: One at Battleford in Saskatchewan, another near Qu'Appelle, in Assiniboia, and a third at High River, in Alberta.\n\nOAK BANK,\n\nSee Sunnyside.\n\nA post office.\n\nAndrews Alfred, farmer\nAndrews Jesse, farmer\nAndrews W.

It is situated in the midst of a rich mineral region, where are found gold, silver, copper, iron, lead and numerous other minerals. It is the lake terminus of the Thunder Bay division of the Canadian Pacific railway, where the vast products of Manitoba and the Great North West are transhipped, and where the immense cargoes of general merchandise necessary to supply the large population of the western prairies are transferred from water to rail, to the Canadian Pacific railway lake steamships. Steamerers of the Northwestern Transportation Co., of Sault Ste. Marie, and the Collingwood and Lake Superior Transit Co., run here regularly. As a shipping port it ranks very high. For the fiscal year ending 30th June, 1884, the number of vessels reported 837, with a tonnage of 450,559 tons, and crews numbering 1,767. A fashionable watering place will soon spring up here, as the scenery is unsurpassed, and the coolness of the lake breezes during the entire summer will attract a large number of tourists and health seekers. Two newspapers are published, the Thunder Bay Sentinel (a daily), established in 1875, containing the general local news of the district, and the Herald (weekly). There are 4 churches: Episcopal, Methodist, Presbyterian and Roman Catholic, also a large public school and convent. A very commodious town hall occupies a prominent position. Several large hotels, with first-class accommodation, and a number of smaller ones, supply the wants of travellers. It is also the seat of the Judicial district, and boasts of a very handsome Court house and jail. Sittings of the District Court are held twice a year, and the Division Court once a month. A large trade in fresh fish is carried on here. For lovers of the piscatorial art there are innumerable small streams and lakes, in which the choicest speckled trout abound. Distant from Collingwood nearly 700 miles; from Winnipeg 428 miles. Population about 4,500.\n\nClark's Roast Turkey in 1lb. tins, P.O. box 342, Montreal.\nAdams Mrs. Ann, St Paul nr Cameron\nAdams David, of Adams & Harvey\nAdams D., foreman Herald\nAdams & Harvey, job printers,\nArthur nr St Paul\nAtkins James, of Atkins & Persian\nAtkins & Persian, Temperance hotel,\nS.

This range, in connection with the Andes, of which it may be said to be a continuation, forms the longest, and, according to Humboldt, the most uniform chain of mountains on the globe. Somewhat more than half of the entire chain belongs to North America, the name Rocky Mountains, being usually applied to that portion only which is comprised within the United States and Dominion of Canada, although the exact limit of this mountain range towards the south can scarcely be said to be determined. The entire length, however, of the chain, following the windings, may be stated in round numbers at 3,000 miles. The east boundary of the Rocky Mountains in lat. 39\u00b0 N., is in 107\u00b0 20' W. lon.; in lat. 40\u00b0 N., 108\u00b0 30' W. lon.; in lat. 63\u00b0 N., 124\u00b0 40' W. lon.; in lat. 69\u00b0 N., 130\u00b0 30' W. lon.\n\nNotwithstanding this general tendency to the west, the continent widens so much more in the same direction that this chain, which, in South and Central America and Mexico is comparatively a coast range, is several hundred leagues inland in the United States and Canada. The highest known peaks within the United States are Fremont's, 13,570 feet; and Pike's Peak, 11,497 feet high; and Mount Brown and Mount Hooker, in Canada, near 53\u00b0 N. lat., the former about 16,000 and the latter 15,690 feet above the sea level. We are very imperfectly acquainted with this system of mountains; the general altitude of the range, however, is supposed to vary from 10,000 to 14,000 feet; it is said that peaks have been measured of 18,000 feet in elevation. Probably no mountains of the same altitude can be so readily traversed as the Rocky Mountain chain, owing to the great breadth of its base and its gentle acclivity. Among the most remarkable of the numerous passes may be mentioned that leading from the head waters of the Athabasca to those of the Columbia between Mount Brown and Mount Hooker, and called the Athabasca Portage; it has a height of 7,300 feet, and has only been used by the traders of the Hudson's Bay Company as the principal pass into the basin of Columbia. The following are the measurement of 8 other passes in the Dominion of Canada:\n\n1. Red Stone Creek or Boundary Pass from Waterlow River to the Kootanie, 6,030 feet above the sea.\n2. British Kootanie Pass, by Ramsay River to the Kootanie, 5,960 feet.\n3. \"Pov's Nest Pass, by Crow River to the Kootanie.\n4. Kootanee Pass, from Fort Bow by Ramsay River to the Kootanie (with a short tunnel, 4,600 feet), 6,086 feet.\n5. Vermillion Pass, from the South Saskatchewan River by Fort Bow (4,100 feet) to the Kootanie, 4,247 feet.\n6. Kicking Horse Pass, by Bow River and Kicking Horse River to the Upper Columbia, 5,250 feet.\n7. Howse Pass, from Deer River by Blue-\n\nClark's Boiled Beef in 2lb. tins.\nHENDERSON'S NORTH WEST GAZETTEER AND DIRECTORY.\n\nberry river to the Upper Columbia, 6,347 feet.\n\n6. Tele-Sanne or Yellowhead Pass, from the Athabasca to the Upper Fraser, 3,160 feet.\n\nThe principal pass on United States territory is the South Pass, in about lat. 42\u00b0 30' N., and lon. 109\u00b0 30' W. Its elevation is about 7,500 feet above the sea. The Union Pacific railroad crosses the Rocky Mountains near the sources of the Missouri and Columbia at an elevation of about 6,000 feet above the sea. Amid the valleys and forges of this stupendous system of mountains, some of the largest rivers of the globe have their birth. Of these the Athabasca, Peace, and Mackenzie find their outlet in the Polar Sea; the Saskatchewan in the Atlantic, through Hudson's Bay; the Missouri and its tributaries find an exit in Mississippi; while the Rio del Norte, the Colorado and the Columbia take opposite directions, the first through the valley of New Mexico to the Gulf of Mexico; the second through the deserts of Utah to the Gulf of California; while the last, from the N., bursting through the Cascade and contiguous ranges, rushes to join the mighty Pacific, bearing the only water that reaches that ocean directly from this range. On the geological structure of the Rocky Mountains little is as yet known. Volcanic rocks are known to exist in many places on the slopes or sides. According to the most recent reports there is, between the heads of Madison River and the upper waters of the Yellowstone, a volcanic region of perhaps 100 square miles in extent. Hot springs are found not only in this region, but in various other places on the east and west declivities of the Rocky Mountain range. Near 42\u00b0 37' N. lat., and 111\u00b0 45' W. lon., there are a number of fountains, the waters of which effervescence with the carbonic acid that they contain. From this circumstance they have received the name of \"Beer, or Soda Springs.\" The most remarkable of these is Roseau, a jet of water about 3 feet high, accompanied with a subterraneous noise, which, together with the rushing of water, resembles the sound of a steamboat in motion, whence it has been termed the \"Steamboat Spring.\" Inexhaustible coal fields skirt the Rocky Mountains through 12 degrees of latitude, chiefly in British territory. The route of the Canadian Pacific Railway is through this coal district, and crosses the Rocky Mountains by the Kicking Horse Pass.\n\nROSEAU,\nA school district.\nAgnew Geo., sec.-treas., Dominion City\n\nROSEAU, or RIVER OF ROSES,\nTakes its rise in the United States, and runs westward at a short distance from and nearly parallel to the boundary line till it joins the Red River, 10 miles north of Emerson.

N. Winding amongst\nThe mountain spurs near its source it follows a N.E. direction to Peace River Pass, thence it runs N.N.E., to the foot of Big Horn Hill, whence, having preserved the streamlet of that name, it marches eastward to Mountain House. From this point to Fort Edmonton its general direction is N.E.; it continues in the same direction until it crosses the 56th parallel of latitude, along which it runs and then turns southward towards Fort Pitt, and thus, between the latter and Fort Edmonton, describes a large and almost regular curve. From Fort Pitt the river continues its S.E. course to the Eskimo, whence it turns suddenly towards the N.E., first reaching Carleton House and thence Cumberland House. From the latter point its general course is S.E., although its great winding sometimes carries it towards the N.W., and sometimes towards the S. This great river divides into many branches that flow capriciously through the vast plains which they cut in various, and frequently quite opposite, directions. Clearwater River joins it near Mountain House, and 75 miles farther down it receives Brazeau River, called also North Branch. From its source to Mountain House, a distance of about 150 miles, the Saskatchewan is not navigable. From Mountain House to Edmonton, about 150 miles, it is navigable with barges, and from Edmonton to Carleton House, about 500 miles, with steamers during a couple of months, some years for a longer period. Between Carleton and Lake Winnipeg the river is very well fitted for navigation, except for 20 miles between Cedar Rapids and Lake Winnipeg, and along the same distance in Coal Rapids near the junction of the southern branch, about 50 miles below Carleton. Total length of the Saskatchewan about 1,200 miles. The northern branch of the Saskatchewan has three main sources, all flowing from the Rocky Mountains, viz.: Gros Ventres, Bow and Red Deer Rivers. From the south bank of this great river N.W. to Peace River the climate is adapted to the growth of wheat. Coal, salt, iron, gold and bitumen are among the products to be found. For hundreds of miles wild cattle can be seen grazing in countless herds. The valley of the Saskatchewan is fitted to sustain as dense an agricultural population as any area of equal extent on the face of the globe. This valley is supposed to be peopled by 17,000 Indians.

One of the sources of this river is at Saguenay Portage, afterwards expanding into Lac des Milles Lacs and flowing on as River la Sene. The whole up to Little Falls, about 65 miles, is navigable by steamers; then to River Lake 67 miles, it can only be navigated by canoes. From the beginning of River Lake to the end of Lake of the Woods, including Rainy River, which connects these two beautiful sheets of water, about 208 miles, it is navigable for steamers except at the Great Falls of St Francis. At East Portage, where it receives the waters of Lake of the Woods, it assumes its own name, and flows thence into Lake Winnipeg at Fort Alexander. This portion of the stream, for a distance of about 160 miles, has so many rapids, falls and cascades that it is only navigable for canoes and small boats. At one place the Winnipeg loses the name of White River, because the water is everywhere forming from the rapid, being very continuous. The most remarkable falls of Winnipeg River are, on the N., inside English River, which empties into Seal, and is the canoe route, via Albany River, to the port of that name on Hudson's Bay, and on the S., the chain of lakes which was formerly the canoe route via Grand Portage and Pigeon River. Vermillion Lake also drains into Winnipeg River.\n\nClark's Minced Oolops in lib. tins, P.O. box 342, Montreal.\nCity of Winnipeg:\n\nCapital of the Province of Manitoba, situated at the junction of the Assiniboine and Red Rivers, 16 miles S. of Lake Winnipeg, 65 from St. Vincent, 900 miles from Montreal via Canada Pacific Railway, or 9000 miles via Chicago and St. Paul. Prior to 1870 Winnipeg was nothing more than a chief trading-post of the Hudson Bay Company, whose headquarters were at Fort Garry. At that date the population was estimated at 300 souls. The growth of the city since has been marvelous, and a source of astonishment to citizens as well as strangers. In the interim, Manitoba was constituted a Province of the Dominion confederation, with Winnipeg as the Provincial capital. This gave a metropolitan character to the place, and brought the elements of political autonomy in its train, making it the headquarters of the Provincial Government, where the residence of the Lieutenant-Governor and all the public departments of the Province are located, as well as the superior courts and court house and jail. The Provincial Government too have made the city the head-quarters for locally transacting business in Manitoba and the Northwest. The city was incorporated in November, 1873, when its population numbered only some 2,000. The assessment of real estate which at that time was but a little over $2,000,000, has in 1884\u2014less than 11 years\u2014increased to nearly $10,000,000. The territorial extent of the city is about 4,000 acres. The revenue for 1884 was about $900,000, of which $90,000 was taxes and the balance licences, etc. Bonds have been issued three by the corporation\u2014in 1875 to the amount of $250,000 for general improvements; and in 1880 to the amount of $200,000 for the building of the Red River bridge, and in 1883 for sewage and street improvements. The mercantile and commercial interests of Winnipeg are as yet but in their infancy, but giant strides are being made in this direction. There are seven banks in the city, besides a number of business houses, the city has a handsome solid brick and stone City Hall costing over $100,000, and a police station costing $30,000. There are the solid brick Fire stations, with a paid Fire Department, 3 steam fire engines, 3 chemical engines, hook and ladder trucks, etc., with telegraph signal boxes in all parts of the city. The city is well lighted by the electric light, its sidewalks are broad and in good condition, second to none in the Dominion; the principal streets, Main street, is 132 feet wide and is paved with block pavement; several of the principal side streets are planked with 3 inch oak plank. $250,000 has been expended on a permanent sewage system. The city owns three bridges, one a railroad and traffic, and the other two private ones, all of which are free to the public. The wholesale mercantile trade is fast rising into importance, and an enormous business has recently been developed in the North-West.\n\nThe Winnipeg and Western Transportation Company have a mercantile fleet, which ply on Lake Winnipeg and the Saskatchewan river, carrying regular trips between Winnipeg and Edmonton at the base of the Rocky Mountains. There are 7 lines of rails entering Winnipeg, the main line of the C. P. R. west, the main line east, the Selkirk, Stonewall, Emerson, Gretna, and the Man. South Western Railway making it the great railroad centre of the West.\n\nWinnipeg, besides being the political and judicial metropolis of the Northwest, has also become the educational centre. The provincial Board of Education holds its sittings here, and the city is also the seat of the University of Manitoba, to which is affiliated St. John's College, one of the oldest here; St. Boniface College, which has recently erected a magnificent building valued at $30,000, and Manitoba College, a younger but also a flourishing institution. These are supplemented by two very fine ladies' colleges, one St. John's Ladies' School being valued at $12,000, and St. Mary's Academy, a new and handsome structure just approaching completion on Notre Dame street, valued at $15,000. In addition to these higher seats of learning there are the public and separate schools, which are well attended. The growth of church congregations has also been very rapid; it is but a very few years ago that church accommodation was very limited, and the number of worshippers also was very small. To-day there are several stately church edifices and others projected. The Presbyterians have Knox Church, a very fine building costing $80,000, and the Roman Catholics have St. Mary's church, valued at $30,000, besides the Cathedral in St. Boniface. The Methodist Church of Canada have two churches, Grace and Zion\u2014the former being a handsome edifice. The Episcopalians have also two churches in the city\u2014Holy Trinity and Christ's Church\u2014besides St. John Cathedral in northern suburbs and the Baptists in a comfortable frame church on Rupert street.\n\nThe industries of the city are yet in their infancy, but when the drawback occasioned by the scarcity of fuel is taken into consideration, it will be admitted that the trend in this direction is a creditable one. Within the last year or two there has been material progress made in both the character and design of many of the public and private buildings, in fact some have gone up during the past 2 years that will compare favorably with those of any other city. A good class of artisans have arrived in the city, and in the general growth of the city their handiwork has been one of the principal elements in the success that has been attained. There are two grist mills, one foundry and machine shop, six steam saw mills and lumber establishments, two breweries, two malt houses, three cigar manufacturers, two biscuit factories, and also a number of carriage and blacksmithing establishments. In this connection it may be mentioned that five or six of the leading agricultural implement manufacturers have handsome warehouses doing a thriving trade; in fact it may be stated, without fear of contradiction, that no other place of the Dominion is doing so large a trade done in farming implements as in Winnipeg. There are 75 hotels in the city, some of which are very commodious houses, and a great improvement on what existed even five years ago. There are three daily newspapers, also job printing establishments and book binderies. There is a manufactory in which stone of a very good quality is made. There are, in addition to the above, a number of minor industries. Pop. 30,000.\nABELS E. H., engineer H. B.

W., in times past it, as Fort Bourbon, gave fierce battle to the \"Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson's Bay,\" and incensed those Arctic waters in a strife the was brought to a close only by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, under which the French ceded the whole country and Hudson's Bay to the English. York Factory is one of the principal trading posts of the Hudson's Bay Company. It is proposed to build a railroad from here to Prince Albert, on the Saskatchewan to connect with the Canadian Pacific, a distance of 400 miles. This would bring the Saskatchewan Valley as near to tide-water as Ontario is to tide-water at Quebec. York Factory is nearer Liverpool than New York, the distances being as follows:\u2014York Factory to Liverpool via Hudson's Straits and Cape Farewell, the southern point of Greenland, 2,066 miles; New York to Liverpool via Cape Race and Tory Island, 2,987 miles; via Cape Race and Cape Clear, 3,029 miles.\n\nFor 200 years Hudson's Bay Company's sailing ships have traded between York Factory and Scotland. The Straits and Bay are clear of ice early in July, closing again at the end of September. Lignite coal is found in abundance at Davis Straits, and a coaling station for the projected steamship line could be established there. York Factory is the seat of the see of the Lord Bishop of Moose Cree (Church of England.)\n\nYORK FARMERS' COUNTY,\nLocated on Tps. 23, 24, and 25, Rg. 2, and Tps. 24, 25, and 26, Rg. 3, and Tps. 26, Rg. 4 and 5, West of the 2nd Meridian of the Territory of Assiniboia.
