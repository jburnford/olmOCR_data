Foisy, who has been for a number of years in charge of one of our Indian day schools at the St. Regis Reserve.\n\nThe Sister Superior has communicated with me in respect to the caretaking of the school during this period. The Sisters are naturally anxious that the property and equipment of the school should be under responsible supervision during their absence. Please discuss the matter of caretaking with Mr. Robert and reach an agreement with him whereby he will give the school and school buildings the supervision that may be necessary during the summer months. The Sister Superior has intimated that the caretaker may expect additional remuneration for this work. I must inform you, however, that it is not the intention of the Department to pay for this additional service, and you should so inform Mr. Robert. In addition to the supervision that may be given by Mr. Robert, it would be appreciated if during the holiday period you would visit the school from time to time and assure yourself that the property and equipment are not being injured in any way.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

On August the 28th of that same year you replied that the Department has allowed extra payment for the cleaning of the toilets and on September 9th, 1935, authorization was given for extra pay.\n\nSince then an account has been sent every year and the same was paid.\n\nThe payment of this account is left entirely to you but it is believed that as we have two janitors for the Village Schools and the teacher's residence and that they are far from being very busy during the school holidays the payment of any additional work should be discontinued.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nJuly 11, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 8th instant with reference to your voucher No. 169.\n\nIt has been decided to pay this account but similar payments will not be made in the future. Two janitors are employed for the village schools and teachers' residence and they have not a great deal to do for a period of 2 or 2\u00bd months each summer. It is, therefore, felt that payment for any additional work must be discontinued.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. F.

When we delay paying our taxes to the Government, we are charged interest. Would it not be reasonable for you to pay interest on overdue accounts?\n\nIn the hope of receiving a favourable reply, we remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nCouvrette Sauriol Limited,\n(Sgd) by F.

Engage a plumber to drill a hole in the bottom of the water tank in the basement. The tank should then be thoroughly drained by cutting off the fresh supply of water.\n\n2. Rinse out the bottom of the tank if possible.\n\n3. Add strong dissolving solution to fill tank in order to cut oil on all surfaces. A strong solution of washing soda would be suitable for this purpose.\n\n4. Heat the content of the whole tank. This may be done by forcing steam or hot water into the tank. If steam is used care must be taken to leave an opening for surplus steam to escape.\n\n5. Rinse tank several times with hot water and make certain that all the solution used for cleaning the tank has been removed.\n\nThe above work should be done at the earliest possible date and you should report fully on the results.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. F.

Firemen from both the Jorts of Montreal and Lachine fire department came to the scene in aid of this Indian Reserve which is a well-known reservation.\n\nIndian Agent Mr. X. Briarbois, with John K. Jocks, summoned aid of the nearby fire department of Montreal when it appeared that the flames were spreading. Firemen went through a number of residences near the school to try to stop the wind.\n\nShortly before 1 a.m., Mr. Briarbois reported that the Lachine department had brought a load of Chief Angus Mickie had succeeded in obtaining water from the St. Lawrence River and was now attacking the blaze which had moved through the school, a two-story brick building attended by about 200 pupils. The Montreal fire department arrived at about that time and joined the forces engaged to attack the blaze under orders of Chief Angus Mickie.\n\nThe doomed school was valued at about $45,000, the resident agent said.\n\nA strong wind forced the flames to sweep the school and an attempt after the fire was discovered by Albert Jocks to extinguish them.\n\nUntil the arrival of the firemen, a bucket brigade was engaged in fighting the fire which apparently broke out in the furnace room.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant dealing with the roofing of the teachers residence in which you informed of the quotation obtained from Raymond Hardware Limited, 658 Craig st, west, Montreal.\n\nIn reply I wish to inform that I have discussed the matter of having the work done immediately with the Sister Superior who is quite willing to suffer some inconvenience at the present time in order that it be done at once. On the other hand the above firm states that the work could be done quickly by their contractor with the minimum of inconvenience for those living in the building. Moreover they state that if the work is to be done only in the Spring they cannot assure that the material will be available and that if available it is likely that the prices will be higher.\n\nI would therefore suggest that this roof be replaced in the least possible delay as this will be satisfactory to all concerned.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.A.

Immediately on the outbreak of fire Mr. Brisebois phoned the Chief of the Training Division and this morning he phoned again and explained that, while the school is a total loss, he believes that there is a considerable quantity of material that might be salvaged. In addition, the main chimney is still standing and it should be decided if it should be left in this condition or demolished. Under the circumstances, Mr. Brisebois is very anxious to have an architect visit the reserve immediately. I am today requesting the Director of the Surveys & Engineering Branch to have Mr. Buck go to Caughnawaga.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nDecember 20, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th instant you may purchase the Ten Test required for the ceiling of the manual training room in the Kateri School. This material can be put in place by the manual training class without cost to the Department.\n\nRegarding the roof of the teachers' residence, this matter will have to be delayed due to the recent destruction of the senior school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F. Brisebois,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nDear Sir;-\n\nI beg to refer to my previous telephone calls to Ottawa in which I informed you of the destruction by fire of the local Senior School and in this connection to make the following report.\n\nAt about 11.30 P.M., the janitor who was living at the School was awakened by the smoke. Upon opening the door of his room which leads to the furnace room he saw some flame which appeared to him to be in the corridor between the sewing class room and the door leading to the furnace room. As he tried to reach for the fire extinguishers he was overcome by smoke and had to get out of the building. He then ran to the Church and gave the alarm. A few minutes after a bucket brigade went and tried to fight the fire but it was useless.\n\nI was awakened by a neighbor and immediately went to the office and called for the Lachine and Montreal firemen. The Lachine brigade came at about 12.30 and the Montreal firemen about 20 minutes later. It was however too late to save the School as the fire had spread to the three floors and was activated by a strong west wind. At about three o'clock the whole building collapsed.\n\nThe fire was blowing directly on the Kateri School and a wooden house located back of it. In fact the firemen had to concentrate their efforts at the other building and often had to turn the water on the Katheri School which was saved owing to their presence. Other fires also started but were promptly put out. The Village was threatened up to the time of the collapse of the School. The firemen worked with two powerful pumps from the time of their arrival up to nine o'clock in the morning.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe Senior School is a total loss. The chimney is the only thing now standing. Very few things could be saved. A few desks and chairs also some finished articles of the weaving studio. The total value of what was saved does not, in my estimation, exceed $200.00.\n\nIt would be appreciated if an official of the Branch could call here in order to inspect what is left and give the necessary authorization for the salvaging of the beams, and other iron also the brick, fire escapes etc., as it is feared that everything will disappeared if measures are not taken to remove these things.\n\nYours very truly\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nDecember 22, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nWith reference to Dr. McGill's memorandum of December 20, in connection with the destruction by fire of the senior school at Caughnawaga, I enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter which has just been received from Indian Agent Brisebois.\n\nActing Director.\n\nPP\nCaughnawaga, December 22nd, 1941.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont., in account with Frank T.

Damage was estimated at more than $60,000.\n\nMontreal and Lachine firemen, with Chief Angus MacKie, Pierre, rushed to the scene upon urgent call of Inspector Pierre Brisebois. It appeared that the blaze, fanned by a strong wind, would sweep through the rest of the buildings near the school. The Indian Reserve, which is without fire protection, was first ordered to fight the blaze with a \"bucket brigade.\"\n\nThe alarm was sounded by the janitor of the three-storey wood and brick building. Firemen rushed up to find smoke and fire surrounding him. Overcome by dense smoke, he was recovered in time to escape from the inferno and save Mr. Brisebois.\n\nFRANKLIN FIREMEN\n\nThe Lachine Department under Chief Angus MacKie obtained water from the Lachine river and pumped it into the blaze, having succeeded in stemming the fire somewhat when the arrival of Montreal firemen, under Chief Maclean, was heard.\n\nMr. Brisebois said the doomed school, built in 1893 by the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa, was attended by 200 children of the reserve. He praised the efficient work of the firemen from Montreal and Lachine, without whose prompt action the engulfed most of the reservation might have been destroyed.\n\nFire Inspector Pare, of Montreal, kept in constant touch with the progress of the fire, stating this morning that his men would remain on the scene until after nine o'clock.\n\nThree firemen were hurt while battling the flames and caused damage to a one-storey building on Laguerre street west, with its contents.\n\nThe blaze, discovered at 2:45 a.m., began to grow at 3:30 a.m. at 300 Fehr at 992 Laguerre street. The flames later spread to the nearby machines of D. Kingley, 990 Laguerre street.\n\nDistrict Chief Heaney and his men, assisted by Director Roche, managed to quell the fire an hour later. Smaller fires were also managed the premises of the Union Garage, 895 Cathedral street, located in the basement, as well as the premises of J. O. Lefebvre.\n\nThe injured were Lt. H. Hammond and J. Cloran, both of No. 25, and J. Chamberlain of No. 5 station who received slight cuts from the flames from broken glass. Damage of $15,000 was caused at 559 Haig street at an early hour; this fire, whose cause of unknown origin broke out in the window of the second floor of the house, spread to both the lower and upper flats.\n\nFiremen from Lebel Bourdon played two streams of water into the blaze, which started at about 2:30 a.m. and was fully extinguished an hour later.\nCAUGHNAWAGA FIRE DESTROYS SCHOOL\n\nMontreal and Lachine Departments Help Battle Blaze\n\n(Special to The Gazette.)\n\nCaughnawaga, Que., December 13\u2014Shortly before midnight, the Senior School of the St. Francis Mission near Caughnawaga was destroyed early this morning despite the efforts of Montreal and Lachine firemen who rushed to the aid of this Indian Reserve which is situated near the town.\n\nIndian Agent F. X. Brisebois, with John Robert, chief of police of the nearby municipality and of Montreal firemen, tried to prevent the flames from possibly sweeping through the houses of the Indians near the school due to a strong wind.\n\nShortly before 1 a.m., Mr. Brisebois informed the Montreal Fire Department under command of Chief Angus Mickie had succeeded in obtaining water from the St. Lawrence River and pumping it to attack the fire. The fire had already spread through the three-story wood and brick building which housed about 250 reservation children. The Montreal firemen arrived at the scene about that time and immediately prepared an air force of 16 men under Fire Chief Mechanic Joseph Forget.\n\nThe damage caused by the fire is estimated at about $45,000 the resident agent said.\n\nA strong wind forced the flames toward the school yard an hour after the fire was discovered by Albert Robert, the school janitor. Until the firemen arrived on the scene, a bucket brigade failed to cope with the fire when another fire quickly broke out in the furnace room.\n| TRIP NO. | DEMANDE NO. | MONTANT BRUT GROSS BILL | MONTANT NET NET BILL |\n|----------|-------------|-------------------------|----------------------|\n| 192      | 18          | 707                     | 636                  |\n\n**TAXE DE VENTE F\u00c9D\u00c9RALE**\nFEDERAL SALES TAX\n\n8%\n\n**TAXE DE VENTE PROVINCIALE**\nPROVINCIAL SALES TAX\n\n2%\n\nPLEASE BRING THIS ACCOUNT WHEN MAKING PAYMENT\n\nTOTAL\n\nVEUILLEZ TRANSMETTRE \u00c0 LA COMPAGNIE \u00c0 MONTR\u00c9AL TOUTE PLAINTE CONCERNANT LE BILLET.\n\nPLEASE ADDRESS COMPLAINTS TO THE COMPANY AT MONTREAL.\n\nDESCRIPTION DES TAUX AU VERSO.

Today I put a period to my plans\u2014\n\nFive classes have to be lodged and here are my plans. I do not care to lodge these classes in temporary houses on the Reserve, for such reasons as, heating, sanitation, desks, blackboards, supervision, etc.\n\nFather Lalonde, the Pastor, has kindly offered the Parish Hall for temporary classes\u2014and for meetings, etc.\u2014still, I do not care to accept for class purposes.\n\nI could lodge all five grades of the Senior School in the Kateri and Eastern schools, temporarily. If each school could be partitioned off, making two classes out of one, four grades could be accommodated having enough desks actually without buying more. One class could be lodged in our convent Dining Room. As we are now, we could get along till June in these conditions, with inconveniences no doubt, but with less than putting up in houses here and there. My work of following up the grades also would be alleviated, as all would be centered in two buildings with the only expense of partitioning material and labour. For this reason of adjustment, classes could be resumed on Jan. 12th or about, instead of Jan. 7th. In this way, all classes would go on as best possible till conditions are bettered.\n\nNaturally, portable blackboards, books for\nward-rob\u00e9s and minor accessories would be needed. All this you understand, and do you approve? If so, we will proceed with the Agent's help, to having purchases made and labour done at once.\n\nYour visit here would be greatly appreciated.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nTeacher's Residence,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\nDecember 27, 1941\nCaughnawaga, Que.,\nDecember 27, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to transmit you herewith a letter remitted me by the Sister Superior dealing with the accommodation of the pupils of the Senior School. This letter is self explanatory.\n\nThe suggestion contained in the Sister's letter is recommended to your attention as it is believed that under the present circumstances this arrangement is the best that can be secured with the minimum of expenses.\n\nThe temporary partition of four classes in the Katerk and Eastern School would enable all pupils to attend school in comfortable buildings. To rent houses on the Reserve would be expensive and accommodation would be very poor for the pupils and the teachers.\n\nI would kindly ask you to let me know as soon as possible if the above meets with your approval and at the same time authorize the purchase of the necessary material for the partitions so that the work be started immediately in order that pupils be ready to resume their studies for the 12th of next month. It is believed that local labour could be used to advantage.\n\nA requisition from the Superior is also enclosed.\n\nYours very truly\n\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Caughnawaga R.C.

I should appreciate it if you would give this matter your personal attention in order that the work may be expedited to the greatest extent possible as I would like the classrooms re-opened by January 12.

With regard to the latter it is understood that you will arrange for building frames to hold the blackboard.\n\nYou may purchase 2 folding tables, 2 ordinary alarm clocks and 2 - 10\" fire gongs. The latter should be operated by means of a chain. I understand that Mr. Doucet explained to you how they should be used.\n\nThe trade name of the glass to be used on the top of the partitions is \"Muranese\".\n\nI am requesting the Purchasing Agent to secure the material required for the roofing of the\n\nMr. F.

These tables will likely be made here.\n\nTwo alarm clocks and 2-10\" fire gongs are being purchased.\n\nThe Muranese glass has also been bought from the Raymond Hardware, Craig st., Montreal.\n\nYou will be advised when the material required for the roofing of the Sister's residence is delivered.\n\nYours very truly\n\nR.A.

(RG 10, Volume 6081, file 305-5, part 12)\nJanuary 6th, 1942\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nRe: Senior School, Caughnawaga Indian Agency, Quebec.\n\nWith reference to your notation dated the 20th ultimo on Dr. McGill's memorandum of the same date, and further to our telephone discussion regarding an inspection of the above, I may say that in accordance with Dr. McGill's request, an inspection was carried out by our Architect on the 25th ultimo, and Mr. Buck now reports as follows:\n\nThe building known as the senior school was a brick veneered structure, containing partial basement, first, second and third floors. The partial basement housed the heating equipment and water supply system. The first floor contained accommodation for weaving and handicraft work, a domestic science room, the upper portion of boiler and fuel rooms, caretaker's room and one academic class-room, as well as pupils' toilet accommodation. The second floor was assigned completely to classrooms, and an assembly hall occupied the whole top floor area.\n\nThe second and third floor construction was carried on a partial steel frame running longitudinally, while the cross bearing was taken by the brick veneered walls. Except for the area occupied by the partial basement, the first floor rested on the ground. Concrete piers in the first floor provided support for steel columns in the upper floors.\n\nOn his inspection Mr. Buck found that except for the chimney, which still stands, the building has collapsed during the fire, and that no visible portion of the former structure or its members could be re-used. Those portions of the foundation walls which still remain in position are covered by the ruins, and no definite opinion on their condition will be possible until they have been exposed to view. It is considered likely, however, that the intense heat to which they have been subjected will have destroyed their usefulness.\n\nInterior steel work, such as beams, columns, radiators and heating pipes have been rendered useless by their collapse into the centre of the fire at its height, while exterior fire escape having been carried outward when the exterior walls collapsed, are warped and distorted beyond repair.\n\nNo metal.....\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nNo metal work that could be seen is considered to have any value beyond what might be obtained for scrap.\n\nSince the former boiler room is completely filled with debris to grade level, it was not possible to inspect the two heating boilers, fuel oil pump, fuel oil tank or water supply equipment. It is considered unlikely that this equipment could be reused, but under existing building conditions it should be inspected before being disposed of.\n\nThe chimney remains standing, but its condition is hazardous and the Indian Affairs Branch should arrange for its demolition immediately.\n\nIt was observed that among the debris there are some undamaged face brick; but the cost of sorting, cleaning and stacking them for re-use would not be justified.\n\nIt is felt that a better price for salvageable scrap metal could be obtained by disposing of it separately, rather than by asking for an allowance when considering new construction work, and on this basis the following action is recommended:\n\n(a) That the existing chimney be demolished immediately under the supervision of the Indian Agent.\n\n(b) That the Indian Agent be instructed to have the former boiler room cleared of all debris, to uncover heating boilers, fuel pump, water supply equipment etc., for the convenience of Departmental officers on inspection, or parties tendering on scrap materials.\n\n(c) That when item (b) is completed, an inspection of the mechanical equipment at present buried should be carried out by an officer of this Service, who would have authority to obtain technical advice if required.\n\n(d) That contingent upon what equipment may be found still fit for service, the Indian Affairs Branch, through the Indian Agent, obtain prices from at least four firms for the purchase and removal from the site of all materials and wreckage, whether of value or not.\n\nIt is estimated that to replace the building with services and equipment as before the fire with allowances for contingencies and supervision, would cost under existing conditions in the neighbourhood of Seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000.00).\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nChief Engineer.\nJanuary 9th, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nI am attaching herewith, copy of a memorandum from Mr. Mills, Chief Engineer, dated the 6th instant, embodying Mr. Buck's report on his inspection of the site of the Senior School, Caughnawaga, which was recently destroyed by fire.\n\nThe recommendations made on Page 2 seem to be the proper procedure at the present time. As soon as your Indian Agent has been able to clear out the debris so that a detailed inspection of the boiler room etc., is possible, arrangements will be made for another visit by Mr. Buck. He should be authorized to obtain the advice of a heating engineer or steamfitter if this appears necessary.\n\nIt is understood that there are so many factors affecting the type of building that may be erected, and which may provide school and other facilities as well, that Mr. Buck has given in his report only an estimate of what it would cost to replace the original building, and provide the same facilities that it afforded.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 15, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn connection with the senior school, the Surveys & Engineering Branch recommend as follows:\n\n(a) That the existing chimney be demolished immediately under the supervision of the Indian Agent.\n\n(b) That the Indian Agent be instructed to have the former boiler room cleared of all debris, to uncover heating boilers, fuel pump, water supply equipment etc., for the convenience of Departmental officers on inspection, or parties tendering on scrap materials.\n\n(c) That when item (b) is completed, an inspection of the mechanical equipment at present buried should be carried out by an officer of this Service, who would have authority to obtain technical advice if required.\n\nYou may arrange for the immediate demolition of the chimney. With regard to item (b) I should appreciate your giving me an idea of the approximate cost of carrying out the work suggested by the Surveys & Engineering Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. F.

(RG 10, Volume 6081, file 305-5, part 12)\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nRe: Fire at Senior School, Caughnawaga Indian Agency, Quebec.\n\nWith reference to the recent destruction of the above school by fire, I may say that during a discussion on the matter preceding his inspection on the 29th ultimo our architect was requested by Indian Affairs officers to establish if possible the cause of the fire.\n\nIt is understood that the responsibility of determining the cause of fires rests with the officer in charge of the Agency; but in discussing the matter with the Indian Agent, I may say that our architect obtained information as follows:\n\nThe fire was discovered to be raging in the central hall on the first floor, shortly after midnight December 16th, 1941. At the time of discovery it had made such headway that it was only with great difficulty that the caretaker Mr. Robert who lived in the building, was able to escape.\n\nHe reached the village church in night attire and sounded the alarm before he was overcome by the effects of smoke.\n\nThe caretaker was unable to give a coherent account of his discovery of the fire; but Mr. Brisebois, the agent, stated that by the time he arrived at the school the fire had reached such proportions that it was obvious that nothing more than preventing the spread of the conflagration was possible.\n\nIn his opinion the strong wind was threatening to carry burning embers over the whole village area, and several small blazes were observed in the vicinity.\n\nMr. Brisebois summoned fire-fighting apparatus from Montreal and Lachine, and both brigades responded.\n\nThe services of two pumpers and crews were required until approximately 5 a.m. December 19th, when the fire was considered definitely under control.\n\nThe fire had made such headway before discovery, and wrought such complete destruction upon the building, that it is not considered possible to establish the cause.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nChief Engineer.\nDear Sir;-\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant dealing with the oil left in the tank at the Senior School.\n\nIn reply I wish to inform that this oil was removed from the Senior School site to the Teacher's residence.\n\nIn order to transfer that oil it has been necessary to employ a truck from an oil dealer which had the required equipment for the pumping of the oil.\n\nYours very truly\n\nR.A.Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt., of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent\n| TAUX NO. | DEMANDE | LECTURE ACTUELLE PRECEDENTE | LECTURE PRECEDENTE PRECEDENTE | CONSUMPTION | MONTANT BRUT GROSS BILL | MONTANT NET NET BILL |\n|----------|---------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------|------------------------|----------------------|\n| 192      | 1.8     | 2058                        | 2188                          | 70          | 4.79                   | 431                  |\n\nTAXE DE VENTE FEDERALE\nFEDERAL SALES TAX\n\n8%\n\nTAXE DE VENTE PROVINCIALE\nPROVINCIAL SALES TAX\n\n2%\n\nTOTAL\n\nVEUILLEZ TRANSMETTRE A LA COMPAGNIE A MONTR\u00c9AL TOUTE PLAINTE CONCERNANT LE SERVICE.\nPLEASE ADDRESS COMPLAINTS TO THE COMPANY AT MONTREAL.\n\nDESCRIPTION DES TAXES AU VERSO.

Further request will be made in due course for an advance to pay for said work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt.

I note what you say regarding circular letter of October 1, but on subsequent investigation it was found that if the employees are Indians it is not necessary to consider them for unemployment insurance, provided they are not already in receipt of an insurance book and express a desire to be insured pursuant to the provisions of the said Act. In the latter event the permission of the Department is necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F.

School\n\nOn the night of the destruction by fire of the senior school there was a very heavy wind blowing and, as the buildings in the village are quite close together, Indian Agent Brisebois was afraid that the whole village might be burned. Consequently he phoned the fire departments at Lachine, Quebec, and at Montreal, Quebec, requesting them to forward fire-fighting equipment. Both of them responded. In reporting his action in the above regard the Indian Agent wrote as follows:\n\n\"I was awakened by a neighbour and immediately went to the office and called for the Lachine and Montreal firemen. The Lachine brigade came at about 12:30 and the Montreal firemen about 20 minutes later. It was, however, too late to save the school as the fire had spread to the three floors and was activated by a strong west wind. At about three o'clock the whole building collapsed.\n\n\"The fire was blowing directly on the Kateri School and a wooden house located back of it. In fact the firemen had to concentrate their efforts at the other building and often had to turn the water on the Kateri School which was saved owing to their presence. Other fires also started but were promptly put out. The village was threatened up to the time of the collapse of the school. The firemen worked with two powerful pumps from the time of their arrival up to nine o'clock in the morning.\"\nRecently the following accounts have been submitted for payment for the firemen's services:\n\nCity of Montreal - $1,043.33\nCity of Lachine - $500.00\n\nInspector Thibault was instructed to call at the Montreal City Hall with a view to having their charge reduced. He was unsuccessful in this regard, his report reading as follows:\n\n\"While in Montreal last week, I called at the City Hall regarding a charge of $1,043.33 made by the City for services rendered on December 19, 1941, when our school was destroyed by fire.\n\n\"The rate of $100.00 per hour is set for all similar calls to municipalities outside of city limits, with a minimum of $150.00.\n\n\"Such rate is including the extra insurance on firemen on duty outside of the city limits, the risk of damage to equipment travelling for service to non-taxpayers, such equipment valued at over $30,000.00.\n\n\"According to information received, the presence of the Montreal fire brigade certainly prevented a more serious conflagration, due to the high wind during that night, and saved many Indian homes as well as our other school nearby, which was, for a while, in a rather dangerous spot.\"\n\nWe are endeavouring to have the Caughnawaga Indian Council pass a resolution approving payment of at least half of the account from their band funds. The other half can be met from the appropriation for Indian education. If the band refuses to pass the resolution, it will be necessary to take the whole amount from the\nIndian education appropriation. I should appreciate receiving the approval of the Minister.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\nIndian education appropriation. I should appreciate receiving the approval of the Minister.\n\nDirector.\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to the accounts submitted by the City of Montreal and the City of Lachine amounting to $1,543.33 for fire protection at Caughnawaga on the night of December 19, 1941.\n\nWhile the work done by the firemen no doubt prevented the destruction of the Kateri School, at the same time there is no question that their efforts also prevented the spread of the fire throughout the Village of Caughnawaga. As a result the Department feels that part of the expense should be paid from band funds. It is suggested that the band should meet half the expenditure and the balance will be paid from Parliamentary appropriation.\n\nIf, however, they are not willing to meet half the cost at least a large portion of this should be provided from band funds.\n\nPlease take up this matter at the next meeting of the Council and secure the required resolution.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F. Brisebois,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 18, 1942.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nIndian Agent Brisebois has forwarded to us your account No. 4142 of December 30, 1941, amounting to $1,043.33 covering services rendered by members of the Montreal Fire Department on the Caughnawaga Reserve on December 19, 1941.\n\nThere is no special provision made in our current year's appropriation for this expenditure and certain adjustments are, therefore, necessary which will prevent our considering payment of the account for some weeks.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

School\n\nOn the night of the destruction by fire of the senior school there was a very heavy wind blowing and, as the buildings in the village are quite close together, Indian Agent Brisebois was afraid that the whole village might be burned. Consequently he phoned the fire departments at Lachine, Quebec, and at Montreal, Quebec, requesting them to forward fire-fighting equipment. Both of them responded. In reporting his action in the above regard the Indian Agent wrote as follows:\n\n\"I was awakened by a neighbour and immediately went to the office and called for the Lachine and Montreal firemen. The Lachine brigade came at about 12:30 and the Montreal firemen about 20 minutes later. It was, however, too late to save the school as the fire had spread to the three floors and was activated by a strong west wind. At about three o'clock the whole building collapsed.\n\n\"The fire was blowing directly on the Kateri School and a wooden house located back of it. In fact the firemen had to concentrate their efforts at the other building and often had to turn the water on the Kateri School which was saved owing to their presence. Other fires also started but were promptly put out. The village was threatened up to the time of the collapse of the school. The firemen worked with two powerful pumps from the time of their arrival up to nine o'clock in the morning.\"\nRecently the following accounts have been submitted for payment for the firemen's services:\n\nCity of Montreal = $1,043.33\nCity of Lachine = 500.00\n\nInspector Thibault was instructed to call at the Montreal City Hall with a view to having their charge reduced. He was unsuccessful in this regard, his report reading as follows:\n\n\"While in Montreal last week, I called at the City Hall regarding a charge of $1,043.33 made by the City for services rendered on December 19, 1941, when our school was destroyed by fire.\n\n\"The rate of $100.00 per hour is set for all similar calls to municipalities outside of city limits, with a minimum of $150.00.\n\n\"Such rate is including the extra insurance on firemen on duty outside of the city limits, the risk of damage to equipment travelling for service to non-taxpayers, such equipment valued at over $30,000.00.\n\n\"According to information received, the presence of the Montreal fire brigade certainly prevented a more serious conflagration, due to the high wind during that night, and saved many Indian homes as well as our other school nearby, which was, for a while, in a rather dangerous spot.\"\n\nWe are endeavouring to have the Caughnawaga Indian Council pass a resolution approving payment of at least half of the account from their band funds. The other half can be met from the appropriation for Indian education. If the band refuses to pass the resolution, it will be necessary to take the whole amount from the\nIndian education appropriation. I should appreciate receiving the approval of the Minister.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\n\nIndian Affairs.

This sum would cover the balance of the wages owing to those employed.\n\nI also wish to submit you the case of Mr. E.E. Wescott, instructor of the Manual Training Class. Upon your instructions Mr. Wescott was asked to supervise the work of dividing the classes. As there were no rate of pay or remuneration price set for this work, Mr. Wescott suggested the following way of remuneration, viz: 32 days work at $5. per day, $160. less amount of cheque received for 12 days as manual training instructor for January, $59.60; balance owing $100.40.\n\nWill you kindly let me know if payment will be made to Mr. Wescott in the above suggested manner? If so, should an account be submitted or if an advance for the amount of $100.40 will be sent at the same time as for the other men employed?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nH.A.

Their action is much regretted and is clearly showing their non-cooperative attitude.\n\nIn the course of the discussion the councillors claimed that the building destroyed was the property of the Government and as no Indian property was affected by the fire they could not see why they should be called upon to contribute towards the paying of the accounts.\n\nWhen it was pointed out that had it not been for the presence of the firemen a conflagration would have taken place and a portion of the Village destroyed, no reply could be obtained. They only reiterated their intention not to pay any amount.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.A.Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt., of Welfare and Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent\nDear Sir:\n\nI was very much concerned when I learned recently that apparently the doors of the schools at Caughnawaga are kept locked during school hours. It has been stated that the doors are locked at nine o'clock and that any pupils who come late have to return home. I do not approve of this latter action but, in any case, the doors should be kept unlocked whenever the classrooms are occupied. Locking the doors of the classrooms during school hours is a very definite fire hazard and cannot be permitted under any circumstances.\n\nI also understand that fire drills have not been practised at regular intervals. One excuse given was that the fire escapes were dangerous on account of ice accumulating in some spots. In view of the destruction of the senior school, the caretakers certainly cannot be overworked and there is no reason why the fire escapes should not be kept clear of snow and ice. Please see that this is done in future and at the same time arrange to have fire drills conducted regularly.\n\nBoth the above matters should be brought to the attention of the Rev. Principal at once.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. F. Brisebois,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\n\nR.A.

The Sister claims that the children had been told repeatedly that should the front doors be locked that they should go through the side doors. However I am positive that the side doors were also locked.\n\nRelative to the fire drills I was also assured that practice will be held once a week.\n\nRelative to the janitor service may I suggest that as Mr. Robert will reach 65 this year that only one be employed after his retirement, as it is considered that one man can easily do the work at both the Eastern and Kateri Schools also at the Sister's residence, which as you know is heated with an automatic oil burner.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.A.

Doors locked and no one drilled. May I explain this real situation and the reasons thereof not to become justified by my way of acting but simply to make things clear to you.\n\nYou do so understand matters known. The Indian School in the village, the front door is never locked during school hours. As to the Boys' Eastern school, yes, we have kept the doors locked after 9 and often 10 o'clock for this reason. There are certain troubles liable, including a neighbor who has come into the school in an unfit condition and the teachers had difficulty in getting them out. Moreover, the...\nteachers and pupils were afraid of these very intruders... so I said the teachers locked the pupils shut the doors would be locked for that reason but that if they came in late all that was to be done was to eat at the side doors and a bell always rings the door. The well thinking people here have understood this bell those boys who are not anxious to be out make no effort whatever to be on time nor to find means of getting in even after school hours. Some parents have spoken to me of this matter and have understood very well... even helping us by seeing their boys get to school on time. So to the well thinking people those boys come in late regardless of school hours.\n\nNevertheless we shall keep all doors unlocked since you liked this done. The above mentioned measure has been taken to keep order in school as well as somewhat forcing the boys to get to school on time. At this Reserve school started at 12 o'clock some would come in at 12:30... the mentality same is there... I trust Mr. Roy that this fact is well understood - I cannot well see a wanted order and discipline will kept in our schools but with the doors unlocked at the Boys' School we will face the same difficulties even the fact. We will nevertheless\nable by your orders.\n\nAs to fire drills we did not have any during the winter months. I did not insist on having the fire escapes closed or extinguishing the fire every day, for I must very sincerely tell you that it would have been useless to try... Since the ice has disappeared, we have had such drills and intend doing so in the future.\n\nHoping that you will understand my rule of action here and that it is the advancement of our school interests both for the instruction and for the education of our Indian boys and girls.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nRev. Mary Jean de Fave,\nPrincipal\n| Description | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|-------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| 32/13 13/12 2x4 = 382' Ept | 48 | 1834 |\n| 32/12 29/13 7/12 2x3 = 435\" | 48 | 2088 |\n| 36 pieces 4x10 = 1440' Clouacore | 46 | 6624 |\n| 1325' Slopfen | 1/4\" | 1656 |\n| 1000' 1/4 Round | 1/4\" | 1250 |\n| 1000' Gauge | 1/4\" | 1250 |\n| 17/16\" 2x7 = 318' Medium a 1/2\" | 50 | 1590 |\n| 56/16\" 1x5 = 374' Ept PE | 48 | 1795 |\n| 29/12\" 1x5 = 110' Pox fl | 100 | 1100 |\n| 5' Parker 2-6x6-8 | 4\" | 2000 |\n| 172' Codroge Die | 1/4\" | 860 |\n| 26 lbs / case | 200 | 22247 |\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is understood that at the time of the fire this tank contained considerable fuel oil. While neither the tank nor its connections to the system could be inspected, to establish whether or not the contents had been ignited during the fire, it is considered that these should not be re-installed in a new building.\n\nIt is therefore recommended that the Indian Affairs Branch take the necessary action to dispose of all metals and other materials to the best advantage.\n\nIt was observed during the inspection, that the isolated chimney had been demolished, as previously recommended by this Service; but it is further recommended that, upon completion of salvage operations, the Indian Affairs Branch arrange for the covering or filling of the basement cavity, to eliminate hazard to the children of the village.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ.

When he has obtained a number of tenders from local dealers for the purchase of same these should be forwarded to this office. The tenders will then be submitted to the Salvage Officer for his decision and the issuance of the usual Salvage Minute authorizing the sale of the scrap to the highest bidder.\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nOttawa,\nMay 2, 1942.\n\nEX'D\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department has received a report from Mr. Buck, of the Surveys & Engineering Branch, regarding a quantity of steel and old iron available for disposal on the site of the former senior school.\n\nPlease prepare a form of tender, listing the approximate quantity of scrap metal involved. You should then obtain offers for this metal from junk dealers. When you have obtained their tenders, please forward same to this office.

You will agree that unless a junk dealer is called to make the estimated list of the material it is rather difficult to prepare a list which would be accurate. May I suggest that tenders be invited for the scrap metal, from let us say four or more dealers, and when their prices are received to forward them to the Department. The metal to be sold comprises the beams, heating system, fire escapes, pipes etc.,\n\nRelative to the brick, it would be appreciated if you could let me know if it is your intention to sell it separately, by tenders, or if you wish to have same included on the tenders to be called for the scrapp metal?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to the disposal of scrap iron and steel on the site of the former Senior School.\n\nThe Department approves of your suggestion to invite tenders for the scrap metal from four or more dealers.

I am frank with you in stating this. I found the opportunity so favorable that I did not hesitate to expect a favorable approval from you.\n\nMay I ask you now, to appropriate half this expense, that is $24.00 towards this linoleum and I will carry over the balance myself, thus atoning for my forward act.\n\nWith sincere hope that you will consider my present request, I am\n\nMost sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. R.

I wish you would make some enquiries in Montreal and ascertain if you can secure the necessary grates there. If so, you should state the name of the firm from whom they can be obtained and the approximate cost.\n\nI would like to know, also, what size of coal will be required. I presume it will be stove size but would like definite assurance in this regard and also the number of tons that you consider would be needed.\n\nThere is still a possibility of our securing oil, but, if we cannot do so, we will of course have to use coal. For this reason I am requesting the information mentioned in the first part of this letter and would appreciate receiving it as soon as possible. I expect a definite decision regarding the oil by the end of this week, and, in the event of our not securing the oil, I want to have the necessary information to secure the coal as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. F.

She would be willing to dispose of it for the very reasonable sum of $40.00. The piano is in fine condition.\n\nWe are writing this letter to ask you if you would authorize the purchase of this piano for Eastern School, to be used for Physical Culture Exercises. We would certainly appreciate having one. We had taken up the matter of buying a second-hand piano with Mr. Doucet shortly after the Senior School Fire and he had promised to do something as a very good piano had been offered him a few days before. We heard no more about it but now feel this opportunity too good, so let it pass. Since the piano is already on the Reserve, the matter of transportation can be very easily arranged.\n\nMay we expect a favorable answer before long?

Brisebois, Indian Agent, Caughnawaga, Que.\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return your voucher No. 506 covering electricity supplied for the lighting of the Caughnawaga Village Schools.\n\nBefore payment of the account can be made very explicit explanations will have to be given regarding the \"Adjusting\" bills included in the account. Several of the accounts do not show the past and present readings. These will have to be supplied except, of course, in the case of those where there is a minimum charge.\n\nI also find that the October account for the Eastern School was not forwarded when you sent the other accounts for that month under cover of your voucher No. 446.\n\nThe Company must realize that we wish these accounts submitted every month and as they read the meters we cannot understand why adjustment bills have to be forwarded later.\n\nWe do not want this matter to assume the proportions that it did in 1935 when we were obliged to check accounts back for several months due to the fact that the Company's meter readers had read meters incorrectly. I trust that you will find it possible to have this account adjusted at an early date and complete information, as requested above, forwarded.\n\nR.A.

An electrician was called to inspect the wiring as a short circuit was suspected. The short circuit was found, and the matter was taken up by this office with the Shawinigan Water & Power Co., at Valleyfield, in order to obtain an adjustment. The result was that the Company agreed to adjust the bills for October and November at the amount of $4.96, per month, therefore, my submitting said accounts.\n\nI am also sending you copies of the accounts for October and November, from which it was deducted that the wiring system was short circuit.

May I suggest that all the requisitions be sent through the agent as this would save considerable time. We require the recommendation of the agent before we can authorize this purchase.

Senior School.\n\nAs you are aware, the senior school at Caughnawaga was destroyed by fire in December, 1941, and, as a result, the special cooking and sewing room was not available. Early this spring the Indian Agent and the Principal of the Caughnawaga School urged on the Department the necessity of providing suitable rooms in order that cooking and sewing could be taught. The only room available was one in the basement of one of the remaining schools on the reserve and authority was given to install the necessary equipment. It was not convenient to estimate exactly what was required before the work was done and, therefore, the Indian Agent was instructed to employ a competent firm to do the necessary work. Mr. Brisebois certifies that only the necessary equipment was placed in the rooms and I, therefore, feel that the items shown on the account were required in order to provide suitable equipment.\n\nDirector.\nExtract from letter dated August 8, 1943, received from Sister Mary George.\n\nThe paint job on the front verandah has transformed the residence. We are so grateful for this. The ice-box has been repaired several times since your last visit without much result.\nOttawa,\nJuly 29, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nI attach account amounting to $296.75, covering material and wages for installing electricity etc. in the new vocational training room for the girls at the Caughnawaga R.C. School. While the total amount of the account is $296.75, the cost of the material is $196.60. It would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order for this amount so that the account may be paid.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nLa pr\u00e9sente atteste que l'installation \u00e9lectrique d\u00e9crite ci-apr\u00e8s, ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e par :\nThis is to certify that the electrical installation described hereinafter, done by :\n\nM.

Principal of the Caughnawaga Indian Day Schools, to be supplied with 20 double benches, and 6 single benches, for the smaller children's class and that of the higher grade.\n\nThe Principal claims that she would need the 20 double benches for the baby class as the number registered this year is so considerable that seating accommodation would be needed for 40 pupils.

School during the past year, it appears that the majority of the purchases have been made either by the Reverend Sister Superior or yourself. As a result, in many cases the total of the accounts submitted is over $50.00 and we have to submit same to the Purchasing Branch for a purchase order before payment can be secured. Such practice is not in conformity with existing purchasing regulations, as it is the function of the Purchasing Branch to review proposed purchases before, not after, they have been made. Consequently in future all purchases, except very minor supplies, will have to be made through the Purchasing Branch. The Reverend Sister in charge of the Caughnawaga R.C.

HOEK\n\nWhen in Montreal last week at the time of my visit to the Caughnawaga Reserve I also interviewed the Mother General of the Sisters of Ste. Ann, Sister Leopoldine, at the Mother House at Lachine. As you suggested, I discussed with her the possibility of having the Sisters of Ste. Ann erect a new residence for the Nuns teaching the Caughnawaga R.C. School instead of having this building provided by this Department.\n\nAs we agreed, I advised her that the Department would be prepared to consider increasing the salaries of the Sisters teaching at Caughnawaga by an amount of $3000.00 a year, if the Order of Ste. Ann would erect the residence at their own expense.\n\nSister Leopoldine was unable to give me a definite reply, but she appeared to be very much interested in the proposal, as she realizes, as we do, the great necessity for providing proper living accommodation for these Sisters. You know the condition of the building at present in use and something will have to be done in the near future in order to provide suitable living accommodation.\n\nI gathered from Sister Leopoldine's conversation that she was prepared to recommend this action to her Board. She asked if we would be prepared to provide, free of charge, a site for such a building on the reserve. In this regard I advised her that I thought the Department would be favourably disposed to\nallow the residence to be built on part of the property of the former senior school. There is plenty of land available for this purpose and, if the residence were built on this site, water and sewage facilities would be available.\n\nSister Leopoldine said she would discuss the matter with her Board and advise us at some future date regarding their decision.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOEY\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of October 9, regarding the type of school building that should replace the Caughnawaga Senior School, I submit the following report:\n\nI visited the Caughnawaga Reserve on October 29 and 30 and discussed school matters generally with Indian Agent Brisebois, Mr. A.E. Wescott, Inspector of Schools, and Sister Mary George. The following is the information specifically requested in your memorandum:\n\n1. As you are aware, the Catholic school at Caughnawaga used three buildings known as the \"Eastern\", \"Kateri\" and \"Senior\" Schools. The latter was destroyed by fire on December 18, 1941. With regard to the Eastern and Kateri Schools, each contains four classrooms and has a full basement. Each classroom can accommodate from 30 to 45 pupils. However, following the fire it was necessary to provide extra classrooms and a temporary partition was erected in each of the two classrooms on the ground floor of each building and consequently there are at the present time twelve classrooms in use. The woodworking class for the boys is in the basement of the Eastern School and the kitchen and sewing room for the girls are in the basement of the Kateri School. On October 29 there was a total enrolment of 322 pupils \u2014 175 boys and 147 girls. For various reasons approximately 28 pupils had not yet registered. They were expected to attend school by the 15th of November which would mean a total of 350 for the current academic year.\n\n2. There is no doubt that the best site for the new school is on the former site of the Senior School. We have plenty of land available and, besides, there is a deep well available for water and there are sewage facilities from the former site to the St. Lawrence River.\n\n3. From information obtained from the Parish Priest, I learned that there are 112 boys and 145 girls who are 5 or 6 years of age and consequently will be of school age within a year or two. It would, therefore, appear that the school attendance for some time to come will remain at approximately the present figure of 350. After discussing the matter with the persons mentioned in the first part of this memorandum, I am of the opinion that the best provision to be made is as follows:\n(a) Discard the Eastern School and construct a new school, with 10 classrooms and a basement, on the site of the former Senior School. In the basement of this building provision could be made for a kitchen and rooms for sewing and weaving. It would also provide sufficient accommodation for an assembly hall. This room need not be as elaborate as the assembly hall in the former Senior School, but Inspector Wescott and the Principal feel that for a school with an attendance of 350 some type of assembly hall is absolutely essential.\n\n(b) Use the present Kateri School for vocational training for the boys. As previously stated, this is a four-roomed building in good condition and is situated within two or three minutes' walk of the site of the new school.\n\n(c) If the suggestion made in \"b\" is adopted, provision should be made for teaching both wood-work and metal-work. This would require two male teachers. It may be interesting to you to have the following information regarding the boys who have graduated from the Caughnawaga R.C. School during the past six years:\n\n| No. of Boys Graduated | Iron Workers | Armed Forces | Other Occupations | Dead |\n|-----------------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|------|\n| 1937                  | 7            | 4            | 2                | 1    |\n| 1938                  | 10           | 4            | 3                | 2    |\n| 1939                  | 7            | 3            | 4                |      |\n| 1940                  | -            | -            | -                |      |\n| 1941                  | 5            | 4            | 1                |      |\n| 1942                  | 5            | 3            | -                | 2    |\n\nThe term \"Iron Workers\" in the above means those employed either with the Dominion Steel Company or the Dominion Bridge Company.\n\nIn discussing the educational requirements Mr. Brisebois expressed the opinion that the older boys should be under male teachers. I discussed this suggestion with Inspector Wescott, who stated that, while he agreed with the suggestion in principle, it would be impossible to carry it out in practice. If we engage Brothers for the older boys it will involve another residence and a great deal of extra arrangements. Mr. Wescott felt that the employment of two vocational training instructors at Caughnawaga, as suggested, would meet the situation adequately, as these two teachers would co-operate with the Sisters and would be able to discipline the older boys if necessary.\nReferring back to paragraph \"a\", you will note I suggest discarding the Eastern School. This is a good building but is situated at a considerable distance from either the Kateri or the proposed new school. Both Inspector Wescott and Sister Mary George felt that it would be in the best interests of all parties concerned to concentrate our educational efforts closer together.\n\nThis would leave the Eastern School vacant. It is a good building, two stories high, with basement, and heated by a furnace. I feel that it would make a good office both for the Agent and the R.C.M. Police, or whatever other officials require to use it.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, November 8, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER,\n\nI am sending forward herewith copies of memoranda submitted by Mr. Phelan, immediately following his visit to the Caughnawaga reserve on October 29 and 30.\n\nIt would be appreciated if we could have an opportunity of discussing the subject matter of these memoranda and the recommendations contained therein with you, at your convenience.\n\nDirector.\n\nEncl.\n\nRAH\nThird Quarter,\nSeptember 30, 1943.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOTTAWA\n\nTO Sister Mary George, Principal,\nCaughnawaga, Quebec.\n\n| Telephone for the months July-Aug-Sept. | 16 49 |\n|----------------------------------------|-------|\n| July 31 A.

As previously agreed upon, we intend to use the M.P. only when every other means has failed.\n\nWe've been playing detective of late. Last Thursday night, someone broke into Kateri School again. We've followed a clue and this morning the police interviewed every boy concerned and we have the culprits\u2014some of our own boys who have been playing truant since September. The M.P. are making their report and they suggested that we write you so that you might use a little pressure on the Attorney General's office so that a good lesson could be given these boys and serve as an example to the others. We do not mean to have them sent to reform school, but placed on a sort of a parole. They did not steal anything but broke flower pots and plants, disturbed things and did dirty things which we do not care to mention here. One good lesson at this time, will mean so much.\n\nThe desks have finally reached us and what a blessing they are. Thanks for these also.\n\nMr. Bush has kept very busy repairing radiators and doing all the repairs on the plumbing in our bathroom. He asks if he may be provided with a plumber's torch so that he may completely finish his work.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSISTERS OF SAINT ANN\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nNovember 17, 1943.\n\nMr. F.

(RG 10, Volume 6081, file 305-5, part 13)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nI beg to report that the back section of the steam furnace of the Kateri School at Caughnawaga gave out last Saturday, November 27, when it became impossible to heat the school. Mr. Garwood, plumber, of Chateauguay was called in and after having inspected the furnace stated that a new section was needed and that the repairs had to be made by the Gurney Foundry's men, the makers of same.\n\nOn Monday last, I called at the Gurney Foundry at the Town of St-Laurent where I was informed that they were no longer making any parts for the furnace that we have, a Gurney No.6, as it was too old and that their patterns were not usable. They stated that owing to the age of the furnace it was likely that another one will have to be installed as it has been in use for at least twenty five years.\n\nOn my return from St-Laurent, one Mr. Wilfrid Rice, who is in charge of the machinery at the local Golf Club and a very competent man in heating and pumping systems suggested that sealing compound be used to repair the furnace in order that it be used temporarily or pending such time as a new one is installed. This has been done and the school which had been closed for two days, on Monday and Tuesday of this week, has now reopened. However Mr. Rice has informed me that although the compound has stopped the leakages for the time being that the furnace itself is finished.\n\nIt would be advisable that an order be given to have a new furnace installed as soon as possible as if the sections do not hold, the school will have to be closed.\n\n(Pre. Brisebois)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nDecember 3, 1943.\n\nMr. F. Brisebois, Indian Agent, Caughnawaga, Que.\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to the steam furnace in the Kateri School. I note that you will be unable to secure parts to permanently repair this furnace, but that you have succeeded in having temporary repairs made.\n\nAs you are aware, it is both difficult and costly to secure a new furnace at the present time and, if there is any possibility of keeping the present furnace going for the current winter, the Department feels that such action is most desirable.\n\nHowever, if, after giving the matter further consideration, you feel that a new furnace must be secured in the near future, you should consult the Curney people, or any other firm from whom definite information can be secured, in order to ascertain what type of furnace we should order to ensure our obtaining the same service as from the present furnace and with the least possible change in piping. You understand, of course, that in supplying this information every possible detail should be given in order to assist our Purchasing Branch.\n\nR.A.

Other repairs were also needed to radiators and piping and have been made.\n\nCommunication was sent to the Gurney people in order to secure information relative to a new furnace as it is rather difficult to be certain as to whether the present one will last until Spring. At all events it takes from two to four months to get a new furnace, as the Gurney Co., is four months behind in their orders and it might be preferable to have an order put in early in the new year so that the furnace be delivered on time to have it installed during the next summer holidays.

There is a size, in both Hot Water and Steam, to meet all practical requirements.\n\nGurney Square Sectional Boilers have always held a favored place with Canadian Heating Engineers and we feel certain that the Gurney Boilers will continue to hold this popularity. We know that they are efficient and are designed to meet the severe Canadian Heating conditions.\n\nAccurate machining of nipple ports in the sections of all Gurney Square Boilers assure tight joints and ease of erection. Ninety-eight years of foundry experience assure the proper mixture of the correct grades of iron to produce castings of the greatest durability.\n\nAccurate, and conservative, ratings allow you to be certain that any Gurney Boiler will give satisfactory heating on the load it is designed to carry.\nIntroducing\n\nTHE NEW 25 SERIES BOILER\n\nThe Gurney Foundry Company, Limited, takes a great deal of satisfaction in announcing the introduction of the 25-SERIES BOILER to the present line of Gurney Boilers.\n\nNEAT APPEARANCE\n\nThe attractiveness of the New 25-Series Boiler enables you to convert your cellar into a really useful place, such as a Recreation room, Play room, or any use according to your desire.\n\nFINNED FOR EFFICIENCY\n\nIn the 25-Series Boiler, we introduce the latest feature in Cast Iron Boiler design, namely Finned Sections. These fins increase the efficiency of the boiler considerably as they add extra heating surface to the boiler. This means greater economy in fuels, particularly with Oil, Gas, Blower and Stoker Firing.\n\nFUEL ECONOMY\n\nThe heating efficiency and economy of this new boiler is the direct result of nearly one hundred years of research and manufacture. To understand this statement, examine the interior of this new boiler. See the double-gallery FINNED FLUE giving a flue travel twice the boiler's length. Note the extensive array of water-filled vertical tubes in the path of the hot gases in both upper and lower flues which soak up all possible heat into the water and promote active circulation. Because these narrow, highly effective tubes form a greater heat absorbing area than the usual heating boiler can offer, the fuel burned by your heating system yields a definitely higher percentage of heat.\nWATER TUBE DESIGN\n\nThe Gurney New Bright Idea is a water tube boiler built entirely of cast iron. The water tube design presents a large heating surface in proportion to the amount of water contained in the tubes. Quick response and economy of operation are features of a water tube boiler.\n\nTHREE CROWN HEATING SURFACES\n\nA distinctive feature is the double gallery flue design which provides three separate and distinct crown heating surfaces...the most effective heating surface in any boiler. The fire travels to the back of the firebox, then to the front of the boiler through the first flue level and then back to the rear of the boiler through the upper gallery. The fire travel is the same in all sizes.\n\nLARGE CLEANOUT DOORS\n\nLarge cleanout doors at the front of the boiler make it simple to clean all the flues. In addition there is a cleanout door at the back of the base through which the secondary combustion chamber may be cleaned.\n\nALL FUEL GRATES\n\nThe grates are so designed that even the small sizes of coal may be used. They are easy to operate for either shaking or dumping. The entire grate assembly on the 30 and 40 series boiler may be removed from the front of the boiler by first removing the front base panel.\n\nEXCELLENT FOR OIL BURNING\n\nDue to the all cast iron construction and the long fire travel, our 25, 30 and 40 series are excellent boilers for use with any oil burning equipment. They will give complete satisfaction with any type of fuel.\n\nEASY TO ERECT\n\nEase of erection is an important feature of Gurney Boilers. This is due to the accurate machining of the sections and a simplified method of pulling them up. When installed, the clean, pleasing lines and the generous proportions give the boilers a smart, workmanlike appearance.\n30 and 40 SERIES\nNEW BRIGHT IDEA BOILERS\nFOR STEAM AND WATER\n\nGurney New Bright Idea Boilers possess the well known advantages of cast iron construction plus rapid heating and the greatest fuel economy. The smaller sizes can be converted into larger boilers by the addition of extra sections and base parts\u2014this is interesting where future additions to the building are contemplated.\n\nSectional View of Gurney New Bright Idea Boiler.\n\nThe slim water tubes, presenting a large heating surface in proportion to the amount of water they contain are clearly shown in this illustration. Note also the double gallery flue design which provides three distinct crown heating surfaces \u2014 the most effective heating surface in any boiler.\n\nIllustrating Regular Intermediate Section for 40 Series Boiler.\nNote in this Illustration the Slender Horizontal Water Heating surfaces and the Generous Vertical Tubes for Quick Water Circulation.\n\nBridge-Wall Section for 30 Series.\nThis type of section is used to form the rear of the fire-box in the larger sizes of this Boiler.\n\nIntermediate Section for 30 Series.\nNote the slender horizontal heating surfaces and the generous vertical tubes for quick water circulation.\n25 SERIES NEW BRIGHT IDEA BOILERS\n\nDraft damper as shown on back of boiler is interchangeable with opening cover on either side of base.\n\nRATINGS AND DATA\n\n| Boiler Number | Net Rating Ft.

The characteristics have been determined after extensive research and many tests. The illustrations show the construction. The noteworthy features are:\n\nThe ample firebox and large combustion chamber assure exceptional combustion by thoroughly mixing the fuel bed gases with secondary air. This is accomplished with a minimum of excess air and results in remarkably high fuel efficiency.\n\nThe flow of gases after leaving the combustion chamber is of constant velocity through the boiler due to an improved arrangement of the tubes. This new tube distribution also insures an approximately equal volume of gas passing through each tube. Combined with the above, the long two-way fire travel guarantees maximum abstraction of heat.\n\nThe contour and size of the firebox permit long firing periods without sacrificing combustion efficiency. On special order, we will supply additional firebox depth for the maintenance of longer firing periods with low grade fuel.\n\nThe four water walls form a continuous column around the combustion chamber and firebox, with free circulation to the drum. This secures the benefit of complete absorption of radiant heat and prevents any restriction of water circulation. Due to the low water line and the resultant large steam releasing surface, remarkably dry steam is produced.\n\nThis boiler is manufactured of heavy plate and is welded by the latest improved equipment. All corners are fully rounded, eliminating troublesome right angle corner welds. The drum being a separate entity and entirely self supporting, the crown sheet does not require any stay bolts.\n\nHot water boilers are for safe operation at sixty pounds water pressure and can be supplied on special order for water pressure up to one hundred pounds. Steam boilers are designed for thirty pounds pressure and are approved for fifteen pounds operating pressure.\n\nStandard shaking and dumping grates or stationary fine coal grates can be supplied. When ordered for oil burning, no grates are furnished.\n\nExtended water legs for all Gurney Steel Stoker Fired Boilers comply with rulings recommended by stoker manufacturers.\n\nGross Ratings are in accordance with the \"Code for the Rating of Low Pressure Heating Boilers\" as adopted by the Steel Heating Boiler Institute.\n\nTHE GURNEY FOUNDRY CO. LIMITED\nToronto and Montreal\nWinnipeg Vancouver\nSTEEL HEATING BOILERS\n\nTHE GURNEY \"POWER TYPE\" STEEL HEATING BOILER\n\nGurney Steel Boiler construction plus the excellence of design has produced a boiler which is exceptionally rugged and which supplies a decided advance in efficiency, fuel saving, ease of installation and operation.\nGURNEY STEEL BOILERS\n\nDRUM OR POWER TYPE DESIGN\u2014assuring equal stress distribution and free internal water circulation.\n\nBALANCED TUBE ARRANGEMENT\u2014assuring correct distribution of first and second pass gas passage areas.\n\nINSIDE AND OUTSIDE SHEETS OF WATER LEGS have rounded corners, assuring greater resistance to strains.\n\nSHORT CURVED BACK ARCH is formed from inside water leg sheet.\n\nLARGE STEAM DISENGAGING AREA.\n\nECONOMICAL.\n\nLARGE VOLUME OF WATER ABOVE TUBES.\n\nSAFETY.\n\nLOW WATER LINE.\n\nNOTES\n\nSTEAM\n\nSteam Fittings supplied with all \"S\" Boilers, include water column and water glass set complete with drain cock, steam gauge with syphon and cock, try-cocks and safety valve and damper control.\n\nIf screwed couplings are used deduct 1 1/2 inch from \"V\" measurements.\n\nBoilers intended for coal firing, ordered with grates, are regularly supplied complete with tube cleaner with handle, poker, slice bar and hoe.\n\nBoilers intended for oil burning regularly supplied complete with tube cleaner with handle, less grates and ashpit door.\n\nBoilers ordered with grates will be supplied with shaking grates.

Brisebois,\nIndian Agent.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of December 16th requesting us to advise you as to the most suitable boiler to replace an old Gurney No. 946 Steam that is beyond repair. The most suitable boiler for this replacement would be our #40-5 Gurney square sectional steam heating boiler having a capacity of 2100 square feet of Equivalent Direct Radiation. This boiler has exactly the same capacity as the old No.946 and approximately the same physical dimensions. The price of this boiler complete is $754.00 list, f.o.b. Montreal, Federal Tax included, terms 2% 30 days, net 60 days. Delivery approximately six months after receipt of order.\n\nWe are unable at the present time to improve this delivery promise as we have quite a number of this type of boiler on order for the various Defence Forces which naturally carry a high priority. We can, however, supply you with a steel boiler of about the same capacity in approximately one month after receipt of order. This would be our No. 36-78.5S Gurney steel steam heating boiler having a net capacity of 215 square feet of Equivalent Direct Radiation. This boiler complete with base, grates, damper regulator, for hand firing, will cost $1016.00 list, f.o.b. Montreal, Federal Tax included, terms 2% 30 days net 60 days.\n\nWe are enclosing descriptive literature of both boilers.\n\nHoping this meets with your approval, we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE GURNEY MASSEY COMPANY, LIMITED.\n\nR.A.

C. School are accommodated in two buildings. One of these, known as the Kateri School, the present furnace has been in use for between 20 and 25 years. The back section of it cracked and temporary repairs were made. Recently, the front section of the furnace also cracked. A plumber who inspected it suggested that a new section was required, but when Indian Agent Brisebois visited the Gurney Foundry he was informed that they were no longer making any part for the furnace as old as the one we have at the present time. Mr. Doucet examined this furnace on Friday last and while it may be possible, by means of temporary repairs, to keep the furnace going for the balance of the current winter, there is a possibility that it may give out at any time. It would then be necessary to close the school, which accommodates approximately 140 children. Mr. Brisebois has obtained prices from the Gurney Foundry Company and I enclose their quotation for your information. Mr. Doucet recommends that the furnace requested in this requisition be supplied. His reasons for this are as follows:\u2014(a) This type of furnace is welded instead of cast iron and consequently he feels it is a better purchase; (b) as previously stated, our present old furnace may give out at any time. It is therefore more important to have a new furnace installed at the earliest possible date. You will note that the one requested will be available within approximately one month. Attached is Gurney Foundry Company quotation to Mr. Brisebois, dated Dec. 29, 1943, also copy of their catalogue.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for departmental purposes only.

The present furnace has been in use for between 20 and 25 years. Mr. Doucet visited this school last week and in his opinion the furnace should be replaced at the earliest possible date, as temporary repairs made to it from time to time are apt to prove insufficient. For your information I enclose a copy of a tender which we have received from the Gurney Foundry Company and Mr. Doucet favours the No. 36-72 AS Gurney Steel Steam Heating Boiler for two reasons: (a) This type of furnace is welded instead of cast iron and consequently he feels it is the better purchase; (b) As previously stated the present old furnace may give out at any time and it is, therefore, most important to have a new furnace installed as soon as possible.\n\nWe have submitted this request to the Purchasing Branch and they wish to obtain from your Branch advice as to whether or not the boiler specified is the most suitable size and type for the above school. To assist you in making a decision in this regard I enclose, for your information, a statement giving the measurements of this building.\n\nDirector.\n| D\u00c9BIT | CR\u00c9DIT |\n|-------|--------|\n| 9     |        |\n| 9553  |        |\n| 1     | 8.00   |\n| 1     | 5.00   |\n| 1     | 9.50   |\n| 10% ESC | 2.25   |\n| PAR M.

Brisbois,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMarch 13, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nOn January 17, 1944, a requisition was submitted to the Purchasing Agent for a Gurney steam heating boiler for the Caughnawaga R.C. Indian Day School. In a memorandum dated January 19 we were requested to obtain from the Surveys & Engineering Branch their advice as to whether or not the boiler specified in our requisition was the most suitable size and type.\n\nThe matter was submitted to the Surveys & Engineering Branch in our memorandum of January 20. As we received no reply we again wrote to them on February 5 and on February 17 we were advised as follows:\n\n\"In reply to your memoranda of January 20 and February 5, we are taking this matter up with several firms in Montreal and hope to be able to advise you further at an early date.\"\n\nSince that time we have heard nothing further from the Surveys & Engineering Branch. Mr. Doucet visited the Caughnawaga School on Friday, February 11, and on that day the temperature of the classrooms was 45. The present boiler is in such condition that it is impossible to heat the building to a higher temperature and, as a result, some of the\nchildren are allowed to go home and some stay at school, but are obliged to wear their coats. This is a condition that should not be allowed, as it not only interferes with the education of the pupils but also causes resentment on the part of both parents and children.\n\nIt would, therefore, be appreciated if you could arrange to have a new boiler ordered at the earliest possible date.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\n| TAXE NO. | DEMANDE DEMAND | LECTURE ACTUELLE PRESENT READING | LECTURE PR\u00c9CEDENTE PREVIOUS READING | CONSOMMATION CONSUMPTION | MONTANT BRUT GROSS BILL | MONTANT NET NET BILL |\n|---------|----------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|\n| 190     |                | 9906                            | 9268                              |                          |                        |                      |\n\nTAXE DE VENTE F\u00c9D\u00c9RALE 8%\nFEDERAL SALES TAX\n\nTAXE DE VENTE PROVINCIALE PROVINCIAL SALES TAX\n\n\"PRI\u00c8RE DE JOINDRE CETTE FACTURE \u00c0 VOTRE REMISE\"\nPLEASE BRING THIS ACCOUNT WHEN MAKING PAYMENT\n\nTOTAL\n\nVEUILLEZ TRANSMETTRE \u00c0 LA COMPAGNIE \u00c0 MONTR\u00c9AL TOUTE PLAINTE CONCERNANT LE SERVICE.\n\nPLEASE ADDRESS COMPLAINTS TO THE COMPANY AT MONTREAL.\n\nDESCRIPTION DES TAUX AU VERSO.

A. LeFrancois\nMarch 30th, 1944.\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Heating System, Kateri Indian Day School, Caughnawaga, Quebec.\n\nWith further reference to my memorandum of February 17th last, and to previous correspondence relative to the above, the following is quoted for your information from a memorandum from Mr. Mills dated March 28th, and a copy of the quotation referred to therein is attached:\n\n\"Following receipt of your memorandum of February 17th last in connection with the above, this office communicated with the heating firms whose names you supplied viz:-\n\nThe Gurney Massey Co. Ltd.\nP.O. Box 277, Montreal, Quebec.\nE. Lefrancois,\n5028 Chambord St., Montreal, Quebec.\nJos. A. Francoeur,\n5312 Papineau St., Montreal, Quebec.\n\n\"Each firm was requested to inspect the existing installation, and forward a report with tender for supplying and installing a new boiler, together with any repairs or changes that would be required to adequately heat the building.\n\n\"No replies to our original request were received and on the 16th instant each firm was\n\n(over)...........\n\"requested by wire to advise how soon the data could be expected here. In this connection the Gurney-Massey Co. replied that they were solely manufacturers of heating equipment, and were not in a position to furnish an estimate for the work. No reply to our wire was received from the other parties.\n\n\"On the 22nd instant, we again wired Messrs. Francoeur and Lefrancois, advising that unless we received their tenders without further delay, they would not be considered. As a result we are now in receipt of a detailed tender from E. Lefrancois, outlining work he is prepared to carry out for his tendered price of $1561.00.\n\n\"No tender has been received from Mr. Francoeur.\n\n\"While Mr. Lefrancois has not commented on the contents of his tender, he has submitted sketches of what is embodied. These may be summarized as follows:-\n\n\"The contractor has figured on retaining a one pipe system and on removing the existing Gurney Boiler, replacing it with an Ideal Boiler No. S36-7, manufactured by the Dominion Radiator Co. Ltd. This boiler is adequate for taking care of the existing connected radiators, together with 4 additional radiators which are considered necessary.\"\n\"The contractor has figured on adjusting the amount of radiation in each room, by moving several units from their existing positions and installing them in new locations to balance the room temperatures. He has included replacement of all air valves, as well as new radiators, new piping, pipe fittings and new smoke breeching to chimney. His tender including the above and all necessary labour amounts to $1561.00, subdivided under the following headings:\n\n\"Supplying No. 36-7 Ideal Steam Boiler and accessories.......................... $ 749.00\nSylphon Damper Regulator......................... 12.00\nNew piping, air vents, valves, pipe fittings, radiators and smoke breeching.. 345.00\nLabour........................................... 450.00\nBoiler inspection............................... 5.00\n\nTotal........ $1,561.00\n\n\"The contractor's sketches indicate that changes from the original layout, have been made in several of the classrooms. Partitions have been erected dividing the larger classrooms into two. This has resulted in unbalancing the radiation in the rooms effected, and is the reason for the contractor having included additional radiators in his tender.\n\n\"Upon analysis of the tender, and checking the items with the original Indian Affairs plans and the contractor's sketches, it is felt that the work covered is necessary, the equipment satisfactory and the price reasonable.\n\n\"You will recall that the price obtained by Indian Agent Brisebois from the Gurney-Massey Co. for a Gurney No. 40-6 steam boiler, which is similar in construction and capacity to the Ideal No. 36-7, was $754.00 F.O.B. Montreal.\n\n(over).............\n\"The contractor was not asked to give dates for beginning or completing operations, but some delay in delivery of a boiler might reasonably be expected under present conditions.\"\n\nMr. Mills' opinion that the equipment etc. proposed by Mr. E. Lefrancois will take care of the situation in a satisfactory manner, and that his tender should be accepted, is concurred in.\n\nIf you approve of this being done will you kindly advise me and we will look after the letting of the contract.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nApril 3, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Heating System, Kateri Indian Day School, Caughnawaga, Quebec.\n\nI have your memorandum of March 30, in connection with the above and have carefully noted its contents. I note that the quotation received by you includes some changes to the radiators etc. in addition to installing the new boiler. However, the boiler mentioned in the quotation from Mr. Lefrancois is not the same boiler as recommended in our memorandum of January 20 last. Besides, there is an item of $450 for labour. Our officials feel that this is an excessive amount for the work required.\n\nAlthough the teachers and children have suffered considerable inconvenience, due to the fact that we did not replace the boiler earlier, at the same time the present heating season is nearly past and there is no great urgency for installing a new boiler within the next few weeks. We must, however, have the new boiler installed before October 1, 1944, in order to ensure adequate heating for the winter of 1944-45.\n\nIn view of the above I feel that the matter can be delayed for a time and it would be appreciated if you would have one of your officers visit the Kateri\nSchool and make certain that the quotation of Mr. Lefrancois is reasonable. We would also like to draw your attention to the fact mentioned above; namely, that we suggested a different type of boiler from that quoted by Mr. Lefrancois.\n\nDirector.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nTREASURY ONLY\n\nPay to The Shawinigan Water & Power Co.,\nAddress Commercial & Distribution Dept.,\nValleyfield,\nP.

As you are aware, our motor on our oil furnace in the teachers' residence burnt out on March 19th. Since that time, we have been using wood to heat up the house but with poor results. Yesterday and today have been miserable days, the temperature in the residence being between 54 and 58.\n\nMr. Bush is doing all he can but we cannot ask him to be on the job twenty four hours a day and therefore a sister fills up the furnace every hour or so. Couldn't you possibly do something to help us out? We assure you that we would appreciate heat since all this year has been a year of suffering from lack of heat either at school or at home. I feel that the sisters' health is suffering from this, for nearly all of them are having colds, sore throats, she came down with double-pneumonia.

Lefrancois of Montreal dated March 25th, 1944 to this Service. This amount is confirmed by the manufacturer's price f.o.b. Montreal, tax included.\n\n(c) The Kateri Indian Day School at Caughnawaga has at present 1750 square feet of connected radiation. If adjustments are carried out this amount will be increased to 1950 square feet. A boiler with a net capacity of 2000 square feet and gross capacity of 2600 square feet would be required.\n\n(d) Either of the boilers described would be satisfactory.\n\nRegarding the amount of $450.00 shown for labour in the tender submitted by Mr. Lefrancois, we may say that in view of the operations to be undertaken, and since the amount is considered to include the contractor's profit, it is not considered excessive.\n\nHowever since the Indian Affairs Branch are prepared to defer action on the matter for the present, the tender could be reviewed with the contractor, when next we have an officer in the vicinity.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ.

Lefrancois is reasonable but if you wish to have one of our officers check the tender with the contractor, we will have that done. However, in view of the delay that will result and the fact that there is just as likely to be an increase in cost as a reduction, we would suggest that the tender of E. Lefrancois be accepted.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nApril 19, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Heating system, Kateri Indian Day School, Caughnawaga Agency, Quebec.\n\nI have your memorandum of April 17, in connection with the above, and this Branch approves the following work:\n\nSupplying No. 36-7 Ideal Steam Boiler and accessories ......................... $ 749.00\nSylphon Damper Regulator .................. 12.00\nNew piping, air vents, valves, pipe fittings, radiators and smoke breeching 345.00\nLabour ........................................ 450.00\nBoiler inspection ............................ 5.00\n\nTotal ........... $1,561.00\n\nArrangements will be made to forward to you the amount shown above at an early date.\n\nI trust that you will arrange to have all the work completed before September 1, 1944, the date on which the school will re-open for the academic year 1944-45.

I regret to state, however, that I am not in a position to say when this program will be announced or when construction work is likely to start.

For instance, we are apparently paying for the services of the women who do the cleaning of the various rooms and at the same time we are requested to provide their dinners. It is felt that the latter charge is unnecessary, as these women no doubt reside in the village and could go home at noon.\n\nWhy was it necessary to incur an expenditure of $2.50 for carrying water?\n\nThe account of $3 for cardboard used in connection with the military stockings is a charge against the Welfare Vote and it would be appreciated if you would issue a special voucher covering that item, to which the receipted account should be attached.\n\nR.A.

Indian Day School graduates for 1944. As you will readily see, we had a nice group of graduates this year. These boys and girls are certainly about the best pupils who have left the Caughnawaga school. We hope they will continue to be a credit to the Department. Most of them are planning to continue their schooling in the fall.\n\nWe wish to take this opportunity to thank you and all the other members of the Department who have been instrumental in obtaining a new unit for our frigidaire. The long-coveted prize has at last arrived and has alleviated conditions very much.\n\nThe furnace in Kateri School has also been installed. For this also, we are very grateful.\n\nWe are now trying to plan where to place all our pupils in September. The schools were overflowing last year\u2014seven graduates left and some sixty new pupils are expected for the first grade. We could use a magic wand and create a few extra rooms.\n\nWe are still looking forward to your long-promised visit.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSisters of Saint Ann\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nOttawa.\n| TAXE NO. | DEMANDE | LECTURE ACTUELLE PRESENT READING | LECTURE PR\u00c9CEDENTE PREVIOUS READING | CONSUMPTION CONSOMMATION | MONTANT BRUT GROSSE BILL | MONTANT NET NET BILL |\n|---------|---------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|\n| 182     |         |                                 |                                     |                          |                          |                      |\n\n**TAXE DE VENTE F\u00c9D\u00c9RALE**\nFEDERAL SALES TAX\n\n8%\n\n**TAXE DE VENTE PROVINCIALE**\nPROVINCIAL SALES TAX\n\n2%\n\n\"PRI\u00c8RE DE JOINDRE CETTE FACTURE \u00c0 VOTRE REMISE\"\n\nPLEASE BRING THIS ACCOUNT WHEN MAKING PAYMENT\n\nTOTAL\n\nVEUILLEZ TRANSMETTRE \u00c0 LA COMPAGNIE \u00c0 MONTR\u00c9AL TOUTE PLAINTE CONCERNANT LE SERVICE.\n\nPLEASE ADDRESS COMPLAINTS TO THE COMPANY AT MONTREAL.\n\nDESCRIPTION DES TAUX AU VERRO.

Accordingly, we communicated with the Quebec Department of Labour and have now been furnished with a duplicate copy of the Certificate, which is transmitted herewith.\n\nProvincial regulations in Quebec require the Inspection Certificate of any pressure vessel to be posted near the unit concerned, and the attached Document should be forwarded to Indian Agent Brisebois for this purpose.\n\nThe Certificate covers the additional installation of the boiler fittings and piping, and expires on October 3rd, 1945. The Indian Affairs Branch should arrange for annual inspections thereafter.\n\nT.S. MILLS,\nChief Engineer.\n\nR. H. Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nOttawa,\nNovember 28, 1944.\n\nMr. F. Brisebois, Indian Agent, Caughnawaga, Que.\n\nWith reference to the new heating boiler recently installed in the Kateri School, the certificate issued by the Provincial Boiler Inspector was lost in the mail and did not reach this office. However, a duplicate has been secured and I enclose this in order that it may be posted on the wall near the boiler. You will note that the certificate expires on October 3, 1945, and previous to that date you should arrange to have the Inspector examine the furnace, in order that we may make certain that it is in good condition for the heating season of 1945-46.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMR. HOEY\n\nRe: Education Requirements at Caughnawaga.\n\nI wish to submit this report as a supplement to Mr. Phelan's report dated November 6th, dealing with the building requirements on the Caughnawaga Reserve.\n\nI had the pleasure of meeting F.J. McHugh of the Dominion Bridge Company, Personnel Manager and William Bell, Construction Engineer. I also interviewed Mr. J. Conrath, Works Manager of the Dominion Plant of the Canadian Car and Foundry.\n\nMy point of interest was to find out what these gentlemen considered necessary or advantageous in the training of young Indians who might be employed by them. They all agreed that the teaching of geometry and the reading of plans along with general mathematics would give these young people a greater opportunity. As far as skills were concerned they mentioned welding, electrical and gas, and metal firing. It is hardly possible for us, because of the young age of the children on leaving school to give training in these skills. Pupils, however, could be picked out who have aptitude in this line and encouraged to carry their training beyond the age of sixteen.\n\nI might say that, the day is fast approaching when the Department as an educational agency for Indians, will have to formulate its own programme of study in co-ordination with the various provinces.\n\nThe above needs have been kept in mind when the building programme as contained in the above mentioned report was recommended.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, November 24, 1944.\n| TAUX NO. | DEMANDE DEMAND | LECTURE ACTUELLE PRESENT READING | LECTURE PRECEDENTE PREVIOUS READING | CONSOMMATION CONSUMPTION | MONTANT BRUT GROSS BILL | MONTANT NET NET BILL |\n|----------|----------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|\n|          |                |                                 |                                   |                          |                        |                      |\n\nTAXE DE VENTE FEDERALE FEDERAL SALES TAX 8%\nTAXE DE VENTE PROVINCIALE PROVINCIAL SALES TAX 2%\n\n\"PREMIERE DE JOINDRE CETTE FACTURE A VOTRE COMPTE\"\nPLEASE BRING THIS ACCOUNT WHEN MAKING PAYMENT\n\nTOTAL\n\nVEUILLEZ TRANSMETTRE A LA COMPAGNIE A MONTR\u00c9AL TOUTE PLAINTE CONCERNANT LE SERVICE.\nPLEASE ADDRESS COMPLAINTS TO THE COMPANY AT MONTREAL.\n\nDESCRIPTION DES COMPTES AU VERSO.

Mr. Buck is familiar with conditions on this reserve, as Mr. Phelan and Mr. Doucet discussed the proposed building with him while at Caughnawaga on November 3 last. Before proceeding with the plans I should appreciate it if you would arrange to have Mr. Buck telephone Mr. Doucet so that the latter may discuss with Mr. Buck some of our requirements.\n\nBroadly speaking we would like to have a building with twelve classrooms, also rooms in the basement for kitchen, sewing room, weaving room and playroom.\n\nToilet facilities should also be provided in the basement.\n\nWe suggest steam heating and electric lighting, also the installation of a simple ventilation system.\nAt the present time we do not favour placing the heating system in the basement, but in a separate addition, and I believe it would be advisable to provide for a stoker, in order that reasonably priced coal may be used.\n\nActing Director.\nPay to Lacroix Hardware,\nAddress 133 Notre-Dame St.,\nLachine, Que.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Nov. 29 | ENCLOSURES. |        |\n\nTo various supplies for use in minor repairs at the Caughnawaga R.C.

Changes had been made in three of the vouchers but in every instance these would appear to have been made before forwarding to our Indian Agent at Caughnawaga. It was noted at the time that a couple of small errors had been made but in view of the difficulty encountered in the past in obtaining completely correct accounts from your firm, these were allowed to stand, the total error being 5\u00bd\u00a2 according to our calculations.\n\nWith reference to your voucher #0118-620 this was paid as rendered at $2.21 although a discount of 25 cents had been deducted when the account was rendered. In connection with voucher #0118-580 this was rendered at $10.68 and paid at that figure. According to our calculations this is figured as follows:\n\n| Item       | Amount   |\n|------------|----------|\n| 1st Metre  | $10.50   |\n|            | - $1.00  |\n|            | = $9.50  |\n| 2nd Metre  | $2.42    |\n|            | - disc.  |\n|            | = $1.18  |\n|            | pre. pd. |\n|            | = $10.68 |\n\nVr.No. 0118-640 2.64 paid\n\" \" 0118-600 6.53 paid as rendered\n\nWith reference to voucher #0017-670 this was rendered at $16.12 but according to rate No 150 under which this was figured it properly amounts to $15.06, figured as follows:\n\n| Item       | Amount   |\n|------------|----------|\n| Service charge | 2 months |\n| Amt. at 3.5\u00a2 | -- 100   |\n| \" \" 1.5\u00a2     | -- 300   |\n| Bal. at .09\u00a2 | -- 1292  |\n| Discount     | $20.07   |\n|              | 2.01     |\n|              | $16.06   |\n\nIf these figures are correct it is considered that the accounts in all have been underpaid to the extent of 5\u00bd cents and on receipt of your acknowledgement this adjustment will be made. If not will you please show in detail how the gross amount of $20.47 is arrived at on voucher #0017-670.\n\nThis Department\nThis Department has had considerable correspondence with your firm in an effort to have your accounts rendered correctly and containing all the details necessary to permit proper credit; but as stated above these accounts were rendered for the amounts at which they were paid and in view of the fact that the total error is small they were passed at the same figures.\n\nThe cheques are being held pending your reply.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL.W.

(RG 10, Volume 6081, file 305-5, part 14)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMemorandum:\n\nIn connection with my recent visit to Caughnawaga, I believe that certain faulty procedures in the operation of the furnaces of the schools, should be noted. The correction of the above should, I believe, increase the efficiency of the heating system.\n\nI am fully aware that it is impossible to obtain a trained fireman. I would not be prepared to say that a change would bring about any improvement. However, I believe that certain facts should be brought to the attention of the Indian Agent who should be instructed to have our instructions carried out:\n\n1. The flues of the steam furnaces should be cleaned weekly. This should be systematically done every Saturday.\n2. The method of checking the furnace by leaving the fuel door open cannot be justified. This door should be open only when adding coal to the fire. Instructions were given to the Janitor on several occasions, once you will recall in your presence but these instructions are not carried out.\n3. When feeding coal into the furnace, the rear damper should be closed while the furnace damper should be open. After closing the fuel door the furnace damper should be at least partially closed and when the furnace is burning freely completely closed.\n4. In order to check the furnace the rear damper should be open more or less as conditions require.\nI noticed that the recently installed furnace was equipped with automatic damper controls. These however have been removed. The Janitor claims that they were not functioning but I am rather inclined to believe that he does not understand this apparatus.\n\nGenerally, the companies furnish instructions on the operation of their furnaces. These should be posted near the furnace and carefully followed. The Agent should be instructed to obtain a copy of these instructions and have it posted in a conspicuous place near the furnace.\n\nI wish to draw your attention to the above having in mind the difficulties that have been encountered in heating the Caughnawaga schools.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nA.J. Doucet.\n\nOttawa, January 3, 1945.\nOttawa, January 4, 1945.\n\nMr. F. Brisebois, Indian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\n\nMr. Doucet has reported regarding his recent visit to Caughnawaga, especially with respect to the new furnace in the Kateri School. He is not satisfied with the manner in which the furnace is being operated. I therefore suggest that the following instructions be given to the janitor and that you make arrangements to see that these instructions are put into effect:\n\n1. The flues of the steam furnaces should be cleaned weekly. This should be systematically done every Saturday.\n\n2. The method of checking the furnace by leaving the fuel door open cannot be justified. This door should be open only when adding coal to the fire. Instructions were given to the Janitor on several occasions, once you will recall in your presence, but these instructions are not carried out.\n\n3. When feeding coal into the furnace, the rear damper should be closed while the furnace damper should be open. After closing the fuel door, the furnace damper should be at least partially closed and when the furnace is burning freely, completely closed.\n\n4. In order to check the furnace, the rear damper should be open more or less, as conditions require.\n\nMr. Doucet also noticed that the automatic damper controls had been removed from the furnace. This\nshould not have been done, and damper controls should be again installed.\n\nIt is the usual practice for a company to furnish instructions on the operation of their furnaces. If they neglected to do so, I would appreciate it if you would secure a copy of these instructions immediately, discuss them with the janitor and post the instructions in a conspicuous place near the furnace.\n\nIt has occurred to me that in view of your many duties it may not be possible for you to visit the Kateri School sufficiently often to ascertain if the janitor is operating the furnace in a proper manner. Might I suggest that when you find it impossible to visit the school you send Mr. LaPlante. It would not require very much time, and he could report to you if the janitor is following instructions and, if not, you could then interview the janitor and point out to him the mistakes that he is making.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, January 4, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Brisebois:\n\nWith reference to my letter of the 4th instant, regarding the furnace at the Kateri School, paragraph numbered 1 read as follows:\n\n\"The flues of the steam furnaces should be closed weekly. This should be systematically done every Saturday.\"\n\nThis should have read:\n\n\"The flues of the steam furnaces should be cleaned weekly. This should be systematically done every Saturday.\"\n\nPlease make the necessary correction in the letter of January 4.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. F.

The old pump was of American make and had been in use for over 22 years.\n\nIn view of the fact that water was much needed at the school in view of the steam heating system etc., and that no savings would have been effected by repairing same it was thought advisable to have a new one installed.\n\nI regret the delay in answering your letter as it had been mislaid at this office.\n\n[Fra.

Besides, if the old pump had been repaired there was no guarantee that it would operate for a period longer than two or three months. The pump was needed immediately, due to the fact that it supplied the water for the steam heating plant. The Agent therefore made arrangements for the immediate installation of a new pump.

C. School. The old pump was not working properly and when it was removed it was found that the repairs necessary would cost as much as a new pump. Besides, if the old pump had been repaired there was no guarantee that it would operate for a period longer than two or three months. The pump was needed immediately, due to the fact that it supplied the water for the steam heating plant. The Agent therefore made arrangements for the immediate installation of a new pump. It would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid. The coding is as follows: - 305-76-12-422.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\nCaughnawaga, May 25th, 1945.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Can.\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of the 23 ultimo dealing with the proposed erection of a wooden fence in front of the Eastern School, and to say that Mr. Wescott will soon give us the particulars needed for an estimate.\n\nI wish to report however that the fence adjoining lots Nos. 461, 462, 457 and 459, that is the sides and the back of the school lot, is now in dilapidated condition and needs to be renewed at the earliest possible date as the four Indian owners of the above mentioned lots will not be able to make any garden. Without a new fence the pupils are all over their properties and also the cattles which are still allowed to roam about.\n\nFor the sides and the back of the lot a 5 ft. wire fence of ordinary make is suggested. This fence wire is priced at .10\u00a2 a foot. Wooden posts are not obtainable and steel posts of 8 ft. long would be required.\n\nIn addition to ordinary posts, two steel corner posts would be needed and also two end posts. This fence would have a total length of 600 ft., and the price of the wire would be of .10\u00a2 per foot. Fifty six ordinary posts (steel) would be required at a cost of .59\u00a2 each. The two corner posts are priced at $12.20 and the two end posts $9.95 each. In addition about a ton of crushed stone at $1.50, between six or eight bags of cement at .60\u00a2 would be needed. The labor could be made by our janitor with the help of one man. The labor to cost around $20.\n\nThese prices were obtained from the Frost Steel & Wire Co., through their local agent, Louis A. Dailleboust, who recently started a hardware store on this Reserve.\n\nAn early reply to this letter would be much appreciated.\n\nIndian Agent.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**REQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES**\n\nOttawa, May 29, 1945.\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa, (File 5-1-5)\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nCaughnawaga R.C.

The old fence was practically non-existent having been torn down by the pupils and other children, including her own.\n\nWhen the men were erecting the fence this woman, who had complained that cattle and horses were coming on her lot through the school yard, was told that she could still make a garden if she had her ploughing done immediately, neglected to do so having apparently made up her mind not to cultivate this year.\n\nThis family owns Lot No. 462 which is located directly at the back of the School yard. This lot is of a total area of about one half an acre, not one acre as stated on her letter.\n\nIt may be that a little damage was suffered from the bad state of the fence but her claim, in my opinion, is greatly exaggerated.\n\n(Frs.

This burner was of the ordinary type (large) with an air circulator attached.

Brisebois, Indian Agent, Caughnawaga, Quebec.\n\nI presume the attached voucher No. 429 covers the cost of the extra fencing which was done at the Caughnawaga Eastern School.\n\nThe voucher is made out in favour of L.A. Dailleboust but the account was on the paper of the Frost Steel and Wire Company and is not receipted. Consequently, payment cannot be made to Dailleboust unless there is a receipt attached from the Company. I also point out that when you forwarded your voucher No. 430 covering items authorized by Purchase Order 3632, the price per foot of wire fencing was 10\u00a2 while on the attached account it is 15\u00a2. There is also an increase in price on the attached account for other articles compared with the account which accompanied Voucher 430. If Dailleboust has paid the account to the Frost Steel and Wire Company it will be necessary to forward one voucher in favour of the Frost Company for articles they supplied and a second voucher in favour of Dailleboust who apparently supplied the articles written in ink on the account. I would also appreciate receiving an explanation for the increased prices mentioned above as we will have to obtain a Purchase Order and I want all possible information available for the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| Description                                      | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|-------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| No. 5 Model W Chair Desks                       | 30       | $10.55     | $316.50     |\n| No. 3 \"                                          | 30       | $10.85     | $325.50     |\n| No. 24 Teachers' Desks - less top rail - with locking device | 2        | $25.65     | $51.30      |\n| No. 39 Chairs                                   | 4        | $6.15      | $24.60      |\n\nTotal: $713.70\n\nFed. sales tax inc.\n\nPrepaid\n\nShipped to: H.C.

Dailleboust, in the amount of $144.85, for materials supplied for the erection of the fence in front of the above named school, together with an amended voucher covering same.\n\nAs to the difference of the price of .15\u00a2 per foot charged on this account compared to the 10\u00a2 per foot charged under voucher No. 430, Purchase Order No. 3632, I wish to point out that the wire supplied was of a height of 6 feet instead of 5 feet as under the above purchase order. The increases on other items on this account compared to the account under voucher No. 430, are due to the fact that the materials supplied are not quite of the same specifications.\n\nIt is hoped that the above informations will be of help to you in the preparing of a purchase order.\n\nEnclos.\n\nFrs.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No.: dated:\n\nFORM No. I.A. 506\n\nVoucher No.: 650\n\nVote 76 Allot. 02-210\n\nDecember 17th, 1945\nAugust 28, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: Senior School,\nCaughnawaga Indian Agency, Quebec.\n\nA memorandum from the Acting Director of Indian Affairs, dated December 12, 1944, gave a general outline of what would be required for a building to replace the Senior School at the above Agency, which was destroyed by fire in December 1941, and on the basis of that information, preliminary sketch drawings have been prepared, and three sets of black line prints of these, are attached for transmission to the Indian Affairs Branch for their study.\n\nThese rough sketches show the suggested twelve classrooms, and make provision for sewing, cooking, and handicraft activities for the girls, as well as manual training for the boys, on the lower floor. Two other floors provide accommodation for a maximum of 480 pupils in six classrooms of 40 pupils each.\n\nThe building is intended to be completely fireproof with a reinforced concrete frame, and outer walls of hollow tile faced with brick and trimmed with cut stone. This trim, however, has been kept to the minimum. The building would be steam heated from a central heating plant which would also supply heat to a teachers' residence which will eventually be built close to the school. A simple ventilation system would be provided.\n\nIt would be necessary to drill a well for a water supply, but electricity is available.\n\nSome years ago, at considerable expense to the then, Indian Affairs Department, a sewer line was built to discharge sewage directly into the Saint Lawrence River. Owing to the very rocky nature and limited area of the site, no additional sewage disposal facilities have been anticipated. It is felt that branch lines to the existing sewer would permit the use of this installation.\n\nThe building, as shown in the sketches, is estimated to cost in the vicinity of $115,000.00.\n\nWe have not forwarded prints for your files, since drawings are available in our Architectural Division, at any time you should require them.\n\nEnclos.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ.

In the second paragraph of your letter you state that the old fence was practically non-existent having been torn down by the pupils and other children, including her own. It would, therefore, appear that the mere fact that there was some delay in building the new fence would not cause her any extra injury.\"\nOne of her claims was that the old fence was torn down some time before the date on which the new fence was erected and it was during this time that the damage occurred.\n\nIn the third paragraph of your letter you stated that if Mrs. Delisle was anxious to cultivate a garden during 1945 she could have done so prior to the erection of the new fence.\n\nWe can not see that she has a just claim and consequently you should advise her that we are not prepared to make any payment to her.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| DATE     | SERVICE                  | AMOUNT |\n|----------|--------------------------|--------|\n| Jan 26   | To 44 gallons of oil @ .23 | $10.12 |\n|          | 1 x 5 gal. mm oil can    | 2.65   |\n|          | **Supplied to the R.C.

Like the evil spirits of legend, they cause havoc wherever they go, injuring hair, skin, clothing; wasting soap and fuel, and adding hours of needless drudgery to household tasks.\n\nFor a better understanding of these invisible enemies consider the wanderings of water from the clouds to your house. In its purest state, falling as rain or snow, water contains some gases and dissolved dust. Then it soaks into soil, sweeps over rock strata, and finally bubbles to the surface in springs which feed rivers and lakes. Water, being the universal solvent, dissolves at least part of everything it touches. This explains the presence in most untreated waters of these troublemakers, lime, magnesia, and other minerals\u2014the hardening elements normally indistinguishable by sight or taste.\n\nWhen soap and water meet, the indisputable test of water hardness occurs right before your eyes. Soft water flows immediately into plentiful, rich, foamy suds, which cleanse thoroughly and wash away easily. In hard water, before any cleansing action can be accomplished, part of the soap must be wasted in neutralizing the water\u2019s mineral salts. The result\u2014a sticky film of insoluble soap curd and very skimpy lather. This soap scum adheres to everything it touches and requires laborious rubbing and scrubbing for only partial removal.\n\nDishes washed in soft water suds, with much less soap, dry to a clear sparkle without toweling. Silver retains its satiny gleam, glassware shines. You save soap, time and work.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6081, file 305-5, part 14)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nENJOY COMFORTS OF SOFT WATER\n\nall around the clock\n\nNOON\n\nSHAVING\nSee that smile? Soft water lather takes the torture out of shaving. Leaves skin soft, smooth and comfortable.\n\nDISHWASHING\nChina and glassware dry to a clear sparkle without toweling when washed in soft water's soap-saving suds.\n\nMORNING\n\nCOOKING\nFoods retain their natural flavor and deliciousness. Coffee tastes as good as it smells. It's much easier to be a good cook with soft water... economical, too.\n\nAFTERNOON\n\nBABY'S BATH\nHear him coo! He, too, enjoys his soft water bath\u2014and it protects his tender skin against the irritation often caused by soap curd film.\n\nEVENING\n\nIT'S SO EASY THE WARLO WAY\nyou can see the difference\n\nIn the KITCHEN\n\nGreen vegetables cooked in soft water retain all their natural deliciousness. When cooked in hard water, they may lose flavor, become tough and tasteless due to absorption of lime in water. Less coffee and tea are required with soft water for a more flavorful brew of desired strength. It is so much easier to be a good cook with soft water!\n\nIn the BATHROOM\n\nBath tub ring is an ugly thing, and hard water causes it. Hard water deposits that same scummy film on skin and hair. That's why hair looks dull and lifeless after a hard water shampoo \u2014 why shaving is a skin-torturing chore. Soft water's foamy suds leave no soap curd film. Hair sparkles with its natural sheen. Shaving becomes easier, more comfortable. Bathing in soft water's plentiful, silky suds is an inexpensive pleasure for the whole family . . . leaves skin soft, smooth.\n\nIn the LAUNDRY\n\nSnowy-white washes are impossible with hard water. Hard rubbing and lots of soap will not remove the sticky film which hard water leaves. Clothes are gray, stiff\u2014wear out faster. Soft water's billowy suds, with less work and less soap, leave clothes really white. Washing machines operate more efficiently, too. Commercial laundries depend on soft water for customer satisfaction and money-saving.\n\nIn the HEATING SYSTEM\n\nHard water scale forms inside your water heater and boiler, acting as an insulator and requiring more fuel for every effective heat unit. Also, scale will clog hot water pipes so that they must be replaced. A Government estimate shows that hard water scale of only 1/9\" thickness will waste 16\u00a2 out of every fuel dollar. Soft water actually removes pipe scale and prevents its further formation.\n\nFacts You Should Know\n\nMiddle-income families, surveyed by an independent engineer, report soft water economies. The table below shows how soft water (1 grain) * decreases costs over comparable use of hard water (17\u00bd grains). Warlo-softened water (0 grains) saves even more.\n\n| Item                        | Savings |\n|-----------------------------|---------|\n| Soap                        | 54% saved |\n| Washable fabrics replacement| 38% saved |\n| Water heater fuel           | 36% saved |\n\n*Hardness varies with different localities, but it is always present in some degree unless removed. For convenience, hardness is quoted in grains per gallon. Typical water: New York City 11\u00bd-3 grains; Great Lakes 6-7 grains; Midwestern cities 20 grains; private wells 16-30 grains.\n\nSurveys show that the average single family house uses about 130 gallons of water a day, or 260 tons a year. So much comfort, convenience and actual dollars depend on that water, you owe it to yourself to see that it is Warlo-soft.\n\nSavings in soap, fuel, plumbing, and heating maintain your own peace of mind. Ask your Crane dealer.

Tenders for the work on the three Village Schools are herewith enclosed but it is unlikely that the amount provided will be sufficient to cover the cost of the painting, labour and material, for these three Schools. Therefore the two Schools above mentioned could be attended to before the opening of the classes in September, next.\n\nRelative to the point I have to say that it was not possible to get any guarantee to be supplied with same owing to the shortage of containers. We were informed that it would be preferable to purchase white lead, boiled oil, turpentine etc., and have our paint mixed by the painters. You will find herewith prices obtained from the Raymond Hardware Co., Ltd., 658 Craig st., west, Montreal, for the above materials.\n\nTenders for the United Church Day School will be transmitted you by the following mail.\n\n(Frs.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, Aug. 17, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nPursuant to our conversation of August 3rd during which you have kindly granted the need of an electric stove for our residence, we have gone to the General Electric Co., Limited, to price them. We are including a sample of the kind and size we wish to have with the price as given us at the office by Mr. McGarrity. We would deeply appreciate your attention to this request.\n\nWe wish to provide 5th grade of Eastern School with individual desks, medium size. It will facilitate the difficult work which we foresee our teacher will have with these 5th graders. Would the Department kindly order three dozen of these desks, of which order one dozen would complete the number of individual desks required to outfit 6th grade, boys and girls, in Kateri School?\n\nMr. Douwet allowed Sr. Superior to obtain Algebras for the upper grades; however the order was not put in then as the school year was already quite advanced. We believe Sr. Superior planned ordering them for the coming year. May we put in the order now from \"Montreal Book Room, Ltd., 1455 McGill, 44 Algebras and 44 Histories entitled \"Europe in the Modern World\"? Would you wish us to call for these two kinds of books separately so that the bill will not exceed $100?\n\nI have visited the schools last week, and I cannot refrain from saying how painfully surprised I am at the conditions in which our teachers and pupils must work. I know you are aware of the situation and no doubt with every teacher here you are eager to see the walls of a new school and residence rise. A newspaper heading a few days ago made our hopes soar high.... Ottawa is to take measures for the building of 80,000 houses in 1947.... A spontaneous cry dropped from all our teachers' lips: \"Are our new school and residence comprised in this resolution?\"\nI wish to thank you, dear Mr. Phelan, for the courtesy and kindness shown Sr. M. George and myself during our visit to you and wish to assure you of my earnest wish to serve the interests of the Department in favor of our Indians.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSISTERS OF ST.

She immediately started to run away and we followed her. At the same time as Edith CANADIAN broke the window, I also saw Angeline DIABO pick up a stone and also break a window of the school.\n\nPersonally, I did not throw any stones at the school and I do not know of anyone else who broke any.\n\n(SGD) William CROSS.\n\n10. Edith CANADIAN who is implicated by CROSS and MYLOW was then contacted in this connection. This girl is fifteen years of age and daughter of Mrs. Cecelia CANADIAN. She furnished a statement admitting her guilt.\n\n(P.T.O.)\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6052, file 305-5, part 15)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nWith reference to the above, I wish to report that on the 2nd inst., a complaint was received from the Superior of the Catholic School, Caughnawaga, Que., to the effect that seven 24 x 28\" windows of the girl's school have been broken during the evening of October 31st 1946 which was Halloween night.\n\nAn examination of the school revealed that seven window panes measuring 24 x 28\" were broken on both the East and North sides. Due to the size of the holes in these broken windows there is no doubt that this damage was caused by stones.\n\nIt is estimated that on the evening of the 31st ult., about three-hundred young children of the Caughnawaga Indian Reserve were masqueraded and were playing between this school and Kirby's dance hall where a dance was taking place.\n\nDuring the course of an investigation in this matter it was learned that the above named has been boasting about breaking a window at the Girl's school on this particular evening.\n\nConsequently, on the 5th inst., Angeline DIABO was interviewed and questioned in this connection and she vehemently denied having anything to do with the damage caused at the school. She however admitted having thrown a stone which struck the porch of the school but assured us that she never broke any window.\n\nFurther investigation in this case revealed that Angeline DIABO was seen with Lorraine CANOE on the evening of the 31st ult. The latter party was therefore questioned and from her statement obtained it is disclosed that Angeline DIABO did break a school window on this evening. Hereunder is a statement obtained from Lorraine CANOE:\n\nCaughnawaga, Que.,\nNov., 12th 1946.\n\nI, Lorraine CANOE, age 13 years, daughter of Mrs. Marian CANOE, residing at Caughnawaga, Que., wish to make the following statement, willingly and knowing it to contain the whole truth.\n\nAt approximately 9.30 p.m. on October 31st 1946, I was with Edith Canadian, Russel Canadian and Angeline DIABO. We began to play near the Girl's school of Caughnawaga, Que., while we were waiting\n\n(P.T.C.)\nfor our friends to join us to attend the Halloween dance which was taking place at the Kirby's dance Hall.\n\nWhile playing with my friends mentioned above, I saw Angeline DIABO pick up a stone and walk near the school and throw it a stone in the direction of the school. Angeline DIABO broke the window on the east side of the school, but I cannot say if she did it intentionally or accidentally. I do not know if Russel and Edith CANADIAN saw Angeline DIABO break the window, but I sincerely believe they did see her.\n\nAfter this, we all went to my home where we remained for a few minutes only. We then returned to the dance hall. Edith Canadian and Angeline were walking together in front of us, and myself, accompanied by Russel Canadian, Stewart Mylow and Roland Perron, were following them by a short distance. The two last persons were walking behind us. As Russel Canadian and I had passed the school, we heard two windows break and I am of the opinion that these windows were broken by Stewart Mylow and Roland Perron. We all met at the dance hall and there was not a word mentioned about the broken windows.\n\nThis is all I know in this case.\n\n(SGD) Lorraine CANOE.\n\n7. After obtaining this statement, Angeline DIABO was again interviewed on this date and a sworn statement was obtained from her. It will be noted from her own statement that she admits having broken one window of the school. After being given the legal warning, the following statement was obtained and sworn to by L.E. Beausais, J.P.:-\n\nCaughnawaga, Que.,\nNovember 11th 1946.\n\nI, Angeline DIABO, 17 years old, daughter of Matthew DIABO, residing at Caughnawaga, Que., wish to make the following statement, willingly and knowing it to contain the whole truth after having been duly warned.\n\nAt approximately 9.30 p.m. on October 31st 1946, I was with Lorraine CANOE, Edith CANADIAN and Russel CANADIAN. We began to play near the Girl's school.\nwhile we were waiting for our friends to join us to attend the Halloween dance which was taking place at the Kirby's dance hall.\n\nWhilst playing with my friends mentioned above, I picked up a stone and threw it at the Girl's school and accidentally broke a 24 x 26\" window on the east side of the school. I cannot say if Lorraine CANOE Edith and Russel CANADIAN did break any windows as we were all throwing stones in all directions. However, these three friends of mine saw me break the window of the school.\n\nAfter this we proceeded to Lorraine CANOE's home where we remained for a few minutes only. Edith CANADIAN and I proceeded direct to the dance hall whilst Lorraine CANOE and her friends were following us by a short distance. When the latter party passed by the school I could hear some stones being thrown and I also heard one or two windows break. With the exception of Lorraine CANOE, I cannot say who were the members of the gang following us and who broke the other windows. Edith CANADIAN and I proceeded to the dance hall, where we remained together till the end of the dance which finished at about 1.00 a.m.\n\nThis is all I have to say in this case.\n\n(SGD) Angeline DIABO.\n\nIn the two aforementioned statements, it will be noted that both Angeline DIABO and Lorraine CANOE admit having heard windows break after they went past the school on their way to the dance hall. One of the parties mentioned in the above statements is Stewart MYIOW. This subject was questioned and the undermentioned statement was obtained from him:\n\nCaughnawaga, Que.,\nNov., 12th 1946.\n\nI, Stewart MYIOW, age 14 years, son of Mr. Annie MYIOW, Caughnawaga, Que., wish to make the following statement, willingly and knowing it to contain the whole truth.\n\nAt approximately 9.30 p.m. of October 31st 1946, I was walking down to Kirby's dance hall with Edith CANADIAN, Russel CANADIAN, Lorraine CANOE, Roland BARRON, William CROSS and Angeline DIABO.\n\n(P.T.O.)\nAs we all passed by the school, I saw that Edith Canadian had a rock in her hand and I also saw her throw this rock at the school and break a window. Edith Canadian then started to run and we all followed her.\n\nI do not know if anyone else heard Edith Canadian break the window, but they all ran away when they the window break and Edith Canadian was the first one to run.\n\nI only threw one stone on the porch of the school but did not break any glass.\n\n(SGD) Stewart Mylow.\n\n9. From MYLOW's statement, it is disclosed that Edith Canadian was also seen breaking one of the school's windows and this statement is corroborated by the one furnished by William CROSS who also implicates Edith Canadian and Angeline DIABO.\n\nCaughnawaga, Que.,\nNovember 12th 1946.\n\nI, William CROSS, age 14 years, son of Louis CROSS, residing at Caughnawaga, Que., wish to make the following statement, willingly and knowing it to contain the whole truth:\n\nAt approximately 9.00 p.m. of October 31st 1946, I was walking down to Kirby's dance hall with Edith Canadian, Lorraine CANOE, Roland PERON, Stewart MYLOW and Angeline DIABO.\n\nAs we were walking down the road and passed near the girl's school, I saw Edith Canadian pick up a stone and throw it at the school and break a window. She immediately started to run away and we followed her. At the same time as Edith Canadian broke the window, I also saw Angeline DIABO pick up a stone and also break a window of the school.\n\nPersonally, I did not throw any stones at the school and I do not know of anyone else who broke any.\n\n(SGD) William CROSS.\n\n10. Edith Canadian who is implicated by CROSS and MYLOW was then contacted in this connection. This girl is fifteen years of age and daughter of Mrs. Cecelia Canadian. She furnished a statement admitting her guilt\n\n(P.T.O.)\nROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE\nHEADQUARTERS\n\nOTTAWA, Dec. 6, 1946.\n\nRe: Angeline DIABO et al,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\n\nAttached are copies of Caughnawaga Detachment reports in the above regard dated November 12th and 22nd, 1946.\n\n2.

The fire pump would be located in the Boiler House and would pump water from the St. Lawrence River, delivering it to the hydrants at a pressure of 100 pounds per square inch. The supply main would be laid below frost, adjoining the School trunk sewer line, in the excavation prepared in 1933 when the sewer was installed.\n\nWe have made a rough estimate of the cost of such an installation, and using equipment which meets the Fire Underwriters' requirements, we believe that this work could be carried out for approximately $15,000, which would include contingencies and supervision.\n\nWe will await instructions before proceeding with a layout, and should approval be given, it is felt that the outside work should be carried out under a separate contract.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ.

In view of an estimated ultimate capital cost of some $300,000.00 for this development, an expenditure of $15,000.00 for adequate fire protection would appear to be warranted. Mr. Mills' recommendations in this regard are concurred in.\n\nBefore proceeding with the preparation of detail and final plans for this proposed fire protection system, we would ask to be advised if it is your wish to have such a system installed.\n\nJ.M.

Please issue one and forward for payment and advise Mrs. Jacobs.\n\nEncl.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nTeachers' Residence,\nGaughnawaga, Dec. 9, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Doucet:\n\nWe have just received notice of the purchase of an electric stove for our residence. We believe it is thanks to a kind \"hint\" you must have given to the members of the Department. However we are grateful to the person responsible for this step.\n\nNo doubt you have been very busy since your visit to Gaughnawaga. We were hoping to hear from you concerning the purchase of a combined faucet for our kitchen sink, and for a small electric stove \"hot point\". May I take the liberty, Sir, of recalling the other subjects treated during your visit and inquire whether any decision has been taken by the Department concerning these?\n\na) a water softener\n\nb) some lumber or ten test for the separation we wish to make in our entrance.\n\nc) an oil cloth for our kitchen; here are the measures taken by Mr. Bush: 16 by 22\n\nd) the black felt paper and sheets of ten test for the covering of the floor of the second grade classroom located in Mrs. Jacobs' store is not needed now since Mr. Bush has changed the small furnace for the bigger one which was at the Bush School.\n\nWe have visited the classrooms quite often. The pupils seem to be very much interested in their school work and, in general, are attending school quite regularly. We have also\nvisited St. Isidore Road School every month. The teacher, Miss Bush, is doing fine work with the grades. We are much interested in the Nutrition contest launched by Dr. Moore. It should prove of great benefit to our Indian pupils.\n\nWith renewal thanks for past kindness and kind greetings to the members of the Department, we remain, kind Sir,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSr. Mary Albertine S.S.A.\nPrincipal\n\nMr. A.J. Doucet,\nTraining Division,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 18, 1946.\n\nMr. F. Brisebois, Indian Agent, Caughnawaga, P.Q.\n\nIn a letter of the 9th instant, the Principal of the Caughnawaga School refers to a temporary partition in the side entrance to their residence and a combination faucet for the kitchen sink. I believe that I discussed this with you during my last visit, however, I may be wrong about this. The point is that the Principal was to endeavour to obtain a kitchen faucet at an approximate cost of $10.00 and submit the voucher to this office for payment.\n\nAs regards the partition, I suggested that she obtain the necessary material and have the boys under the direction of Mr. Wescott construct this movable partition. Kindly let me have your opinion in this matter.\n\nWhat has happened to the two sinks that were to be installed in the bathroom and teacher's residence?\n\nWhat happened to my auto-knitter?\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nSupervisor, Training Division.\nOttawa, December 18, 1946.\n\nRev. Sister M. Albertus, Principal, Caughnawaga Indian Day School, Caughnawaga, P.Q.\n\nIn reply to your letter of December 9th, I had taken no action as far as the oilcloth for the kitchen is concerned as you will recall I had asked Mr. Bush to give me an accurate estimate of the amount required. This letter gives me the measurements as sixteen feet by twenty-two feet. I presume that this ignores the well \"that is the opening for stairway\". I will ascertain whether or not this linoleum can be purchased and I will let you know in the near future.\n\nWith regard to the ten test for a separation I was under the impression that we decided to make a kind of a movable partition at this spot and that Mr. Wescott was going to undertake this with a few of the boys. I believe, that I authorized the Agent to purchase the material and submit the vouchers to us for payment.\n\nThe \"A\" part of your letter - the water softener -. We have never received an analysis of the water. This is necessary before we can take any steps towards the purchase of this softener.\n\nI have been away on an extensive trip out West and have been unable to check the files to verify what has been done.\nI wish to thank you for the St. Catherine's parcels that you sent for the children. They certainly appreciated the candy.\n\nYours for better Indian education,\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nSupervisor, Training Division.\nAtt. Mr. Doucet.\n\nGaughnawaga, Que.\nDecember 26, 1946.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Dept., of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant dealing with a letter received from the Sister Superior of Gaughnawaga dealing with a temporary partition at the side entrance of their residence and a combination faucet for the kitchen sink.\n\nIn reply I wish to say that this matter was not discussed at your last visit but we discussed was the installation of two sinks, one large one for downstairs and a small one to be installed in the bedroom of the Principal. These have been ordered at Raymond Hardware over two months ago, but have not been delivered yet.

Lighting\n\nIt was felt that a good system of lighting should be installed in keeping with modern day practice with special attention being given to the classrooms weaving and sewing rooms, where the visual tasks involved are greater than elsewhere. The general classroom lighting was discussed fully and it was decided that this Service would prepare a cost analysis comparison between fluorescent and incandescent lighting systems for consideration before laying out the lighting in these areas. It was agreed that special blackboard lighting units should be installed in the classrooms in addition to the general lighting system.\n\n2. Signal System\n\nAfter discussing this matter it was decided that an automatic electrical signal system operating bells on each floor, and on the exterior wall of the school for the playground area, would provide adequate control for class movements. All bells in this system will be controlled from a clock located in the office which would be set to operate the bell system automatically in any time sequence desired.\n\n3. Electrical Equipment\n\nElectrical outlets for connections to apparatus such as electric ranges and other heating or motor loads necessary in the kitchen, weaving and sewing rooms was considered and it was agreed that this Service would supply the Indian Affairs Branch with a plan of these areas for the purpose of making an equipment layout for incorporation in our working drawings. We understand the Welfare and Training Division of Indian Affairs are concentrating attention on this matter at the moment.\n\nJ. M.

Telephones\n\nTelephone requirements were left in abeyance pending return to Ottawa of the officer of the Indian Affairs Branch, charged with this responsibility, at which times further consideration would be given this item.\n\n5. Clocks\n\nIt was felt that clocks located elsewhere than in the office would be unwarranted in view of the automatic signal system to be provided.\n\n6. Fire Alarm System\n\nIt was decided that an electric fire alarm system with two stations on each floor operating bells located in hallways was desirable. The suggestion was made that a mechanical system be installed as well but decision on this is pending further investigation.\n\n7. Plug Receptacles\n\nThis subject was dealt with in general and particularly in classrooms where special equipment is likely to be used.\n\nAny special items other than those mentioned in the above, that are foreseen by Indian Affairs in connection with apparatus for the school, should be brought to the attention of this Service at their earliest possible convenience.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nMR.

The plan of the kitchen has already been forwarded under cover of my memorandum of February 11th.\n\nWe would also like to direct your attention to the provision of an amplification system for use in radio school broadcasts of the C.B.C., school announcements, etc. The telephone connection is only necessary in the principal's office as there is already a telephone in the teachers' residence.\n\nRegarding the location of the new school, I understand that when Mr. Phelan, Mr. Doucet and Mr. Buck visited Caughnawaga on November 3rd, 1944, it was understood that a new school would not be erected on the old site but would be moved closer to the main road. We have not yet secured the additional plot of land in front of our present lot but we are endeavouring to purchase it. Even if we are not successful, our officials feel that there is no reason why the school could not be moved towards the front of our lot as previously agreed upon.\n\nDirector.\n| TAUX NO | C/C/A | LECTURE ACTUELLE PREVIOUS READING | CONSUMMATION CONSOMMATION CONSUMPTION | DEMANDE DEMAND | MONTANT BRUT GROSS AMOUNT | ESCOMPTE DISCOUNT | MONTANT NET NET AMOUNT |\n|---------|-------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------|---------------------------|-----------------|------------------------|\n|         |       |                                  |                                      |                |                           |                 |                        |\n\nTAXE DE VENTE F\u00c9D\u00c9RALE 8%\nFEDERAL SALES TAX\n\nTAXE DE VENTE PROVINCIALE 2%\nPROVINCIAL SALES TAX\n\nTOTAL 100\n\nIndian Affairs.

(b) Mr. Neary's reference to items drawn to the attention of Indian Affairs officers in our memorandum of February 15th is noted. We have been advised verbally by the Superintendent of Welfare and Training, Mr. Neary, that an analysis of cost between fluorescent and incandescent lighting systems will have to be required; since in discussions with Mr. Neary, a decision has been reached to install fluorescent fixtures. Mr. Neary has further advised that other items discussed by Indian Affairs Welfare and Training Officers, with our Mr. Kommer on January 24th last, and confirmed by our memorandum of February 15th have been adopted. Mr. Kommer of this office has been in touch with manufacturers of sound equipment, but is not likely to have any definite information on the cost of such equipment. With reference to Mr. Neary's remarks concerning the position of the school on the property, our Chief Architect recalls the discussion which took place on the site, between Mr. Phelan, Mr. Doucet and himself in November 1946.\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6082, file 305-5, part 15)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nIt was felt then that if two Indian properties on the highway, (between which a right of way 47'10\" wide, gives access to Crown lands) could be purchased, the new group of buildings could be planned to occupy land a fair distance north of the site of the destroyed school.\n\nAt that time the Indian Affairs Officers stated that it would be difficult if not impossible to obtain possession of the Indian properties and our architectural work was begun on the basis of restoration ourselves to the property, we knew was Crown Lands.\n\nUnder date of November 2nd 1945, copies of our drawing P1, Index 811 were forwarded to Indian Affairs, showing a building arrangement that we considered attractive, and economical to operate. A copy of that drawing is forwarded herewith.\n\nIt was not until recently, that Indian Affairs gave any definite indication that attempts would be made to obtain the Indian properties mentioned, and it now appears that efforts are being directed toward obtaining the western parcel only. Mr. Healy's memorandum gives no assurance that their efforts will be successful.\n\nA relatively small increase to the playground area would be possible if the westerly Indian property when surveyed shows a rectangular shape. The new building group could be moved northerly, but would place the easterly end of the new school immediately behind the dilapidated buildings to the east of the right of way. Considerable improvements to the layout of the school grounds would be effected if both properties could be made available, but in the event that no additional area can be made available, we cannot agree that any improvement would result from rearranging the layout which up to date has been the basis of establishing sewage and power lines and other mechanical services.\n\nMemo.(c)\n\nMr. Healy's reference to the interview between Messrs. Healy and Phelan with our Chief Architect, has been discussed since the date of your notation on the memorandum. In the interview, Mr. Healy's statement that working drawings for the school would be completed during March, was interpreted to indicate that tenders could be invited at that time. It has been pointed out verbally in the last few days, to the Indian Affairs officers concerned, that following the completion of working drawings, specifications must be prepared and stencilled, drawings must be printed and assembled, approved wage rates must be obtained, and that a number of other routine operations must be carried out before tenders can be invited by public advertisement.\n\nWe propose directing every effort toward completing our work on this project as soon as possible, but with our unreasonably small staff depleted by the recent resignations of Mr. Horwood and Mr. Barnes, we are no longer prepared to estimate dates within which phases of our work will be completed.\n\nChief Engineer,\n\nJ.J.

Dr. Moore's visit was most pleasant and encouraging for our teachers. At the present moment, Mr. Wescott, our inspector, is examining our pupils. You will soon receive his report which we hope will be most satisfactory to the Department.\n\nWe have several requests to present before you and the members of the Indian Affairs Branch, and it is with complete trust in your kind interest that we do it.\n\nMay we have three dozen individual desks, largest size, for next Sept. for our seventh grades? We did not put this order on our requisition as we hope to have them by Sept. by asking you directly for them.\n\nPrizes are given to our graduates in June. We have twelve this year. A money offering is usually given us by some of the graduates' parents, but this amount is far from covering the cost of prizes we like to give them. We also grant from six to ten prizes in each of the other twelve classes in our schools. Would the Department have the kindness to allow a certain amount to buy these prizes?\n\nOur third request is a big item. When Mr. Doucet visited us last Fall we asked him whether we could hope to have a new convent immediately after the building of our new school. Mr. Doucet assured us that a new residence could not be expected before five years at least and that\nmost likely some one from the Department would come at the end of this school year to estimate the amount of repairs to be done in our present home. We have taken the initiative, Mr. Phelan, and have asked the estimate of painting the outside of our residence and of the inside, ground floor only, for this year. We have asked for separate estimates of the different sections of our house, hoping these would be more satisfactory to the Department. We feel sure, dear Mr. Phelan, that you and your co-workers in Ottawa, admit the urgent need of these repairs, so we are hopeful that a generous authorization will be given soon to do the work requested. This timely treatment will prevent the residence from falling into greater decay and will certainly improve its appearance and add value to it.\n\nWe are much worried over the present increase in the price of building material; however you and Mr. Doucet and even kind Mr. Hoey gave us such a great assurance that our new school would begin this summer, that we are looking forward to a day in the near future when we shall see the work begin.\n\nWe thank you, kind Sir, in advance, for the courtesy with which you will attend to the above mentioned points.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSr. Mary Albertine\nPrincipal\nOttawa, May 26th, 1947.\n\nMr. Frs. Brisebois, Indian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\n\nSister Superior of the Caughnawaga R.C.\nSchool has written to us with reference to painting\nsome of the buildings.\n\nWe are prepared to submit for the Minister's\napproval, the expenditure that might be required to\npaint the interior and exterior of the main building\nand also the woodwork. The Sister Superior has for-\nwarded two estimates to us, which are attached to this\nletter.\n\nPlease let me know which you recommend we\naccept. Possibly you know some other painter. If his\nwork is satisfactory, we would prefer to give the\nwork to the Indian who has given the quotation. We\nare not prepared to consider painting the barn and\nout-buildings at the back of the lot.\n\nYou may inform the Sister Superior that we\nare ordering the thirty-six desks.\n\nBernard E.

At the present time it is impossible to assure the Department whether the same religious teachers who are teaching here actually will be stationed again in Caughnawaga, next September. The assignments for the next school year are received from our Reverend Superior General at the end of July. We shall then be able to give you definitely the names of the religious teachers who will be in Caugh. for the next school term. May we delay till the end of July to send in these applications or does the Department prefer we should fill them out now regardless of the fact that there might be a few changes in our staff during the coming summer vacation?\n\nThe Indian Bulletins have interested us very much this year. We find them instructive and enlightening. We highly appreciate the new salary scale and wish to express our deep gratitude immediately to the Department for this beneficent increase.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan, may we expect a favorable reply to our letter of the 15th ult.?

Our teachers have left the Reserve for their retreat and for summer courses; it would be the ideal time to have at least the painting of the inside done.\n\nWe shall be most grateful to you, Sir, for this kindness. Our teachers were most pleased also to have made your acquaintance though it was on the last school day. We hope to have the pleasure of receiving you in our schools next year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSisters of St. Ann.\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nMr. Bernard F.

At that time the taxi driver was only going to one place, that is from the Village to Reserve Lot 325. A while after an Indian family purchased Reserve Lot No. 261 and as there are no school there but that it is in the Bush Rd., area we had to have their children transported, which meant that the route had to be extended from Reserve Lot no. 225 to 261-A-.\n\nLater on the parents of pupils living on Chateauguay Basin Road up to Reserve lot no. 122 D and the same applied to the pupils living along the Chateauguay-Melone Highway as far as Reserve Lot 157. The additional mileage incurred means that the original mileage has been tripled but it also means that every Indian child living outside of the Village proper is well taken care of and that all roads are now covered. The only road not deserved by school transportation is that of St. Isidore but the children are attending the St. Isidore Road School which is opened and under Miss Descotesux. It is hoped that the above will meet with your approval. None of the parents can now claim that there is discrimination in the transportation of the pupils attending the Village Schools.\n\n(Frs.

He advises me that in a very short time contractors will be requested to submit tenders on the construction of the new twelve-room day school plan for this reserve. It is necessary that an assured source of water supply be provided for contractor's purposes. Can you please advise me whether it would be possible to take the following action:\n\n(a) to remove the buried fuel tank,\n\n(b) to clean out the old well by having a pump put on it and having it pumped out for at least a week.\n\nThese results could then be checked and we could be advised if the flow is strong enough for the purposes required.\n\nUnless this is done, it may be necessary for contractors to seek a source of supply of water elsewhere, and this is likely to be a costly process. If you have any difficulty determining the flow of water, we can arrange to have an engineer come to Caughnawaga to check the flow.\n\nIt is suggested that one of two methods be considered for the above project, namely by the use of Indian labour or by contract. We will expect to hear further from you concerning the points raised in this letter.\n\nBernard F.

Before the fire, it had become evident, that the tank had corroded badly and had permitted the surrounding subsoil to become saturated with fuel oil, which was finding its way into the well, fouling the water supply. Any water drawn from a school faucet showed oil, and was unfit for domestic use.\n\nIn considering a source of water supply for construction purposes, our Chief Architect felt that it would be desirable to investigate the existing well, (in disuse for seven years) as a source of supply, rather than authorize the contractor to pump water from the St. Lawrence River, and the matter was discussed with Col. Neary by Mr. Buck. It was thought the well could have sufficient volume, and there was no evidence of oil, it would at least serve the contractor's purposes, and might possibly be satisfactory for use in the new school. Col. Neary concurred, and requested Indian Agent Brisebois at Caughsawage to contact a firm who would supply an estimate for having the well shaft cleaned out, and a pumping test put on. Mr. Brisebois has now replied, and most of his letter has been quoted by Mr. Hoey in his memorandum.\n\nWhen Mr. Brisebois furnishes Indian Affairs with a tender, it will be considered and you will be advised.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nR.A.

Original on file 103-5.\n\nYou will recall that some time last year we authorized the installation of two wash basins at the Caughnawaga teacher's residence. The basins were purchased but it has been impossible to secure plumbers to install them, due principally to the shortage of galvanized pipe. While at Caughnawaga I interviewed two plumbers who are ready to undertake the job beginning on Monday or Tuesday of next week. They estimate the cost of installation, supplying all material that is at present lacking, for the sum of approximately $125.00. You know that there are 16 persons in this residence and this would be a very necessary installation. I would therefore strongly recommend that Mr. Brisebois be notified immediately if you should decide to have this installation carried on. This would permit the agent to authorize this while the men are available.\nOttawa, March 24, 1948.\n\nMr. Frs. Brisebois, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Caughnawaga, P.Q.\n\nMr. Doucet advises that on the occasion of his recent visit to Caughnawaga he arranged for installation of two additional wash basins in the Caughnawaga R.C. teachers' residence.\n\nIt is understood that the cost of the installation including all material at present lacking, will be in the neighborhood of $125.00. You may arrange to have the necessary work done.\n\nBernard F.

Beauvais, a Caughnawaga Indian electrical contractor has received attention, and you are advised that Mr. Beauvais contacted our Chief Architect by telephone and was advised that since tenders are being accepted from general contractors only, a tender to this office for the electrical work would serve no purpose.\n\nMr. Beauvais was informed that as soon as tenders for the school were analyzed, he would be advised of the successful general contractor, with whom he could discuss his own trade tender.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nR.A.

As stated in your letter instructions were received from the Lands and Development Services Branch as to the manner in which the pumping of the water etc., was to be carried out. In connection with this work I beg to report as follows:\n\nThe well in question was located inside the destroyed building, in the boiler room, 9 feet below the ground level and only fifteen feet from the site where the old oil tank seeped (500 gallons of oil went into the ground when it pierced).\n\nWhen the contractor came to start the pumping it was found out that the five inches pipe of the well was tightly blocked with mortar, bricks and other debris. An attempt was made to clear same but to no avail. Moreover an heavy coat of oil could be seen on top of the water.\n\nOwing to the condition of the well and the impossibility to clear the debris, the work was ordered discontinued and the following suggestion made.\n\nThat a new well be drilled nearer the site of the proposed building where we would be assured that the water would be good for drinking purposes which well would not cost more than $400.00 or $450.00 and would no doubt be sufficient for the use of the contractor.\n\nBy........\nBy doing so we would be sure that the amount authorized of $255.00 would not be spent for nothing, as it is much doubted that even if the old well could be pumped out that its water could be used. It would also save the ditching from the present site of the old well to the new site of the new school, in order to take the water there.\n\nIf this suggestion is accepted a well could be drilled immediately and be ready when the work of the new building commences.\n\nIt would be appreciated if this could be taken up with Mr. Mills, Chief Engineer, Lands & Development Services, Dept., of Mines and Resources. May I say that the Contractors, Jean Bedard Ltd., are of the above opinion.\n\n(Fr.s.

That branch is not, therefore, at liberty to divulge the name of the lowest tenderer or the successful tenderer, until the Order in Council is passed.\n\nI have been informed, however, that just as soon as the Order in Council is passed the name of the contractor will be given to you and you may inform Mr. Beauvais so that he may get in touch with him.

The quotation for labour appears high and after careful consideration of the contents of your letter, it has been decided to defer action on this matter until one of our Officials of this Division has an opportunity of visiting Caughnawaga.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nPP/HM.\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on 22 April 1948\n\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 14th April, 1948, from the Acting Minister of Mines and Resources, stating:\n\nThat in the 1948-49 estimates of the Indian Affairs Branch of the Department of Mines and Resources, funds have been provided for the construction of contract, at the Caughnawaga Indian Agency, in the Province of Quebec, of\u2014\n\n(a) A twelve-roomed Day School of fireproof construction and\n\n(b) A Boiler House of fireproof construction.\n\nThat tenders were invited for construction on the basis of drawings, specifications and other tendering data prepared by the Department, through the medium of public advertisement in newspapers serving the area;\n\nThat bona-fide lump sum tenders for the two buildings were received from two firms of general contractors, details of which were as follows:\n\n| Name and Address of Contractor | Tender price for School | Tender price for Boiler House | Total Amount of Tender |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| A.F. Byers Construction Co. Ltd., 5675 Western Avenue, Montreal, Quebec. | $252,461.00 | $30,900.00 | $283,361.00 |\n| Alphonse Gratton Inc., 3440 Shuter St., Montreal, Quebec. | $270,200.00 | $36,100.00 | $306,300.00 |\n\nThat both tenders were analyzed and found to be in accordance with the drawings, specifications and other tendering documents prepared by the Department, and that each was accompanied by a security deposit in the amount of ten per cent (10%) of the tender price, being in the form of a marked cheque drawn in favour of the Receiver General of Canada;\n\nThat the acceptance of the lowest tender, namely that submitted by the A.F. Byers Construction Co. Ltd., would involve, after making provision for contingencies and supervision, an expenditure of $333,000.\n\nThe Committee, therefore, on the recommendation of the Acting Minister of Mines and Resources, advise that authority be granted to accept the tender furnished by the A.F. Byers Construction Co. Ltd., of Montreal, and to enter into a contract with them for the erection of the twelve-roomed school and boiler house,\n\nThe Honourable,\nthe Minister of Mines and Resources,\nin accordance with the hereinbefore mentioned drawings, specifications and tendering documents, prepared by the Department, and the Contractor's tender dated March 30th, 1948, in the amount of $283,361, which with provision for contingencies and supervision will entail a total expenditure to the approximate amount of $333,000; the said expenditure to be met from funds provided in the 1948-49 estimates of the Indian Affairs Branch, under Vote 218 (Indian Education) of the Department of Mines and Resources.\n\n(Sgd.) A.D.P. Heesey\nClerk of the Privy Council.\nCopy - Mr. Hoey\n\nOttawa, April 28, 1948.\n\nMr. Mills\n\nI am sending you herewith a copy of an Order-in-Council P.C. 1754, dated the 2nd instant, authorizing the Minister to accept the tender of A.F. Byers Construction Company Limited of Montreal, and to enter into a contract with them for the erection of a twelve-room school and boiler house.\n\nDirector.\nRe: Water Supply and Fire Protection, Twelve-roomed School, Caughnawaga Indian Agency, Quebec.\n\nIn order to obtain material for a reply to your memorandum of April 12th last, an officer of this Division made an investigation on the site on the 14th instant, with a view to securing additional data relative to the acquisition by Indian Affairs of additional property, the water supply and fire protection for the school.\n\nCollaborating with our officer, Mr. G.R. Rankin, were Mr. G.H. Edgcumbe of the Dominion Health and Welfare Department in Montreal, and Messrs. Caley and Owen of the Geological Survey Division of this Department. The precis of our officer's report follows.\n\nLAND -\n\nWe are given to understand that Lot 100 in the Village may be obtained. This is the lot on which it is desired eventually to build the proposed Teachers' Residence and is adequate for the purpose. Lots 83 and 84 to the east of the site entrance can not be obtained in the immediate future and will be the concern of the Indian Affairs Branch. These lots would give additional frontage, but are not required at present. Every effort possible however should be directed by Indian Affairs toward acquiring the property as soon as possible, with a view to improving the appearance of the area, and to justify its selection as the site of the new and costly building.\n\nWATER SUPPLY -\n\nAn inspection was made of four drilled wells in the vicinity and of the old well on the site. Information was also obtained from Mr. Joseph Laberge who has drilled practically all the wells in these parts. Mr. Laberge is well known to contracting firms in Montreal, and his information is considered reliable. Rock stratum is encountered from ten feet to twelve feet below the surface, and the wells then drilled through solid rock. The wells inspected were fifty, fifty-two, fifty-eight and sixty feet deep, which appeared to be the approximate average drilled depth for public wells provided for the Indian families in the Village. The old well on the school site is 100'-0\" deep, and it must be assumed that a new well would at least reach this depth, since a much greater volume is required than for public wells mentioned.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nWATER SUPPLY (Cont'd)\n\nThe best information available on the assumed capacity of a well 100 feet deep on the site is 1,000 gallons per hour for a five inch well and 3,000 to 4,000 gallons per hour for an eight inch well. Our specifications call for delivery of 540 gallons of water per hours, and unless this rate of flow is obtained from a five inch well the bore should be enlarged to eight inches. Until the well is drilled and given a seventy-two hour test and the draw-down level ascertained, no positive information will be available. The possibility exists that the well may have to be bored deeper, or a new location chosen and the process repeated until the available visible volume is adequate for our purposes. It is not thought, however, that this will be the case.\n\nThe possibility of oil from the old well impregnating the new supply is negligible. While the existence of oil in the well shaft is still visible, it is felt that since the desired position of the new well would be higher, and 180 feet northwest of the old well, that if the bottom of the well casing is cemented to the solid rock, no penetration of oil from the latter will be possible.\n\nThe matter of obtaining potable water from Lake St. Louis was investigated, including a discussion with the Montreal Water Works Department. Information gathered indicated that the raw sewage and industrial wastes from plants situated along the south shore of the St. Lawrence River, the Chateauguay River and surrounding Lake St. Louis, make the treatment of such water for a project as small as the new school, so elaborate and expensive to operate and maintain with expert staff, that it is not being considered.\n\nMr. Edgecombe took seven samples of water for analysis, and confirmation of the above. Mr. Caley examined the site and was shown our proposed location for the new well. The location of the new well (to be located in a projection of the new boiler house) is shown on our revised plan index number 600, sheet W.1, dated May 20, 1947; blueprints of which have previously been sent to the Indian Affairs Branch. Mr. Caley stated that he would submit a separate report on his own observations to this Branch as soon as possible.\n\nFIRE PROTECTION -\n\nIt was not understood previously that the Caughnawaga Agency has an arrangement with the City of Lachine Fire Department to answer calls to the Reserve. In view of this, it is felt that the costly undertaking of constructing a pipe line and intake to Lake St. Louis might not be necessary as Lachine is approximately only four miles distant, and the fire brigade can arrive at the site of the school in about fifteen minutes.\n\nOne serious difficulty in utilizing fire hose within the school building is that fire fighting would depend almost entirely on the female staff and pupils. Control of pupils in such an emergency has been described by Indian Superintendent Brisebois as an impossibility.\n\nThere is little that is combustible in the school and the boiler house, and the use of conveniently placed fire extinguishers of an approved type should control a fire until the fire brigade arrive. Fire extinguishers moreover in sufficient numbers can be handled by the female staff. The stand pipes and hose within the school have outside connection, to which the firemen may connect their fire hose, which would be\nlaid to Lake St. Louis, a distance of some 460 feet. Through their pumper, water streams can be employed in the number and at the pressure required.\n\nThe alternative, of course, would be to construct an underground reservoir of say 10,000 gallons capacity to be served from the new well and equipped with a fire pump and in a separate pump house. This would mean constant employment of men able to, and available to put the pump in use and operate the hose within the school for the time required for the arrival of the Lachine fire equipment, or for the twenty or thirty minutes required to exhaust the contents of the reservoir. This alternative is not recommended, and unless requested, we are not estimating the cost of construction.\n\nSumming up, the cost of providing a water supply for domestic purposes from a deep well cased to solid rock would be as follows: For drilling a five inch well, the cost would be $4.50 per foot, and for an eight inch well $8.00 per foot. For every foot beyond one hundred feet in depth, the additional cost would be $1.00. For supplying and installing steel casing for a five inch well, the cost would be $1.10 per foot. In addition to drilling the well a seventy-two hour test should be undertaken to ascertain: (a) the capacity in gallons per hour; (b) the quality of the water; (c) that the supply would be adequate for a long period. This type of work is undertaken throughout Canada by the Railway and Power Corporation Limited of Montreal whose charge would be $300.00 for the complete testing operation. The total cost, therefore, on our assumption that water would be obtained at one hundred feet, would be about $350.00 for a five inch well.\n\nIt is recommended, therefore, that we be authorized to have the drilling and casing of a five inch well, one hundred feet deep undertaken by Joseph Laberge, and if water is found at that level, to have the before-mentioned test carried out by Railway and Power Corporation Limited. The work to be under the supervision of Indian Superintendent Brisebois, who would be furnished with all necessary instructions from this office.\n\nThe cost of pumps and other water supply equipment is already included in the contract being awarded, and the cost of other material and services recommended herein can be met from the contingencies amount we have requested from Council.\n\nChief Engineer.\nOttawa, April 30, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS & DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH\n\nRe: Caughnawaga Indian Day School.\n\nAttached is a letter which has been forwarded to this office from the Deputy Minister's office.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP/MGD\nOttawa, April 30, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS & DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH\n\nRe: Water Supply and Fire Protection, Twelve-roomed School, Caughnawage Indian Agency, Quebec.\n\nWe have your memorandum of April 28th in connection with the above.\n\nWe approve of the action recommended by Mr. Mills, namely that you arrange the drilling and casing of a five inch well, one hundred feet deep and that the work be undertaken by Joseph Laberge.

Co\" have examined them and upon our request have sent us estimates of the cleaning and repairs which must be done to them. By looking over the enclosed estimate you will notice that they have made two of them, the second one being half the price of the first and without the two cylinders and pieces which would need to be exchanged.\n\nFor the past few years we have asked for a typewriter on our requisition. We would certainly need a second one for our residence. Very often we are obliged to bring the typewriter from one of the schools to do our work at the teachers' residence over the week end.\n\nWill the Department kindly give consideration to this need of ours, and give us permission to purchase the Underwood priced at One Hundred Dollars. We are not very much interested in the portable one.\n\nWe wish to thank you, Sir, for allowing us Fifteen Dollars for the purchase of second hand library books from our consent in Rigaud.\n\nThanking you once more for all past courtesy, we remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nOttawa.\nCaughnawaga, Que.,\nMay 22, 1948.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Dept., of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI wish to enclose herewith the original of a letter remitted here by the Principal of the R.C. Schools, together with an estimate dealing with the repairing of three typewriters used at their Schools.\n\nThis estimate as will be seen have been obtained by the Principal from the Provinciale Dactylographie Regd, 115 east, Laurier st., Montreal.\n\nWill you please be kind enough to inform if this can be authorized so that the Sister be informed accordingly.\n\n(Frs. Brisebois)\nSupp., Indian Agency.\nMay 15, 1948.\n\nMr. Frs. Brisebois, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Caughnawaga, P.Q.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the\n12th instant, the Department approves an expend-\niture of $90.00 for repairing the three typewriters\nat the Caughnawaga R.C. School.\n\nIt is noted that for this amount the\nmachines will be completely repaired and new\ncylinders will be provided.\n\nAt the present time we are not in a\nposition to authorize the purchase of a fourth\ntypewriter.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDear Sir:\n\nYour reply to our letter of the 20th ult. brought us quite a disappointment. The Department wishes to defer the painting and repairing on the second floor of the Teachers' Residence until some member of your staff has come to visit the place. Mr. Doucet has already seen the poor conditions of the rooms during one of his last visits; we stated this before. Moreover the fact that no repairing of any kind has been done for the past eighteen years in all the rooms of the second floor should be sufficient to explain the great need there is of painting. However, Sir, we do not wish to make any pressure but simply restate the need of painting in the rooms of the second floor of our residence. Did you find Mr. Sailor's estimate too high?\n\nKindly be at ease to give us an unfavorable reply should the Department still wish to defer this work to a later date.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nMay 17, 1948.\n\nMr. Frs. Brisebois, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Caughnawaga, P.Q.\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of April 21st and our reply of April 28th with reference to painting the upper storeys of the Caughnawaga R.C. teachers' residence. We have received another letter from the Sister Superior urging that favourable consideration be given to the request. On reviewing the quotation from Louis Saylor it reads as follows:\n\n(a) Price for labour only $511.00\n\n(b) Price for labour and materials $671.00\n\nFor material costing $160.00, Mr. Saylor expects $511.00 for labour. It is realized that there are a large number of rooms to be painted but the price for labour appears high.\n\nPossibly you could interview Saylor again and ascertain if he would not do the work at a more reasonable cost. If you are submitting a lower tender from him you should attach a requisition for the paint that is needed.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\n| Description | Quantity | Unit | Price |\n|-------------|----------|------|-------|\n| Lin. ft. 2x2 Spruce D3S Fl | 432 | | 144' |\n\nMANUFACTURERS & EXPORTERS OF HARDWOOD FLOORING\n\nIndian Affairs.

F. Neary, of the Indian Affairs Branch, and Mr. V. Hoey, of this Division, the question of providing an automatic alarm at the Lachine Fire Station, in case of a fire at the above school was discussed. Mr. Neary was of the opinion that a system such as we proposed, which would summon fire fighting equipment with a minimum loss of time, should be adopted.\n\nProvision has been made for the installation of two siamese water pipe connections at the school, to which the Lachine Fire Department's water pumping equipment could be connected, to feed the fire standpipe within the building in the event of a fire. We consider it advisable to connect the electric fire alarm system provided for the school to the Lachine Fire Station alarm call board, so that in the event of the sounding of the fire alarm system at the school, fire fighting equipment would be automatically summoned, thus removing the possibility of delay which could result from relying on telephone contact between the school and fire station.\n\nConnections between the school and the Lachine Fire Department Station should be arranged for through the Bell Telephone Company, and it is suggested that the Indian Affairs Branch contact the Lachine Fire Chief and the Montreal office of the Bell Telephone Company in the near future to arrange for such a service.\n\nIt will be necessary for the Bell Telephone Company to carry their telephone lines to the building for the telephone to be located in the Principal's office, and we suggest that Indian Affairs make application for the telephone service at the same time enquiries are directed in connection with the fire alarm system.\n\nEarly attention is recommended in this matter, so that the contractor can be advised of the conduit runs he will be required to provide in the floor slab during the building construction for the telephone service and for the fire alarm connections if the Indian Affairs Branch approve of this suggestion.\n\nT.

The Gurney Foundry Co., Ltd., do not make them any longer. This boiler was made about thirty years ago.\n\nMay I say however that a base of fire bricks could be installed to replace the corroded steel one. This would be satisfactory for at least two or three years and its cost, including materials and labour, would be of approximately $75.00.\n\nPlease authorize the above at your earliest convenience. Said work could be made on a weekend and would not inconvenience the teaching staff nor the pupils.\n\n(Frs. Brisebois)\nSupt., Indian Agency.\nOctober 21, 1948.\n\nMr. Frs.

The electrical maintenance would consist largely of replacing fluorescent tubes and making occasional adjustments to the controls on the heating and ventilating systems.\n\nChief Engineer.\nNovember 19, 1948.\n\nMr. F.

We have now received from the Lands and Development Services Branch an outline of the various mechanical equipments with which this school will be provided.\n\nYou will find their memorandum attached hereto.

As you are probably aware, it will be necessary to have a Civil Service Commission position established if the salary is in excess of $400.00 a year.

At that time it was suggested that an official letter be sent to you concerning the points raised at this meeting.\n\nOur proposal is that in the school there be installed an alarm which would be connected with your fire station at Lachine. Then, in the event of a fire at the school, a signal would automatically be sent, registering on your alarm board and thus calling your equipment. We are quite prepared to accept the fact that your Fire Chief would have to decide at that time whether he could despatch equipment without interfering with other fire fighting being engaged in by his department. In other words, we appreciate the fact that our requirements would be secondary to those in Lachine.\n\nIn view of the facts presented above, I would like to hear from you as to whether such a system could be installed in your fire station connecting it with our new Caughnawaga Indian Day School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOttawa, February 21, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH.\n\nCaughnawaga Eastern (R.C.) Indian Day School.\n\nCaughnawaga United Church Indian Day School.\n\nAs soon as the new Caughnawaga R.C. Day School is completed, it is our intention to move to it all the children from the Caughnawaga Eastern School.\n\nThe following action will then be taken:\n\n1. The Caughnawaga Eastern R.C. School will become the Caughnawaga United Church Day School.\n\n2. The present Caughnawaga U.C. Day School will be converted for use as a teachers' residence for the U.C. teachers.\n\nIt will be necessary to have the following repairs completed before September 1, 1949, in order to accomplish the above changes:\n\nCaughnawaga Eastern School:\n\n1. Carry out repairs to heating system.\n2. Rebuild porches and steps.\n3. Paint interior and exterior.\n\nCaughnawaga U.C. School:\n\n1. The installation of plumbing for the kitchen.\n2. The erection of bedroom and living room partitions.\n\n..... I would\nI would therefore request that one of your engineers visit these schools on a future inspection trip to Caughnawaga and prepare the plans and specifications necessary for the above plumbing and heating alterations.

At that time, it was suggested that an official letter be sent to you concerning the points raised at the meeting.\n\nAs you are aware, the Lachine Fire Department has in the past offered all assistance possible in providing fire fighting facilities for the Caughnawaga Indian Agency. When requested to do so. In connection with the fire protection at the school, we have provided two (2) Siamese connections at the front of the school of suitable thread and design for connecting to the Lachine Fire Department's pumper. A two inch (2\") line is run from each Siamese connection each feeding one vertical standpipe servicing one hose cabinet on each of the three floors. The two 2\" vertical standpipes are inter-connected so that one pumper at either Siamese connection may be used to supply water to the six (6) hose cabinets. We have provided an electric fire alarm system with two (2) \"break glass\" fire alarm stations in the corridors of the 3rd floor and our proposal is to connect this system with the fire alarm panel in the Lachine Fire Station so that in the event of fire an alarm will automatically be sounded when the school circuit is energized indicating the need for fire fighting equipment. It is our feeling that all possibility of delay in transmitting the call should be eliminated as far as possible, and in our opinion, the method proposed is a reliable means of accomplishing this end.\n\nWe are quite prepared to accept the fact that your Fire Chief would have to decide at the time of receiving an alarm if the equipment and personnel is available to send to the Caughnawaga school. In other words, we appreciate the fact that our requirements will be secondary to those of the City of Lachine.\n\nIn view of the facts presented above, I would like to hear from you as to whether the City of Lachine authorities would be agreeable to having the necessary equipment installed in the Fire Station to provide this service, the costs of which would be entirely borne by the Department.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

We have today received a letter from our Indian Superintendent, Mr. F. Brisebois, with regard to the electrical system at the Caughnawaga Eastern School. He has just received a defective installation report from the Board of Examiners of Electricians, Province of Quebec, in connection with this school. It was necessary to call the Inspector of the Board of Examiners to this building after a minor fire broke out, due to defective wiring. Therefore, it would be appreciated if, in addition to the plumbing and heating specifications, you would also have an engineer prepare similar drawings covering a renovated electrical system.\n\nIt has been drawn to our attention also that the sanitary arrangements in this school will have to be investigated by an engineer at the same time that plumbing specifications are prepared. It is our intention to provide flush toilets at this school and I would suggest that the engineer detailed for this work call first on our Superintendent of Education so that further particulars in this regard can be provided.\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

1949.\n\nRe: 12-Room Indian Day School, Caughnawaga, Dormitory Block, Wabasca Indian School.\n\nThe sum of $330,000.00 was provided in the 1948-49 appropriations for the construction of a twelve room Indian Day School at Caughnawaga, boiler house included, of which $200,000.00 was transferred to our Division. We will require an additional amount ranging from $3,000.00 to $30,000.00 and will have the exact figure within a week from now. In the meantime it is necessary that Indian Affairs Branch be informed that our maximum total requirements in any event will be no more than $230,000.00 during the current fiscal season which will leave $100,000.00 of the original $330,000.00 for use elsewhere.\n\nThe Bond Construction Company Limited, contractors for the Wabasca Dormitory Block, estimate that their progress claims to March 31, 1949, will total $105,000.00 for the Dormitory Block alone. We have received $25,000.00 from the Indian Affairs Branch to date for this work and will require an additional $80,000.00 in the current fiscal season. We suggest that transfer of funds not required for the Caughnawaga project could be transferred to the Wabasca project.\n\nIt is essential that we be informed at an early date if the $80,000.00 we require for Wabasca will be made available in time to make the necessary payments to the contractor in the current fiscal season.\n\nR.A.

Kennedy, reading as follows:\n\n\"Since the heating unit in the present United Church school will have to be changed; and since our Board of Home Missions must renew the heating unit in the church building this year; and since the heating unit in the minister's residence must be replaced within two to five years, therefore, we feel that there might be some way in which your Department and our Board of Home Missions could cooperate in installing a central heating unit for the three buildings.\n\n\"This suggestion is feasible due to the short distance between the buildings.\n\n\"As you know, it is less expensive to heat three buildings from one central unit than from three...\"\nunits. The cost of operation to your Department, to the church, and to the house could be determined quite easily from the cubic content of each building.\n\n\"If this suggestion is of interest to you, we would be pleased to have a qualified and reliable heating engineer inspect the three buildings and recommend the type of heating unit which would provide the most efficiency with the least cost. By the time this would be done, Dr. Dorsey should have returned to Toronto and details of installation cost could be arranged between yourself and him.\"\n\nWhen your engineer visits this school, we would appreciate his comments concerning the feasibility of Mr. Kennedy's suggestions.\n\nDirector.\nMr. J. Stanley Kennedy,\nP. O. Box 263,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of March 8 has been the subject of recent discussions between our Engineers and this Division. As you are probably aware, one of our Engineers will shortly be visiting Caughnawaga to go over the plans proposed for the alteration of the Caughnawaga Eastern School. At that time he will discuss with you the feasibility of the plan proposed in your letter.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

The prices shown are subject to recent price changes not furnished to this Division and include sales tax of 5%, equipment f.o.b. Weston.\n\n1. One only model 85 Moffat range with 2-1600 watt and 2-1200 watt boiling plates, 230 volts, single phase, 60 cycle otherwise as included under price List No. 29 in the amount of $370.00 less Department discount of 10% and 10%. Price to the Department, .................. $299.70\n\n2. Ten only standard counter model H-13-1 hot plate with one 1200 watt boiling plate, 115 volt, single phase, 60 cycle otherwise as included under the price list No. 29 in the amount of $18.00 each; less Department discount of 10% and 10%. Price to the Department, .................. $145.00\n\nWe suggest that the orders for the above equipment be placed as soon as possible and a request for earliest possible delivery be made on the above items especially on the ten hot plates, as they must be mounted on the food preparation counter. At the time of ordering, we recommend that hot plate shop drawings be requested and sent to (this Division) so they can be forwarded to the general contractor in order that provision can be made for mounting and connecting up the units prior to delivery, thus eliminating the possibility of delay in fabrication of the food preparation counter.\n\nR.A.

We attach hereto for the information of the Purchasing Agent their specification of equipment to be supplied, which we request be returned.\n\nThe cost of the equipment in the amount of $1,390.45 includes Dominion Government Sales Tax of eight per cent (8%) and if this tax is deductible for this type of equipment when used for school purposes, the cost to the Department would amount to $1,279.21 f.o.b. Montreal. We suggest that the Purchasing Agent investigate the possibility of deducting the above tax. In addition to the cost of the equipment an expenditure of $160.00 will be necessary for installation and testing, making the total installed cost to the Department of the sound distribution system $1,459.21 f.o.b. Montreal.\n\nThe equipment offered by the above firm is, in our opinion, suitable to requirements and the price is fair and reasonable. It would appear therefore satisfactory if the Indian Affairs Branch accept this tender and issue a Purchase Order as soon as possible.\n\nChas. H.

Q.\n\nCher monsieur le D\u00e9put\u00e9:\n\nPermettez-moi cette d\u00e9marche au nom des familles de Canadiens-Fran\u00e7ais et Anglais qui r\u00e9sident actuellement sur la R\u00e9serve indienne, tol\u00e9r\u00e9s qu'ils y sont par le \"D\u00e9partement\", \u00e0 cause de la crise du logement qui s\u00e9vit encore, h\u00e9las!\n\nOn me dit que dans ces familles il y a bien au-del\u00e0 de 75 enfants d'\u00e2ge scolaire. Vous voyez d\u00e9j\u00e0 le probl\u00e8me, puisqu'ces enfants ne sont pas admis dans les \u00e9coles indiennes locales.\n\nLe Gouvernement Provincial veut bien faire sa part en procurant le transport gratuit de ces enfants aux \u00e9coles situ\u00e9es en dehors de la r\u00e9serve, et m\u00eame, en se montrant pr\u00eat \u00e0 payer des institutrices pour ces enfants s'il y avait lieu.\n\nMais ici se pose un second probl\u00e8me: Quelle municipalit\u00e9 va les prendre dans ses \u00e9coles?\n\nVille La Salle n'accepte que ceux qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 commenc\u00e9 l\u00e0 depuis au moins trois ans. Lachine est pr\u00eate \u00e0 en accepter un certain nombre, moyennant le prix de $4.00 par mois, ce qui est au-del\u00e0 des moyens de la plupart des familles, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement nombreuses et peu fortun\u00e9es. Il y a aussi la paroisse de la C\u00f4te Ste-Catherine; mais leur \u00e9cole actuelle est trop petite et leur nouvelle \u00e9cole n'ouvrira pas avant janvier.\n\nLa seule solution serait de pouvoir ouvrir une \u00e9cole pour des enfants ici m\u00eame sur la r\u00e9serve, si un local pouvait \u00eatre trouv\u00e9 et si une sorte de Commission Scolaire pouvait \u00eatre form\u00e9e pour la dur\u00e9e du cas d'urgence.\nJe laisse toutefois \u00e0 votre initiative, tout en promettant mon appui \u00e0 vos sages mesures, de trouver la meilleure solution \u00e0 ce probl\u00e8me important pour l'avenir de ces enfants, dont un bon nombre ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9pass\u00e9 l'\u00e2ge de 8 et 9 ans sans avoir encore eu les moyens d'aller \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole, ni d'\u00eatre initi\u00e9s aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la religion. Un homme sans instruction, et surtout sans religion, tous l'admettent, est non seulement tr\u00e8s incomplet, mais peut devenir un citoyen dangereux pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et un chr\u00e9tien expos\u00e9 \u00e0 manquer sa destin\u00e9e \u00e9ternelle...\n\nConfiant que vous donnerez \u00e0 ce probl\u00e8me l'attention qu'il m\u00e9rite et que Dieu vous aidera \u00e0 lui trouver la solution la plus avantageuse pour tous, je demeure,\n\nVotre tr\u00e8s oblig\u00e9,\n\nReal Lalonde, S.J.\n\nCure de Caughnawaga.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nAugust 11, 1949.\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER:\n\nAttention - Director of Indian Affairs\n\nI am attaching hereto a letter dated July 19th from Father Real Lalonde, S.J. of the Saint-Francois-Xavier Mission in Caughnawaga, to Mr. D.E. Black, M.P. It concerns schooling for those English and French Canadians who live in the Indian Reserve and for whom there is no school nearby. As certain of the villages do not wish to provide education without obtaining school taxes and grants, he suggests that a school should be opened on the Reserve.\n\nWould you please investigate this suggestion and prepare a reply to Mr. Black for the Private Secretary's signature in the absence of the Minister.\n\nMr. MacKay\nFor attention and draft reply as requested.\n\nAug. 12 - 9.30\n\nJ.G. Levy,\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, August 16, 1949.\n\nDonald E. Black, Esq., M.P.,\nAubrey, P.C.\n\nDear Mr. Black:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your recent letter concerning the establishment of a provincial day school on the Caughnawaga Indian Reserve, near Lachine, P.Q. I am returning the letter which you forwarded from the Reverend Father R. Lalonde, S.J.\n\nBefore proceeding with the suggestion made concerning the building of a local or provincial school on an Indian reserve, it will be necessary for one of our officials to approach the provincial school inspector concerned so that we may ascertain whether it is possible to provide educational facilities for these Indians in some other way.\n\nWe are erecting a big brick school for the Indian children at Caughnawaga and this no doubt has resulted in requests from the white lessees on the reserve for the establishment of a school for their children.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBFN/EM\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6082, file 305-5, part 17)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, August 16, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nPlease find attached a draft reply to the Reverend Father Lalonde's letter of July 19, as requested by Mr. Levy in his memorandum of August 11.\n\nThis is a delicate situation and involves the establishment of a provincial school on an Indian reserve. Therefore I have attempted to make the reply as non-committal as possible. We are having one of our officials approach the Provincial School Inspector concerned so that we may obtain further details.\n\nDirector.\n\nEncl.\n\nBFN/EM\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Caughnawaga Eastern Day School\n\nWith reference to Major MacKay's memorandum of June 2nd bearing your marginal notation of the 3rd instant, in connection with the above you are advised as follows,\n\nWe verbally advised Col. Neary that the plans and specifications would be forwarded at an early date; and on July 13th the said plans and specifications were delivered by hand to the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nOwing to an unusually heavy pressure of work which was being dealt with at that time, the memorandum referred to was overlooked and unanswered.\n\nFor your information, we are verbally informed that the Indian Affairs Branch after having advertised the work have received three (3) tenders and it is expected that we will be called upon to comment on same.\n\nChas. H. Buck,\nfor Chief, Engineering and Construction Division.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report dated 20th July, 1949, from the Minister of Mines and Resources, representing:\n\nThat under authority of Order in Council P.C. 1785 of 22nd April, 1948, an agreement was entered into with the A.F. Byers Construction Company of Montreal, Quebec, for the construction of a 12-Room Day School and Boiler House at the Caughnawaga Indian Agency in the Province of Quebec on the basis of their lump sum tender of $283,761.00, which, with provision for contingencies and supervision, entailed a total expenditure to the approximate amount of $333,000.00;\n\nThat the project, now nearing completion, was subject to changes in the design of the mechanical services and water supply system and the substitution of materials and equipment other than those specified which were in short supply, thereby increasing the value of the work as described in the said agreement by the approximate amount of $18,000.00;\n\nThat expenditures will not exceed the total amount of approximately $351,000.00 authorized by P.C. 1785, dated 22nd of April, 1948, for this project.\n\nThe Committee, therefore, on the recommendation of the Minister of Mines and Resources, advise that Authority be granted to make settlement for extra work in the amount of approximately $18,000.00 performed by the said contractor as above set out, such expenditures to be charged to funds provided in the Estimates of the Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, for Indian Education.\n\n(sgd) N.

Brisebois)\nSupt., Indian Agency.\nSt. Ann's Convent\nCaughnawaga, Quebec\nSeptember 13, 1949\n\nMr. Philip Phelan, Chief, Training Division\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOTTAWA\n\nDear Sir:\n\n\"Time and Tide wait for no man,\" but man simply must wait for Time and the things that come along with the Tide, such as estimates for approved requisitions. That is the only reason which explains the long delay of this letter\u2014otherwise, it would have been written two days after Mr. Neary's visit on August 31.\n\nKnowing that he would be absent for quite a while, he asked me to address all communications directly to you, as you were informed of all the doings in Caughnawaga and that you would see to their immediate and safe despatch.\n\nThere are several items to be covered\u2014each one as important as the other\u2014and the length of this letter is not meant to discourage you; on the contrary, I shall endeavour to set forth as clearly as possible the determining provisions considered in the preparation of the enclosed requisition. These may help you take appropriate decisions, knowing the local needs. Each point has already been discussed with and approved by Mr. Neary, but Form and Convenience exact that they be committed to writing.\n\nOur beautiful new school eventually opened wide its doors to 330 pupils yesterday...but no one can say it is complete\u2014there are ever so many indispensable details that must be attended to before the Official Opening, and even after. The old furniture really impairs the appearance of the spacious and well-lighted classrooms. That is why I am placing the furniture item first: lack of suitable desks and chairs for the teachers; pupils' desks (Mr. Neary has already ordered 120 desks, but at least 50 more will be needed\u2014the exact number and size will be definitely determined as soon as the registration is complete);\nbookcases for each room as there is none free to serve as library as had been previously planned; the entire equipment for the two Principals' offices\u2014desks, chairs, files, bookcases, typewriters (the old ones are beyond repair), and desk lamps. In the meantime, the Department has had to spend a considerable sum for the repair and adaptation of old desks...\n\nMr. Neary asked me to obtain quotations from various firms for all the above articles. A separate tabulation of these prices is included for easy and quick comparison. Now for a few precisions...\n\nThe great variance in the price of the Principals' desks is rather striking: the Vilas Company offers a plain desk thereby necessitating a typewriting table, which in reality would be too large for the available office space; whereas the Valiquette Distributors Limited offer the convenient oak CLEMCO desks equipped with the typewriting-table inset\u2014a piece of furniture that will outlive the school. Wouldn't you consider the present extra expense an actual saving?\n\nThe requisition cupboards to be built in the waiting room of the Principal's office and the three cupboards for the Domestic Science rooms are also indispensable articles that were definitely approved in June and in August. Valiquette Distributors quote the price for birch cupboards but they will actually be made of mahogany. (Mr. Racine has done his utmost to furnish reasonable prices for exceptional quality.) J. P. Dupuis' estimates cover the bare wooden element of the cupboards...no glass nor any other fixture.\n\nWe fully realize that equipping a new school as large as ours can cause a severe headache to the Personnel of the Purchasing Department. To offer them some sort of relief, we found our way to a well-known second-hand store: Baillargeon Furniture Galleries. They carry a good stock and therefore present worthwhile and tempting bargains. By the very fact that we become their customers, they accept any furniture we may have to discard. They repair and sell it at the most advantageous price, giving us 70% of the sale. Their stock is generally liquidated within a three-month period. The three items submitted by this Company are really good buys, and the credit received from the sale of our old furniture would yield a worthwhile decrease on the present expenditure.\nMr. Philip Phelan\n\nSept. 13, 1949\n\nThe sectional bookcases requested are for the two higher classes of the Boys' and Girls' sections... they could also be purchased in view of the future library. The plain glass-paneled cases from Vilas Company will do very well for the other rooms.\n\nThe other items of the requisition are all essential. They were not included in the April requisition simply because they could not be determined before the school was completed.\n\nAnother proposal which Mr. Neary readily sanctioned was the addition of a Public Speaking Instructor. Mrs. Dewar of Montreal has sent in her application to teach Public Speaking, Choral speaking and Elocution to our pupils. She would have to give eight lessons of one-half hour each for which she is charging the reasonable fee of $20. Her weekly lessons are well-prepared, practical, and delivered with a charming facility and simplicity that exercises a beneficial influence over the students. We know that the Department is willing to do all in its power to raise the level of better English and culture in all its forms for the benefit of the Indians and we dare vouchsafe for the successful work that Mrs. Dewar will accomplish with our pupils. As she would be ready to begin her work in October, the Department will no doubt advise us as soon as possible of her acceptance.\n\nThe letter in which you authorized us to spend $15 for Music Appreciation has been inadvertently lost.... May I disturb the Filing Department for a duplicate copy of it because the File Number is required for the Disbursement Voucher. It was received between July 15 and August 8. This favour will be greatly appreciated.\n\nSr. Mary Alma, Domestic Science Instructor, wishes to renew her request for the expenditure of the same monthly allowance, $13.50, for her Department. She is well-pleased with her new quarters so bright and spacious. The articles called for in the requisition will complete its practicality.\n\nNow for The \"Elementary Art\" by R.W. Hedly requisitioned August 24 and for which Mr. Neary asked more detailed information. Each set covers Grades I including VIII, and we are asking for three sets\u2014one for both Sections and one for the Office.\n\nIn my haste to return The Oaths yesterday, I overlooked Sister Dolores Marie's name on the list of retiring teachers from last year's staff. May I trouble you to advise the Treasury Department? Thank you.\nMr. Philip Phelan\n\nSept. 13, 1949\n\nI trust that this long letter has served its purpose. It was written with the sole aim of offering you and Purchasing Department some enlightening explanations that would tip the Treasury Scales on the most economical side so that the least possible time may be lost in purchasing the equipment\u2014and also not to delay the Official Opening announced for a probable date around mid-October.\n\nThe Department may well be very proud of its new acquisition (we are, too) and it would make your heart feel good to hear the appreciative exclamations of the numerous visitors from our own country and from the United States. We are most eager to see it completely equipped and to have the different Officials of the Department come to admire it.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nEnclosures\nSt. Ann's Convent\nCaughnawaga, Quebec\nSeptember 15, 1949\n\nMr. Philip Phelan, Chief, Training Division\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOTTAWA\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nMay I add a personal note to the already extra-long \"business epistle\" enclosed?\n\nIt is indeed a real pleasure for me, Mr. Phelan, to renew acquaintance with you (being an \"old-Timer\" of '30) and the pleasant, friendly relations you had with my worthy predecessors\u2014Sisters Mary Cleophas and George Edmund, to name but two. How they would appreciate our beautiful new school! The Lord has reserved this pleasure for the latter only\u2014and we hope it will be soon\u2014the others are already enjoying the blessed fruits of their untiring labours.\n\nPast correspondence reveals your deep interest in the welfare of our Indians, and your wholehearted, ever-ready cooperation reassures me in my dealings with the Department. Knowing the local needs, you will between the lines and understand the necessity of the different articles. I don't believe there is any extravagance\u2014nevertheless, I did my best to find furniture that would be compatible with the \"Pride of the Federal Government\" and that would prevent doubling the expense in the future.\n\nMay I count on you for a speedy despatch of this requisition, as I figure that the Official Opening will not take place till everything is really ready.\n\nWe are most grateful to have to deal with such strong concerted interests and efforts as yours and Mr. Neary's.\n\nWith sincere appreciation,\n\n[Signature]\nSister Mary Mediator\nPrincipal\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUESTION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nSeptember 20th 1949\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Caughnawaga R.C.

A copy of your memorandum is being forwarded to Indian Superintendent Brisebois, and he is being requested to report. When we hear from him, you will be advised.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST Chief, Education Division\nColonel Bernard F. Neary  \nSupt. of Indian Education  \nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nSince the pump began working after a delay of three days, the water situation though improved, is not of the best. Each afternoon, about two o'clock, the water gives out with all the resulting complications easy to imagine.\n\nProblem No. 2, to my way of thinking, is the playground in back of the school. Only one softball or baseball team can play at the same time. Having more recesses would be unfeasible; there are already two different periods (1st-4th and 5th-9th grades) both in the morning and afternoon. I have been carefully over every foot of the place and with the exception of the spot where the boys play lacrosse or softball, it is a hazard. Holes, rocks, stumps, etc., spangle the field, so to speak. It will be a miracle if no accidents occur before the snow sets in. Whatever, under prevailing conditions, it is difficult to organize the sports here, as the children have a right to expect. \"Where shall we play?\" they ask. With Mr. Brisebois' help, I shall try to interest them\u2014at least a good many of them\u2014in volley-ball. That would ease up the situation for a while.\n\nDoubtless in your spare time\u2014if you have any\u2014you must be wondering how the new staff at the Caughnawaga Day School is getting along. Rather well. The boys seem to have taken to the teachers. Thanks to a gift of a dozen new lacrosses from outsiders, we have a group of the bigger boys playing after school hours. Father Burns supervises the players who are the keymen ('boys) and they naturally react favorably in class.\n\nMr. Desmarais, now, this is a first impression, seems to be an excellent addition to the teaching staff.\n\nMr. Viau is doing well also. May I suggest that his first month's salary be forwarded to him as soon as possible? He has, as you know, a large family, six children, if I am not mistaken, and funds would indeed be welcome. I did not send in his application blank sooner (Sept. 12), as I waited quite a few days before I learned that Mr. Desmarais had sent his in through Mr. Brisebois.\n\nThanking you for all you are doing for Caughnawaga, I remain\n\nVery gratefully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(R.

The water pumped from the well into the basin is just sufficient to take care of the requirements for the forenoon on School days. Water is running short at about 2 hrs P.M., every day.\n\nAs you are aware there is a well located at about 350 feet from the Senior School. This well is supplying the Kateri School, presently occupied by the U.C. School, and tests made a few years ago revealed that there is a considerable volume of water available there.\n\nIt might be desirable to have further tests made for the same well with a view of running a pipe from same to the reservoir of the New School, if it is found that there is enough water to supply both buildings.\n\nOf course this is a matter for the Engineers to determine but I would be pleased to be informed of your views in the matter. According to the Railway Power & Engineering Co., experts it would be relatively easy to pump water from that point with the proper equipment.\n\n(Frs.

At that time the boilers had not been put into operation. We have in mind sending Mr. Hargreaves to Caughnawaga again, but had anticipated that Indian Affairs would have appointed a qualified permanent engineer to operate the mechanical services at the school, before he went.\n\nOur Chief Architect in contacting Indian Affairs, has been advised that as yet no appointment has been made, but that the matter is receiving definite consideration at the moment.\n\nThere is no objection to Indian Affairs action in putting the boiler plant into operation temporarily under control of the fireman who services other schools in the agency, but within the next two weeks, we consider it advisable to have Mr. Hargreaves go to Caughnawaga and familiarize the operator with the technical needs of the system. A later trip for the benefit of the permanent appointee will be necessary.\n\nChief, Engineering and Construction Division.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOctober 22, 1949.\n\nMr. F. Brisebois,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\n\nI have just been advised that advertisements should be issued for a caretaker for the new Caughnawaga School.\n\nIn the meantime, please find attached a memorandum received from the engineers concerning the operation of the heating plant.\n\nBernard F.

Mr. Perron located many well in this district, among his achievement are wells for the Canadian Alkali Co., Beauharnois, Que., Merck & Co. at Valleyfield, the City of Valleyfield, The Town of Ste-Therese. He located all the artesian wells for the Trappists fathers at Oka and at the Agricultural College.\n\nIt might be well to retain his services to try to locate water on the ground of the New Senior School.\n\n(Signed)\n(Frs.

Doucet,\nSupervisor of Vocational Education.\n\nAJD:MNcN\nSt. Ann's Convent\nCaughnawaga, Quebec\nSeptember 29, 1949\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. Phelan informs me in his letter of September 20 that your return \"Home\" is scheduled for October 1. And here I am to welcome you with another epistle.... I trust that your visits to the different reserves are not so harassing as those to Caughnawaga....\n\nThe tenor of my letter of September 13 and the accompanying requisition must have stunned him. I fully agree with him that they were unusual\u2014but then, our new school is a most unusual item in the Government's budget! I really do not want to be importunate, Mr. Neary; I am simply doing my best to equip this beautiful, modern construction with suitable furniture and various equipment that will convert the building into a real school, such as the Department desires. I assure you that extravagant selection was wilfully avoided, and many items were even postponed till next year. Because you had approved all these points, I felt quite free in exposing the several considerations involved.\n\nWe do not regret the time and trouble spent in \"bargain-hunting\" and in preparing the requisition as everything was done solely to carry out your orders, to save you precious time, and to facilitate your work as much as possible. Your discerning choice and decision in the matter will assuredly meet the requirements seeing that you are so familiar with the actual local needs.\n\nDaily living in the new school affords enlightening experiences. I hope this one will not disappoint you too much. Contrary to the regular routine followed for the Official Openings, it will be impossible for us to carry out the program in the school should the weather be stormy\u2014the pupils alone would occupy three-fourths of the corridor, leaving no place for the activities nor for the invited guests. Such a late date would practically prohibit an outside performance\u2014the cold weather would play havoc with the current pre-dispositions for T.E.\nThe next best thing that remains to be done is having the entire program executed at Kateri Hall, which Father Lalonde graciously offered. We have already adapted our activities to this staging, presuming that you would not have any objections. The lunch would be served at school after the official visiting.\n\nMrs. McComber informs me that the dishes used at the Home-Makers' Convention three years ago were rented from Mr. Bergeron, Lachine, at a very nominal price. Would you want us to solicit the same favour, or would you prefer that we buy our own dishes? The Club had not purchased any for the simple reason that they had no place to keep them since they have no special quarters at their disposal.\n\nAnother point which I would like you to clarify is the amount allowed to cover the incurring expenses of such a ceremony. Last August you said that the Department generally allows $75. Now, according to our calculations, the cost of a light lunch for the invited guests plus at least two representatives from about 200 families that send their children to school would easily exceed that amount. Our past experience with Alumnae gatherings proves that expenses range from 30\u00a2 to 40\u00a2 per capita. If the demonstration takes place on a Saturday afternoon or a Sunday, more people will want to witness it. Of course, this number excludes our 350 pupils, who will enjoy their share the following day.\n\nThe increase becomes quite obvious when we compare our 12-classroom school with those of four or even six rooms. It is only logical that the expenses would double too. Therefore, the lowest calculation would necessitate $150.... May I ask you to stamp this point with your seal of approbation in your next letter?\n\nSr. Phelan's letter of September 26 inquires about the Application Form from Sr. Dorothy Marie--name mistaken no doubt for Sr. Dolores Marie. The last paragraph on Page 3 of my letter dated September 13 explains the omission: she is replaced by Sr. Mary Cabrini.\n\nIt is rather unusual that the books from the requisition you sent to the Purchasing Department at the end of August have not yet arrived. We are in urgent need of these texts as these important subjects--Religion and Literature--carry quite a heavy program. A good deal of the April requisition is still on the waiting list....\n\nI am most eager to receive an answer to my long epistles, which I honestly hope did not cause you too severe a headache. Your reply will also bring us more information concerning the definite date of the Official Opening....\nIt will be more than time to send out the invitations. Our Printing Shop in Lachine charges $3.50 C for handset printing and $2.00 C for machine-set printing. If it is agreeable to you, we could have the invitations for the guests of honor done there. The others would receive theirs through the pulpit and through the children.\n\nThere are ever so many question marks popping up concerning the functioning of the new school that you may decide to come to answer them \"viva voce.\" That would be a splendid solution and a real time-saver. You did leave us to our own initiative, but your approbation of certain points is necessary to dispel any doubt we may entertain as to their feasibility.\n\nVery appreciatively yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal, Girls' Section\n\nP. S. Mr. Brisebois informed me today that the Henderson Company from St. Lambert will deliver the desks you ordered at the end of next week. We are eager to see them.\nRequisition for School Material\n\nDate: September 13, 1912\n\nFor: R.C.

C. HICK,\nLands and Development Services Branch.\n\nWater Situation - Caughnawaga R.C. School.\n\nI believe enquiries have been made concerning the hiring of a water locator in connection with the problems in locating a supply at the above school. I have received a report from Mr. Brisebois concerning such a man and his comments read as follows:-\n\n\"Please be advised that his full name is Paul Perron. His address is Rosemere, Que., Telephone No. Rosemere 612 Ring 4.\"\n\n\"May I say that the above named is highly recommended by the Railway & Power Engineering who, as you know is a responsible firm. Mr. Perron located many wells in this district, among his achievement are wells for the Canadian Alkali Co., Beauharnois, Que., Merck & Co. at Valleyfield, the City of Valleyfield, The Town of Ste. Therese. He located all the artesian wells for the Trappists Fathers at Oka and at the Agricultural College.\n\n\"It might be well to retain his services to try to locate water on the ground of the new Senior School.\"\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nBFN/IM\nOctober 28, 1949.\n\nReverend H. Bechard, S.J.,\nR.C. Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\n\nCaughnawaga R.C., Indian Day School.\n\nI have for answer your recent letters concerning your requirements at the Caughnawaga School and also those of the Sister Superior.\n\nWith regard to the playground, please speak to Mr. Brisebois about this as he has been in touch with a company which may submit a tender.\n\nWe simply do not have enough funds to buy additional new desks for the school unless it can be proved that the present ones are unserviceable. The funds asked for by the Sister Superior are simply not available until the water situation at the school is decided. Until we know how much additional money is required to locate water, we must be very careful in buying new equipment as otherwise there will not be enough money to cover the water supply.\n\nThe same situation applies with regard to the road leading to the school. We can do little on this road until it has been decided as to what the water situation will be and whether a pipeline will have to be laid from the river up to the school. If so, this line will pass directly through where we intend to lay a proper road to the school.\n\nYou can advise the Sister Superior that action is being taken to provide certain of the requirements for desks, etc., but that some items will definitely have to wait until I know where we stand with regard to the water. I am pleased to note that the new desks which have arrived are satisfactory.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMR.

Herewith enclosed is the original of his report in the French language and a translation of same made at this office.\n\nMr. Hargreaves happened to be present when Mr. Perron stated his work and he will remember that two particular spots were worked by Mr. Perron. What is described as Well No. 1, is that location on the east side of the School yard, where there are several large uncovered rocks.\n\nWell No. 2, is located south west of the yard in a rather flat area. This well should yield about 8 gallons per minute while No. 1 would produce more.

Mines & Resources.\n\nThis will acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st., ultimo, dealing with the winter opening of the St. Isidore Road, so that our School children may be able to travel by Bus to the Village schools.\n\nAfter discussions with the Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, this matter was taken up with the Provincial authorities, when it was suggested that they undertake the work themselves with the understanding that we would contribute an amount of $75.00 per mile.\n\nOn that occasion I was told that this matter would have to be discussed further between the local representative of the Provincial Government and the higher authorities.\n\nI am now advised that it will not be possible at least for the coming winter for the Provincial to undertake the clearing of this road as they will be maintaining Winter Roads for the benefit of the Municipalities of St. Isidore through to St. Philomene, to the main Montreal-Malone Highway. St. Isidore Junction will have their road through St. Constant, Delson and Laprairie for them to reach Montreal. Furthermore it is claimed that the Budget for the maintenance of winter roads did not provide for the opening of St. Isidore road for this winter.\n\nIt would appear that the only way to keep this road open would be for us to hire snowploughs locally.\n\nOver.\nIn this regard I have to advise that the services of two different companies would be available as follows; Jean Bedard Ltd., of Caughnawaga and Ville LaSalle who are operating three snowploughs and who are doing work for the town of LaSalle, the town of St. Pierre and who have also kept our Village streets open for the past two years. Their hourly price for a snow-plough and two men are of $6.00 per working hour including Sundays and holidays.\n\nThe other firm would be the Quinlan Cut Stone Co. of Ville LaSalle who are the owners of one snowplough. Their rates are of $6.00 per hour for weekdays and of $75.00 per hour for Sundays and holidays, also for Saturday afternoons after 12:00 P.M.\n\nNone of these firms are willing to undertake the work on a mileage basis.\n\nAs you may be aware it is impossible to make an exact estimate of such an undertaking as it depends entirely on weather conditions.\n\nFor instance our Village streets (about 3\u00bd miles) were kept open last winter for the sum of $280.00, while the previous winter amounted to over $500.00.\n\nWill you kindly advise if it would be in order for us to make arrangements locally for the clearing of St. Isidore Road on an hourly basis.\n\nFr.

You are therefore, advised that no change in the positioning of the hot plates from those shown on our above mentioned drawing, are to be made.\n\nKindly advise the A.F. Byers Construction Company of the decision reached, so that the electrical subcontractor will be informed.\n\nIt will be your responsibility to supervise the drilling of the counter top for conduit passages and anchors for the hot plates to ensure that the surface is not damaged in any manner.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nC.

It will not be possible to change the cooking units as suggested. If this is done, it will affect the position and areas of working spaces on the top of the counter, and will necessitate an entire new set of plans being prepared. The knee space will be affected, and the whole structure will have to be changed.\n\nI have, therefore, advised the engineers to proceed with the building of the food counter on the basis of the plans already prepared, and you may advise the Principal of the school that no changes can be made.\n\nBernard F.

Carrick\n\nSound Systems Dept.\n\nWEC:SH\nMemorandum\n\nCHIEF, EDUCATION DIVISION\n\nRe: Caughnawaga R.C. Indian Day School\n\nThe attention of the contractors should be drawn to the fact that the exterior doors of the new R.C. School are not operating satisfactorily. Apparently the front doors cannot be used at all and the side doors are difficult to open and close and will not lock. The school then remains open all night. This situation should be remedied immediately.\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nSupervisor of Vocational Education.\nDecember 12, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUCK\nCaughnawaga R.C. Day School\n\nOne of our officials has recently returned from an inspection trip to the above school. He reports that the exterior doors are not operating satisfactorily. The front doors can not be used and the side doors are difficult to open and close and will not lock. It is not possible at the present time to lock the school at nights.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you could take this matter up with the Contractor as soon as possible.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nDecember 15, 1949.\n\nThe Director,\nLands and Development Services Branch.\n\nRe: Water supply for Caughnawaga Indian Day School.\n\nWe understand that some difficulty is being encountered in securing sufficient water for the operation of the school from the present source of supply.\n\nIt has been suggested that the St. Lawrence River be considered as a possible new source. Recently we were asked to prepare a 5-year plan, and an item of $200,000.00 was included in the 5-year plan for the years 1953-54 and 1954-55. It is not likely that $200,000.00 will be sufficient to pay for a water supply for the Indian village, but perhaps it would be sufficient to make a start on the work.\n\nIf the provision of a water supply from the St. Lawrence River is being considered for the school, it might be well to consider the Indian village needs at the same time and a sufficiently large intake and main pipe line be specified to take care of both the school and the village.\n\nI would suggest, therefore, that your engineer be asked to furnish us with an estimate of the cost of providing a water supply system from the St. Lawrence River that will provide sufficient water for the school and will permit extension to provide water for the Indian village.\n\nIn preparing this report, we would ask that the engineer break down the costs and show what should be charged to the Indian Education Vote and what to the Indian Agencies Vote.\n\nDirector.\nDominion Sound Equipments Limited,\nPost Office Box No. 320 (Westmount),\n4040 St. Catherine Street West,\nMontreal 6, Quebec.\n\nAttention: Mr. E. E. Handley\nSound Systems Manager\n\nGentlemen:\n\nRe: Purchase Order No. 47734\n\nYour invoice, No. M-110935-DD dated 12 September 1949, has been referred to the undersigned for attention. We note that you have charged us a price of $1,570.45 which, we presume, includes equipment and sales tax thereon at $1,390.45, and cost of installation and testing at $180.00.\n\nAs this distribution system is used solely for educational purposes, it is our opinion that the eight per cent Dominion Sales Tax is not applicable under Canadian Tariff Item No. 696. In view of this, please advise us of the exact amount of sales tax that may be deducted from your invoice.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M.

It is further noted that you expect that a report could be prepared by the end of February. This will be quite satisfactory.\n\nThe estimate of the cost should include fire protection for the Indian village as well as for the school.\n\nDirector.\nJanuary 5, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

Provided the snow conditions remain satisfactory it is expected that such a survey could be carried out during the month of January and after a tentative design is drawn up it is expected that the report could be prepared by the end of February. If, however, an approximate estimate only is required, it is expected that same could be prepared for Major MacKay shortly after the first of January.\n\nIn the meantime our engineers wish to be advised if it is the intention of the Indian Affairs Branch to supply a quantity of water sufficient for fire-fighting purposes together with hydrants placed throughout the village to provide for fire protection.\n\nWe would appreciate your further instructions regarding this matter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief.\n| QTY.

The explanation of the situation is, that to accomplish occupancy of the school by the beginning of the fall term in 1949, the Contractors were instructed to continue construction operations throughout the winter. It was apparent to our Chief Architect when in company with Col. Neary he inspected the school last fall, that the coping stones had been pointed with mortar affected by frost, since bed and end joints had deteriorated. On Mr. Buck's instructions the Contractors re-pointed the copings and applied a transparent waterproofing compound which seemed to check any further deterioration was evident in brick jointing at that time, but when Mr. Kosnar reported the matter following his return from Caughnawaga, it was taken up with Mr. Gege, President of the Pyers Construction Co., who has agreed to have all brickwork in the walls examined and to re-point jointing where necessary, as soon as the danger of frost is over, at no cost to the Department.\n\nNo purpose would be served by an analysis of the mortar chips brought back by Mr. Kosnar.\n\nChief.\nMemorandum to the Director\n\nTwelve Classroom Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga Indian Agency, Quebec\n\nWe have been advised in Mr. Maurice Payette's letter dated the 9th of January that the Spencer Electric Alarms have completed the installation of equipment necessary to connect the fire alarm system at the school to the Lachine Fire Station. Mr. Payette has forwarded this firm's account in quadruplicate covering the installation charges and agreed upon rental for twelve months to January, 1951 in the amount of $215.00.\n\nIn our memorandum to the Superintendent of Indian Education dated the 3rd of August last, we pointed out that it would be necessary for the Indian Affairs Branch to provide funds for the installation of this equipment.\n\nWe are attaching hereto the account of the Spencer Electric Alarms, approved by Mr. Payette, for transmission to the Indian Affairs Branch for payment.\n\nEncl.\n\nChief.\n14 January, 1950.\n\nMemorandum to the Director\n\nTwelve Classroom Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga Indian Agency, Quebec\n\nWe have been advised in Mr. Maurice Payette's letter dated the 8th of January that the Spencer Electric Alarms have completed the installation of equipment necessary to connect the fire alarm system at the school to the Lachine Fire Station.

Included on this Voucher is an item of $5.31, which apparently covers the cost of installing a new telephone. If this is correct, I would appreciate it if you would let me know in what building this telephone was installed and on whose authority.\n\nIt is our understanding that there is a telephone in the Sister's residence, and also one telephone in the new school. Has a second telephone been installed in the new school? If so, the Department is not prepared to pay for it, as we consider one telephone in the new school is sufficient. I may add that before any new telephone is installed, it is necessary to obtain the approval of the Deputy Minister.\n\nPlease let me hear from you.\n\nPP/T\nAttach.\n\nBernard F.

Please explain the following items:\n\nMay 6 45 gals. of liquid for glass. $16.50\nMay 12 3 cases of paper serviettes)\n3 BTS Only One Serviettes )\nThe cost of these 2 items was $33.99\n\nWe have been reviewing our file and find that practically every month we receive an account for a considerable amount for various articles of materials purchased by the Principal of the Caughnawaga R.C. School. Over a year's time these accounts amount to a very considerable sum. Please point out to the Principal that in future she should consult you before making these purchases, because these miscellaneous accounts must be kept to a minimum.\n\nI also wish to refer to your Voucher 597. This includes a charge of $11.23 for telephone. Please point out to the Principal that effective from June 1st, 1950, the Department will only be able to allow the service charge for the telephone, which it is noted amounts to $3.85 at the residence and $3.93 at the school.\n\n......2\nWhen the account is received from the telephone company at the end of each month, the teachers should pay their long distance telephone charges direct to the company. This is the same procedure as we have adopted with the teachers at the Caughnawaga U.C. School.\n\nPP/ST Attach.\n\nBernard F.

For the first 2,000 gallons, which we could deliver to you in tank wagon lots of 500 or 600 gallons at a time, all of which would have to be delivered before snowfall, the price would be 14\u00a2 per Imperial Gallon. This includes delivery right into your tanks at Caughnawaga.\n\nAs regards to the balance, i.e., 2,000 gallons, we would be unable to make delivery of this quantity by tank wagon after snowfall on account of the poor condition of the roads between our plant at Montreal and Caughnawaga. Therefore this quantity would have to be delivered in wood barrels, and the prices would be as shown below:\n\nIn carload lots, in wood barrels, including freight on the return of the empty barrels in carload lots, the price will be 14 1/2\u00a2 per Imperial gallon, F.O.R. Railway Siding, Adirondack Junction.\n\nFor the same material in less than carload quantities in wood barrels, including freight on the empty barrels from Adirondack Jct. to Montreal, if returned in any quantity, the price will be 15 1/2\u00a2 per gallon, F.O.B. Adirondack Junction.\n\nIt is to be understood that there is a charge of $3.00 each for the wood containers, all of which are returnable to us at our warehouse in Montreal at price charged if in good condition.\n\nHoping to be favored with your valued\n\nALL QUOTATIONS SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE\nOctober 20th, 1926.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\norder, we beg to remain,\n\nYours very truly,\nIMPERIAL OIL, LIMITED.\n\nper J.

Mr. Perrier, who examined this engine agrees with me that it should be replaced by a Fairbanks Morse electric motor. I would, therefore, recommend that this machine be purchased from the local office of the Canadian Fairbanks Morse Co. Otherwise it will be necessary to obtain competitive prices from local dealers in Montreal.\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. H.

This motor should be shipped f.o.b. Mirondack Junction, Ont., to Rev. Sister Mary Rose Alma, Superior, Caughnawaga Girls' School, and the accounts should be sent to her for verification in duplicate.\n\nIt is desired that you arrange for the installation of this machinery in complete working order.

This latter Company was obliged to shut off the power quite a lot this summer to make certain repairs due to serious damage to their transmission line last spring.\n\nWe are glad to know of your intentions to install some electric motors at Caughnawaga for the operating of the water supply system, and we shall endeavor to give you the best of service.

There will be no charge for the changes, should same be found advisable.\n\nUntil we hear from you re above, it would be useless to make an inspection.\n\nKindly advise us at your earliest possible convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary.\nJan. 4, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 31st of December, 1926, requesting to be advised as to the capacity of the electric meters referred to in my letter of the 30th of December, I beg to say that the capacity of one of the meters installed is a 5 H.

In the meantime, instructions have been given to the Indian Agent to see that the system is not overloaded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nUnited Power Co., Ltd.,\n390 Phillips Place,\nMontreal, Canada.\nSt-Constant, Que.,\nJanuary 14th 1927\n\nSir:\n\nSince the recent installation of one automatic oil burner at the teachers' residence at Caughnawaga, which operates very satisfactory, it is observed that on account of the cellar being low (the distance between the floor and the ceiling being rather small) the heat of the burner being intense to heat all the house, it is advisable for security to have asbestos boards above the furnace for ten square feet, also, I beg to recommend that the furnace be covered with the same material together with the smoke stack in order to avoid the roar from the flames which is somewhat annoying for the teachers. I am informed by Mr. W.F.T. Cheesman, of the Asbestos Limited, Montreal, that it would cost $28.00 for the necessary asbestos boards and $45.00 for the other material and labour, making a total expense of $73.00 for the above mentioned installation which I strongly recommend to your approval. This is mostly urgent because I have noticed that the wooden parts around the furnace are getting dryer and dryer, it is even lightly burnt and it is greatly desired to have your authorization with the least possible delay to have this work performed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6082, file 305-8, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFeb. 17, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 11th of Feb., advising your company that the Department had authorized the necessary change in the wiring at the teachers' residence at Caughnawaga in order that storage meters might be installed for electric light and power, I beg to say that upon re-considering the price mentioned in the contract for the furnishing of power, it is found that the rate is higher than that stipulated in the first agreement made between your Company and the Department, dated 25th of November, 1926. According to this agreement the tariff for electric current for motors and heating did not exceed four cents per K.W. hour. The contract now submitted to the Department mentions a rate of six cents per K.W. hour with a discount of one cent.\n\nI would ask you to send me revised copies in duplicate of the contract for a period of three years, mentioning the correct rate. As soon as this is received the matter will be given further consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nUnited Power Co.,\n390 Phillips Place,\nMontreal, Que.\nUNITED POWER COMPANY, LIMITED\n\n390 PHILLIPS PLACE\n\nMONTREAL. January 6th-1927\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your favor of the 4th instant we find the electric meter and service wires much too small to serve the 5 H.P. motor you have installed at the teacher's residence at Caughnawaga, and if used may burn out the meter. The present use of same is therefore entirely at your risk.\n\nWe beg to submit for your kind consideration 2 proposals for the power supply, as follows:\n\nProposal No. 1. This contemplates joint use of power and light on same meter, paying for power same rate as for light, viz. 17 cents less 15%. Contract is for one year.\n\nProposal No. 2. This is a 3 year contract for power only, rate 5 cents net per K.W.hour with a minimum guarantee of $1.00 per H.P. per month, in this case $5.25 min. per month, with meter rental for special meter of 25 cents per month. In this case arrangement must be made by you for the placing of the Company's meter, similarly as was done for the electric light supply.\n\nWe have no such large meters in stock, so perhaps you will be good enough to write or to wire at once, which proposal you wish to accept, so that we can order the meter at once and make the changes with the least possible delay.\n\nWhether it will be safe to use the motor in the meantime will depend on the actual load the motor is taking. If it is taking only about 3 H.P. and used in daytime only with no lights burning it should be safe enough. The \u00bd H.P. for the oil burner can be used in any case.\n\nWe shall install meter and wires large enough to take care of the extra \u00bd H.P. motor you may decide to install later on.\n\nTrusting we have made ourselves clear and thanking you for the business,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.

This is for two months as there was no reading taken in the month of February.\n\nYou had been billed for $1.00 for light, which amount has been paid, and this is the reason why our collector only billed you $1.00. As to the stove account, this should be figured the first 600 kwhrs. due to billing for two months, which gives an amount of $21.90, less $1.00 already billed in the month of February, a net amount of $20.90.\n\nWe are returning the bill which was corrected by you and are attaching a new one showing an amount of $1.00 outstanding, for which we would ask you to kindly let us have your cheque as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE SHAWINIGAN WATER & POWER COMPANY.\nCommercial & Distribution Department.\n\nJ.D.
