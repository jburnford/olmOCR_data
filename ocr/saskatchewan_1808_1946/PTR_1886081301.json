The proceedings began by the election of Hon. Clements on the Church in St. Mary\u2019s church, whose opening service last week, has undergone changes and requisitions for the purchase of a new building. Yesterday morning Rev. Mr. E. McDonald presented his resignation to the Synod after which the Hon. Hon. H. W. Campbell was administered by Bishop Lordship the Bishop\u2019s anointing to reviving the whole of the clergy and lay deacons were stationed at the north end of Bishop\u2019s House Hill overlooking the town of Newtonboy. At 2:30 o\u2019clock the Synod proceeded to business in St. Mary\u2019s church. The following resolutions were moved by the following stories regarding the Bishop\u2019s new living, the former being a parish without its own rector or vicar. I am still interested in any news from the Overseas Missionaries.\n\nMy Reverend Bishops and Brethren,\n\nWe are presented with a synod last year by the discovery into which the country had been thrown by the Wireless Age. It is evident that the good Providence of God has been seen fit to reach us by a hand of mercy which we have been able to meet as the mission of public purpose. We do not need a prophet.\n\nThe number of citizens in the Diocese is twenty-three. Of these eleven are preachers on the day-by-day strikes, representing all the sections which constitute central Canada\u2014when their presence would be a strong counterbalance to the difficulties of travel. The Diocese stretching from Lake Winnipeg to the Rocky Mountains on the west, a distance of over a thousand miles. The boundaries of the Diocese, forming the most populous of the District, has also no railway communication within its borders. The cottage, which is now assembled, is still two hundred and sixty miles from the nearest railway station. In this way the inhabitants of the new world are forced to combine the principles of simplicity along the route of missionary work.\n\nBetts & Gwynne.\nFurniture.\nCheaper than Ever.\n\nI am now prepared to sell furniture cheaper than ever before offered in Prince Albert.

Matheson left by mail for Troy to report to his new station at Lethbridge.\n\nOn this occasion he was called upon to depart from his previous parish and St. Andrew's, and presented with an address by the members of the congregation from friends more or less intimately connected with these parishes.\n\nRev. Mr. Matheson, M.A., who promised to supply the vacant position at the meeting by a few genial and appropriate remarks, and then read the address as follows:\n\nPrince Albert, Aug. 18th, 1886\n\nReverend Dear Sir,\n\nAs you are now about to leave this district, we wish to have no long interval with you and acceptance, the inhabitants of St. Catherine's, who have had the benefit of your services for several years, and those of St. Andrew's whom you have been more recently visited, desire in parting with you to express their thanks for your services, and extend to you our congratulations and as a friend, their best regards at your departure and their best wishes for your future success.\n\nWe bear willing testimony to the great value of your services and personal character as a man for spiritual and temporal welfare. You have been the leader in every good work among us, diligent in the discharge of the duties of your high calling, instant in season and out of season for the good of all your parishioners and neighbors. You reject ease in us, and in us we feel as comforted in your presence. We ever felt that your whole sympathy went out towards all of us, whether members of your own church or other communions.\n\nIn leaving us we believe you will take a people to whom you have been dear, from our rural population. We sincerely congratulate the inhabitants of that rising town in your new field of labor amongst them. We know you will soon make many friends there, and in new building you will find a warm welcome. God-speed to your future labors there. If bar, we may be allowed to hope that on the page of your life hereafter there will still be a record of many a warm friend who will wish your leaving behind.\n\nIn name of the parishioners,\n\nWm. Clark, St. Catherine's,\nAlexander Macdonald, St. Andrew's\nO. E. Hutton, M.M.W.C., Chair-\n\nman of Presentation Committee.\n\nTo Rev. E. K. Matheson, Rural Dean of Carlton and Incumbent of St. Catherine's.\n\nIn landing Mr. Matheson, the address and remarks delivered by Mr. Hughson were fully sympathized with the sentiments he had just read. He had a high regard for Mr. Matheson and the recipient of his message was a brotherhood in which he had always considered Mr. Matheson, from his youth as a young man as one of the most promising of the congregations and seemed suited to lead amongst a people such as ours.\n\nMr. Matheson expressed his regret as he was leaving the district, and concluded with him well for the future.\n\nMr. Matheson said that the past year had been a time of spiritual gain to himself, and he trusted that God had been pleased with his efforts. He was now his lot to go forth to a land where he knew not. His Lordship the Bishop, who had been kind enough to give him the new town of Lethbridge, had selected him for the post, and although he professed to be personally acquainted with Lethbridge, still he wanted to send his prayers cheerfully and hopefully at the call of duty. But it would be a sin for him to endeavor to do anything but to serve the district and the people amongst whom he had lived and labored. He had recently taken a trip to the west and visited two congregations, both of which wished him to remain as their minister, but he declined. The minister expressed his gratitude for the opportunity afforded him by the congregation, and then read the address as follows:\n\nPRINCE ALBERT, Aug. 18th, 1886\n\nReverend Dear Sir,\n\nAs you are now about to leave this district, we wish to have no long interval with you and acceptance, the inhabitants of St. Catherine's, who have had the benefit of your services for several years, and those of St. Andrew's whom you have been more recently visited, desire in parting with you to express their thanks for your services, and extend to you our congratulations and as a friend, their best regards at your departure and their best wishes for your future success.\n\nWe bear willing testimony to the great value of your services and personal character as a man for spiritual and temporal welfare.
