All the churches now belong to the Diocese of Saskatchewan. The new Diocesan Board has been set up. They are to be commended as they continue to work tirelessly for the interests of all within their jurisdiction.\n\nThe next item of business was the election of delegates to the Provincial Council. It was agreed that they would be elected by the Presbyteries.\n\nAnother major change made by the Provincial Council was the establishment of a new Diocese in the northern part of the province.\n\nThe Bishop, who presided over the service, indicated that he was pleased with the progress made by the Diocese since its formation.\n\nHe called upon all members of the Diocese to continue to support the work of the Church in this challenging time.\n\nHe stressed the importance of working together as a united force in order to achieve our goals.\n\nThe meeting closed with prayers and hymns.\n\nBanking House\n\nMacarthur & Knowles,\n\nPrince Albert, N.W.T.\n\nThird largest Banking House.\n\nFrederick Parker, M.D.,\n\nRoyal College of Surgeons, London.\n\nKing's and Queen's Colleges of Physicians, Ireland.\n\nTHE MISSION.\n\nMcLean & Eldredge.\n\nB.A. Aelbrechtsen, Dr.\n\nPARKER'S FINERY.\n\nW.

Full information in regard to these lands will be given at the offices of the Company in Winnipeg and elsewhere.\n\nC. J. BRIGGS, Land Commissioner.\nCHI-CHAT LOCALS\n\nGathered for a chat.\n\nOn Sunday morning last, the Rev. Thomas Macdonald, Bishop of Battleford, was ordained to the order of the priesthood by the Lord Bishop of the Saskatchewan, who was represented by his Lordship.\n\nRevocation Notice.\n\nWe have been informed that a meeting will be held on Friday evening next, the 19th inst., in Mr. Foster's hall at 7.30 o'clock, of those who desire to assist in the undertaking referred to under the heading as suggested in our last issue. It is to be hoped that this will be a large and enthusiastic gathering of interested men and that our citizens generally will lend a helping hand so as to enable us an undertaking.\n\nNew Church Building.\n\nMr. James Treloar's new three storey building is now completed and forms one of the most striking features of the town. The ground floor is used as a spacious room, 35 feet by 56 is occupied by Messrs. W. & J. Smith, who have just started business. Mr. Elwood Johnson occupies a portion of the second floor, for his law offices, while Mr. J. C. Currie, French teacher, has his classes there.\n\nThe Surveyor.\n\nMr. J. H. Land, B.S., is still employed across the river with a large party laying off the land into townships and sections, but for what purpose we do not know. We have also heard that they have been made elsewhere by the authorities in Ottawa that they could not find any surveyors willing to undertake the work. We understand that Mr. Land will through his present contract, in about three months, be obliged to take further contracts, and would undertake to lay out thirty townships before April 1st, or he would have no excuse for delay.\n\nThe Telegraph.\n\nThe Telegraph poles are now being erected across the whole town, and the contractor has finished his work. We are greatly surprised that there will be no delay in the erection of the wires, enabling us to connect the telegraph, bringing the news and supplying the town for weeks. The company has been very generous for the work and advantages will be taken of it at once. We do not know whether Mr. Gibb, the telegrapher, will be able to get the new wires strung through the streets. It would be too late to install them now, as there is connection with the outside world, if we were left out in the cold for another winter. We trust that the company will be able to get the wires strung before the snow falls, and thus save considerable inconvenience.\n\nQuestion of Education.\n\nIn connection with the question of education, we are anxious to see that the bishop's scheme by the Bishop for the diocese was carried out. We understand that the funds obtained from private sources are all to be applied to the Bishop's Fund, the College Fund, and the Cathedral Fund according as the Bishop may think best for the present state of the work. The amount of the Bishop's Fund is stated to be approximately only about one hundred pounds sterling for Catholic or Diocesan Church purposes. We understand that the Bishop's Christian knowledge has voted \u00a3200 sterling towards the cathedral or diocese and church on condition that the \u00a3200 sterling is paid from our own funds. The cathedral question is postponed until this summer.\n\nMiss Mack & Co.\n\nWe would suggest to the clergyman of the different churches in Prince Albert the propriety of holding a joint prayer meeting throughout the town. They have been established for many of the principal heads of the religious denominations, and we think that such a meeting would be a great help to the religious life of the town. Independent of the religious question, it is in the public interest that the religious life of the town should be strengthened after (although, as journalists, we of course feel it was but their duty to look after the religious life of the town). If such a meeting were held, the members of the various churches would be encouraged to attend, and the religious life of the town would be strengthened.\n\nMEDICAL HALL.\n\nT. E.

HUGHES\n\n& Co.,\n\nGeneral Merchants\n\nAND\n\nIndian Traders,\n\nPRINCE ALBERT, N.W.T.\nWEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 17, 1885.\n\nCOMMUNICATIONS.\n\nOur Member,\n\nTo the Editor of the Times:\n\nSir,\u2014According to the old saw \"speech is silver but silence is gold,\" I desire to make a few remarks in this connection.\n\nThe meeting of the District of Albert, convened by Mr. Mackay, President of the North West Council, was attended by a thorough believer in the latter part of this proceeding. I have never been able fully to agree with any part of this proceeding. The Council has not seen fit to take any part in these proceedings which have been taken. There are two purposes involved in this organisation, the redress of grievances, and he appears to have been absent when this vote was taken. I am, therefore, satisfied with his conduct.\n\nFor these reasons, I do not propose to say anything further on this question.\n\nI am, Sir, yours respectfully, etc.,\n\nPRINCE ALBERT\n\nTHE MASS MEETING.\n\nThe public meeting of the inhabitants of Prince Albert and vicinity, which was held last week, was attended by a large number of the prominent citizens of the town. Mr. W. J. Murray was appointed chairman of the meeting, and Mr. Fitzkearside, secretary. Mr. Murray officially stated that the object of the meeting was to secure for Prince Albert the status of a incorporated town, the redress of grievances, and the right to vote.\n\nThe following resolutions were proposed at this meeting:\u2014\n\nWHEREAS the inhabitants of Prince Albert have been unable to secure the support of the Government in respect to the affairs of the town, and whereas it has been suggested that Prince Albert is unfit for incorporation, be it resolved that a delegation be sent to the Northwest Territories to secure the passage of legislation as above mentioned.\n\nAnd whereas, there is no question whatever whether Prince Albert will ever be incorporated, and whereas it is evident that the people of Prince Albert will never be able to secure the passage of such legislation, be it resolved that the people of Prince Albert are hereby united in their refusal to submit to the rule of any foreign power.\n\nTherefore resolved\u2014That we, the delegates, who meet here today, do declare that we are determined to resist any attempt to incorporate us under any form of government except that which we have heretofore enjoyed.\n\nAND WHEREAS, we have been informed that Prince Albert has always been refused the right to vote in respect to the matters above mentioned, be it resolved that we hereby declare our intention to vote for the incorporation of Prince Albert.\n\nRESOLVED\u2014That we hereby declare our intention to vote for the incorporateation of Prince Albert.\n\nRESOLVED\u2014That we hereby declare our intention to vote for the incorporateation of Prince Albert.\n\nPRINCE ALBERT\n\nTHAT FERRY CROSSING.\n\nTo the Editor of the Times:\n\nSir,\u2014I am on my way to Prince Albert and the ferry crossing on the Assiniboine River is now useless as the boat which used to cross the river is no longer in use, and the ferry which was formerly used is now out of service. It is probable that the boat will be sold, and the ferry may also be sold, as it is now impossible to get any passengers or teams across at this point.\n\nSTANLEY\n\nIn reference to the foregoing letter, I have to thank you for your kind offer, but I must inform you that I have never been at Stanley's Crossing since its opening, nor have I heard that any changes have been made in connection therewith.\n\nMr. Stanley is certainly justified in his letter, but I must protest against the manner in which it is written. It is unfortunate that such letters should be written as they are, and it is to be hoped that the citizens of Prince Albert will take measures to prevent such letters from being written in the future.\n\nSTANLEY\n\nITHINK THIS.\n\nTo the Editor of the Times:\n\nSir,\u2014I have but little faith left in human nature after reading your letter of the other day. You speak of a man named Mr. Stanley, and how he has been selling land at a great profit. I don't believe it, sir, and I can only say that if this is true, the man deserves all the trouble he has given me.\n\nPENNSYLVANIA\n\nA CARD.\n\nWe beg leave to state that we have again got our Factory in running order, and we have decided to reduce the price of planning and all kinds of shop work to suit the times. Factory building will be fitted up to their advantage to give us a good sale.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06", "created": "2025-10-06", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_sask_test/PTR_1883101701.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 6, "total-input-tokens": 9270, "total-output-tokens": 5798, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2445, 1], [2445, 2445, 2], [2445, 3979, 3], [3979, 15819, 4], [15819, 21392, 5], [21392, 25739, 6]], "primary_language": ["en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, false]}}]
