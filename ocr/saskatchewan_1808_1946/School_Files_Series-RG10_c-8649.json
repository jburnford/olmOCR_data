Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., Oct. 5, 1937.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to make requisition for lumber:\n\nThe flooring of the stalls in the Horse Stable is entirely worn through and must be replaced. It will require 800 lumber ft. for this purpose. The best price we can get for the lumber suitable for this purpose is at $48.00 per M, which amounts to $38.40.\n\nHockey is our main winter recreation. Our boys are becoming quite proficient and frequently play with other teams in this vicinity. We need lumber for a 2 foot fence around the skating rink. In looking into the matter we find a 12-inch board, undressed, which is a full inch in width, to be the most serviceable material we can secure. It requires 1,000 ft. to make this necessary fence 2 feet high around the rink. The stakes can be cut in the bush and drive them in the ground for our uprights to which we nail the boards. The cost of this lumber is $45.00 per M.\n\nThis makes a total bill of $83.40.\n\nWe will appreciate it very much if these two items of lumber can be supplied to us by the Department.\n\nI am, Yours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nOctober 12, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nEX'D.\n\nWith reference to your letter of October 5th, you may incur an expenditure of $3.40 for the purchase of lumber to replace the flooring of the stalls in the horse stable and also to erect a fence around the skating rink.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., July 6, 1938.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to enclose as requisition No. 9, account with Yates, Neale, & Co. for $32.45, for repairs to flush tanks in connection with this School. These have been giving us serious trouble lately, and the repairs were absolutely necessary and emergent.\n\nI am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle,\nPRINCIPAL.\nDear Sir,\n\nI quote from a letter just received from Dr. Doyle, Indian Residential School, Brandon, which refers to the need for new dining room tables -\n\n\"These tables were made of light and unsuitable material, had no braces whatever, and they were not in use many months until they began to need repairs. Most of them have now reached that condition that they are beyond further repair. Some of them will have to be replaced at once, and the rest in the very near future. I saw a table some weeks ago at one of the other schools which seemed very suitable and has stood up well, and got a quotation from Messrs Wade & Son for a table 2'6\" x 8', with cross bars between the legs at the ends, and a brace from these to a cross support in the centre of the table, with battleship linoleum covering, and angle iron in place of a molding around the outside of the table. The price they quote is $22.00 for a single table, or a job rate for the sixteen tables of $20.00 each.\"\n\nI know the tables are in bad condition and at least a number should be renewed at once. I would be pleased to receive the Department's instructions concerning this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nM. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nJuly 15, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 11th instant with reference to tables that the principal of the Brandon Residential School requests we supply.\n\nFor your information, I may say that in the current year's appropriation, we included an amount of $500 for repairs, improvements, and new equipment at the Brandon Indian Residential School. We have already expended an amount of $33.45 for repairs to the flush tanks, which leaves a balance available of $466.55. If we purchase 16 of the tables recommended by the principal it would involve an expenditure of $320.00.\n\nBefore requesting our purchasing agent to do so, I thought it advisable to write you in order that you might again consult the principal and advise him of the amount available, as if the tables are purchased it would only leave a sum of approximately $145 for further repairs and improvements.\n\nAs soon as you have the opportunity of discussing the matter with Dr. Doyle, you should let me know how many tables he wishes us to secure, and at the same time you should state the address of Messrs. Wade and Son from whom you recommend the tables be purchased.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter 133-0-5 dated July 15th, I wish to report that I was at the Brandon School on July 27th. Dr. Doyle was away on holidays. Unfortunately, I was not aware of this when I left Winnipeg.\n\nI had hoped that we might secure a good carpenter and rebuild the tables, but after seeing their condition and the inferior wood of which they had been constructed, this is out of the question. The tables are a disgrace to the institution and new ones should be provided. I might add that the benches being used are very little better than the tables.\n\nI am not sure that the plan of a table designed by Dr. Doyle is the most satisfactory. I would recommend that the Department draw up a blueprint giving specifications and that different firms be asked to tender. In designing the tables a strip should be morticed in both ends of the table top to prevent warping.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.F.C. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Brandon Indian Residential School, Brandon, Manitoba, Electoral District of Brandon.\n\nIt is necessary to build new dining room tables and benches for use at the above-mentioned school. I would appreciate if you would let me have the name of a competent carpenter who could be employed to do this work. We would like to have these tables and benches built as soon as possible and we would, therefore, like to know at the earliest possible date the name of the person to be employed.\n\nActing Director.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMinister's Office\n\nOttawa, August 19th, 1938.\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe - Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nReferring to your memorandum of the 15th instant, file 133-0-5, it will be in order for you to engage Mr. J.C.

Dr. J. Doyle,\nIndian Residential School,\nBRANDON, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe are pleased to quote on installing plumbing in the Indian school as follows:\n\nSupply and install -\n\n6. Industrial showers complete with hot and cold water connections. Build 2, 6' x 12' cement receptacles with shower drains, with all necessary pipe valves and fittings complete for the sum of\n\nTWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT DOLLARS ........... $288.00\n\nTo take out 7 - 5' bath, for these, we can allow you the sum of\n\n$ 70.00\n\nYours very truly,\n\nYates, Neale & Company,\n\nper Jas. E. Yates, (sgd)\nInspector Hamilton,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Inspector Hamilton,\n\nAs I stated in conversation the other evening, our water supply continues low. The reservoir on the hill has stood all summer about three feet below the top of the tank, which cuts off our supply for the flush box in the bathroom of our residence. We have had to use a pail all summer in this connection. We have been studying ways and means of lessening the consumption and find that children's baths take a great deal of water and frequently run us short on Saturday, and this shortage sometimes extends over Sunday. The bathing is done on Friday and Saturday as a rule. We find that Y.M.C.A.s and similar institutions have replaced the bath tubs with shower baths. We believe that if properly organized and supervised, we could get through our bathing each week with less than half the amount of water we now use. Then, there is no question that the showers are much more sanitary than tubs.\n\nI have taken the matter up with Yates, Neale & Company and had them estimate on taking out the four tubs on the boys side and three on the girls and placing three shower baths on each side. This of course necessitates fixing the floor and the drain so as to properly care for the water that is used. The enclosed letter is their estimate.\n\nI would appreciate very much your good offices in having this work cared for by the Department, if they approve of same.\n\nWe have just been checking over the tables and benches with a view of making what temporary repairs are absolutely necessary in order to carry on till new ones can be secured. We will be glad if this can be done soon.\n\nAgain thanking you, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.A. Doyle (signed)\nPrincipal\n\nJAD/GR/RS\nDear Sir,\n\nAttached is a copy of a letter received from Dr. Doyle, principal of the Indian Residential School, Brandon, in which he requests that bath tubs be replaced with shower equipment.\n\nDr. Doyle is of the opinion that a saving can be made in the use of water, if the showers are properly supervised. With the same supervision, no doubt a saving could be made under the present system, of bath tubs.\n\nWith the information now on hand and in view of the expense involved, I can not see my way clear to recommend this change. May I be advised as to the Department's wish?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G.

Previous shortages have occurred during January and February, but for the past three weeks, at intervals, we have been without water during part of the time. We turn off the water at nights, preventing the automatic flush of the toilets, and conserving any waste that might occur on account of leaking taps; and we have been hauling for most of the stock from Lake Percy.\n\nThe main spring to the north of the buildings here, which was investigated either two or three years ago, as far as we can see, seems to be flowing as strongly as ever, and it is the opinion of those who know the situation best, that if this supply were tapped, it would give us adequate water for all our purposes.\n\nWe are also endeavouring to find a new spring along the bottom of this elevation where the School is situated, hoping to get a supply for the stock without having to haul it the way we are doing at present.\n\nI will keep you informed from time to time in regard to the situation, as to whether it becomes better or worse.

For a week now we have been very short. No water has been coming to the horse barn or to the west barn which we have fairly well filled with cattle. We have dug a shallow well at the bottom of the hill below the School, and are getting enough water from it to supply the stock in these two barns. Instead of using the water which comes by gravitation for pupils' bathing, we are carrying it from the upper part of the building, off the pressure tank supply; and using just a pailful for each pupil. We shut off the water at night and are conserving it in every way possible consistent with health and reasonable cleanliness.\n\nWe will continue to keep you informed in this connection.

Doyle,\nPRINCIPAL.\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to acknowledge Department letter 133-0-5 dated November 19th and to report that I have discussed with Dr. Doyle, the principal of the Brandon Indian Residential School the question of a new garage.\n\nIt is necessary to build a garage large enough to accommodate one car and two trucks. The large truck is approximately 22 feet long from bumper to bumper. Consequently it will be necessary to have a building 24 ft. wide and 28 ft. long. This allows 8 ft. for each of the car and small truck and 12 ft. for the truck. The old garage is constructed of cement and, in my opinion, it is not a safe place to store cars. The location, I think, is the one most suitable. Therefore it would be necessary to destroy the present garage before a new one could be erected.\n\nI think the estimate of $1000.00 is high and I would suggest that a plan for a garage be drawn up and a price obtained from builders on the approved list at Brandon. I would be pleased to hear from the Department in this connection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.C. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa,\nDecember 30, 1936.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. VINCENT\n\nAt the Indian residential school in Brandon, Manitoba, a new garage is required to accommodate one car and two trucks.\n\nOne of the trucks is an ordinary size but the other is a large one being 22' long from bumper to bumper.\n\nTo accommodate the three cars in one building it is estimated that it would require a building 24' wide and 28' long.\n\nIt is possible, however, that they might be accommodated in separate buildings.\n\nI should appreciate your making inquiries and advising me what would be the cost of either one or three of the corrugated iron garages which are manufactured and can be set up in any place.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| DATE | PARTICULARS                        | FOLIO | TIME AND MATERIAL | GR. | TOTAL |\n|------|-----------------------------------|-------|------------------|-----|-------|\n| Dec  | 12 A.M.

J. A.

Are watering all the cattle at an open well we have dug at the bottom of the hill. This is not the best arrangement, especially when it is thirty below zero, but it may tide us through the rest of the winter without exhausting our supply altogether.\n\nI am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle\n\nPRINCIPAL.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe water situation here continues to give us trouble. A week ago today we were without any water from the spring.\n\nSome time ago we deepened the reservoir and extended the intake pipe down about fourteen inches, which now places the pipe which carries the water out of the reservoir about two feet above the bottom of the well. The water therefore has to siphon out while we are using that last two feet in the bottom of the reservoir. We therefore were without water after the supply was exhausted and air got in the pipe, until the water rose in the reservoir considerably over two feet, as air seems to get in the pipes somewhere and prevent the water running through until there was a fairly good head of pressure. We consulted Yates & Neale about having a valve placed at the bottom of the intake pipe that would automatically close before the tank was quite empty, thereby preventing air from getting in. They looked into the matter and suggested supplying us with a valve belonging to a type of force-pump which would cost together with float, over $5000. So we devised a scheme of our own and had them make it for us. It consists of an elbow on the bottom of the perpendicular pipe, a short piece of horizontal pipe, and another elbow facing up; then had a valve made to cover that opening with a fairly long shaft, a float attached to the end of it and so adjusted that when the water was within an inch or two of the opening, the valve would shut and prevent any more water from flowing until a fresh supply accumulated in the reservoir sufficient to lift the valve and let the water through.\nMemorandum\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nFollowing receipt of Mr. Phelan's memorandum of the 30th ultimo, File 133-0-5, prices were secured as requested on three corrugated iron garages f.o.b.

Hamilton,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI was glad to learn in our conversation yesterday that progress was being made in regard to securing garage accommodation here in the near future, as the situation in regard to the present garage is very much worse. The risk of collapse has become so imminent that we think it unlikely even a car or truck in for overnight. Some parts of the walls are in danger of falling in, the north wall and the north end of the roof have shifted considerably recently and the roof is so badly cracked that when the snow melts or it rains the water comes through freely.\n\nI would like very much if a garage could be built that could be heated, as in the extreme winter weather it is not only very difficult to get cars started but the grease and oil become so hard that it is injurious to the car during the time it is running until these become soft.\n\nI have checked up on the measurements and find that the two garages suggested 26' x 18' x 9' will accommodate our requirements, providing that one of them has a door space full 16' wide.\n\nThe tearing down and removal of at least part of the material of the present garage and the levelling up of the debris to make a fit foundation and floor for the new garage or garages will cost approximately $100.00.\n\nI would think it advisable that this part of the work be done as soon as possible as men could be secured more cheaply before the work of spring commences.\n\nWe would certainly appreciate getting this accommodation as early as possible as our large stock, especially, will deteriorate considerably if it has to remain out through all kinds of weather.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. A. Doyle, (signed)\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter 133-0-5 dated January 25th, and to say that I have discussed this matter with Dr. Doyle when in Brandon last week, and enclosed is a copy of a letter just received from him.\n\nYou will note that Dr. Doyle is quite prepared to accept the two garages 18 ft. wide, 9 ft. high and 26 ft. long, but points out that one of these must have a door space full 16 ft. wide.\n\nI would also draw your attention to the second paragraph of Dr. Doyle's letter, which I think should be given some consideration. I think you will agree that it would be practically impossible to heat a metal garage. It is also practically impossible to start a car in this country, during the winter, if the garage is not heated. The price of these two garages would be $692.00 and it would require approximately $100.00 to take the old garage down and prepare the site for the erection of the new buildings. This makes a total of almost $700.00 and we have two buildings instead of one which, to say the least would be very difficult to heat. I am still of the opinion that plans should be drawn up for a garage the size required and quotations obtained from firms on the approved list. If this were done, I doubt if there would be much difference in the total expenditure incurred.\n\nThe enclosures are returned herewith.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Inspector of Indian Agencies\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nManitoba.\n\nEncs.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., Feb. 14, 1939\n\nInspector A.G. Hamilton,\n526 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Inspector Hamilton:\n\nSince our conversation and my subsequent letter in regard to garage accommodation, we have had an intense and prolonged cold spell and have had the most trouble with our trucks that we have ever had in my experience here. It has been almost impossible to get the big truck started after a few days standing by the School with the temperature so far below zero as it has been. This condition would not be improved much if it were in a metal garage in similar temperature.\n\nWe have been casting about for any possible saving in the erection of a garage which could be heated and I am satisfied we have found a solution. I believe the best possible place for a garage on these premises would be immediately north of the present School building using the north wall of the Assembly Hall for the south wall and gable end of the garage. We could cut at least two feet off the width, making it thirty instead of thirty-two, facing west, and the front in line with the School building and twenty-six feet deep, as suggested in our previous plan. This, as you see, would save material and work for this south wall and gable. A lot of excavating would have to be done, which we would be able to do ourselves when the frost is out, probably immediately after seeding; in all nearly 300 yards of earth would have to be moved to make way for this building, and the suitable drive-way approaching both doors. This would move the earth back and leave the slope in such condition that it would not give trouble in the future in working in against the building. Then we could put a pipe through from the heating plant, installing a couple of radiators, and thereby be able to heat the building in the most economical way. The only addition that would be required would be a door at the east side, so that the wagons bringing vegetables to the root house could be driven through. It would also be a great convenience to drive a car through rather than back out the distance which\nInspector A.G. Hamilton.\n\nwould be required on account of the bank.\n\nI have taken the matter up with Mr. Spratling, and he thinks this can be constructed for about $675.00. There would then be the additional expense of wrecking the old garage. We would use some of the material out of this for the foundation and cement floor of the new garage. The above price includes the cement floor, and we would do the necessary hauling of material.\n\nIn viewing the matter from every standpoint, and in talking it over with the men of the Staff and others who are familiar with the situation, this seems to me to be the most feasible arrangement we could possibly make, and we will certainly appreciate it very much if this plan can be carried out.\n\nAs we are finding now, as also in the past, the intense frost has a tendency to deflate truck tires. Sunday morning we found five tires of the big truck practically flat, with no sign of puncture or leaking valves, and after working all morning to get the tires up and the truck going, it was too late to take our C.G.I.T. girls to a special service at Knox Church, in which they were to take part.\n\nI know you will give this matter sympathetic consideration.\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. A. Doyle\n\nPRINCIPAL.\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to refer to my letter 209-11 A.U. of the 9th instant, and to enclose letter just received from Dr. Doyle, together with a rough sketch of the Brandon Indian Residential School, showing the location of the proposed garage.\n\nI do not know if the Department would approve of attaching the garage to the rear of the school but if there are no objections, I think it would be well to give Dr. Doyle's suggestion some further consideration. It will be noted that he is prepared to do all the necessary excavating and grading, as well as hauling the sand and gravel so that the actual labour to be paid for would be merely for the erecting of the building, one wall of which is now the North wall of the school. If the garage were placed in the location suggested, there would only be a wall between it and the furnace room so that no difficulty would be experienced in supplying the necessary heat during the winter months.\n\nI would be pleased to know if the Department would consider adding the garage to the school as suggested by Dr. Doyle.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G.

It is a three-oven range with a large fire pot at the end. We have never found it possible, no matter how hot a fire we had, to heat the third oven. In fact the top of the stove at that end could not be kept warm enough to keep food hot enough to serve if left standing for any length of time. This meant that all the cooking and baking had to be done either in the first or second oven, and these were so different in the amount of heat they carried that many things had to be removed from one oven to the other, and to cook a dinner pots were continually moved up and down the stove. In addition to these difficulties in cooking the top plates on the stove have been warping and grates have been burning out at frequent intervals. The top of the stove covering the first two sections was seriously warped and both large plates so badly cracked that these have had to be replaced.\n\nA few weeks ago a Mr. Sutherland, Combustion Engineer, employed by one of the large coal companies, called in here with a friend of his. We recounted to him our difficulty and he recommended trying forced draft. When the new covers were being installed we had Messrs. McDowell & Doke make some temporary alterations and install a blower for a try-out, and now after using it for nearly a week we are satisfied that we have at last solved the problem of getting satisfactory and sufficient heat distributed in this stove to make it entirely efficient. The third oven is now heated just as readily, and at approximately the same temperature as the first one, and water can be boiled on any part of the stove.\n\nWe are now seeking your approval to go ahead and have this blower permanently installed. We had the blower for\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A.

After installing the float and valve we have kept a record of the amount of water in the reservoir just after breakfast each morning. During the balance of January it varied from eight to fifteen inches. During the last half of February the highest was ten inches and it stood at five a number of mornings. During the thirteen days in March, four mornings it was up to six inches, six mornings five inches, and the balance, four. We are continuing to conserve the use of water in every possible way but during a part of every day it is shut off entirely.\n\nI am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJAD/RS\nPRINCIPAL.\nOttawa,\nMarch 21, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant with reference to the kitchen range at the Brandon residential school.\n\nI note from the latter part of your letter that you estimate the cost of the repairs to the range at $112.00. Please let me know the name of the firm from whom you secured this quotation. As the cost of the material is $86.50 the matter will have to be submitted to our Purchasing Branch. It will, therefore, be necessary for you to forward full details regarding what is required as our Purchasing Agent may desire to secure quotations from firms other than the one from whom you secured a price.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Atkinson, of our Engineering staff, made an inspection of the water supply system and in his preliminary report stated that -\n\n\"there undoubtedly was an abundant supply of water in the vicinity as evidenced by the continued flow of a spring situated about 1,700 feet north of the school and 80 feet above it in elevation. The springs, which constitute the present source of supply, are 450 feet from the school and about 25 feet above its ground floor.\"\n\nHe is of the opinion that, since water is still available in this area, an attempt should be made to improve the existing collection system by excavation of the hillside above and level with the spring and also by installing additional tile intakes from the hillside to the spring or reservoirs, which could be done at a very reasonable cost. If this did not remedy the condition, then recourse could be had to the spring mentioned in the preceding paragraph as situated 1,700 feet north of the school.\"\n\nMr. Atkinson proposes to go into the matter further and we hope to let you have his final report in the near future.\n\nDirector.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., March 30, 1939\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 21, No. 133-0-5, concerning the kitchen range here.\n\nThe top sections of the stove were so badly warped, and one of them cracked entirely across, which made it necessary to secure new tops at once. When this work was being done, we felt it better to make the experiment in regard to the blower recommended by Mr. Sutherland, referred to in my letter of March 13. The experiment was entirely satisfactory and would have been carried on without making the matter permanent until we had further word from you, except for the facts that the undergrate was so seriously warped that the fire was running through into the ash box, not only wasting fuel but complicating the situation, then the blower we were using had to be returned, and we felt the only wise thing to do was to go ahead and have this equipment permanently installed. It is now completed and is working very satisfactorily. When the new grates were first put in, the openings were too small and had to be drilled out. This added somewhat to the cost. I had McDowell and Doke send an itemized statement, which I enclose herewith. There is one extra item of $2.50 included. There had never been a damper in the pipe leading from the laundry heater. When the laundry heater was being overhauled we had this damper put in.\n\nI am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A.

This will have to be met from school funds.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J. A.

Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., Apr. 11, 1939\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith by authority of your letter of February 28, No. 133-0-5, Voucher No. 2, in favour of Yates Neale and Co. for a total of $113.34 for the installation of new tubes in connection with the laundry boiler.\n\nI am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle\n\nPRINCIPAL.\nWesagaming, Manitoba,\nMarch 31st, 1939.\n\nT. S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering and Construction Service,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Brandon Indian Residential School, Water Supply.\n\nFurther to my report of the 1st instant on the above matter, I may say that I have again visited the school to make a more thorough investigation of the problem and in this connection I have the following to report:\n\nUpon a close inspection of the three concrete chambers referred to in my previous report, I found that conditions were as described, with one exception, the chambers are 6' x 10' x 10' in size, and have a capacity of 11,250 gallons, and not 18,750 as stated previously. As suggested in my previous report the construction of these tanks appears to be contrary to the best methods, and in my opinion the reason for a shortage of water is a result of this type of construction, and I would therefore recommend that the following work be carried out on these chambers, before any major expenditure is considered:\n\n(1) Since the three chambers are entirely open at the bottom, that is they rest on the sandy floor, I would suggest the use sheet pile, with 3\" built-up material, the south wall of the chambers. The material used should be 6' in length in order that it may be driven on the inside of each chamber.\n\n(2) In addition to this work I would suggest that a trench be dug from the South East corner and also from the S. West corner of the block of chambers. This trench would be excavated to a depth of 8', which is the depth of the floor, and would be about 40' in length, as indicated on the attached sketch. In this trench sheet piling should be placed, throughout its entire length, and back-filled with clay, not gravelly soil, of which the local soil consists.\n\n(3) To improve the flow to the tanks I would suggest that three lines of weeping tile be placed in the trenches indicated on the plan. I would suggest that these trenches be excavated to a depth of approximately 6', with of course a grade to the collection chambers, and I believe that it would be of considerable advantage if coarse screened gravel were used in the bottom of the trench, to a depth of at least one foot.\nI believe that this proposed work, if carried out, will result in an increase of water during the season of the year when shortages usually take place, but I would strongly recommend that every attempt be made to have this work carried out at the earliest possible moment, in order that the effect of the work could be determined, and not confused with the natural seasonal increase which may be expected quite soon.\n\nMy estimate of the cost of this work, is as follows:\n\n- Lumber 110' 3\" x 6' Approx. 2,000 F.B.M. $80.00\n- Labour, 150 hrs. @ .50\u00a2 75.00\n- Cement, 6 sacks @ 1.00 6.00\n- Excavation 150 cu. yds. Labour 200 hrs. @ 35\u00a2 105.00\n- 120 lin. feet weeping tile 4\" 15.00\n\nContingencies 20% approx. 56.00\n\nTotal $327.00\n\nYou will note by the sketch that we show an old trench, and in this connection I may say that an attempt was made some years ago to increase the storage capacity of the chambers by the placing of sheet piling in the approximate location shown. I am advised that this work was of some value, but it appears to me that the piling would be placed to better advantage on the higher ground.\n\nI sincerely hope that this suggested work will be of benefit if carried out, and if it were possible I should be very happy to look after the work for you.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nSgd. J. Atkinson,\nJunior Engineer.\nApril 14, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nRe: Water Supply Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nWith further reference to our report of the 29th ultimo in connection with the above matter, we have now received a fuller report from Mr. Atkinson, copy of which is attached. Copy of sketch plan, referred to in Mr. Atkinson's report, is also attached.\n\nAs mentioned in our memorandum of the 29th ultimo, there appears to be no doubt that there is an abundant supply of water in the vicinity and that a sufficient supply could be assured by piping same from a spring situated about 1700 feet north of the School. However, as this would involve a considerable expenditure, it is felt that further experimental development at the springs, from which water is now obtained and which are only 450 feet from the School, should first be undertaken.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Atkinson is apparently of the same opinion as he recommends development work at the present intake estimated to cost $337.00. It would seem that the suggestion should improve the situation and furnish a more generous supply of water. We, therefore, concur in the suggestion that work estimated to cost $337.00 should be undertaken. In this connection it will be noted Mr. Atkinson recommends that if this work is approved it should be carried out at the earliest possible moment in order that the effect of such work could be determined and not confused with the natural seasonal increase which may be shortly expected.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n19th April, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Brandon Indian Residential School water supply.\n\nIn regard to the above, I am forwarding a copy of a memorandum from the Chief Engineer together with a report from Junior Engineer Atkinson and sketch plan in connection therewith.\n\nFrom the correspondence you will note that Mr. Atkinson recommends, and the Chief Engineer concurs, that work estimated to cost $337.00 be carried out in connection with the present site of water supply.\n\nIt is also noted that Mr. Atkinson thinks this work should be carried out at the earliest possible moment in order that the effect at all seasons of the year may be noted.\n\nDirector\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev.

If, in the event of building this garage, it is the Principal's intention to give a contract to Mr. Spratling it will be necessary for you to let me know his full name and his address. If, however, it is intended to erect this building by day labour you may forward a requisition for the material required.

We have already expended slightly over $500.00 and the provision of $600.00 for the garage will exceed the amount specifically provided for this school.

Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen visiting a few evenings ago at the Indian industrial school, I was shown around by Dr. Doyle, the principal. Dr. Doyle is an exceptionally able administrator, as well as a successful principal.\n\nSeveral repairs and changes at the school are practically imperative without delay, in order to avoid greater expenditure later. The order of necessity would stand somewhat as follows:\n\n1. The water problem still remains. The development of a new stream has helped, but it is yet altogether insufficient for the residence. A small pressure tank at a cost of about $100.00 would be sufficient to overcome this difficulty.\n\n2. The garage, a heavy old cement structure, is falling to pieces. One of the staff will not risk his car in it at all. Repairs to this old tumbledown building are out of the question. The erection of a garage to be in readiness for the coming winter cannot be delayed. Dr. Doyle is most anxious that a workshop for the boys be installed over the garage. Heating facilities can be cheaply taken care of from the main building. The whole trend is in favour of manual training, and this cannot be followed without facilities.\n\n3. The school has entered upon honey production with every promise of success, and much to the interest of the scholars. There is a small building, old and unused, which, if moved to another location, would be made at little cost into a desirable bee house.\n\n4. The gym is over a rough workshop used for repairs to farm implements, etc. Entrance at present to the gym is quite unsuitable and dangerous. Outside stairs could be easily erected, and the present difficulty thereby eliminated.\n5. In several places, and particularly at the principal's residence, the eaves troughing is completely gone, and the foundations are being impaired.\n\n6. There is a very nice chapel, but the stage curtains are just about a thing of the past, and should be replaced. Only comparatively small curtains are required.\n\n7. A small sleeping balcony on the east end of the main building should be fitted with mosquito screening. For lack of screening, it is almost impossible to use the balcony at night.\n\n8. There is considerable interior painting that should be done at once during the holidays. This has been necessary for some time, and it would be false economy to disregard the need any longer.\n\nAll the above are vitally necessary, and delay in the work would, in my judgment, be a mistake. The main building is an excellent one, and in good shape.\n\nDr. Doyle is doing very fine work in this school. I was much impressed with the happy, animated expression of the boys and girls, as compared with the stolidity which one might expect.\n\nI would suggest that Mr. E. Fulcher, 402 - 22nd Street, Brandon, be asked to give you estimates on building and repairs, and that Crane Bros. and Geo. Hickling be asked for figures on painting.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) J. E.

If the Department sees fit to build the new garage at the back of the School which can be heated from the School plant it would seem to me the most feasible thing that a room above this garage could be provided for this phase of our work which I feel would greatly increase our school training.\n\nI talked this matter over a little while ago with Mr. J. E. Mathews, M. P. of Brandon, and I believe he has written you in this connection. My purpose in this letter is simply to state we will be glad to pay the salary of a full time man as soon as it can be arranged. The restoration of the Five Per Cent cut and the prospect of funds from a sale of the surplus of our Short Horn herd which we plan holding on September 27th, will improve our financial condition so that the payment of this additional salary will be made possible.\n\nI am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

A. Doyle. It is exceedingly difficult to make provision at this date for any additions or alterations such as the one suggested by the Principal. It would save our Inspectors and officials a great deal of trouble if principals of residential schools would only realize that our estimates are prepared prior to the opening of Parliament each year and cannot be altered except in the case of an emergency.\n\nI am anxious, however, that you should discuss, just as soon as you can conveniently do so, the erection of this garage with Mr. Doyle. I am deeply interested in the promotion of vocational instruction, but I am opposed, for a number of reasons, to an upstairs work-shop. I have learned from experience that such work-shops are wholly unsuitable for manual training. It is awkward and a great waste of time to get the lumber necessary into such buildings. Then again, the vibration caused by electrically operated machines is always a source of annoyance and always contributes to the deterioration of the building itself. If you consider a vocational shop could be established, provision might be made for the establishment of such a shop in the estimates of next year. The construction of the garage, however, should proceed at once.\n\nYour immediate attention to this matter will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A.

Atkinson, the Engineer who was in charge, that this work has been completed.\n\nIn his letter he states:\n\n\"In connection with the above project, I may say that I am of the opinion that the water supply as at present may prove to be adequate throughout the year, but from an inspection made by me recently, I would say that however much we may have improved the existing water system we cannot have solved the problem of water shortage as the Superintendent's residence is concerned. I have taken levels from the tank site to the Superintendent's house and in that there is only a head of approximately 25 ft. available in the top story of his residence, it is obvious that some other method of procuring a water supply is immediately necessary. In this connection I would suggest that a small pressure tank system be installed in the Superintendent's house. Since there would appear to be no reason why the Superintendent's water supply could not be connected to the existing tank in the school building, I may say that I have come into this matter, and as it would require the installation of a supply pipe from the school building to the residence, a distance of approximately 800 ft., and since this pipe would have to be carried below the frost line, I believe that the installation of a small pumping unit would be far superior to any connection to the existing pressure tank. The type of installation which I would suggest would cost approximately one hundred dollars, being a unit with a tank capacity of two hundred gallons and a one-sixth H.P. motor.\"\n\nThe amount provided under Vote 576 for this project was $337.00 of which $235.48 has been spent, leaving a balance of $101.52.\n\nJ.M.

Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nNovember 3, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle,\n\nWith further reference to the water supply at the Brandon Indian Residential School, enclosed herewith are copies of a report and plan submitted by Mr. Atkinson under date of the 28th ultimo.\n\nMr. Atkinson discusses the situation under three heads:\n\n(1) Wells - This would be feasible but would require the installation of pumping equipment and a water softener.\n\n(2) Extension of present source of supply - More water could be obtained but there is no guarantee that the supply would be adequate. This proposal is not favoured by the school officials but their opinions should not be the controlling factor in the case.\n\n(3) Development of springs 1,700 feet north of school - The estimated cost of this project, which would provide an adequate supply, is about $3,700.00. It is favoured strongly by the school authorities and Mr. Atkinson is of the opinion that it should be carried out at the earliest possible date.\n\nReferring to project (3), Mr. Gow in a letter dated October 24th, 1934, stated that this spring showed a substantial flow but that it was used by cattle, presented an unsightly looking source of water supply, and was badly contaminated. He estimated that the clearing up of the spring and improving of the water would cost about $1,500.00. The clearing up of the site and its protection from contamination do not appear to be covered in Mr. Atkinson's estimate. Moreover, if construction is undertaken now it will be under winter conditions with higher costs for all items of work.\n\nFrom Inspector Hamilton's letter of October 3rd last, it might be inferred that the situation was serious, yet Mr. Atkinson's wire of the 6th item stated that he had examined the system and found no shortage. The school may be operating under a handicap and the extension of the water supply system would undoubtedly be advantageous. However, the existing supply has served requirements for some time and the school has been able to function during this period when it has been one of the driest in the history of Brandon. Under the circumstances and in view of existing conditions we do not feel the expenditure for scheme (3) is justified at present. It is recommended that Engineer Atkinson be requested to investigate scheme (2) and furnish an estimate of cost for consideration.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ. M.

This, of course, is difficult to determine, as the season has been one of the driest in the history of Brandon, but in that the system is still short of water, the benefit, if any, was insufficient for the purpose.\n\nSince it is imperative that an adequate water supply be established, I investigated the available sources of supply, which are as follows:\n\n1. Wells.\n2. Additional work in the vicinity of the existing tank and springs.\n3. Springs to the North of the school, and at a distance of about 1,700 feet.\n\nRegarding a supply from a system of wells, or from a well, this is undoubtedly quite feasible, but any such scheme would necessitate the installation of storage tanks, and would also depend on pumping. In addition, the water is very hard and would necessitate the installation of a softener.\n\nI am quite convinced that more water could be diverted to the existing tanks by the construction of drainage ditches covering a larger area in the immediate vicinity of the existing water system supply tank. However, I would not suggest that this work be undertaken, as I am convinced that only one project will meet with the approval of the local authorities, and that is the project covered in the next paragraph.\n\nThe proposal to connect the school system to the springs to the North of the school has been advocated for a long time, and in that there is apparently an adequate supply for all purposes........\n\nT. S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering and Construction Service,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nfor all purposes at the school, especially when the existing system may be considered as a standby for this system, I am of the opinion that the installation should be made at the earliest possible date. I have, therefore, prepared a plan covering such an installation, and forwarded it to you under separate cover. The following is an estimate of the cost of the proposed work:\n\n| Item                  | Quantity/Unit | Cost   |\n|-----------------------|--------------|--------|\n| Tank Construction     | 37 cu.yds. @ 10.00 | 370.00 |\n| Forms                 |              | 40.00  |\n| Excavation            | 1,260 cu.yds. @ 6 per | 588.00 |\n| Backfill              | 1,260 cu.yds. @ .20\u00a2 | 252.00 |\n| Pipe Laying           | 1,700 lin.ft. @ .20\u00a2 | 340.00 |\n| Cost of pipe and      | 1,700 lin.ft. 4\" @ .75\u00a2 | 1,275.00 |\n| specials              |              |        |\n| Hauling Pipe          | 15 tons @ 2.5\u00a2 | 35.00  |\n| Supervision           |              | 290.00 |\n| Miscellaneous         |              | 500.00 |\n\nTotal: $3,690.00\n\nWith reference to the flow from the springs to which we propose constructing the pipe line, I may say that I did not measure the flow in the stream, but from a rough calculation based on a minimum cross section, I estimate a flow of at least 25,000 gallons per day.\n\nRegarding the proposed pipe size for the new line, I may say that it is based on the following:\n\n- Elevation proposed tank outlet: 188.0'\n- Elevation proposed discharge: 120.0'\n- Available static head in feet: 58.0'\n- Frictional loss in 1,700 feet of 4\" pipe with delivery of 40 G.P.M. is 0.22 x 17 = 3.74'\n- Pressure will therefore be 23.5 lbs. at the building.\n\nWith a 3\" pipe based on the same delivery, the available pressure would be 18.5 lbs.\n\nSince the upper story of the main building is about 40 feet above the discharge, it would seem wise to install the 4\" main.\n\nThe cost of the proposed system as submitted has been very carefully considered, but a very close check of all detail would be appreciated.\n\nI regret the fact that I was unable to mail on the 25th as promised, but I can assure you that every effort has been made to get the detail to you at the earliest possible date.\n\nFaithfully yours,\nSgd.

Atkinson, Resident Engineer, Riding Mountain Park, on the above water supply together with a covering memorandum from the Chief Engineer and blueprint in duplicate showing the present and proposed water systems.\n\nIt is noted that Mr. Atkinson is of the opinion that more water could be made available under the present system but that the officers of the Indian Affairs Branch do not approve of this system but prefer the scheme whereby water will be brought from the springs 1,700 feet north of the school.

Hamilton,\n528 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Inspector Hamilton:\n\nI regret exceedingly that I have been delayed this long in sending forward these estimates; but matters arranging for the sale and consequent details to be looked after when the sale was over, together with the visit of Dr. Dorey, have kept my time very closely occupied. The estimates are as follows:\n\nPaint for the halls throughout the building, the recreation rooms and reading rooms, 20 gal. @ $3.35 $67.00\n\nMoving building for a bee-house. This is the building back of the west cottage, which is not used since the hen house was removed, and could be made into a very suitable building as a bee-house. It should be placed on the site of the old stable just north of the old garage. The cement floor that is there could be used but additional floor would have to be put in. Mr. Spratling estimates that this would cost $100.00 which is more than I expected when in conversation with you on this matter. $100.00\n\nEavetroughing. The eavetroughs are gone on both the horsebarn and what we generally call the pig and sheep barn, and should be replaced as these are both bank barns and the\nrainfall gets in around the foundation. I had Messrs. McDowell and Doke make an estimate, which is $105.00\n\nManuel training building. As this could be placed on the new garage, the ground on the north side is on a level with the top of the garage, therefore entrance could be made and material brought in without stairs. The contractors assure us that the roof on this garage, which is cement, is strong enough to have a garage built on top if necessary.\n\nMr. Spratling's estimate for a frame building boarded outside, with paper and stucco, boarded inside with V-joint and paper, six windows, suitable door, rubberoid roof, $750.00\n\nGrates for the jacket heaters $50.00\n\nScreening in the porch at the east end of the building. $42.00\n\nNew furniture for the staff living room. $150.00\n\nHeating and plumbing. The valves on the radiators throughout the building are giving way and many of them have to be replaced immediately. Considerable repairs will soon be required in connection with the toilets throughout the building. Estimated requirements. $100.00\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. A.

The upper spring is some 1,700 feet north of the school and has an estimated flow of 28,000 gallons per day.\n\nTo undertake the installation of the pipe under winter conditions would cost $4,000.00, including material. Our Chief Engineer points out, however, that the installation of the new pipe in the frozen ground, under frost conditions, would have to be very carefully done as, with frost in the pipe, there is a possibility that the water would freeze just as soon as it reached the pipe. Eventually, the ring of ice would practically fill the pipe at various points.\n\nWhile the installation could be made, it seems advisable that it be deferred until the spring and water hauled to the extent required. It is very likely that the Indian Agent could obtain the loan of a water tank from the City of Brandon for the winter months and obtain water from the most convenient source of supply.\n\nIn the meantime, we will prepare a Bill of Material.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nDecember 4, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department has received from the Surveys & Engineering Branch several reports regarding the water supply at the Brandon Indian residential school. The last report suggests a possible expenditure of $4000.00. No provision was made for such an expenditure in the current year's appropriation and due to present conditions I am unable to state definitely whether or not this amount will be available in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1940-41.\n\nIn the last report the engineer suggests that if additional water is required it be hauled from the city of Brandon. We are advised that you could obtain the loan of a water tank from the city of Brandon for the winter months and you could then obtain water from the most convenient source of supply.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

I presume that he must have made a recent investigation of the water supply at this school because in Mr. Mills' memorandum of November 3 which was forwarded under cover of your memorandum of November 7 the following statement was made:\n\n\"Under the circumstances and in view of existing conditions we do not feel the expenditure for scheme 3 is justified at present. It is recommended that Engineer Atkinson be requested to investigate scheme 2 and furnish an estimate of cost for consideration.\"\n\nThe recommendation contained in your memorandum of November 28 is for scheme 3 which you will note was not recommended on November 3.\n\nThere are no funds available in our present year's appropriation for the expenditure mentioned in your last memorandum.\n\nWe are writing to the Principal regarding the suggestion contained in the last paragraph.\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

As I understand from a letter from Dr. Cochrane, that owing to the economy of expenditure made necessary by war demands, the Department would not likely go to the expense of additional building in the near future. As I stated to you the other day, I am now in a financial position to engage a manual training teacher for the first time since I have taken over the school here; and I am very anxious that this work should be initiated and put on its feet before my work here has terminated. I wish also to say that our recent experience in employing a woman to give full time and individual instruction to our girls in the making of all sorts of garments and clothing, including girls' winter coats, has been exceedingly encouraging. The girls are responding splendidly and doing much better work than was anticipated. I am sure the same results could be achieved with the boys.\n\nMy proposition is this. If the Department will allow us an increase of five in our pupilage, for the next school year it would put us in financial condition so that we could put up the building out of school funds. At the present time we have four on supernumerary, and this also helps toward the end which we have suggested. The building we would suggest could be placed on the new garage, as stated in my letter of October 6. The roof of this garage, is on a level with the ground on the north side and has sufficient strength to carry any weight that might be placed on it in this connection. It would have six windows, three on the east and three on the west, a suitable door for the north, rubberoid roof, would be a frame building with paper and stucco. Mr. Spratling's estimated cost is $750.00.\n\nAs far as equipment is concerned, plumbing would need to be installed, and light, also benches. We have a few tools and there would need to be some expenses for additions along this line.\n\nI quite realize the scarcity of funds, but if this can be done, I know it would be of great advantage to a large number of our boys in this school.\n\nTrusting it may receive favourable consideration, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. A. Doyle (Signed)\nPrincipal.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\nGD\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWINNIPEG, MAN., December 2nd, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttached is a copy of a letter just received from Dr. Doyle, Principal of the Indian Residential School at Brandon.\n\nI visited the school last week and was delighted with the splendid garage which has just been erected, which will accommodate two trucks and a car.\n\nThe entire building is constructed with cement, reinforced with steel. Dr. Doyle is very anxious to build another storey on top of the garage, bringing it to the level of the back of the main school building. He wishes this extra room in order that the Indian boys may receive a thorough course in manual training and that the more intelligent boys who graduate from the school be able to do any kind of carpentry work.\n\nThis is a training, in my opinion, which is sadly lacking in all our institutions and I hope some consideration can be given to Dr. Doyle's request.\n\nThere is no question, but that there is plenty of room in the dormitory of this school to accommodate the extra five pupils requested by Dr. Doyle. However, if the increased number of pupils is not possible would the Department consider erecting the addition to the building at the cost of $750.00 as submitted by Dr. Doyle.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

However, at the present time our appropriation for the current fiscal year is totally assigned and it is not possible to provide the amount that would be necessary.\n\nIn regard to the Principal's suggestion that the pupilage be increased I regret that this procedure cannot be adopted. We have similar requests from practically all Indian residential schools throughout Canada and we have been obliged to give all of them the same answer. In view of the above the erection of the vocational training building will have to be deferred until after April 1 next. It is hoped that funds will then be available.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Under these circumstances, and in view of the fact that a winter installation along the lines of plan 3 is not advisable, it seems best for the present to have the School haul additional water that is required.\n\nDirector.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev.

We are naturally very much disappointed that the work necessary to get a better supply of water is further delayed. We are conserving the consumption of water in every possible way, both in the school and by driving the cattle to surface water in the vicinity. Notwithstanding, the supply of water in the reservoir is continually standing at a lower level, there only being a few inches in the lowest part at the intake, and none at the outside of the tank.\n\nWe are now making provision to haul water to the stables from a nearby supply; but as we have a large number of livestock this is going to entail a great deal of extra work; and if the supply in the reservoir continues to grow less, as it has been doing, it will be impossible to haul sufficient amount for the school.

We dug another shallow well below the School, from which we get some water, and these two together give us almost enough for the livestock.\n\nDuring previous years, during the end of January or some time during early February, water has broken out in the cellar of the Principal's residence, but this year up to the present there has been no sign of any, and the supply from the spring grows gradually less and varies considerably. We have found this phenomenon existing ever since the supply began to seriously lessen, some days at the present there is very little water comes from this source.

The same condition exists at the Chapleau Residential School, Chapleau, Ont., and at Sandy Bay Residential School, Manitoba. This condition exists despite the fact that we have been spending large sums of money in recent years to provide an adequate supply of water at a number of schools. There is in the estimates of this year an item of $4,000.00 to pay for the system installed at the Shingwauk Residential School, Sault Ste. Marie, Ont. This work was undertaken and completed last year. I regret to state, however, that it was not possible to include in the estimates of this year the amount of money necessary to undertake the installation of water supply systems at Brandon or the other schools. The total amount included in this year's estimates for repairs and general upkeep at the Brandon school is $500.00.\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Crerar,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Crerar:\n\nPrevious to leaving for Ottawa I looked over some of the Dominion Government property, and more particularly the Indian Residential School. I there interviewed the Principal, Dr. J. A. Doyle, who I may say is in my judgment one of the most efficient administrators of whom I know. There are several matters in connection with the School that require attention, but with the enormous outlays now compulsory it will probably not be possible to take care of all of them.\n\nThe matter of water supply, however, is unavoidable and demands immediate attention. As a matter of fact the fire risk has reached an acute stage.\n\nThe large reservoir in the bank above the School which at one time afforded an abundance of water and was almost constantly overflowing, is now practically empty. The intake has been lowered and there is a very small trickle of water running down to the low level of the intake, and the large portion of the earth at the bottom of this reservoir is out of the water. A partial supply of water is taken from a well near the School, but in the case of emergency such as fire this would be entirely inadequate. I have no doubt that the Department has on file details concerning the water supply but I would strongly urge that there be no delay in having this matter receive attention.\n\nThere are two small matters which should also immediately be attended to; the eave troughing for two of the barns if neglected any longer will cost much more than at present. The estimated cost some time ago was down to $105.00, but to what extent the foundations have been impaired since then I cannot say.\n\nThe other matter is a very trivial one. The School has taken up bee-keeping with, I believe, a good\nmeasure of success, and the boys of the School have become greatly interested. It is not only a matter of instruction, but is even already a matter of revenue which will be increased constantly. Before proceeding it is necessary to move an old building and repair it to some extent at a cost of not over $100.00. If this could be done without delay, it would help the School very decidedly in bee-keeping efforts.\n\nI shall be glad to discuss these matters with you briefly at an early opportunity and I will again emphasize their urgency.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.

This building was intended to provide educational facilities for the children in that district owing to the destruction by fire of the main part of the Ahousaht Residential School on January 27, 1940. I have been in communication with Indian Commissioner MacKay and also had a recent interview with Reverend George Dorey, D.D., Associate Secretary, Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada, who has just returned from a visit to British Columbia.\n\nIt has been pointed out that the attendance at the Ahousaht Day School will not be large and that there will be available at this point two buildings, formerly used in connection with the Ahousaht Residential School. One of these buildings can be used for a classroom and the other for a teacher's residence. While these two buildings are situated approximately one-half mile from the village of Ahousaht, there appears to be no necessity for incurring expenditure in erecting another building when the two mentioned are available and will meet our requirements.\n\nUnder the above circumstances, I recommend that the money provided for the erection of a school at this -\nat this point be used for providing a new water supply at the Brandon Indian Residential School. In this connection I would refer you to Mr. Jackson's memorandum of May 28 and Mr. Pratt's memorandum of May 28, with regard to the communications received from Mr. J. E. Matthews, M. P.\n\nIn November, 1939, this Branch arranged with the Surveys and Engineering Branch to have one of their engineers proceed to Brandon and investigate the water situation. He has supplied a report indicating that an adequate water supply can be obtained for an amount not exceeding $4,000.00.\n\nWith the amount not used at Ahousaht, plus a sum of $500.00 included in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the Brandon School, we would have sufficient funds to do this work, which is apparently very necessary, as the school cannot operate successfully under the present water conditions.\n\nI would appreciate it if the Minister would grant the necessary approval.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Williamson\n\nMr. C.W. Jackson telephoned me today about the need for improving the water supply for the Indian School at Brandon. Evidently it is the intention of the Indian Affairs Branch to employ a foreman contractor and use Indian labour as much as possible. The job will involve an outlay of some $2,000.\n\nIt is understood that Mr. Atkinson, Resident Engineer at Riding Mountain National Park, reported on the project in October last and estimated the cost at around $4,000, but as I understand it this did not take cognizance of the use of Indian labour. We have been asked to have Mr. Atkinson proceed to Brandon some time next week and interview the Reverend Mr. Doyle, principal of the school, checking his figures on the job and the way that he proposes to have the work done. If the principal's scheme is approved it will be subject to regular inspections by Mr. Atkinson.\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. H.W. McGill,\nDir. of Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nRe - Water Supply, Brandon Indian Residential School, your file 133-0-5.\n\nWill you please refer to your memorandum of the 3rd instant in the above matter. The Minister approves of the necessary steps being taken to increase the water supply for this school. It has been suggested by the Principal that if he is given permission to do the work, the cost could be kept to around $2,000. You will recall that in the Fall of last year Engineer Atkinson, a member of the staff of the Lands, Parks and Forests Branch at Riding Mountain, made a report to the Engineering and Construction Service and estimated that the work would cost approximately $3,700. It is, of course, advisable that the work should be done under the supervision of a competent engineer, or at least under his direction. Therefore, Mr. Gibson has been asked to instruct Engineer Atkinson to call upon the Principal of the School some time next week in order that the latter may outline to him how he thinks the work can be done for the sum he mentions.\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nChief Executive Assistant.\nOttawa,\nJuly 25, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to the water supply at the Brandon Indian Residential School it has been brought to the Department's attention that you consider that if you are given permission to do the necessary work the development of the springs 1700' north of the school could be carried out at an approximate cost of $2000.00.\n\nArrangements have been made to have Mr. Atkinson call upon you in the near future with a view to ascertaining in what manner you consider the work could be done for the amount mentioned above. Following Mr. Atkinson's visit you will no doubt report to this Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J. A.

With practically all our senior boys graduated and gone we have not enough help left to carry on the necessary work on the farm without hiring additional labor. Then I have had the misfortune to meet with a car accident suffering with some broken ribs and severe bruises this has brought back an occurrence of gall bladder trouble which I had in the spring and had for some months subsided. It looks now as if an operation was imminent. I have planned not to take holidays this year in view of the possibility of this operation. Under these circumstances I could not be sure of giving a project of this kind the uninterrupted and detailed attention which it would require.\n\nI can assure however that we will be glad to co-operate in any possible way in getting relief to the water situation which continually grows worse.\n\nI am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle.\nMemo for Mr. Heaslip\n\nRe - Water Supply\nBrandon Indian School\n\nAs requested, I have visited the above mentioned school in connection with the suggested revision of my original estimate of cost of proposed work because of the suggested use of Indian labour and a foreman contractor. In connection with this matter, I may say that I have interviewed Doctor Doyle, the Principal of the Indian School, and requested any further details which may have a bearing on the actual cost of the job, and he advised me that since all the senior boys have been graduated there is not and will not be any Indian Labour available for the proposed work. Dr. Doyle also informed me that he has no qualified foreman available for the job in mind.\n\nI told Dr. Doyle that from our letter of instructions, it appeared that he had suggested that the work could be carried out at a reduced cost to that of my estimate, and he assured me that he had arrived at this conclusion from conversations with certain local contractors only and not by any actual estimating method. I further suggested to Dr. Doyle that the situation with regard to the whole matter is still exactly the same as at the time of my original estimate, and he agreed with me.\n\nI did, however, suggest to Dr. Doyle that since I had made the original estimate in October, 1939, and anticipated doing the work at that time of year, that my estimate might be reduced. After due consideration of my original figures, however, and taking into consideration the swampy nature of the ground in the vicinity of the proposed tank site, also parts of the intake line, I would only suggest the reduction of the item \"Miscellaneous\" by $300.00, making the revised estimated cost of the work $3,390.00.\n\nI shall be glad to supervise this proposed work if and when it is carried out.\n\nJ. Atkinson\nResident Engineer.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. H.W. McGill,\nDir. of Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nRe - Water Supply, Brandon Indian Residential School, your file 133-0-5.\n\nWith further reference to my memorandum of the 20th ultimo, I am now enclosing herewith a copy of a report made by Engineer Atkinson, the Resident Engineer at Riding Mountain National Park. It would seem that it will not be possible to have the work done for much less than the original estimate. It will, therefore, be in order for you to place the matter at once in the hands of the Surveys and Engineering Branch so that the work can be carried out along the lines suggested in Mr. Atkinson's report of October 28th, 1939. You can advise Mr. Wardle that Mr. Gibson will make the services of Engineer Atkinson available to his Branch to supervise the construction work.\n\nMr. Matthews, M.P., has suggested that Edward Fulcher & Company, Brandon, might be asked to quote a price on the total job. Mr. Fulcher is a competent contractor and would have the necessary equipment to do the work.\n\nC.W.

Atkinson dated October 28, 1939.\n\nRecently the Chief Executive Assistant arranged with Mr. Atkinson to again visit the Brandon School and he has submitted a report in which he states that the estimated cost of $3,590.00 could be reduced by $300.00 making the revised estimated cost of the work $3,290.00.\n\nArrangements are being made to transfer this amount to your Branch and it would be appreciated if you would arrange to have this work done at the earliest possible date. I am directed to advise you that Mr. Gibson, Director of the Lands, Parks and Forests Branch, will permit the services of Engineer Atkinson to be used for supervision of the construction work.\n\nMr. Matthews, M.P., has suggested that Edward Fulcher & Company, Brandon, Manitoba, might be asked to quote a price on the total job.

Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., August 15, 1940\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSince taking over this School I have always felt that we should have Fire Extinguishers for our barns. A short while ago Mr. William J. Norman direct Factory Representative of the Pyrene Manufacturing Company of Canada called at the office here and after talking the matter over with him I recommended that he interview Inspector A. G. Hamilton of Winnipeg. I have now received a letter from Inspector Hamilton enclosing a folder and suggesting the advisability of having three of the five gallon pump pipe extinguishers as marked, one for each of the three barns.\n\nWe will appreciate if the Department will provide us with these Extinguishers. They are approximately $12.00 each F.O.B., Winnipeg.\n\nI am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, August 22, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 15th instant, in which you suggest that fire extinguishers be supplied for use in the barn at the Brandon Residential School.\n\nThere is nothing here to indicate that it has ever been the practice of the Department to supply extinguishers for stock barns, and of course our funds this year have been drastically reduced. In view of this fact, I am communicating with Inspector Hamilton and asking him to make a specific recommendation with respect to these extinguishers.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend J. A. Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, August 22, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from the Reverend J. A. Doyle, Principal of the Brandon Indian Residential School, in which he suggests that this Branch purchase and supply to the school fire extinguishers for the cattle barn.\n\nA circular attached to the Principal's communication indicates that these extinguishers are reasonably inexpensive and cost approximately $1.5 each, f. o. b. Winnipeg. There is nothing on file here, however, to show that it has been the practice of the Department to supply fire extinguishers for use in barns.\n\nYou might, at your convenience, advise the Department if these extinguishers, in your judgment, are really necessary. Is this barn at Brandon supplied with electrical energy or ordinary lanterns? I am always somewhat suspicious of these requests. The fact that we are at war does not appear to prevent high pressure salesmen from visiting our residential schools regularly. I should like to have a definite recommendation from you with respect to these extinguishers.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., August 20, 1940\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI was very glad to hear through my friend Mr. J. E. Mathews, M. P. that definite action had been taken in regard to the water situation in connection with this school. I felt however I should let you know that the situation continues to grow much worse. The spring from which we were getting a partial supply for the live stock has dried up entirely. The well that we opened up at the back of the horse barn from which we got a good supply during the winter does not yield enough for more than three or four horses. We are driving the most of the cattle to a ravine north of the school and hauling water for those required to be kept in the stable. We are getting practically no use from our frigid-aire plant as the supply of water which it requires is so limited and intermitting. It is unsage to leave this plant in action unless we are assured of a constant water supply.\n\nIn about a week the pupils will commence returning from holidays and the need for more water will be increased, making the situation more difficult.\n\nWe certainly will appreciate as early action as possible in securing a new supply of water and will be glad to cooperate in any way we can to facilitate this work.\n\nI am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle\nPrincipal\nOttawa, August 23, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 20th instant in which you state that the need for a greater supply of water at the Brandon Residential School is becoming a very urgent matter.\n\nI have been absent from the office as a result of illness and consequently have not been following the negotiations relating to the water supply at your school, and Mr. Phelan, my assistant, is at this date absent from the office on his annual holidays. The files indicate, however, that the Surveys and Engineering Branch of the Department were authorized to proceed with the work, in a memorandum sent forward to them on August 12. The amount of money necessary to undertake and complete this work was also transferred to the Surveys and Engineering Branch at that time. In addition to this, I have been in touch with the Surveys and Engineering Branch this morning, by phone, and have sought to impress upon them the desirability of undertaking this work at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend J. A.

He returned in a little while to tell me that no water at all was available, therefore this test would have to be postponed. If a fire should occur it might happen when water was not available.\n\nI am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter 133-0-5, dated August 22, and to report as follows:\n\nThere are three large barns at the Brandon School, in which are housed some splendid stock, and each fall a large quantity of feed.\n\nTwo years ago a fire occurred in the horse barn and but for the fact that prompt action was possible and the experimental farm assisted, I fear that a high-priced barn would have been lost. It is thought the fire started from the overheating of new hay and instant combustion took place.\n\nThe buildings are wired and electric lights are in use, but I do not think this is sufficient guarantee of safety. I would recommend three fire extinguishers, one for each barn, and I understand these will cost about $12.00 each, F.O.B. Winnipeg.\n\nI know that in these times, should a barn be lost it cannot be replaced because funds are not available. It is therefore most important that we take what precautions we can. I think this small expense is well worthwhile.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G.

ROEY:\n\nWhile on my holidays I had an opportunity, without any expense to the Department, of inspecting the under-mentioned residential schools:\n\n1. Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nI was at Brandon on August 27 and went over all the buildings with the Principal, Rev. J. A. Doyle, D.D. I found everything in good condition and it should not be necessary to expend any large amount on repairs for some time. The Principal was anxious regarding the water situation and I advised him that as far as we were aware the necessary work would be done in the near future.\n\nDr. Doyle will reach retirement age in 1941 and expects to leave the Indian work at that time. When the present Brandon school was erected in 1929-30, a principal's residence was not provided, due to the fact that it was considered at that time it was unnecessary to replace the principal's residence, which had been in use for some years. At the present time this building is in very bad repair. Apparently, it is gradually sinking and as a result the floors are warped and the plaster is continually falling. There is no basement under this building, although some years ago a small space was dug to provide for a furnace. In the event of a new principal being appointed next year, it is quite likely we will have a request for extensive repairs to the present building or a new building. At that time the whole question should receive very careful consideration. The present building is extremely large, in fact much larger than is required for a principal's residence at a residential school. Instead of expending the large amount that would be necessary to repair the present building, I am inclined to feel that it would be preferable to erect a new principal's residence.\n\nS. V.

We have covered the halls on the main floor throughout four feet high, the assembly hall walls seven feet, platform walls to the ceiling, the two reading rooms, two bedrooms and phone office on the main floor, halls complete in basement, the engineer's room, basement bath room, and the dining room five feet high, also the dispensary on second floor. There is now such a contrast with what we have done and what is not done we feel we should go ahead with about as much more painting. Both recreation rooms and the adjoining bath rooms and toilet rooms need it badly, also all the halls on the two other flats, both small dormitories, and a number of the bedrooms. It will take at least another fifty dollars worth of paint to cover all this work, and we are hereby making application for same.\n\nSome of our boys are becoming quite proficient at painting.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

Thompson Ferrier took with him furniture valued at $500.00 which was the amount of furniture he supplied of his own when he became Principal about 30 years previous. This left the house considerably depleted, and as we had a good deal of furniture of our own we used this and purchased from our own funds what additional furniture we required.\n\nMy successor, Rev. R. T. Chapin, is here at the present time and we have gone over the furniture situation together, and as the School residence at Norway House has been furnished they have no furniture of their own; and after looking carefully into the matter the following is the furniture required to meet the situation at present:\n\n- Chesterfield and two chairs (probable cost) $125.00\n- Living room table $15.00\n- Two occasional chairs $30.00\n- Bedroom suite - 3 piece $80.00\n- Mattress $20.00\n\nTotal $270.00\n\nTrusting that the supplying of this will meet with your approval,\n\nI am, Yours respectfully,\n\nJ.

Our estimates were prepared several months ago and have not been submitted to Parliament. My understanding is that supplementary estimates will not be considered. Under these circumstances you can understand how difficult it is to consider expending the amount you mention for furniture when no provision was made in our current year's appropriation. If the furniture mentioned in your letter were bought it would mean that only the difference between its price and the $500.00 in the appropriation would be available for repairs and improvements at the Brandon School during the current fiscal year.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would give the whole matter further consideration and let me hear from you again.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

In a season when the mosquitoes are bad this balcony is practically useless. Some time ago we secured estimates on the screening of it in and the lowest figure we got was $45.00. We find in figuring the matter up today that we can purchase the material necessary for $16.00. We would appreciate it very much if the Department would allow us this amount for this purpose, and we will do the work in connection with the School.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A.

While these show the position of electric outlets they do not show the detail of wiring, which was what I was desiring when I asked for a copy of the working plans.\n\nI would like to know the position of the wiring to see if it is possible to make any changes. E.G. there is no switch to the lights in the laundry. The laundress has to get a chair and grope for the first drop light. Then she can see to reach the others with a chair. (2) Contrary to the blue prints you sent, the switches for the children's dining room are in cabinet No.1, which is located on the boys' side. The kitchen matron, to put the lights on in the dining room, has to go through the dark dining room, unlock the door into the boys' basement hall and turn the lights on from the switches there, and the reverse in turning them off. (3) Coming into the building at night, to get a light in the entry or hall you have to grope down to the end of the hall to the switch cabinet.\n\nIf it were possible I would like to have these and a few minor features rectified, but without knowing the position of the actual wiring it will be difficult to figure out just what can be done. Hence I hope that a copy of the \"working plans\" of the wiring may still be available.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nR.T.

T Chapin, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nMr. A. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Hamilton:\n\nIn reference to the repairs about the School here which we looked over at the time Dr. McGill and yourself were here, I beg to submit the following estimates and suggestions. Contractors have been so busy around here with R.A.F. work that it has taken a little time to get information from them.\n\nRe the roof. The firm of McDowell and Doke examined the roof with me and we found that on many parts of the roof the tar and gravel had completely washed away leaving the roofing paper exposed and already showing signs of weathering. This type of roof I understand should be retarred within ten years, but it is now 12 or 13 years since the roofs were put on. I concur in their recommendation that the entire roof should be cleaned of gravel and re-coated with tar and gravel. The flashings around the edges have in many places worked loose and these will need to be reset and rechinked. At one place on the main roof the roofing paper has split from one side of the building to the other along one of the two ridges. The other ridge needs reinforcing before it likewise splits. Around the hopper on the Chapel roof the paper has become damaged. In these two places the building now leaks.\n\nTheir estimate for all of the above work is $390.00. If funds are not available this fall to do the entire roof I would suggest that the two places be repaired and recoated at once and the balance of the roof finished in the spring. This immediate repair work would take about $50.00.\n\nRe the barn. The H.D. Spratling Co. looked over the barns with me. He recommended that the rotted portion of the sills and timbers be cut away, a cement wall be built up about two feet on top of the old foundation, the timbers reset in this wall, the side wall be straightened where it had sagged, new floor joists be put in under the driveway and the other lot of joists spliced with new pieces, and the floor renewed when...\nrotted through. He estimated the cost of all this would not be more than $175.00.\n\nWe examined the shingles and found those on the south side including the extension in very bad condition, beyond repairing. Mr. Spratling thinks that the north side could be repaired to last a few years, but he estimated the shingling would cost about $400.00.\n\nIt is imperative that the wall and floor of the barn be done at once, but I would suggest that if the funds are not available this fall the shingling might be left over until next spring.\n\nRe the chimney on the Principal's residence. This of course is imperative and his estimate was $25.00 to rebuild the chimney from the roof up.\n\nRe the pig-pen, Mr. Spratling is working on estimates for two different ways to overcome the difficulty. As soon as I receive them I will forward them to you, and I hope something can be done about it this fall.\n\nThere are some other things around the place that I would like to have fixed up next summer. How soon should I have these items and the estimates of their cost in to you?\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) R. T. Chapin.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe enclosed letter has just been received from Rev. R. T. Chapin, Principal of the Brandon Indian Residential School, in connection with various repairs required at the school.\n\nI recommend that the roof be repaired at a cost of $60.00, and provision be made for the completion of this work in 1942.\n\nThe barn is in poor condition, and unsafe. This is very essential work and I think the figure of $175.00 is reasonable for the repairs required. If this is left much longer, some boy will be hurt or some valuable stock injured. The barn is well worth repairing.\n\nThe shingles should be provided for in next year's estimates. A poor roof makes almost a useless barn.\n\nThe chimney on the principal's residence is about to fall down, and should be repaired at once. The estimated cost is $25.00.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa, September 5, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th ultimo, the following expenditures at the Brandon Indian Residential School are approved:\n\n1.

Chapin, B.A.\nPrincipal\n\nBrandon, Man., November 13, 1941.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing an account, the first half of which, $28.35, is not exactly in order; but for which I am asking permission to issue a voucher.\n\nThe floor drain in the Boys' Washroom has been giving trouble some time. We have worked at it until finally last month it blocked in spite of anything we could do. With water on the floor we had to do something immediately, and called the plumber, Yates & Neale. They could not get it open, but had to take the floor up, open the pipe, clear up the obstruction and repair it putting in a new floor strainer. While they were here we had them clear the drain from the slop sink on the first floor, which had also plugged. This accounts for the work on the 8th. At the same time our water pump ceased to operate. We took it apart to find the trouble and found one of the water pistons had broken loose, the thread completely worn off. Fortunately Yates & Neale were able to get us a new piston the next day. This accounts for the item $4.75 on the 9th. The copper bucket on the same date was for the steam trap of the laundry dryer which was not operating properly, letting the steam escape as well as the condensed water.\n\nAs you will see the above repairs had to be attended to immediately and while I realize we should have had permission to do the work first, I am asking if under the conditions we may be allowed to send a voucher for the above amount.\n\nThe amount for the welding repairs on the boiler has already been taken care of.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.T.

This was endangering the outer foundation of the building, so upon consultation with the contractor we put in a cement wall at the back of the coal bin, which also acted as an abutment to hold the earth from giving way underneath the foundation of the building at that point. We hope it will be in line for you to include this amount in the total bill.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.T.

It would help in the orderliness of the work to have further cupboard room. I am enclosing a drawing of the third floor hall, and of a cupboard I would like to build in this hall as indicated.

We were able to patch them to his satisfaction for the winter, but they must be renewed before another season. I had McDowell & Doke, Brandon, looking over the work, and they gave us an estimate of between $95.00 and 100.00, to replace the above pipes. They state they have the material on hand at present to do the work, and urge that we have it done immediately as they are having such extreme difficulty in getting further material. May we have authority to have this work done and have it done immediately.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.T.

Chapin,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn accordance with our previous conversation, we have prepared a sketch and estimate of the work which should be done on the electrical distribution system of your School. We are enclosing herewith, also, a sheet of symbols which should enable you to interpret the sketch.\n\nThe work to be done, as we agreed, is listed as follows:\n\n(1) Pole 2 to be removed and replaced by a new 35 ft. pole about 50 ft. north of present location to skirt preposed Girls' Playground.\n(2) Same as Item (1)\n(3) Guy and anchor removed and attached to opposite side of Pole 4.\n(4) Pole 6 moved 10 ft. north, approximately, to straighten line and clear evergreen tree.\n(5) Poles 7, 8, and 9 to be replaced by new 30 ft. poles in view of deterioration of present poles.\n\nIn addition to above, we have noted one or two other poles to be replaced near the barns; some tree trimming and wire tightening to be done; and a few other improvements to be made. The total cost of all this work is $179.30.\n\nWe suggest that you communicate with your department and recommend that this work be done in the interests of safety.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMANITOBA POWER COMMISSION\n\nElectrical Engineer\nIndian Residential School\n\nBrandon, Man., June 9, 1942.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing correspondence which I have just received from the Manitoba Power Commission, in reference to our distribution system within the School property.\n\nA short time ago the electrical engineer and head linesman were here because of a blow-out through lightning. They pointed out to me that in one place particularly, the line was in a very dangerous condition, and so we went over the whole distribution system. At one point between poles 1 and 2, wires are so low that you can almost reach them with an unstretched hand. The insulation on the wires is becoming so old and worn that in some places it is breaking away, leaving the wires in a very dangerous position. By putting a higher pole in at number 2, and moving it to a little higher ground to the north, this danger can be eliminated. I asked them of the possibility of running the wires at the edge of the girls' playground, instead of across it, with the pole in the centre of the playground. This they measured out and considered very feasible indeed advisable, replacing pole number 3 with a higher pole to the north. Near pole number 6 a large shade tree on the edge of the lawn is growing into the wires, and to eliminate danger from\nthe high voltage wires, this would either have to be cut out or pole number 6 moved farther north. They recommended this latter, as it would also straighten the line. Poles 7, 8 and 9 are deteriorating beneath the ground and becoming somewhat shaky. Likewise two poles near the barns need replacing. The good part of pole number 3 could be used for one of these. So a total of six new poles is required. They are making us allowance for the old poles, as the top parts of them could be utilized in some of their other work. As they pointed out, where we have so many children, it is in the interests of safety to keep the line in good condition, and I would recommend that the improvements be carried on, and ask for authority for them to proceed with the work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRTS/TS\nOttawa,\nJune 13, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to the work which should be done on the electrical distribution system at the Brandon Indian Residential School. It is noted that the Manitoba Power Commission has estimated that the necessary work can be done at a total cost of $179.50. Funds are available for this purpose and you may arrange to have the necessary repairs made as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. R.T.

As you can see there is considerable work involved. The Inspector had Mr. Yates of Yates & Neale, plumbers, and also a Boiler Maker out here, to look over the work with him. Their conclusion was that either a new boiler would need to be installed, or the head of the present one replaced. They thought it might be possible to secure a used boiler in good condition that would not cost any more than putting a head in the present boiler. Mr. Yates and Mr. Moodie were going to see if they could locate one and let me know. I will report further to you as soon as I get definite word. In the meantime may we have permission to have the other work done by Yates & Neale?\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRTC/TS\n\nIndian Affairs.

We have recently been informed by the Purchasing Division that it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure such supplies. If a used boiler in fairly good condition could be secured, such a boiler, no doubt, would meet your needs for the war period at least. In the meantime you are authorized to have the other repairs undertaken by Yates & Neale.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend R. T.

Mines & Resources,\nLangevin Block,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Clarence:\n\nI called over to the Indian School yesterday to see Mr. Chapin, whom I had met for only a minute a year ago. He seems most anxious to give good service along all lines.\n\nI was glad to find that the added water supply is fairly satisfactory. Without that, they could not have carried on.\n\nDiscussing the property, there are of course several major improvements necessary, those to the residence, or a new residence, being just about imperative. Mr. Chapin realizes the present war difficulties, and no one could be more willing to co-operate than he. There are, however, some minor repairs which should be made without any delay so as to avoid further depreciation. No doubt the department has a list of those on file. The roof of the school, for instance, can be repaired now for a much smaller outlay than would soon be necessary. It is steadily deteriorating. There are several other minor matters which a capable man should be able to correct within a reasonable time, and undoubtedly the residence calls for attention before winter sets in.\n\nCapable men are difficult to secure here, at present, but I imagine if you were to take the matter up with Ed. Fulcher, 403-22nd Street, he could locate a suitable man.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Sgd.) J.E.

Matthews, M.P., recently visited the Brandon Residential School and, in a letter to the Department, states that the roof of the school requires repairs, also that there are other minor repairs required. It would, therefore, be appreciated if you would visit the school at an early date and let me know exactly what is needed. We have already expended approximately $600.00 for repairs and new equipment at this school this year. We do not appear to have any correspondence on file regarding the roof. It might be advisable, when you are visiting the school, to suggest to the Principal that such matters should be brought to your attention.\n\nIn his letter Mr. Matthews also refers to the Principal's residence. I am aware that this is in bad condition but unfortunately no heavy expenditure can be made at the present time. However, if there are minor repairs that would improve this building, the Department is prepared to consider them. I should appreciate hearing from you as soon as you have an opportunity of visiting the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The condition of the roof has not previously been reported to us and Inspector Hamilton is being instructed to ascertain definitely what is required. I note your recommendation regarding Mr. Ed. Fulcher, 403 - 22nd Street, Brandon.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nJ.E. Matthews, Esq., M.P.,\nBrandon, Man.\n\nPP\nDear Sir,\n\nAs requested in your letter 133-0-5, dated October 27th, I investigated into the repairs required at the Brandon Indian School and would report as follows.\n\nThe roof does not leak at present and the repair work required should be left until the coming spring. Mr. Chapin submitted a request for this work in August 23, 1941, a copy of which was forwarded to Ottawa under cover of my letter of August 26th. Mr. Chapin gave a quotation on the work as submitted by McDowall and Duke, for the amount of $400.00. This figure covered certain repair work to the roofing, re-tarring and re-gravelling. This work as stated above should be done in the spring, otherwise if left, it may be necessary to renew the roofing and this would entail heavy expense.\n\nThe barn needs reshingling on the south side. It will require approximately forty thousand shingles. It is too late to do this work; but Mr. Chapin stated he would arrange to have the shingles put on early in the spring if the shingles and nails were supplied. He suggested the purchase be made at once, otherwise the material might not be available in the early spring. I would recommend the purchase of the shingles and nails on the distinct understanding that the labour required be provided by the Principal.\n\nThe Principal's residence is in poor condition; but the building does not justify the outlay of heavy expense. Mr. Chapin felt he could carry on for the present but pointed out that next spring new screens would be urgently needed. The old screen frames are so badly rotted they are past repairing.\n\nI would recommend that a plumber be sent to the school to do the necessary repairs to the flush tanks - the working parts in connection with the floats are badly worn and in many cases new parts are needed. At the same time he should check all water taps and those past repairing should be replaced with spring taps, if they can be obtained. I make this recommendation because the water supply is limited and the spring taps would always be closed when not in use.\n\nSteam radiator valves are needed on some of the radiators and this could also receive attention by the plumber and steamfitter.\n\nThe seat covers were all missing on the boys' toilets. I would recommend six new lids be provided and that these be made secure with bolts.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6257, file 576-5, part 7)\nA number of beds are broken and past repairing. Ten new beds should be provided. The standard institutional bed in white is desired. I would also recommend that Mr. Chapin be instructed to send to Winnipeg for repair twenty bed springs. These springs belong to the children's beds and are so badly stretched that they form a hammock. No doubt Parkhills or some other bedding company could re-stretch the cables.\n\nOne other matter should receive attention and Mr. Chapin again offered to do the work if the required material was provided. Neither the boys or girls have any suitable place to hang their winter coats and garments. A proper place could be fixed in the basement if the following materials were provided:\n\n- 10 pieces 2 x 4 - 12 ft. long,\n- 12 doz. heavy metal hooks (with the required screws)\n\nI hope funds can be made available to carry out the repairs suggested, all of which are much needed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nOttawa,\nNovember 18, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to your recent inspection of the Brandon Residential School.\n\nThe following expenditures are approved:\n\n1. Plumber to repair the tanks, check water taps and replace taps that cannot be repaired, also supply steam radiator valves. It is understood that only the necessary work will be done and the cost kept as low as possible.\n\n2. Purchase 6 new seat covers for boys' toilets.\n\n3. You may arrange for having the bed springs repaired.\n\n4. You may purchase the following material:\n   - 10 pieces 2 x 4 - 12 ft. long\n   - 12 Doz. heavy metal hooks with screws\n\nI have noted your recommendation that the roof of the building and the south side of the barn should be reshingled next year. I am including the amount that will be required in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1943-44. We have recently been advised that it is impossible to secure shingles at the present time in the vicinity of Winnipeg. You should write to me again in connection with the shingling about April 1 at which time I will know if the amount requested in the estimates has been allowed. At that time you should give me an estimate of the cost of the new screens for the Principal's residence.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A.G.

He hopes it will last until after the war.\n\nIn view of the information given by Mr. Chapin I do not think any expense should be incurred at present to repair the old tank. If at a later date a tank is required, the matter can be given further consideration.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO**: WADE & SONS LIMITED  \n**ADDRESS**: 117 Fourteenth Street  \nBRANDON, Manitoba.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| 1942 | Jan. 11 | To amount of account, detailed copies attached $9.45 |\n|      |         | for lumber supplied to the Brandon Indian Residential School |\n\n**Authority**: Letter from Mr. R.A.

During the last cold spell, in the west dormitory on the third floor, there was actually frost on the ceiling at times. There is such a large ceiling expanse, that I think it would make a tremendous difference if this ceiling were insulated.\n\nI wrote the J.H. Ashdown Hardware Co. for estimates, which I enclose. I would recommend the eventemp insulation. The ceiling space is 1500 sq. ft., so it would take 90 bags at a cost of $54.00. The woodwool insulation would not be fire-proof, and the asbestos is very high priced. We will do the work if we may have the material.\n\nI trust we may have the authority to purchase this; and I am sure it would make a big difference in the heating of this part of the building.\n\nYours very Truly,\n\nRTC/JH\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It has come to the place where the plates are so worn they will not crush the grain. We tried to set them up a little more but the machine simply gummed up. The bearings on the machine are also so badly worn that new plates could not be put on without the risk of damage to them unless the whole machine is overhauled and new bearings put in. This would cost practically the price of a new grinder, and would not be economy as the old machine is so old and shaky. I cannot find definitely when this was purchased but it goes back beyond twenty years so it has done good service. A lot of feed is put through it in a year.\n\nI have enquired prices and received the following quotations\u2014\n\nInternational Harvester Co.\n10 inch plates, plain bearings, $72.50\n10\u00bd\" ball bearings, $143.50\n\nMassey Harris Co.\n10\u00bd inch plates, ball bearings, $74.75\n\nMcLeod's Ltd.\n11 inch plates, ball bearings, $66.50\n\nMay I have authority to order one at once from McLeod's Ltd.? With both hogs and cattle to feed our need is rather imperative.\n\nOur field mower has got to the place where it will not do the work any longer. Last summer we had to use the binder to finish the hay crop. Our binders are also getting\nso old that we would not want to put them into the hay crop this summer.\n\nThe International Harvester Co. give a price of $100.00 for a 5 foot mower but say they have none available at present and do not know what they will be getting.\n\nThe Massey Harris Co. have two types, both available at present. One with enclosed gears running in oil, No.33, at $156.00. The other with open gears, No.37, at $120.50. McLeod's Ltd. do not handle mowers.\n\nWhat are your instructions regarding the above?\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

They took the bowl off and found the lime incrustation had almost closed the drain.\n\nThe water pump was beginning to be very slow in pumping. Leather no doubt were needed and perhaps discs. They took the pump to their shop for work on it. They found the bearings needed attention also, and while they had the pump apart gave it a thorough overhaul. It is now in first class condition.\n\nIn March frost reached the pipe line below ground between the horse barn and cow barn. They loaned us sufficient old pipe and ran a temporary line above ground which we covered with manure. This proved quite satisfactory and gave us ample water for the cow barn. We are still using the temporary line as the frost has not yet come out of the original line.\n\nDuring the winter when the furnaces are going we need use only one Cottage Heater for hot water. The grates from the other heater had been used to keep this going, so with milder weather when we had to put on the other heater we were three grates short.\n\nTrusting the above explanations of needs are satisfactory.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6257, file 576-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nExtract from Mr. Hamilton's report on the Brandon Indian Residential School inspected on May 14 and 15, 1943.\n\nThe barns are in fair repair, except the roof on the south side of one stock barn. The shingles should be renewed and this was taken up last fall in my letter 209-11 A.U. in reply to departmental letter 133-0-5, dated October 27th, 1942. It will require 40M shingles and the price on No. 1 is $8.00 per M, No. 2 $6.40 per M, less 10%.\n\nThe following screens are also required:\n\n| Screens | Price |\n|---------|-------|\n| 9 Screens for the Principal's residence | @ $1.35 - $12.15 |\n| 11 Screens for the school | @ 1.75 - 19.25 |\n\n$31.40\n\nI would again bring to your attention the fact that the roof on the school should be repaired and retarred. Last year Mr. Chapin secured a quotation submitted by McDowall and Duke on this work and the figure was $400.00. This figure covered certain repair work to the roofing, re-tarring and re-gravelling. I understand the present roof was what is termed a ten-year roof. We have passed that period now and unless this work is carried out we may be obliged later to renew the roofing and this would involve heavy expense.\n\nI inspected the farm lands and found seeding operations well along. The fence posts along the road on three sides of the farm have almost all rotted off and the fence is hanging only by the odd good post. It will require approximately 350 posts to rebuild the fence and tamarac posts will cost 40\u00a2 each for 5\" posts; a total expenditure of $140.00. It is necessary to renew the fences not only to keep stock out but to keep our own stock on the farm.\n\nI inspected the two pumps in the school and found that one has recently been repaired and is in good condition. The large pump for fire use should be overhauled and a new valve or two may be required. Mr. Yates could not give a price because it is impossible to know the material required until the pump is dismantled. I strongly recommend that the necessary repairs be carried out.\n\np.t.o.\nI would be pleased to hear at an early date re\nthe following:\n\n..................................\n\n3. I would like authority to have the fire\npump put in first-class condition.\n\n4. School roof should be repaired; otherwise\na complete new job may be required.\n\n5.

Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nI have your recent letter with reference to your inspection of the Brandon Indian Residential School on May 14 and 15 last. The Departmental Purchasing Agent is being requested to secure the shingles for the roof on the south side of the barn. I am not certain from your letter whether the 10% discount refers both to the No. 1 and the No. 2 shingles, or only to the No. 2.\n\nYou may authorize the purchase of the screens at a total cost of $31.40. You may also have the large pump overhauled. It is hoped that you will keep the cost of the overhauling as low as possible.\n\nI have reviewed the correspondence to which you refer in regard to the repairs required to the school roof. It is noted that Mr. Chapin has secured a quotation from McDowall and Duke on this work. Please forward this for our consideration.\n\nWe feel that the condition of the fence is a rather serious reflection on the school management. If each post had been replaced as required, the fence would not be in the condition in which you state it is today.\n\nR.A. Hosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. R. A.

Chapin,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nOCT 6 1943\n\nDr. McGill.\n\nRe: Brandon Indian Residential School\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of July 9th last, the question of proposed repairs to the roof of this school was referred to our Engineering and Construction Service who have been in correspondence with Mr. Gow concerning it.\n\nFrom Mr. Gow's report he is of opinion that the original workmanship and materials in the roof were of high quality and that by carrying out certain repairs its life may be extended for several years. These repairs, however, are somewhat more extensive than what is covered by the tender of McDowell and Doke of $340.00.\n\nWhile it is considered that the only method of obtaining guaranteed freedom from future trouble is a completed new four ply felt pitch and gravel roof carrying the manufacturer's bond, such new roof is not considered essential at this time. In view of the apparent uniform and normal deterioration of the roof covering, it is recommended that the work at present be confined to:\n\n1. Removing and replacing loose gravel, resetting and caulking metal flashings, providing new felt flashings at parapets, applying a liberal coating of pitch over the whole roof.\n\n(over) ..........\n2. The repair of the leakage, and replacement of roofing in the vicinity of the roof hopper over the southwest corner of the Assembly Hall.\n\n3. The replacement of roofing over the room adjoining the kitchen.\n\nThese items should be undertaken at once.\n\nIt is considered that a reasonable estimate for this work is $500.00.\n\nWe would recommend that we be authorized to have Mr. Gow arrange to have the above work carried out by a reliable firm of roofers at a cost not to exceed $500.00 under supervision from his office and that $500.00 be transferred to our Engineering and Construction Service for the purpose.\n\nWe cannot undertake to say when the work could be carried out under existing circumstances, but if our recommendation is approved, Mr. Gow will be requested to do all he can to expedite operations.\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Executive Assistant.\nOttawa,\nOctober 7, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Brandon Residential School\n\nI have your memorandum of October 5, in which you state that it will require an amount of $500.00 to properly repair the roof of the above-mentioned residential school.

R. T. Chapin,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI submit the following report on the Brandon Indian Residential School, inspected April 26th and 27th, 1944.\n\nThere are 132 pupils. The three classroom teachers are all qualified with years of experience. The classroom work is well advanced and I consider the pupils well along in their respective grades.\n\nThe Department will pay grant for 156 pupils, so at present they are 24 pupils short. At the end of June when school is closed about 15 pupils will graduate, which will then make a total shortage of around 40 pupils. The chances of recruiting for this school are not good, because the parents feel the children are not well trained, nor are they well fed. Last year the food problem was a real point of issue with many. Fortunately this has improved; but unfortunately the Indians have not forgotten.\n\nThe school was clean and the dormitories in good condition.\n\nThe Sewing Room is in charge of Miss Maguire. The children do very good work and the older girls can make most of their own clothes. The discarded army clothing is remade and used for both the boys and girls.\n\nThe laundry work is supervised by Miss Boak. I found the work well done. The plaster is falling off the walls and ceiling in several places and the wrapping around the water pipe has rotted and fallen apart. This is due, I believe, to the excessive dampness, especially in the winter. There are two ventilators in the ceiling but neither works. These should be repaired and if necessary a large electric fan installed in the side wall. The fan could be used on wash days and would carry out the moisture. The repair work mentioned should be done during the summer when most of the children are away.\n\nMiss Cochrane is girls' supervisor, but at present is supplying in the kitchen. A new kitchen matron was expected this week. I was present when several meals were served and there appeared plenty as far as bulk is concerned. The meals consist of:\n\n**Breakfast**\n- 1 cup of milk,\n- Porridge with milk and sugar\n- Bread with beef dripping.\n\n**Dinner**\n- Meat Stew\n- Potatoes (boiled with jackets on)\n- Carrots\n- Rice pudding, bread, water to drink.\nSupper -\nVegetable Soup - lots of vegetables in it,\nBread spread with butter,\nPrunes (changed with custards and jellies)\nTea for seniors - water for others.\n\nI feel certain the children have plenty of food, because the bread issue is liberal and they can have more if they ask. I did, however, feel that the beef stew consisted mostly of gravy. In my opinion more meat is required. I would also recommend that hot cocoa be made with milk and served to the small children to replace the cold water. There is a large herd of cattle kept at this school and there should be enough milk for cooking, puddings, porridge and the making of cocoa. At present they get about 120 lbs. per milking, or 12 gallons per milking.\n\nMr. LeFevre is the engineer. He is a new member of the staff and I doubt if his services will be retained for long. A younger and more active man is required. In the children's wash rooms I found some taps not working and a number needing new washers. In view of the shortage of water the taps should all be in good repair and I told Mr. Chapin, the Principal, that he should have the engineer check these taps morning, noon and night. This would require only a few minutes and would no doubt prevent the waste of many gallons of water.\n\nIt might be advisable to dig a trench around the north side of the basin in which the water is collected with a view to striking more water. If any extra were located it could then be directed into the basin.\n\nThe plaster in the boys' playroom is broken in many places - even the V joint is split and pieces broken from the walls. Repair work to this room is urgently needed. The girls' playroom is in fair condition. Some glass is also needed for the windows.\n\nMiss Hart is in charge of the dispensary and infirmary. At present she has a few cases of mumps, but none is very sick.\n\nThe large dairy barn measuring about 116 x 45 is in fair condition. Some glass is needed for the windows and three storm sashes are missing.\n\nThe pig pen and slaughter house measures 28 x 50. One window sash missing and 24 panes of glass. Stock barn 24 x 100, with a 34' lean. This barn needs re-shingling on the south side and the shingles have been purchased from Wade and Sons of Brandon. Eleven window sashes are missing and over 150 panes of glass needed. The interior of the barn should be thoroughly cleaned and if not used the doors should be locked.\n\nThe chicken house is 12' x 60' and in good condition. A few shingles are needed on the north side of the roof.\n\nMachine shop measures 27' x 56'. The walls of the first story are cement and the upper part is frame.\n\nAt -\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6257, file 576-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nAt present the upper part is one large room and at times has been used for a gymnasium. It would make an ideal place for teaching carpentry. The building is heated from a furnace on the ground floor.\n\nThe root-house is large and in good repair. The vegetables needed to be picked over and the place thoroughly cleaned.\n\nThe ice-house was filled with ice. A portion of this building is used for storing meat. This room needed a thorough cleaning.\n\nThe manure from the stable is hauled out west of the barns near the city golf links and scattered over about half an acre of ground. If the manure is not needed now it should be put into a pile about 16 ft. wide and 6 ft. high and continued in length as required. In this way the place would look tidy and the manure would heat and later be useful on the land. I pointed this out to the new stockman, Mr. Haggerty, and in time I am sure he will try to improve the situation.\n\nThe Principal's house is in poor condition and I doubt if extensive repairs could be justified.\n\nHouse No. 2 is occupied by Mr. Haggerty. The walk leading to the house should be renewed. The plaster is badly cracked on some rooms. This should be repaired and the walls and ceiling re-tinted.\n\nHouse No. 3 is used by the farming instructor, Mr. Udell. This house should be painted. On the east side the old paint has almost entirely disappeared. Painting and papering is also needed inside.\n\nHouse No. 4 is a very old building. It is leased for $10.00 a month to a man who works at the Experimental Farm. The house is well cared for and the present renters have made many repairs.\n\nMr. Chapin, the Principal, has found the question of discipline difficult to handle and tells me he is leaving at the end of June. In March some of the boys and girls got out of the dormitories at night and on one occasion the girls were away two nights before being found. They were hiding in one of the root cellars at the rear of the barn. The girls let themselves down from the third storey dormitory by tying the bed sheets together. I understand they may have escaped about 1 a.m. after the staff had retired. The boys, with the exception of one from Norway House, were immediately discharged. The Norway House boy will be sent home when navigation opens.\n\nThe Church authorities in selecting a new Principal should make sure they have a man who can enforce discipline and is accustomed to the supervision of others. It is difficult to get a suitable staff and they, almost as much as the children, need constant supervision. The Principal needs to be active, alert and continually checking. To get the school back into good shape means hard work.\nand only a man willing to work should be recommended.\n\nI would like authority to spend $150.00 to do the following repair work:\n\n1. Purchase 10 gals. of barn paint and small quantity of oil.\n2. Purchase glass.\n3. Purchase some lumber to repair doors, etc.\n4. Purchase water taps and other plumbing repairs.\n\nThe work should be done at once and authority for the expenditure would be appreciated.\n\nIn closing I would like to state that in my opinion neither the Brandon nor the Elkhorn Schools receive sufficient supervision. I would recommend that both schools be attached to the Griswold Agency and that Mr. Young be instructed to make monthly inspections and submit reports through this office. In this way recommendations can be followed up and certain work pushed to completion.\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nOttawa,\nMay 12, 1944.\n\nMr. A.G.

The ventilator should be repaired in the laundry and, if necessary, a large fan installed in the side wall. Any plaster that has fallen should be replaced.\n\n2. You should make certain that new washers are placed on all taps requiring same and you should again point out to the Principal the necessity of keeping the taps in good condition.\n\n3. On the occasion of your next visit to the school you should make certain that the stock man is carrying out your instructions regarding the handling of the manure from the stable.\n\n4.

Hoey\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWith further reference to the conversation which I had with you on Friday, I am writing to say that Mr. Strapp recently visited the School and made the suggestion that it would add very much to the speed and efficiency of the work in the laundry if some machinery were installed for ironing the flat work. He told me that the children had to spend five days a week ironing\u2014which certainly is enough to disgust anybody with the work of a residential school. Would you look into the matter of the possibility of obtaining a flat work ironer such as they have at Muncey.\n\nMr. Strapp also mentioned the fact that the sewing-room seemed to be inadequately equipped with sewing machines. He mentioned, particularly, that in his judgment there should be one machine of a tailor type and two domestic type.\n\nFrom what Mr. Strapp told me I think that some additions will be necessary to the buildings; but about these he will write you later on when he has had a chance to look over the situation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Doctor Dorey mentions that a flat work ironer, such as you have at Mount Elgin, would be suitable at Brandon. I thought the quickest way to ascertain exactly what you think is needed at Brandon would be to write you personally. In your reply you might let me know the size and name of manufacturer of the ironer at present at Mount Elgin. You might also state the catalogue number of this machine, if at all possible. As you know, all orders have to be placed through our Purchasing Branch and very explicit information is necessary in order to assist them in making the purchase.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

If so, is it possible to repair it with a view to making it last until similar equipment is available as surplus stores?\n\n(b) Size - The 90\" size seems unnecessarily large, is very expensive, and will be difficult to obtain under present conditions. We suggest the 54 or 56\" size which will take a sheet folded once. The next largest ironer in the semi-commercial or institutional size is about 66\". The outside diameter of the padded roll varies from about 8\u00bd\" to 13\u00bd\".\n\n(c) Method of heating - We assume that a steam heated ironer with belted motor drive is required, and that steam of sufficient pressure is available from boiler at present in the school. Will you please check on this.\n\n(d) Electric current - Kindly state whether A.C. or D.C.\n\nThe above requested information is needed for our assistance in calling for tenders, and to ensure obtaining satisfactory equipment at best possible prices.\n\nH. J. Davidson,\nDept. Purchasing Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMr. Chapin reports as follows regarding the septic tank for one of the houses at the Brandon School:\n\n\"We have had trouble with the septic tank of the bungalow. It plugged up entirely and backed up into the cellar. Nobody knew where the septic tank was exactly, as it was covered over and sodded. We got Yates out. He uncovered it, finding the cover of one section of it had caved in, letting a great deal of earth into the tank. They also uncovered the second compartment, which was almost ready to cave in too. The field tiles apparently are entirely plugged up. When we got the tank cleaned out we found that there apparently is no cement bottom to it. Mr. Yates brought out the Provincial Inspector, and he says we will have to have a cement bottom put into it to meet requirements. Also a new field of the overflow will have to be put in, and there should be cement covers made for the coverings. They estimated this work would cost in the neighborhood of $200.00. Apparently the tank has never been opened up for some time. This will have to be attended to right away as soon as we can get the authority for the work to be done.\n\n\"While we are speaking about tanks, I might bring it to your attention that the manholes into the School tank will have to be repaired. These openings were just walled up with planking, which is beginning to get pretty shaky, and I think it would be well to have cement walls put in these manholes before they do cave in.\"\n\nThis work must be attended to and I would be pleased to have authority for the necessary expenditure.\n\nA.G.

(RG 10, Volume 6257, file 576-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES OF CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nOttawa, June 29, 1944.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, with reference to the septic tank of the Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter, you may authorize the expenditure necessary to repair the septic tank at the bungalow.\n\nYou may also authorize the repairs of the manholes in the tank at the school.\n\nThe cost of this work should be kept as low as possible.\n\nIt is our understanding that the sludge in the septic tank should be cleared out occasionally. We suggest that this be done annually, otherwise it will be neglected and you will have an occurrence of the condition which you are now confronted with at the Brandon School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan;\n\nIn reply to your letter of the above noted file and date, may I say that we will be glad to have an ironer of any size that can be obtained at the present time. From our experience at this school the larger ironer is the most satisfactory. The smaller ironer here is one with a 66\" roll and I would prefer that if possible. However if that size is not readily available then we will have to accept the 54\" or 56\" size. I suppose there will be a considerable amount of equipment available as soon as the war is over and it might be possible to obtain another medium size at that time.\n\nI am returning the memorandum as it appears to be the original.\n\nMay I say that I appreciate very much your endeavours in this direction for the Brandon School.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Hoey,\n\nIn discussing the proposed purchase of an ironer for the Brandon Indian Residential School, we made certain enquiries and comment, which, as requested, are summarized herewith:\n\n(a) Is this a replacement of old equipment? If so, is it possible to repair it with a view to making it last until similar equipment is available as surplus stores?\n\n(b) Size - The 90\" size seems unnecessarily large, is very expensive, and will be difficult to obtain under present conditions. We suggest the 54 or 56\" size which will take a sheet folded once. The next largest ironer in the semi-commercial or institutional size is about 66\". The outside diameter of the padded roll varies from about 8\u00bd\" to 13\u00bd\".\n\n(c) Method of heating - We assume that a steam heated ironer with belted motor drive is required, and that steam of sufficient pressure is available from boiler at present in the school. Will you please check on this.\n\n(d) Electric current - Kindly state whether A.C. or D.C.\n\nThe above requested information is needed for our assistance in calling for tenders, and to ensure obtaining satisfactory equipment at best possible prices.\n\nH.J. Davidson\nH. J. Davidson,\nDept. Purchasing Agent.\nIndian Residential School\n\nBrandon, Man., June 29, 1944.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYours of the 27th received, file 106-0-5. The steam boiler that is at present used for the pressure dryer would be of sufficient capacity to heat the ironer, provided thirty (30) pounds of pressure would be sufficient. This is the pressure we use on the dryer.\n\nAs to electric current; our current here is A.C. sixty (60) cycle, and the motors in the laundry are three (3) phase, two hundred and twenty (220) volt.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRTC/TS\nOttawa, July 6, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT.\n\nI desire to refer to your memorandum of June 26, with reference to our requisition of June 21 for a flatwork ironer for the Brandon Residential School. The answers to your questions are as follows:\n\n(a) This is not a replacement. The Brandon School has never had an ironer and such a machine is extremely necessary in a school of this size, which has an enrolment of 170 pupils. It is especially necessary at the present time, due to the difficulty of obtaining labour.\n\n(b) Following correspondence with the school management, it has been decided that a 66\" ironer will be satisfactory.\n\n(c) The steam boiler at present used will be sufficient to heat the ironer, as it provides 30 lbs. of pressure.\n\n(d) The electric current is A.C. 60 cycles, 3 phase, 220 volts.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMemorandum\n\nDr. H.W. McGill\n\nSUBJECT: Ironer for Brandon I.R.School.\nYour file No. 133-0-5.\n\nTenders were called on a flat-work ironer, steam heated, as called for on your requisition of June 21st, 1944. Mr. Hoey, in his memorandum of the 6th ultimo, advises that the present steam boiler provides a steam pressure of 30 lbs., but all tenders indicate that a working pressure of 80 to 100 lbs., is necessary. It appears evident therefore that the present boiler capacity is too small to operate a steam-heated ironer of the kind required.\n\nIf you do not wish to consider the purchase of a boiler of greater capacity at the present time, we suggest, as an alternative, that we endeavour to purchase an electrically heated ironer for the Brandon School. Please advise if the latter would be satisfactory.\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nWMV/HG\nOttawa,\nAugust 9, 1944.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Mr. Strapp:\n\nWith reference to the ironer requested for the Brandon Residential School, I enclose, for your information, a copy of a memorandum which we have just received from the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nI should appreciate receiving your comments and at the same time you might let me know if an electrically heated ironer would meet your purposes.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 20, 1944.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nOn his return to Ottawa recently Mr. Morris brought to my attention the condition of both the interior of the Brandon Residential School and the barn. Several of the matters which Mr. Morris considers require immediate attention were included in your letter of May 8 last, at which time you reported regarding your inspection of the Brandon Residential School on April 26 and 27.\n\nFollowing receipt of your report you were written two letters, one on May 12 and the other on May 17. These letters authorized certain expenditures, but a review of our file shows that the only account we have received is your voucher No. 114 for $43.48, covering the cost of window glass purchased from the Ashdown Hardware Company. As no other accounts have been received it would appear that the other work authorized has not received any attention.\n\nIn a letter dated June 28, addressed to the former Principal, the Department approved an expenditure of $60 for rewinding the coils of the motor used for pumping the water. In a letter dated June 29, addressed to you, authority was given for the expenditure required to repair the septic tank. No accounts have been received in connection with\neither of these two authorized expenditures and the only conclusion the Department can draw is that the work has never been done. Evidently it was considered urgent at the time the letters were written and the Department is at a loss to understand why the matters have not received attention previous to this.\n\nI should appreciate an immediate reply from you indicating exactly what action has been taken with regard to the matters mentioned in the above letters.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, OTTAWA, Canada\n\nYour file 133-0-5 dated Sept. 14/44\n\nI have not been able to obtain the supplies listed on the attached memorandum. They are not available at the wholesale or at Eaton's.\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba\nIndian Affairs Branch, OTTAWA, Canada\n\nRE: Brandon School\n\nI spent yesterday with Mr. Strapp at the Brandon School. Already he has made several improvements; but there is much to do yet.\n\nI would recommend that the following expenditures be given consideration:\n\n1. The Principal's Residence needs interior decorations. Already Mr. Strapp has had the plaster repaired in the various rooms and the walls are really for papering. It will cost from $250 to $300 to do the necessary work (papering and painting), and even then part of the house will be closed off and not used. Authority for this expenditure should be granted at once.\n\n2. The shingles for the one barn have never been put on. Labour will be required and the cost may reach $150. At present the barn is practically useless and the rain is rotting the floors, etc. If labor is obtainable the work should be done now.\n\n3. New stoneworking is required. The water runs down along the foundation and if allowed to continue will ruin the foundation.\n\n4. The upright boiler Mr. Strapp claims has not sufficient steam capacity, and as the result it takes four days to wash what should be done in a day. Mr. Strapp thinks a second upright boiler should be supplied. However, this is a matter which might be carried over until after the war.\n\nAlready, authority has been granted for the following:\n\n(Cont'd)\n1. $150 for glass, paint, plumbing, repairs and lumber. This total will be accounted for by Mr. Strapp.\n\n2. Repairs to laundry walls and ventilators: may involve from $75 to $100.\n\n3. Purchase of electric fan for laundry; this to draw the moisture out.\n\n4. Repairs to Syptic tank at cottage; approximately $200.\n\n5. Repair to Syptic tank manholes at School--this requires considerable excavation and cement work and may cost $75 or $100.\n\nMr. Strapp is apparently a hard worker. I believe if he remains he will in due course bring the school back to its old high standing. We must, however, spend some money on repair work. It cannot all be done this fall, but we have listed the more essential things and I hope Mr. Strapp will be encouraged by receiving instructions to proceed with the repairs listed.\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba\nOttawa,\nSeptember 26, 1944.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, with reference to your recent inspection of the Brandon Residential School. The Department approves an expenditure not exceeding $200 for papering the Principal's residence. It is regretted that you did not give us information regarding the paper so that an order could be placed through the Purchasing Branch. You are aware of the purchasing regulations and when material is required full particulars regarding it should be forwarded so that our procedure may be followed. However, under the circumstances it has been decided to allow local purchase in order that the work may be done at the earliest possible date.\n\nAn expenditure of $150 for labour to shingle the barn is also authorized. Every endeavour should be made to have this work done immediately.\n\nI note your statement regarding the eavetroughing. The Department is prepared to supply this if it can be secured. Please let me know if you can purchase the eavetroughing locally and, if so, give the name and address of the firm and the expenditure required.\n\nIt is noted that you consider the request for a second boiler can be deferred.\nThe expenditures already authorized which you list in your letters are those referred to in my letter of September 20. I trust that you can arrange to have these repairs receive early attention.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMemorandum\n\nDr. H.W.

Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, reporting on your recent inspection of the Brandon Residential School. I note the request contained in the sixth paragraph of your letter to the effect that Mr. Strapp should be impressed with the necessity of doing the work at the earliest possible date. Mr. Hoey is in Toronto this week and I am forwarding a copy of the report to him so that he may take it up with the General Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church.\n\nYou are correct in considering the small girls' dormitory overcrowded. Our general rule is to have 500 cubic feet of air space per pupil in dormitories, or as close to that figure as possible. On this basis the room mentioned is much too small for 13 children.\n\nRegarding the eavestroughing required for the barn, I would refer you to the third paragraph of official letter to you dated September 26, 1944. We do not appear to have received any reply to the request contained in that letter for you to let us know if you can purchase the eavestroughing locally and, if so, we would like to know the name and address of the firm and the expenditure required.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| DATE | PARTICULARS                  | FOLIO | TIME AND MATERIAL | CR. | TOTAL |\n|------|-----------------------------|-------|-------------------|-----|-------|\n| July 1 | To Clearing Sewer to Septic Tank |       |                   |     |       |\n|       | m&H 2\u00bdhrs                   | 2.10  | 5 25              |     |       |\n| 3     | \"                            |       |                   |     | 4 20  |\n| 13    | \"                            |       |                   |     | 6 30  |\n| 14    | \"                            |       |                   |     | 5 25  |\n\nTotal: 21.00\n\nCertified\n\nIndian Affairs.

We are advised by Inspector Hamilton that the Brandon School is having trouble with the septic tank. It plugged entirely and the sewage backed up into the cellar. It was necessary to uncover the tank and it was found that one section of it had caved in. The second section was almost ready to cave in. The steel tiles were also entirely plugged. The Provincial Inspector was called in and he recommended a cement bottom, also a new field for the overflow, as well as cement covers for the coverings. It would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid.

We are advised by Inspector Hamilton that the Brandon School is having trouble with the septic tank. It plugged entirely and the sewage backed up into the cellar. It was necessary to uncover the tank and it was found that one section of it had caved in. The second section was almost ready to cave in. The steel tiles were also entirely plugged. The Provincial Inspector was called in and he recommended a cement bottom, also a new field for the overflow, as well as cement covers for the coverings. It would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid.

Manholes repaired and manhole covers provided for school septic tank. Instructed Yates to supply Mr. Strapp at once with necessary invoice.\n\nThe shingles have not yet been put on the barn. Mr. Strapp was unable to get help. I interviewed a Mr. Robinson of Kenton, and he will try to do the work before March 10th. If by chance the weather remains too cold, and the work cannot be done I would like authority to purchase 500 tamarack posts. These are available now at Wades Lumber Company, at 3\u00bd\u00a2 for 4\" tops and 2\u00bd\u00a2 for 6\" tops. The fences are in very poor condition and must be repaired during the coming summer.\n\nThe houses all need exterior painting. Mr. Strapp states he cannot undertake the work and to date he has not been able to get anyone to even submit a quotation.\n\nThe folding chairs supplied for the auditorium or chapel are in poor condition; in fact, many are out of use and others are unsafe and should be discarded. This was brought to the Department's attention some months ago, but at that time apparently funds were not available. Now a strong folding chair can be obtained from the Stony Mountain Penitentiary priced at $2.75 each. I enclose a letter from Warden Campbell dealing with this matter.\n\nIn going through the School I found a toilet in the\n\nIndian Affairs.

These two toilets should be renewed at once. I might add that the toilets have been cracked for months, but gradually are getting worse and some pieces have loosened, thus weakening the bowl.\n\nThe taps were all in good working order, except those in the bath tubs, and the loss of water has been greatly reduced. The water situation is bad and the supply is very low.\n\nThe children appeared in good health. They were clean and well dressed.\n\nThe new kitchen matron appears capable and Mr. Strapp feels certain she will handle the department well.\n\nMr. Strapp is still without a qualified engineer and is doing the supervision of this work himself.\n\nThe cattle are in good condition but there is a shortage of milk and Mr. Strapp is confident he cannot get the supply necessary from the present herd. He hopes later to obtain some Holstein cows.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nOttawa, January 25, 1945.\n\nMr. A. G.

This particular section of the account was returned to Yates & Company, due to the fact that it was necessary to have a receipt for the number of hours and the rate per hour in connection with the $41.25 for labour in digging three manholes and also $65.55 for labour on cribbing and cement work. The account should also have shown the quantities and prices for the items of $25.30 for cement and $70.09 for cribbing. This account should have been referred to you but for some unaccountable reason it was sent direct to Yates & Company, who may not yet have returned it with the desired explanation. It would be appreciated if you could arrange with that firm to furnish the information required and return it at the earliest possible date, in order that it may be paid.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend O.

You will recall that we had several letters last fall with regard to this matter, but we finally dropped it, due to the fact that Mr. Hamilton, in a letter dated September 21, 1944, stated the firm of Stanley Brock & Company were under the impression that a steam ironer cannot be operated successfully on less than 100 lbs. pressure. Dr. Dorey, evidently quoting a communication he received from you, writes as follows in his letter:\n\n\"Mr. Strapp says that the boiler is in first-class shape; that he can carry 80 pounds of steam; and that it is possible to obtain from Stanley Brock, Ltd. of Winnipeg a rebuilt 100 inch ironer, which would be just the thing for this school.\"\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would again consult Mr. Hamilton on the occasion of your next visit to Winnipeg, and possibly the two of you could again interview Stanley Brock & Company. Following this interview, you might let me have complete information regarding the rebuilt 100 inch ironer which you consider would be suitable. If you can definitely assure us that there is sufficient pressure to operate it, I believe we will not have any trouble in persuading the Purchasing Branch to secure it.\n\nDr. Dorey also mentions additional sewing machines.

However, the Singer Sewing Machine Company has available a general purpose, heavy duty machine, which at the present time is replacing the tailor's machine supplied in peace-time.

We have been unable to get the stock barn shingled and so I instructed Mr. Strapp to immediately use the $150.00 to purchase fence posts and forward the voucher at once.\n\n2. Mr. Strapp is having the chairs repaired; but when the work is completed he will still be urgently in need of 50 folding chairs. I urge that these be supplied.\n\nI have not been able to purchase an electric exhaust fan to be installed in the laundry window. Unfortunately these have not been available. The laundry walls are subject to extreme moisture and I am afraid the plaster will be off again if a suitable fan cannot be obtained.\n\n3. The water situation is bad. I am afraid that sooner or later we will be faced with a serious shortage. The springs are very weak and more and more it is necessary to pump from the old well which too only has a limited supply.\n\nMr. Strapp has had the upright steam boiler repaired and I understand it will carry up to 100 lbs. steam pressure. This pressure is more than is required for a steam ironer, and I understand Mr. Strapp is requesting that the ironer be purchased and installed. If the present boiler will handle the ironer, I recommend the purchase.\nOttawa, March 16, 1945.\n\nMr. A. G.

Strapp, principal of the Indian Residential School at Brandon, Manitoba, has asked us to write you and advise you of the reconditioned Flatwork Ironer which we have to offer for this Indian School.\n\nThis Ironer is what is known as a two-roll 100\" machine, that is, the chests and the rolls are 100\" long and can be operated on 80 lbs. pressure and we would supply the motor so that the Ironer could be individually operated by this motor. The Ironer would be completely padded. The Ironer has been thoroughly reconditioned and overhauled and is an excellent machine for the work required at the Indian School. The price of this machine plus the motor is $1000.00 F.O.B. cars Brandon.\n\nWe do not have any hesitancy in recommending this Ironer for the Indian Residential School at Brandon, Manitoba.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSTANLEY BROCK LIMITED\n\nW.H.

A great deal of difficulty is experienced because of the fact that during the winter months the supply frequently fails and the pupils' dormitory toilets, etc., become plugged. The present system is too complicated, having 10 valves.

Several repairs have been made to the doors, windows and walls so that conditions have greatly improved.\n\nThe one stock barn is in a disgraceful condition. Mr. Strapp has been unable to have this barn shingled because he could not get help. In addition to the roof, new doors should be provided - the windows repaired and refit - corner boards and siding repaired where required, and all patch work painted. Then Mr. Strapp wants a poultry house made upstairs in the lean-to which faces south. He needs this extra room because more poultry should be kept. I would recommend that the Department, or that Mr. Strapp be instructed to call for tenders from contract firms to do the work outlined. I am convinced this is the only way the work will be accomplished. As stated above, the barn is in a disgraceful condition and I feel we should spend the amount necessary to save a barn which to erect now would cost from $6000.00 to $8000.00. If left in its present condition it will soon become worthless.\n\nAfter this barn is repaired I would recommend the Department advise Mr. Strapp that he should see to it that the barn is kept in good repair. I would not be surprised if the material and labor would cost over $1000.00. The barn is needed and as stated above, we cannot afford longer to neglect this much needed repair.\n\nAnother matter that must not be neglected longer is the repair needed to the eavestroughing. All three barns should have new eavestroughing on the north side. There are barns here and the water runs off the roof down along the stone foundation and is undermining the foundation. On the south side the water can get away and does not affect the foundation. I understand McDowell and Duke, Brandon, can now supply the material and are prepared to do the work, but if some of the old material is to be used and repaired, they cannot very well submit a quotation.\n\nThe Principal's house needs the eavestroughing repaired and parts renewed. This work should be done at the same time as the barn. The entire bottom is rusted out of some of the eavestroughing and this repair work is absolutely necessary.\n\nI would further recommend that Mr. Strapp be requested to call for tenders to do the following painting:\n\n1. The farmer's house just inside the main entrance should be painted. It is in bad condition - two coats will help but it is really a three coat job.\n\n2. The Principal's residence should have one coat of paint.\n3. The cottage between the school and Principal's residence requires two coats of shingle paint.\n\nHere again this repair work will entail expense but it is useless for me or anyone else to make repeated inspections and expect to see improvements unless funds can be provided for the work. We are hardly faced with the initial cost of putting these schools in good condition but we must realize that a yearly expenditure, and of a considerable amount, must be provided; otherwise, they cannot be maintained as a government institution should. To be advised that six or eight hundred dollars is allowed for Brandon, or Elkhorn, or Birtle, or any large assembly of buildings, and that this may be used where most urgently needed, and the balance must wait for the next fiscal year, just isn't good enough. We have these institutions, and while we have them we should provide the necessary funds to keep them maintained so that the Principal, staff and pupils, as well as the Government, may be justly proud of the institution. I urge that the recommendations outlined be carried out and at once. I will be away most of the summer so that instructions should be sent direct to Mr. Strapp, with a copy for my file.\n\nThe Government sign just inside the school gate is, I consider, past repairing, and Mr. Strapp should be instructed to have it removed. It would be more credit to the Government not to have any than to leave the bleached, faded and broken one now in use.\n\nI should add that the new steam ironer had just arrived and will be installed within the next few days. I am sure this equipment will lighten greatly the work in the laundry department and so will be greatly appreciated.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nOttawa, May 24, 1945.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant,\nwith reference to your inspection of the Brandon Indian\nResidential School. The Department is prepared to\nfavourably consider the following:\n\n1. Repairs to barn, which you estimate at $1,000.00.\n   A requisition should be forwarded for the\n   material required.\n\n2. Eaves troughing on the barns and the Principal's\n   residence. Please forward tenders from reliable\n   firms.\n\n3. You may also authorize the Principal to obtain\n   tenders for painting the farmer's house, the\n   Principal's residence and the cottage. No doubt\n   you will consult him regarding the firms who\n   should be asked to quote.\n\n4. In view of the condition of the sign, you should\n   instruct the Principal to remove it.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, May 24, 1945.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nLast January we received your voucher No. 27, issued in favour of Yates & Company. This included three accounts, in amounts as follows: $12.65; $176.95 and $222.04. The latter item was returned to Yates & Company in a letter dated January 19, 1945, as the account as originally presented was not sufficiently detailed. Subsequently, the Company returned this account and it was paid, but in doing so we apparently overlooked the first two accounts for $12.65 and $176.95. I am returning these to you and would appreciate it if you would make out a new voucher. In each case you should quote the authority for the expenditure on the voucher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. O. B.

As you will note from the account, this expenditure was incurred last December, at a time when the temperature was low and the heating equipment had to be kept in first class condition. The firm has only now submitted the account to the Principal, who has forwarded it to this office. It would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order, so that it may be paid.

In discussing this matter with the inspector, Mr. Moodie, I find that he is of the opinion that the head of this boiler may have to be renewed within the next year. The deterioration of the head has resulted in the necessity for the frequent expansion of the tubes to stop leakage with a resultant thinning of the tubes at the head.\n\nMay I have immediate authority for Messrs. Yates & Coy. to proceed with the other repairs mentioned as they are necessary before firing the boilers.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I enclose copies of the Inspector's reports.\n\nIt is expected, of course, that the cost will be kept as low as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\n\nRev. O. B. Strapp,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nAs originally designed and installed in 1929 the water supply system at this school was quite simple and except in case of fire the operation was automatically controlled. It was realized that the quantity of water available from the reservoir was limited and conservation of water would be necessary. Of the estimated daily usage of 5,000 gallons, about 4,000 gallons were supplied by gravity to the barns, kitchens, laundry, children's showers and toilets, the boilers and hot water heaters. The other services on the main floor and the floors above were supplied through the pressure tank system. This system consisted of a 2 H.P. motor direct connected on the same shaft to a 1,000 g.p.m. typhoon pump connected with a 1,200 gallon pressure tank which ordinarily supplied water to the services at pressure varying from 40 lbs. to 80 lbs; the operation of the pump being controlled by automatic pressure regulator. An air compressor was installed to maintain the required air pressure in the tank and safety valves were also included. The 15 H.P. Motor driven centrifugal pump was installed for fire and emergency use only.\n\nThe system worked very well until 1939 when the lessening water supply necessitated the tapping of an auxiliary water supply and in 1940 a pipe line was laid from a newly constructed reservoir at a higher spring some 1,500 feet distant. This new work was not laid out or constructed by this office and we are not familiar with the alteration made in connection with the water supply services. It appears, however, that this upper reservoir supplied a gravity head of about 25 lbs. pressure and so eliminated the necessity for pump operation entirely and the piping was changed accordingly. This necessitated the installation of several more valves throughout the water system and as long as water supply met the water demand the system was very satisfactory. It would also appear that with the advent of the complete gravity system the use of water increased and the pumping installation was permitted to deteriorate.\n\nDuring the past winter and probably during the past two or three winters there were times when the demand for water exceeded the supply and the pressure became inadequate to supply services. To overcome this deficiency the school management had to fall back on the water supply of the lower reservoir and pumping had to be resorted to. The Typhoon Pump was out of order and the large pump had to be operated without benefit of automatic control. To maintain a water supply all night under these conditions would have necessitated the engineer remaining on the job. The failure of the water supply referred to by the present Principal of the school was a result of the method of operation rather than from any shortage of water in the reservoirs. The many valves in the system, while apparently placed of necessity, rather added to the difficulty of operation when a switch from the gravity supply to pumping became necessary.\n\nT. S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering and Construction Service,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nThe situation at the school was investigated on two occasions this summer by engineers from this office. Both visits happened to follow heavy rains and the water supply was abundant with overflow from the springs forming little streams. There have been staff changes and the present staff is conversant only with conditions as existed last winter. It is difficult to understand the complaints as to shortage of water at night with the gravity system\u2014a period of low usage of water. With severe frosty nights there may have been sufficient lowering of pressure to affect the water supply on the top storey of the building. Whatever the trouble it is desirable that it be eliminated and that the pumping operations be made as inexpensive, simple and automatic as possible.\n\nThe water supply system in the school worked satisfactorily from 1929 to 1939 and it is proposed to return to that system in principle. The basement distribution system which includes the barns and outside services will be supplied by gravity from both the high and low reservoirs at pressures of about 25 lbs. and 6\u00bd lbs., respectively. Water will flow from the lower reservoir only when the supply fails from the upper reservoir. The other floors of the building will be supplied by a pressure system varying from 30 lbs. to 60 lbs., through the pressure tank and supplied by pumping from the gravity supply. The use of water at the school is estimated by the Principal to be about 13,000 gallons daily which appears to be a high rate of usage. However, about 50% of this usage will be supplied by gravity.\n\nThe Principal of the School has suggested that a 2,000 gallon per hour pump be installed and the system of valves simplified. The 1,000 g.p.h. pump now installed needs thorough overhauling and probably replacement, although I believe $60.00 was recently spent upon the motor. If the pump has to be replaced it is suggested that a 1,000 g.p.h. pump is adequate but as pumping noises have always caused complaints in the school, a 2,000 g.p.h. pump should reduce the periods of annoyance 50%. A new pressure switch must be installed. The use of the large pump must be limited to fire and emergency use. It appears that the small pump is now utilized to feed water to the high pressure steam boiler. If such is the case the practice should be discontinued and the high pressure steam boiler fed from the source originally connected to.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nIt is recommended that the Typhoon Pump be removed and be examined by a competent machinist to determine whether it should be completely overhauled or replaced and his advice be acted upon. The water distribution system should be altered so as to restore the original idea of having all services above the main basement floor supplied by a pressure tank system. Unnecessary valves should be removed and check valves installed where necessary to provide the combined gravity and pressure system. The whole distribution system should be thoroughly gone over to eliminate the present excessive leakage and waste of water. Provision should be made for using the large centrifugal pump in the system but only as a standby for water supply and for fire protection.\n\nWe are unable to give any reasonable estimate of the probable cost of carrying out the work involved in the above outlined suggestions. The work involved is more or less in the nature of maintenance work and the extent of the work will be governed to a considerable degree by what is discovered as the job progresses.\n\n(Sgd.) D.B. Gow,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\nMr. Hoey\n\nRe: Water Supply, Brandon Indian Residential School\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of May 17th last, relative to the above, I am enclosing for your information, copy of a letter dated August 21st from Mr. D.B.Gow, outlining the water situation and recommending what work should be undertaken to put the water system at the school on a more workable and economical basis.\n\nMr. Gow's recommendations are concurred in, and it is considered that if funds are available, the work should be authorized and put in hand as soon as possible.\n\nIn reply to an inquiry for an estimate of cost, Mr. Gow states:\n\n\"Appears impossible to purchase new pump for Brandon School this year STOP Suggest shipping pump to Winnipeg for examination and overhauling if condition permit of same STOP Can give no reasonable estimate on cost of carrying out recommendation but it would not be less than $500.00 or more than $1,000.00, probably $600.00. However, we want no limitation of authority under the maximum above mentioned.\"\n\nIf you wish us to undertake this work, will you kindly arrange for the transfer of $1,000 to our Engineering and Construction Service for the purpose. It is possible that a smaller amount may be sufficient but a close estimate is impossible until the work is undertaken.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, 21st September, 1945.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nOn receipt of your Annual Report for the fiscal year ending March 31st, 1945, I communicated with the Surveys and Engineering Branch with regard to the water supply at the Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nI enclose for your information a copy of Mr. Gow's report. At the present time it appears impossible to purchase a new pump, consequently the only action we can take is to ship the present pump to Winnipeg for examination and overhauling.\n\nWe are transferring an amount of $1,000.00 to the Surveys and Engineering Branch in order that they may carry out, at the earliest possible date, the recommendations contained in Mr. Gow's report.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. O.B. Strapp,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Manitoba.\nOttawa, 21st September, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR OF SURVEYS AND ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nRe: Water Supply - Brandon Indian Residential School, Brandon, Man.\n\nI received your memorandum of the 19th instant enclosing report from Mr. D.B. Gow, in which he states that he considers the water supply at the above school could be improved at an approximate cost of $1,000.00.\n\nThe Representative of the Treasury is being requested to transfer this amount to you.\n\nActing Director.\nOttawa, 21st September, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nPlease transfer the amount of $1,000.00 to the Surveys and Engineering Branch. These funds are required for the urgent repairs to the water supply system at the Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nActing Director.\nOttawa, 21st September, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nPlease transfer the amount of $1,000.00 to the Surveys and Engineering Branch. These funds are required for the urgent repairs to the water supply system at the Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nActing Director.\nEXTRACT from letter from A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba, dated 11th October, 1945.\n\n\"As yet none of the homes have been painted and I do not think Mr. Strapp was even successful in securing a quotation on the work. I understand he got a price on the eavestroughing job; but as yet nothing has been done. The $1,000.00 allowed for the repairs to the barn also has been untouched. Mr. Strapp stated he could get no one and he had thoroughly canvassed the contractors in Brandon. The result is I must report, no outside improvement.\n\nThe Stockman, Mr. Osborne, stated he could have had the barn shingled with the boys; but Mr. Strapp considered the work too dangerous. He was afraid an accident might occur. It seems to me that this is a type of training the senior boys need and with good supervision there should be very little danger if only a small number were allowed to be on the roof at one time. I do not know the Department's wish in a matter of this kind but felt it should be presented for consideration.\n\nThe large steam mangle has been installed and appears to be working well. Mr. Yates, the plumber, states the steam upright boiler can produce enough steam if properly handled.\n\nThe road leading into the School has grown up on each side with grass and weeds. The garden plots along the road are weedy and ill kept. This condition may be due to lack of labour. Certainly the farmer could not do this work and supervise the work on the 960-acre farm.\n\nThe hay crop, I understand, was good. Threshing had just started and the yield expected to be fair. There is little garden other than some beets and potatoes. No doubt the potato crop will meet all their needs.\n\nThe Stockman was busy repairing the cement floor in the hog barn. He informed me he had just completed replacing 18 panes of glass in the cow barn and there were still that many more to do. There are also 17 panes broken in the hog barn and if the slaughter house (one end of the hog barn) is to be made usable, another 32 panes will be required. I looked over the horse barn and found about 18 panes broken and one entire sash missing.\"\nOttawa, 16th October, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Strapp:\n\nI am in receipt of a report from Inspector Hamilton regarding his visit to the Brandon School on September 25th.\n\nIt appears that the work authorized in previous letters during the past few months has not yet been done. Presumably this is due to difficulty in securing labour. However, as we are anxious to have Brandon School in as good condition as finances will permit, I would appreciate it if you would make another effort to have the repairs authorized carried out at the earliest possible date.\n\nI understand from the Inspector's letter that the following panes are missing:\n\n- 17 Panes in the Hog Barn\n- 32 Panes in the Slaughter House\n- 18 Panes in the Horse Barn\n\nIn the latter place, one entire sash is missing. I know you will agree with me that such a condition makes the buildings mentioned look as if no one was much interested. Replacing the glass is a comparatively simple job. I wish you would arrange to have all broken or missing glass repaired at once.\n\nI was also sorry to learn that the road leading into the school had grown up with grass and weeds. Again I think you will agree with me it is very important that roadways leading to any of our residential schools should be kept in first class shape, not only\n\n...........\nfor the example of Indian pupils but also to avoid criticism from outsiders.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

I also regret very much that I personally accepted any responsibility for attempting to have the repairs made, as it has simply been a headache during the past year and I am very little further ahead.\n\nI was in touch with the contractors for the eavestroughing on Tuesday last and they were not even civil about the matter. They just informed me that when they were able to get the material they would do the job, but at present all supplies were taken up by Wartime Housing, and if Indian Affairs wanted the work done they must supply a 'Priority Rating'.\n\nI am enclosing a tender submitted by Mr. F. Young for the painting but Mr. Young informs me that as the eavestroughing has not been done and the season is late this work should not be done until next April. I beg to suggest that this tender be held in abeyance until the early part of the next fiscal year.\n\nThe matter of replacing of glass in the windows is simply one of time. It should really have been done before I accepted any responsibility for the school. I have had the men doing as much repair work as possible in addition to their regular work at the school. To date about 150 panes of glass have been replaced, repairs have been carried out to the cement floors in the barns, window frames and doors have been repaired, and at the very time of Mr. Hamilton's visit Mr. Osborne of our staff had the glass for the windows in the hog pen and in the course of a day or so these panes of glass were all in the frames.\nWith reference to the \"weeds and grass\" even Dr. Doyle found it quite a problem to keep these under control when I visited this school in 1936. At that time there was a fairly large group of senior boys who could be trusted with a scythe. I spoke to our farm instructor about the matter and he advised that it would be wise to burn this off rather than attempt to use mowers as already they had broken a mower tongue on one of the many stumps that are only just above ground. I will see that this is attended to as soon as possible.\n\nI quite agree that there are a number of things about this school that make it appear \"as if no one was very much interested in it,\" and this goes back for quite a number of years. However that does not help us today. I am definitely interested and I am sure that you too are interested, but it will take time and money to repair the neglect of the past. I am wondering whether the windows, sashes and frames, have been painted since the building was built in 1929? If this matter is not attended to in the near future it will be necessary to make repairs to the woodwork.\n\nI am very much of the opinion that this school should be visited by a competent authority, a careful survey made of the requirements and a program of repairs planned over several years to put the buildings in first class order, and thereafter a definite program of upkeep should be adopted.\n\nThis year has been one of extreme difficulty, particularly in the matter of the administration of discipline. I was very much encouraged on my visits to many of the reservations by the kindly attitude and the very evident interest of so many of the parents toward, and in the school. I believe that there is a real trend toward higher standards of education, particularly along vocational lines, amongst many of the Saskatchewan and Manitoba Indians and hope that with the close of the war it will be possible to obtain the necessary equipment and instructors to carry on this type of training.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nMcDOWELL & DOKE\nTinsmiths, Heating and Ventilating\nALL ESTIMATES FREE\n115 NINTH STREET\nBRANDON, MAN.

Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Hamilton:\n\nI understand that you have reported to Ottawa that I am not proceeding with the repairs authorized. I am enclosing a letter which I would ask you to transmit to Ottawa. Until last week it was not possible to get anyone to even come out to the school to give a figure on the painting job. I have submitted a figure given by Mr. Young, and he recommends that the work be deferred to next April or May. Mr. Matthews, M.P., tried to get a man to figure on the barn but he just came out, took one look at the proposition and went home again.\n\nAs I said in my letter to Mr. Phelan, I am very sorry that I accepted any responsibility for attempting to get any of the repairs done. It has been nothing but a headache and this really belongs to Indian Affairs, not to the Church Management, under existing agreements.\n\nI wonder if any provision has been made for the painting of the window sashes and frames of the main building since it was built, because it does not look like it, and outside paint will only last approximately five years.\n\nThe main trouble, it seems to me, lies in the fact that a building is put up and expected to last indefinitely without a settled program of maintenance being set up with the completion of the building.\n\nBut for the fact that I am definitely interested in this school and am willing to co-operate for the sake of the school and my own comfort, I would feel like saying \"The buildings belong to Indian Affairs the agreement between the Church and Indian Affairs calls for Indian Affairs to provide and maintain the property and for the Church to provide Staff and manage the school, let us both stay with our own side of the agreement.\"\n\nHowever, I realize the difficulties inherent in attempting to...\nmaintain property scattered over the country, and will endeavour to co-operate in getting these repairs done, but it must be distinctly understood that this is a matter of Co-operation and not a duty on my part.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of the estimates submitted by Mr. Young.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"Oliver B. Strapp\"\n\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nI enclose for your information a copy of a letter from Mr. Strapp, together with the enclosures referred to my him.\n\nI am somewhat surprised at the attitude assumed by Mr. Strapp. My experience in the past has always been that the Principals were so delighted at receiving authority for improvements that by one means or another they got the work done. Rarely, if ever, did they permit the authority for the expenditure to lapse unused. Mr. Strapp has undoubtedly tried; but apparently according to the second paragraph of his letter, he considers this is not part of his work and he does not like \"headaches\" that belong to someone else.\n\nThe Department know better than I do what is required of a Principal. If this is not part of his duties all well and good - if it is, then he should be so instructed.\n\nI would like to go further with this and state if the supervising and arranging of the repair work is not a part of Mr. Strapp's work then this school should definitely be linked up with the Griswold Agency. Mr. Young is only twenty miles from Brandon and he could, if instructed, give valuable assistance. I stated before and I am still convinced that both the Elkhorn and Brandon Schools should be tied in with the Griswold Agency and should receive regular visits from the Agent. It is not possible to do detailed work at this office for any school, because the volume of work carried on by myself and one stenographer cannot be increased. The work done by Mrs. Matheson, I am convinced, is more than was expected from any previous stenographer and is much more than the average stenographer can do. I give long hours both when in the field and in the office and I find no time for thoughtful planning, and in a responsible position of this kind such should not be the case.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You should bring this matter to our attention about the middle of March, in order that the necessary arrangements can be made before the fine weather commences.\n\nI am glad to note from your letter that the broken panes of glass have now been replaced.\n\nI was somewhat surprised at the contents of your letter to Mr. Hamilton. The Principal at every residential school always seems extremely anxious to have repairs and improvements carried out under his personal supervision, as such action generally gives more satisfaction. I certainly cannot agree with many of the statements that you have made to Mr. Hamilton. If my memory serves me correctly, when you were at Mount Elgin you were only too anxious to look after any repairs and improvements authorized by the Department.\n\nI feel that since you took charge of Brandon you have had a very trying time, both personally and in connection with the work, and from my previous knowledge of you, I feel certain that when\n\nRev.

I instructed one of our men to remove the insulation and found that there had been a leak from one of the seams and that the boiler was badly rusted and the sheet pitted in the vicinity of the leak. I arranged for the local Provincial Boiler Inspector, Mr. Moodie, to inspect the boiler and he advised me yesterday that it would be necessary to get the Canadian Brown Steel Tank Coy. to bring our their portable welder and weld on a patch before the boiler could again go into service.\n\nWill you please give me the authority to make arrangements to have this done as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, 16th November, 1945.\n\nAIRMAIL\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant, you may arrange for repairs required to be made to the No. 1 low pressure boiler at the Brandon Residential School.

Considerable delay was occasioned by the absence of the Principal from the school and it was only about three weeks ago that the pump was received at the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Warehouse in Winnipeg. We are assured by that firm that the pump is repairable but that delay is being occasioned in the overhauling by the difficulty in getting certain parts. It is hoped, however, to have the pump in good working order shortly and returned to the institution.\n\nAs soon as the pump is again installed, it is our intention to engage a firm in Brendon to make the other alterations which are considered necessary in the pumping plant to render it fully automatic.\"\n\nYou will note that Mr. Gow has the matter in hand.\n\nT.S.

Mr. Strapp, together with a quotation from the Vulcan Iron Works, on a steam boiler desired by Mr. Strapp. You will note the expense involved and to this must be added the cost of installing the equipment.\n\nIn May of this year Mr. Strapp sent a letter here complaining of the water shortage; and along with his letter he sent sketches of changes which he wanted in the water hook-up. He wanted the complicated system of ten valves replaced with a simpler system using a 2000-gallon motor driven pump. He claimed the same recommendations were sent to Ottawa with his annual report.\n\nThe equipment and changes desired by Mr. Strapp may all be essential, however they will involve heavy expenditure and before anything is done I recommend that expert advice be obtained from a competent engineer. The proposed requests sound quite in order; but to an expert there may be a better way of solving the problem and obtaining more for the expense involved.\n\nA.G.

However, the repairs to the pump were completed early in January, and last week Mr. J. T. Rose of this staff took it to Brandon and had it installed and tested. This test revealed what was necessary in the line of new equipment and what further alterations were necessary to again make the water supply system automatic. This work will be proceeded with.\n\n\"Mr. Rose reports verbally that with the alterations already made the water supply at the school is now not unsatisfactory although the conservation of the supply has been found necessary. Mr. Rose is preparing a brief memorandum on the water supply system as he found it and this memorandum will be forwarded to you shortly.\"\n\nJ. M.

T. Rose of this staff spent January 24th and 25th at the Brandon Indian Residential School and had a local plumber reinstall the small typhon pump which had just undergone overhauling. He then had tests made on the operation of this pump.\n\n\"Mr. Rose found that the school staff were not conversant with the general water supply installation and accordingly were not operating the system advantageously. The water supply system derives the water supply from three sources and operates both under gravity and pressure so that numerous valves are a part of the system. The examinations and tests as made by Mr. Rose show that the water supply system can be made quite satisfactory provided the amount of water available from the three reservoirs holds up. Replacement and repair of equipment will be necessary and some additional equipment will be required to make this system more simply operated.\n\n\"The Principal of the School writes us under date of February 8th that the water supply system is holding satisfactorily. However, we will proceed with the necessary repair and replacement of equipment within the building and the installation of some additional parts in order to secure automatic pump operation. Some outside work in connection with reservoir and valves must await more favourable weather conditions.\"\n\nJ. M.

After being thoroughly cleaned, it is assumed that the existing storage tanks will be satisfactory.\n\n(b) Installing a horizontal, firebox type, return tubular high pressure boiler of approximately 50 H.P. capacity with mechanical stoker, pressure reducing valve, new indirect steam hot water heater, condensation pump, the necessary new piping and other standard accessories, as well as building an additional flue on the existing chimney.\n\nBy the suggested remodelling operations, ample high pressure steam and hot water could be made available from one source; a number of units of outworn equipment soon needing repairs or replacement would be eliminated, and a considerable saving of fuel would be possible.\n\nThe estimated cost of the suggested remodelling, including materials, labour, contingencies and supervision, would be in the neighborhood of $6800.00.\n\nIf our recommendation is approved, drawings and specifications should be prepared by this Service, on the basis of a thorough examination of the whole system by an officer from Ottawa.\n\nChief Engineer.\nOttawa, March 5, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, SURVEYS and ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nRe: Indian Residential School, Brandon, Man.\n\nI have your memorandum of February 25, reporting on the high pressure steam supply at the above mentioned school.

McDowell & Doke will proceed with the eaves troughing in the near future. I presume that the cost of the material and labour will not exceed $339.45, which was the quotation forwarded to this office with your letter of July 3, 1945.\n\nLast October Inspector Hamilton forwarded a tender that he had received from Mr. F. H. Young, 404, Fourteenth Street, Brandon, for the painting. This quotation amounted to $1,041.70. I would like to know if this figure still stands and also if it is possible to secure a quotation from some other firm. This matter will have to receive the Minister's attention and I am usually requested to state if competitive prices have been secured.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend O.

Please let me know if you think competitive prices can be obtained for the painting.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Mr. Phelan;\n\nIn reply to your letter of the above noted date and file number, may I say that it was not possible to get another contractor to figure on the houses at the time the prices were submitted and it was only after considerable urging that Mr. Young came out and submitted his estimate.\n\nI saw Mr. Young last week and he informed me that he was quite busy and had considerable work already promised ahead and if awarded the contract could not begin work for at least another three weeks. With the amount of new work that is going on in Brandon I feel that we will be fortunate in getting anyone at all to come out and do the work.\n\nMcDowell and Doke will be ready to proceed with the work in a few days.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, April 17th, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nACTING DEPUTY MINISTER.\n\nI attach quotation which has been received by the Principal of the Brandon School and forwarded to us by Inspector Hamilton, in connection with the exterior painting required at the Brandon School at a total cost of $1041.70.\n\nThis tender was originally received last Fall but we felt that the season had advanced too far to do the work at that time.

In several places the plaster is breaking from the walls and is only held up by the covering of paper which is several plies thick.\n\nOur present farm instructor is leaving us before the beginning of the next school term and a new man will be moving into the house. This means that there will be a few days during which the house will be empty and it will be comparatively easy to get the work done.\n\nThe Cottage occupied by our Utility Man is also in need of redecoration. The plaster on both walls and ceilings is of the rough type of finish. The house has settled since it was built and the places where the plaster came off have been replastered but never repainted. This house should be redecorated throughout in order to make it fit to live in.\n\nMr. Young is at present working on the contract for the painting of the outside of the houses and with the labor situation as difficult as it is, I think it would be advisable to have this other work done while he has men available out here.\n\nI am enclosing specifications and tenders which I requested from Mr. Young.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I further found out that other considerable sums have been spent recently at this school, including $161.70 for a painting tender and $279.45 for savestroughing tender.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nJuly 29th, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nIn connection with Mr. Hoey's memorandum of May 23rd, 1946 and your notations of the 28th instant thereon and further to our memorandum of February 25th, 1946, you are advised as follows:\n\nOur Mr. Hargreaves was sent to Brandon on June 16th, 1946, to obtain technical data in order that a layout and specification might be prepared for this work.\n\nSummarized, it can be stated that after a thorough inspection of the design and installed equipment in the laundry and domestic hot water services, extensive alterations and replacements are vitally necessary if these services are to function normally. Much of the equipment is worn out and the piping installation is of very poor design.\n\nGoing into some detail it can be stated that:\n\nThe high pressure steam boiler is badly rusted and in operation is greatly overloaded. It is a 10 horsepower unit which was originally intended to serve the tumbler dryer, and laundry only, which in themselves require 12 horsepower, steam at 100 lbs. per square inch. Of late, due to an almost total lack of hot water, this boiler has been used to heat water in the washing machine which adds approximately 10 horsepower. In view of the above load and the fact that the safety valve setting to 80 lbs. per square inch is obvious that the boiler cannot be operated safely. No means for replacing loss by evaporation to the boiler is provided, the boiler being the only method of heating.\n\nBoiler pressure fluctuated from 70 to 100 lbs. per square inch and could not be kept constant under normal and sudden demands.\n\nIt was found that an Indian lad aged 15 years was employed to tend the boiler for periods up to 2 hours, while the boiler maker was engaged on other duties. Such responsibilities should not be placed upon the Department open to censure in case of a fatal accident.\n\nThe domestic hot water storage tank has been badly rusted. It was found to be very thin in places and pitted. It is our opinion that the tank is intended to be heated by an electric heater connected to both the hot water service and to a jacket heater for the boiler. The heater is badly rusted and sealed.\n\nDirector\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6257, file 576-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nin the interior and is located in such a manner that the element cannot be removed for cleaning without dismantling the entire unit. For the service intended this heater should have been a steam fed type. The connections between the heater and tank are poorly made as are the connections between the jacket heater and tank.\n\nThe jacket heater is badly scaled and is in very poor shape. A 200 gallon tank with a submerged steam fed coil serves the upper floor and is apparently giving satisfaction. The jacket heater serving this tank in summer is in bad shape. Connections between the jacket heater and tank are poorly made.\n\n3. The low pressure heating boilers are in need of some repairs and a good cleaning, and can be expected to give further service if reasonable care and attention is given them. Grates should be replaced in one unit and the covering should be replaced. The steam connections in the boiler room are not too bad except that the covering has deteriorated badly.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nIn view of the fact that the high pressure boiler, the indirect heater, the jacket heaters and 1000 gallon storage tank are unfit for further service, and totally unable to cope with the demand, it is recommended that the plant be modernized and brought up to date so that trouble free service will be available.\n\nSince the domestic hot water load and the high pressure steam requirements nearly balance the building heating load, it is recommended that one new steel portable high pressure steam boiler of 40 horse-power be installed to handle all high pressure steam services and to heat all domestic hot water for the entire building. A stoker should be provided for this boiler along with an automatic boiler feed pump and cold water replacement regulator, plus all standard boiler fittings.\n\nOne low pressure heating boiler should be scrapped and the remaining boiler thoroughly cleaned, fitted with new grates and re-covered. This boiler when discarded from the domestic hot water service will be capable of handling the building heating load except under most adverse weather conditions, under which circumstances the high pressure boiler can be made to help out by a connection through a pressure reducing valve to the low pressure header.\n\nShould it be necessary at some time in the future to make further repairs to the low pressure boiler, the new high pressure boiler would have sufficient capacity to carry the heating load temporarily at relatively small sacrifice to the domestic hot water and laundry service.\n\nA new 1000 gallon storage tank with a self contained regulating valve should be installed with an indirect steam fed heater of 500 gallons per hour capacity. The 200 gallon tank can be retained but its submerged coil should be connected to the high pressure boiler load.\n\nSteam connections to the tank heaters should be made from the low pressure header.\n\nBoth jacket heaters should be dispensed with.\n\nThe estimated cost for this work installed is $7000.00\n\nShould our recommendations be approved and authority issued to proceed with the work, we recommend that it be carried out on the basis of data and instructions prepared in this office, with supervision supplied by Mr. Gow. We feel that it would be difficult to obtain a lump sum tender from a contractor, and consider that Mr. Gow should be authorized to obtain materials and skilled tradesmen to the best advantage locally.\n\nT.

Hargreaves of our Engineering and Construction Service staff and for your information I am enclosing a copy of Mr. Mills' memorandum of July 29th in which Mr. Hargreaves' recommendations are embodied.\n\nMr. Mills' recommendations are concurred in. If it is your wish that the work be proceeded with along the lines suggested, will you kindly advise us accordingly so that the necessary instructions can be sent Mr. Gow as soon as possible.

He has been only able to allot him an amount not to exceed $1,500.00.\n\nIn other words, the appropriation for your school has already been exceeded and we have not the money to authorize further expenditures.\n\nWe are faced with similar requests from practically all our Residential Schools and already have stretched our small funds to the limit. Increased labour and material costs have added to the problem. I hope you will appreciate the Department's position in having to reject your proposal.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend O. B. Strapp,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Manitoba.\n\nCOPY SENT TO INSPECTOR HAMILTON\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDeptmt.of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI beg to make the following submissions for your attention:\n\n1. Kitchen Stove:\n   This stove has had minor repairs on a number of occasions but will now need to be replaced as the interior baffles have burned out and the oven plates are very thin. The canopy is in good shape and will not have to be replaced.\n\n2. Steam heating plant, low and high pressure:\n   The low pressure boilers to which are connected the hot water supply tanks are not in very good shape as the shells have been patched on a number of occasions. Both boilers need retubing as small leaks have developed which indicate that the tubes are pitting. The heating system for the pupils hot water supply does not function satisfactorily necessitating the carrying of hot water for the pupils bathing from the staff supply on the main floor. The two auxiliary jacket heaters are not able to cope with the demand for hot water at any time.\n\n   The high pressure boiler for the laundry has deteriorated in the head with the result that the constant movement with the expansion and contraction of the head causes the tubes to become loose from time to time thus causing leaks at the tube ends. I doubt whether this boiler will pass another inspection without the effective steam pressure being reduced. This will mean loss of efficiency in our drying and flatwork ironing machines.\n\nover.\nThe Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nThe Engineering & Surveys Branch, Winnipeg, has made a complete survey of the pump room and the boiler room and no doubt have a complete report on the matter. It is imperative that this matter be considered as soon as possible.\n\n3. The whole of the interior of the school should be painted, particularly the pupils quarters. This could be done in units from time to time.\n\n4. The class rooms need redecoration and attention should be paid to the lighting, especially of the two rooms with northern exposure. The present system of electric lighting is not good and I would suggest that the new system of fluorescent lighting be installed.\n\n5. There is not any provision for seating or lockers in the basement play rooms for the pupils. I would recommend that a type of box-seat-locker be provided. This could be done by the senior boys as soon as material is available, as a manual training project after school opens.\n\nThe seating in the assembly room is very inadequate, there being only 75 seats available for pupils and staff. It is necessary to carry benches from the pupils' dining room up to the assembly hall with the resultant wrecking of the benches and frequent damage to the plaster in the halls. A large number of these chairs have been repaired, but we should have at least another 75 new ones.\n\nI believe that Mr. Inspector Hamilton of Winnipeg could secure a suitable chair, through the warden of the penitentiary, at a reasonable price.\n\n6. The barns are in very poor condition. #1. Horse barn; Roof needs re-shingling on south side and considerable repairs to the north side. #2 Dairy barn; roof needs re-shingling and possible replacement of sheeting in several places. #3 Hog pen; Roof needs repairs to sheeting and re-shingling. All these buildings need repairs to outside sheeting and painting.\n\n#4 Barn is in serious condition and should be wrecked and the materials used to build a good hog pen, poultry house, and granary. There is sufficient material to frame all these buildings and have sufficient for the framing of a manual training shop.\n\nI respectfully beg to suggest again (ref letter Oct.19,1945) that \"this school should be visited by a competent authority.\"\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\n\"a careful survey made of the requirements, and a program of repairs planned over several years to put the buildings in first class order. That thereafter a definite program of upkeep should be adopted.\"\n\nMay I say that I shall be only too pleased to co-operate with Indian Affairs Officials as far as possible in this matter.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, August 26, 1946.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have for answer your second letter of August 16, which unfortunately did not arrive with your first letter, previously answered by my 133-0-5 of August 21.\n\n1. Kitchen stove -\n\nI have requested Inspector Hamilton to make an inspection of this stove so that a decision can be reached as to whether it is beyond repair.\n\n2. Steam heating plant -\n\nAs I indicated in my former letter, an allotment has been made of $1,500.00 to the Surveys and Engineering Branch for repairs and replacements to this system.\n\n3. Painting -\n\nI would recommend that you make a further submission as to the painting of the pupils' quarters in time for next year's estimates.\n\n4. Lighting -\n\nI would recommend that at some time you have one of the local electric contractors conduct the necessary tests as to the efficiency of this lighting in these classrooms. I believe that in a town the size of Brandon the General Electric Company or the Mazda Company should have a light testing machine available.\n\n5. Lockers -\n\nYou can submit a requisition for the materials necessary\n\n..... to construct\nto construct 30 box-seat-lockers. I feel that this number will be enough to authorize at present, as it will probably take your boys some 6 months to complete these. You can write us further when more lumber is required.\n\n6. Condition of barns -\n\nI will try to have Mr. Doucet visit your school during the 1946-47 school term.\n\nI appreciate your co-operation in this regard and regret that I was unable to meet you during my visit to your school.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

In the complete revision, several items, all relatively costly are needed. These items include a new high pressure boiler, new indirect heater, new domestic hot water storage tank, new jacket heaters, with piping and valves and other smaller accessories.\n\nTo get the greatest value for the funds available, it will be necessary to complete one phase of the work, and after thoroughly considering the matter, such funds as are available should be spent on improvements to the domestic hot water supply system.\n\nIt is therefore recommended that the following operations be undertaken, as the first phase of the revisions.\n\n(a) Provide one new indirect steam fed heater having a steel shell and copper tube removable element.\n\n(b) Provide one new 1000 gallon domestic hot water storage tank.\n\n(c) Provide one new self contained regulator valve.\n\n(d) Provide all necessary piping and valves to complete the connections. Drawings will be prepared by this Service outlining the hook-up. The heater, regulator valve and tank, necessary components of the complete scheme, would remain undisturbed except for revisions to piping, at a time when the remaining new items of equipment are provided. This phase of the work will obviate the necessity of introducing live steam to the laundry washer from the high pressure boiler, thereby eliminating one dangerous practice now being followed.\n\nFreed of its domestic hot water demand, the existing high pressure boiler might be nursed along to serve with partial efficiency, the demands of the laundry equipment. It is emphasized however, that this Service does not assume any responsibility for the safety of the high pressure boiler, during its operation under present conditions.\n\nJ. M.

We are attaching hereto, two prints and two copies of the plan and specification.\n\nWe believe that these operations can be completed under arrangements outlined in the last paragraph of our memorandum dated August 20th, 1946, within the limits of funds made available by Indian Affairs.\n\nExcept for relatively minor changes to the piping, this work will be undisturbed when the balance of the plant revisions are carried out.\n\nBoth heating boilers will be in operation during the heating season, and in the off heating season, one heating boiler will be used to meet the domestic hot water demands. Either boiler may be used.\n\nIt is recommended that the live steam line from the existing high pressure boiler to the laundry washer be disconnected as soon as this new work is ready for operation.\n\nCopies of the drawing, specification, together with instructions regarding operations to be carried out are being forwarded to Mr. Cow immediately.\n\nT.

I discussed this with the Principal Mr. Strapp, and he referred to his recent letter to Ottawa, dealing with repairs and implied the letter outlined all necessary work for which provision must be made. There has been improvements made at the school since Mr. Strapp came but considerable money will be needed next year if necessary improvements are to be completed.\n\nThe hot water and heating needs extensive overhauling which I understand will cost around $7,000.00. Repairs are needed to the two barns and it is suggested it will take over $2,000.00 to cover the cost of labor and material. The interior of the school needs painting and to do the playrooms, washrooms, and halls on the first floor will cost for material and labor another $1,000.00. Mr. Strapp already has a quotation on interior painting as suggested above for $580.00 but I doubt if this quotation will be available next year.\n\nIf we expect to keep these large schools in good repair more money must be provided in the estimates. I hope the need will be realized and provision made for the necessary expense.\n\nA.G. Hamilton  \nInspector of Indian Agencies  \nfor Manitoba\nOttawa, 4 October, 1946.\n\nMr. A.G.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa, Ontario  \n\nRE: Range Brandon School  \nYour file 133-0-5WT\n\nI was at Brandon School September 27, and inspected the range. It is a heavy duty Gurney Oxford No.13CL. There are three ovens with a fire box at one end of the range. The one firebox is supposed to heat the three ovens.\n\nThe range I am told has never been entirely satisfactory. About ten years ago when Dr. Doyle was principal he hoped to improve it by installing a blower and forcing the heat to the second and third ovens. The blower did help some but intensified the heat on the surface and the first oven with the result that the metal is warped and some of the lining destroyed. In view of the history of the range and its present condition I would recommend a new one be provided when available. This is not an emergency but a suitable range is necessary. There are over 200 to cook for and it is impossible to do so satisfactorily with the present equipment.\n\nI trust a new range will be purchased as soon as a suitable one can be made available.\n\nA.G.

You should secure an account in duplicate and forward same for our consideration. However, we are advising the Secretary of the Board of Home Missions that Mr. Strapp could have wired this office or could have communicated with you by telephone. It is realized that the matter was urgent but at the same time we have very definite purchasing regulations and I am inclined to feel that it will be difficult to have this passed for payment.\n\nBernard F.

Strapp with regard to the furnace in the Principal's residence.\n\nWhile it appears from Mr. Strapp's telegram that immediate action was necessary, it is felt that he could have telegraphed the Department or telephoned Inspector Hamilton in Winnipeg. As far as we know, Mr. Strapp proceeded without consulting anybody. As you know, we have a regular purchasing procedure and while regulations in this regard are flexible in the case of emergency, it is much better for all concerned to receive authority before rather than after a purchase is made involving an amount over $500.\n\nBernard F.

Hamilton,\nInspector of Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Hamilton;\n\nI have had considerable trouble with gas fumes coming up the air pipes from the furnace in my house for some time past. Yesterday I arranged for McDowell and Doke of Brandon to come out and make an inspection of the furnace as they told me that they had repaired it on several occasions.\n\nWhen we took off the outside casing we found that the firebox was split for about eighteen inches along the front and that a piece had fallen out. The radiator on the back had been repaired but had at last burned right through and the result is that the furnace is beyond repair.\n\nFortunately McDowell and Doke had a furnace in stock so I arranged for them to bring it out and set it up at once as of course we must have heat on in the house at this time of the year.\n\nI have sent a night letter to Dr. Dorey asking him to get in touch with the authorities at Ottawa and obtain permission for the expenditure which will run somewhere between $550.00 and $600.00 installed.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"Oliver B.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRe: Brandon Indian Residential School,\nBrandon, Manitoba.\n\nFollowing receipt of Mr. Hoey's memorandum to you dated August 29th last, which bore your notation of September 9th, 1946, this Service communicated with Mr. Gow, and forwarded drawings and specifications for one phase of the work which was all that could be accomplished with the amount of $1,500., stated by Indian Affairs to be the maximum amount that could be made available this fiscal year.\n\nMr. Gow has had great difficulty in finding firms who could be interested in a repair job at the Brandon school and not until November 13th last was he able to submit an estimate.\n\nHowever, on that date Mr. Gow wrote this Service and forwarded a tender from Messrs. Neale, Stothard and Chapman, prepared in accordance with our drawings and specifications, involving an expenditure of $1,992., a considerable increase over the funds provided.\n\nIn his comment, Mr. Gow states that in conversation on the matter with the School Principal, the latter indicated a reluctance to have work on the domestic water distribution system undertaken now, in view of the future work associated with the boilers that will be required next year. Mr. Gow's remarks in this connection are as follows:\n\n\"In discussing the situation at the Brandon Indian School with the Principal, I found that he was fairly well satisfied with the present hot water situation at the school and would much prefer that no action be taken this winter with respect to this installation. It is his idea that if work of major repairs is to be carried out next summer that this repair work can well be delayed until that time. In view of the reluctance of these firms to proceed with this installation along the lines outlined, and the wishes of the Principal of the School, we will not take any further action with respect to the matter until we have had a further communication from you on the subject.\"\n\nIt could be inferred from the above that Mr. Gow might concur in the Principal's opinion.\n\nOur Chief Architect has discussed both the increase in cost and the advisability of deferring operations on the domestic water distribution lines for the present with officers of the Training and Welfare Division, Indian Affairs Branch, and has been\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nverbally advised that having made funds available they favour having the work undertaken, and that in their opinion the additional funds could be found.\n\nUnder these circumstances, it will be necessary to furnish additional funds for the work as follows:\n\nFor work covered by tender from Neale, Stothard and Chapman........... $1992.\n\nContingencies and Supervision........... 200.\n\nTotal funds required.................. $2192.\n\nFunds already transferred.............. 1600.\n\nAdditional funds required.............. $ 692.\n\nMr. Gow has only furnished a carbon copy of the tender and we have requested him to furnish the original for transmission to the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nAs soon as the required action by that officer has been taken, we will instruct Mr. Gow regarding initiating work on the job.\n\n(Sgd.)

A memorandum has now been received from Mr. Mills, copy of which is attached, indicating that a further amount of $692.00 will be required to complete the initial work of this project. There also seems to be doubt as to whether or not repairs should be proceeded with now or delayed until all the work as previously proposed is undertaken.\n\nWill you kindly advise us of your wishes in this regard and arrange to have the necessary additional money transferred to the Engineering and Construction Service if you wish us to continue with this work in the present fiscal year.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, 2 December 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR SURVEYS AND ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nRe: Indian Residential School, Brandon, Manitoba\n\nYour memorandum of the 28th ultimo regarding the above school has been carefully considered.\n\nArrangements will be made to transfer to your Branch, an additional amount of $692.00 in order to complete the initial work of the project underway.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, 2 December 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nPlease transfer to Surveys and Engineering Branch an additional amount of $692.00 in connection with the repairs to the heating system at the Brandon Indian Residential School, No. 576.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, 2 December 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nPlease transfer to Surveys and Engineering Branch an additional amount of $692.00 in connection with the repairs to the heating system at the Brandon Indian Residential School, No. 576.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, 2 December 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR SURVEYS AND ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nRe: Indian Residential School, Brandon, Manitoba\n\nYour memorandum of the 25th ultimo regarding the above school has been carefully considered.\n\nArrangements will be made to transfer to your Branch, an additional amount of $692.00 in order to complete the initial work of the project underway.\n\nDirector.\nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa, Ontario  \n\nRE: Furnace for Brandon School - Principal's home - File 133-0-(W.T.1)  \n\nI wrote Rev.

I have received the accounts for the furnace and forwarded them to Ottawa, under voucher #22.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of the account and of my covering letter to the Secretary.\n\nI have received a communication from Dr. Dorey with a copy of a letter received from Mr. Neary. Mr. Neary is inclined to be rather critical of my action from an official point of view and I quite agree with him officially. However, personally I feel that it would have merited severe criticism had we not taken advantage of the opportunity to get a furnace when it was available as had we had to wait until another could have been ordered we could not have prevented damage to the water system. Another element that enters into the situation is the fact that I am entitled to a comfortable house to live in and had Ottawa taken as long to decide about the furnace as they have about our kitchen stove in the school kitchen, and the repairs to the hot water system and the boilers, I would be wondering where to find a place to live.\n\nI hope that the matter will turn out to be not too serious and that the account will be paid.\"\n\nA.G.

In that connection, may I suggest that the Department consider the purchase of an Esso stove. It is more expensive to begin with than the ordinary type of stove, but it keeps the kitchen cool and conserves a great deal of fuel. It is sold by the J.H. Ashdown Company, who would give a discount of 25% if one were ordered before the end of the year.\n\nMr. Strapp asks me to urge that something be done, as they are in quite a fix in the kitchen.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp: Department of Mines & Resources]\n\n[Handwritten note: VERY POOR COPY]\nOttawa, 10 December 1946.\n\nMr. A.G.

If you refer to your letter of Oct. 1 you will note that you stated that the purchase of a new range was not a necessity and consequently we advised you in official letter of Oct. 7th that funds would be provided in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1947-48.\n\nIn addition to your recent letter, we have also received a letter from the Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada urging the immediate purchase of a new kitchen range. In his letter it is suggested that we secure an Esso stove which is handled by the Ashdown Hardware Company.\n\nPlease let us have full particulars regarding the size of stove required.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRe: Brandon Indian Residential School\n\nFurther to our memorandum of November 23rd, 1946, you are advised that we are in receipt of additional correspondence from Mr. Gow, under date of December 10th, 1946, in which he informs us of a reluctance on the part of the School Principal to have that phase of the work already approved by Indian Affairs carried out this winter, as he feels that considerable disturbance would be created and that the interference to the normal school routine would be troublesome.\n\nIn this connection, the following excerpt is quoted from Mr. Gow's letter dated the 10th instant on the matter:\n\n\"In discussing the situation at the Brandon Indian School with the Principal, I found that he was fairly well satisfied with the present hot water situation at the School and would much prefer that no action be taken this winter with respect to this installation. It is his idea that, if work of major repairs is to be carried out next summer, that this repair work can be well delayed until that time. In view of the reluctance of these firms to proceed with this installation along the lines outlined, and the wishes of the Principal of the School, we will not take any further action with respect to the matter until we have had a further communication with you on the subject.\"\n\nIt is felt that a brief summary of the entire project should be brought to the attention of the Indian Affairs Branch before our commentary is added, and the following outlines in condensed form, the reasons for our previous recommendations.\n\nFrom October 30th, 1945, to February 9th, 1946, complaints, reports, and suggestions were submitted by the School authorities and Mr. Gow's office, all relative to the continuing inefficiencies, failures and general unsatisfactory performance of the existing high pressure steam and domestic hot water services. These conditions were confirmed by an officer from this Service on an inspection made last June. The highlights which should be kept in mind are (1) an inadequate supply of hot water due to several causes, mainly the wearing out of present equipment, (2) the inability of the high pressure boiler to provide steam at sufficient pressure and in sufficient quantity to serve the laundry machines, caused by its deterioration and excessive loads.\n\nOur original recommendation, under date of July 29th, 1946, provided for a complete modernization of this plant, including a new high pressure boiler, sufficient in capacity to\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\n(over)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6257, file 576-5, part 8)\nhandle laundry machinery and a rather large domestic hot water load. The auxiliary equipment necessary to complete this project was included along with an estimate. Indian Affairs not realizing the extent of the work involved, could not see their way clear to provide funds as estimated, and suggested that one phase of the work be carried out at this time, namely, (our recommendation), improvements to the domestic hot water service. We realize that by splitting the work up into two or more phases the cost would be increased because when the final phase is undertaken certain changes and adjustments would be necessary, disturbing to some extent, the new work. In view of the serious shortage of hot water, it was felt that, in spite of this probability, the first operation should be carried out.\n\nIn commenting on the Principal's reluctance to have part of the work done now, during the School season, we wish to say that we fully realize that the disturbance unavoidably created would tend to upset, in varying degrees, the normal school routine. We would certainly prefer having all the work carried out at one time, since a much more satisfactory solution would result.\n\nHowever, due to the time required by Contractors to assemble data for their tenders, and their reluctance to take on new work at this time, any benefit that may have been derived from carrying out one phase of the work has been lost, and it would appear that nothing better could be achieved before the close of the present fiscal year, than the purchase of as much essential equipment as possible from funds now available.\n\nIf Indian Affairs concur, we will prepare a bill of materials for equipment to the approximate value of funds now transferred to this Service, for delivery to the School this fiscal year. This procedure, of course, would require a revised design and specifications embodying the completed work to be undertaken in the 1947-48 fiscal year.\n\nChief Engineer.\nDecember 19th, 1946.\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nRe: Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nPlease refer to your memorandum of December 2nd and previous correspondence relative to the proposed repairs to the heating plant at the above school.\n\nA further memorandum dated December 16th has been received from Mr. Mills, copy of which is attached. It will be noted that the school authorities are still opposed to having any work done until next summer and in addition, it is virtually impossible to get any contractor to undertake the work. In view of the circumstances, Mr. Mills' recommendation to spend the money which is available now on the procurement of equipment and to undertake the complete repairs, as originally proposed, early in the 1947-48 fiscal year, is concurred in.\n\nIf you are in agreement with this plan would you please advise as soon as possible in order that a revised design and specifications may be prepared as per the last paragraph of Mr. Mills' memorandum.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, December 27, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSURVEYS AND ENGINEERING BRANCH.\n\nRe: Brandon Indian Residential School\nBrandon, Manitoba.\n\nWe have your memorandum of December 19th and it is noted that it has been found impossible to get any contractor to undertake the work required at the present time.\n\nYour suggestion that some of the material be purchased now and placed in storage at the school is approved. However, we would appreciate it if this matter could receive immediate attention so that any funds not expended can be returned to this Branch before the end of February.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, December 28, 1946.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Man.,\n\nThe Surveys and Engineering Branch has been endeavouring to make improvements to the heating plant at the Brandon Residential School. However, they now report to us as follows:\n\n\"In discussing the situation at the Brandon Indian Residential School with the Principal, I found that he was fairly well satisfied with the present hot water situation at the School and would much prefer that no action be taken this winter with respect to this installation. It is his idea that, if work or major repairs is to be carried out next summer, that this repair work can be well delayed until that time. In view of the reluctance of these firms to proceed with this installation along the lines outlined, and the wishes of the Principal of the School, we will not take any further action with respect to the matter until we have had a further communication with you on the subject\".\n\nIn view of the above, it has been decided to defer further action until next summer.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDecember 16, 1946.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have pleasure in quoting you on our cooker equipment as follows:\n\nModel 700XB - $3,370.00\nModel 700XB HG - $4,650.00\n\nThese two Units will be found illustrated on page two of the attached booklet. The difference being merely that the Model 700XB - HG has a hot closet all the way across the back as shown in the small cut on page two, whereas the 700XB does not have the hot closet.\n\nFrom the foregoing prices may be deducted your discount of 25% and, in addition, presumably if you are exempt from Sales Tax, same also might be deducted. The actual Sales Tax deduction would be $163.39 on the 700XB - HG, and $120.56 on the 700XB.\n\nThese excellent cookers are very attractive in view of the fuel saving. The Model 700 Unit, whether with or without hot closet, is operated with two fires and the total fuel consumption for the whole unit is 16 Tons of Anthracite or equivalent per year. The cooker burns continuously 24 hours a day. The reason for this economy is simply that the heat of the coal is stored up in the heavily insulated cooker and some of it, also, is stored up in the heavy steel heat accumulator so that all the fuel is used for cooking rather than a large percentage of it being wasted through the side of the usual coal range and serving chiefly to raise the temperature of the kitchen to an uncomfortable level.\n\nIn addition the cooking qualities in so far as the ovens are concerned are stated to produce a saving in meat shrinkage of at least 10%. The reason for this is that the heat is even all around the oven, same being produced by means of the caloriduct. In ordinary coal ranges the heat is largely concentrated on one side which means continuous turning and attention. In the case Cooker, the meat is placed in the oven and one turning, at the most, is usually sufficient, the meat cooking evenly all around and without the weight lost which is usual with coal ranges.\nIn addition, the kitchen is maintained in a very clean appearing and cool condition. Under current conditions, with staff difficulties, this is often a great feature in retaining a satisfied staff.\n\nWe trust the foregoing will prove of interest and are ready to supply any other information you may require at any time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE J. H. ASHDOWN HARDWARE COMPANY LIMITED,\n\nC. M. Fleming,\nManager, ESSE COOKER DEPARTMENT.\nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa, Ontario\n\nRE: Range for Brandon School  \nFile 133-0-5 (W.T.I) Dec.10/46\n\nIn my letter 209-11AU, dated October 1, 1946, I wrote as follows:\n\n\"In view of the history of the range and its present condition I recommend a new one be provided when available. This is not an emergency but a suitable range is necessary. There are over 200 to cook for and it is impossible to do so satisfactorily with the present equipment.\n\nI trust a new range will be purchased as soon as one can be made available.\"\n\nThe range now in use is a Gurney Oxford No.13C.L.. It has three ovens with a firebox at one end. A large range is required but in view of our experience with the one in use I am not prepared to recommend the purchase of another range of the same design and make. In any event I am advised there are no large ranges of this type available in Winnipeg, and it is doubtful if there will be until some time late in 1947.\n\nAshdowns have the Esse range available for immediate shipment from their store in Winnipeg, and until December 31, are giving a 25% discount. I am enclosing their quotation together with a book of designs. This is undoubtedly an excellent range. The price is high but there is no comparison between this and the old range now in use.\n\nAgain I recommend the purchase of a new range. The Esse is available for immediate shipment and if funds are available I recommend it be purchased at once.\n\nA.G. Hamilton  \nInspector of Indian Agencies  \nfor Manitoba.\nOttawa, 30 December 1946.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg., Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nWe have your letter of the 17th instant with reference to the range for the Brandon Residential School.\n\nCareful consideration has been given to the request that we supply Esse Cooker Equipment. However, the price of this is out of line with similar equipment supplied to other residential schools and consequently we are not prepared to incur the expenditure that would be involved.\n\nWe can secure within six weeks or two months, a McClary \"Chef Junior Range\". This would be supplied with double deck high shelf. The dimensions are as follows:\n\n- Cooking Surface - 115\" x 35\"\n- Pan Tops - 30\" x 28\"\n- Height to Top - 31\u00bd\"\n- Smoke Collars - 10\"\n- Ovens - W-26\", D-27\", H-15\u00bd\"\n\nThe above range gave satisfactory service in many military camps during the war and has been supplied to other residential schools with an enrolment of approximately the same number as Brandon.\n\nWe feel it should be satisfactory for the Brandon School but before placing the order we thought it advisable to write to you. Please let me hear from you as soon as possible.\n\nThe catalogue which you forwarded is enclosed.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nThese ranges have proven very satisfactory when adapted for use with automatic stokers.\n\nWhen supplied for use with stoker range, the firebox and ashpit are completely lined with firebrick or tile; if required, the castings on the front of the firebox can be left off and the firebox covered with a blank plate. The opening for stoker connection can be made through end or front of firebox as required.\n\nRanges for use with stokers may be supplied with firebox on either left or right hand side of range.\n\nOwing to the extremely high temperatures which may be developed with some stokers, we are not able to guarantee range tops when used with these units. We are, however, able to supply a top of a special nichrome mixture which has a greater heat resistance than the standard tops. We, therefore, strongly recommend that all ranges for use with stokers be equipped with nichrome tops over the firebox.\n\n| No. 20 \"Chef Junior\" with Double Deck High Shelf |\n|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Measurements:                                  |\n| Cooking Surface:                                |\n| Pan Tops:                                      |\n| Height to Top:                                  |\n| Smoke Collars:                                  |\n| Ovens:                                         |\n| Firebox for Coal or Wood:                      |\n| SHIPPING WEIGHTS:                               |\n| Range:                                         |\n| Double Deck High Shelf:                        |\n| High Closet:                                   |\n| Waterfront:                                    |\n\n| No. 30 \"Chef Junior\" RANGE                     |\n|------------------------------------------------|\n| One fire, two ovens.                          |\n| One fire, three ovens.                        |\n| 8\u00bd\" x 35\"                                     |\n| 11\u00bd\" x 35\"                                    |\n| 30\" x 28\"                                     |\n| 36\" x 28\"                                     |\n| 31\u00bd\"                                          |\n| 31\u00bd\"                                          |\n| 8\"                                             |\n| 10\"                                            |\n| W\u201426\", D\u201427\", H\u201415\u00bd\"                         |\n| W\u201426\", D\u201427\", H\u201415\u00bd\"                         |\n| 18\" x 12\" x 10\u00bd\" deep                         |\n| 18\" x 12\" x 10\u00bd\" deep                         |\n| 1860 lbs.                                     |\n| 2400 lbs.                                     |\n| 130 lbs.                                      |\n| 190 lbs.                                      |\n| 130 lbs.                                      |\n| 190 lbs.                                      |\n| 60 lbs.                                       |\n| 60 lbs.                                       |\nThis is a well-constructed heavy duty range designed for restaurant or hotel service.

Paint for the hall on the third floor. The walls are in a disgraceful condition - the result of the lack of discipline among the boys prior to Mr. Strapp accepting the position as Principal. This wall is a reminder of the \"good old days\" and I feel it has a bad effect on the boys. Redecoration would be another step in removing the memory of a time when the \"gang spirit\" ruled.\n\n2. The dormitory floor space for the girls is crowded. I recommend twelve (12) double deck beds complete with mattresses. At present there are 100 girls in residence.\n\n3. The need for chairs has previously been reported and should be supplied without delay. These chairs are required for use in the auditorium and I understand the folding type is most suitable.\n\n4.

Glen, P.C., M.P.,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Glen,\n\nI dislike troubling you, but duty compels me to bring to your attention the condition of dwelling occupied by the Superintendent or Residential School at Brandon. This matter has been before the Department, to my knowledge, at least ten years and I feel that the time has come when action will have to be taken. The house is in such a condition that further neglect of the situation could not be considered. In saying this, I am mindful of the fact that your term as Minister has been brief and that you could not be expected to have many similar matters taken care of in a short time, especially under present conditions. I want that clearly understood.\n\nIf you could have the opportunity at any time to visit this home for yourself, you would agree that my remarks concerning it are most moderate.\n\nI cannot see that the present building in its dilapidated condition would be worth repairing. I think it would be cheaper and better in the end to have a new building.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) J.E. Matthews, M.P.\nOttawa, April 1st, 1947.\n\nDear Ewen:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of March 26th with reference to the condition of the principal's residence at the Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nIn the Supplementary Estimates for 1947-48 it is my intention to include an amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) to provide a new residence at the Brandon Residential School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.K. Matthews, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Canada.\n(This copy to be returned to Welfare & Training when letter is signed)\n\nOttawa, April 1st, 1947.\n\nDear Ewen:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of March 26th with reference to the condition of the principal's residence at the Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nIn the Supplementary Estimates for 1947-48 it is my intention to include an amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.) to provide a new residence at the Brandon Residential School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.B. Matthews, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Canada.\nMarch 27, 1947.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Water Supply - Brandon Residential School, Manitoba.\n\nReferring to your notation on copy of a memorandum from Indian Affairs dated March 11th, we have now received a report from Mr. Gow on the water situation at the above school.\n\nDuplicate copies of this report dated March 25th are attached. You will note that the difficulty experienced has been overcome by more careful organization of the available supply from the two sources. Mr. Gow, however, points out that the water supply is diminishing and suggests that investigations proceed with a view to obtaining a water supply from the City of Brandon or from the Assiniboine River when the present supply is reduced below the needs of the school.\n\nAs water resources over the southern sections of Western Canada appear to be generally decreasing, we would concur with Mr. Gow's recommendation that steps be taken to find out if water can be obtained from the City of Brandon and at what cost. If the scheme should be feasible the matter of sharing the cost with the Experimental Farm could be considered. If water cannot be obtained at suitable cost from Brandon, the Assiniboine River scheme could be investigated.\n\nEncl.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6257, file 576-5, part 8)\n532 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWINNIPEG, March 25, 1947.\n\nRe: Water Supply, Brandon Indian Residential School - Brandon, Manitoba.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 14th with reference to the above mentioned subject and asking for a report on the reported partial failure of the water supply at the school. We had not intended making any report on the matter but in view of the inquiry from the Indian Affairs Branch it has been considered advisable to report upon the inspection carried out by this office.\n\nThis office was advised of the telephone message to Mr. Hamilton regarding the water supply and later, on March 4th, the Rev. Mr. Strapp called at this office in connection with the matter. Mr. Rose, an engineer of this staff, visited the school later and made certain studies with respect to the water supply situation. He found that the lower spring, which normally supplies dormitories and farm buildings, also the basement and ground floor of the school by gravity, had early in January proved insufficient to meet the demand. An examination of the reservoir by the engineer of the school showed that it was empty and he accordingly opened the by-pass valve and allowed water from the upper spring reservoir to discharge back into the lower spring reservoir so that the gravity feed to the above mentioned services was almost immediately restored. However, this discharge was permitted to continue for an hour and forty minutes, thus depleting the upper reservoir and cutting off the gravity water supply to the two upper storeys of the school. Undoubtedly, much water was wasted through the lower reservoir during the hour and forty-minute period. To supply the upper floors the motor-driven pump had to be put into operation and the upper floors supplied through the pressure tank. However, the next day water supply had been built up in the upper reservoir and the gravity system was again in operation throughout. Since then the system has been operated without inconvenience but once weekly it is necessary to permit water to flow back into the lower reservoir from the upper reservoir for about forty minutes. It is found that this procedure does not deplete the supply in the upper reservoir but does augment the supply sufficiently in the lower reservoir to permit continuous supply for one week.\n\nAdmittedly, this is not a very dependable water supply but it has proven adequate to meet the present demand. During the past few years there have been critical periods as regard the water supply from these two widely separated springs and while normally the whole system is a gravity supply, a pumping system has to be maintained for fire protection and for such an emergency as happened recently. The equipment is available for meeting the emergency created by failure of supply from either reservoir but due to changes in personnel at the school, the procedure to be followed in such emergencies is not always understood, and some confusion results.\n\nHowever, there is no equipment available for providing a water supply in the event of failure of both springs. There used to be several springs in the vicinity of the school - there are now only the two with any flow and they appear to be producing less water and at critical times only careful operation permits of a water supply being maintained over such periods. The Dominion Experimental Farm, which adjoins the school property, have had similar experiences and\n\nT. S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering and Construction Service,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6257, file 576-5, part 8)\nnow also have to meet water shortages and dwindling supply from springs on their property. The Experimental Farm has made attempts to secure water from deep wells with indifferent success and the water has not been satisfactory. There would appear to be only two alternatives open to these two Government Enterprises to secure a dependable water supply - they can either connect up with the City of Brandon water system or construct their own pumping plant with the Assiniboine River as a source of water. Either alternatives would involve a large capital outlay but in view of the threatened failure of water supply at both sites, it would appear advisable to investigate these two alternatives.\n\n(Sgd.)

Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nIt has been decided to include in the supplementary estimates, an amount necessary to erect a new principal's residence at the Brandon Residential School. I attach blue print of the plan of the building we propose to erect and I also enclose a copy of the specifications.\n\nPlease let me know if there are any firms in the vicinity of Brandon who would be willing to quote on the erection of this building. For your personal information I may say that we estimate its cost at approximately $10,000.\n\nIf we are successful in obtaining a contractor to erect it, I presume that we will have to select a new site on the school grounds. If we demolish the present residence now, there would be no place for the principal to live until the new building is erected. The old residence can be demolished later and the material in it used for repairs to other buildings.\n\nSurveys and Engineering Branch is extremely busy this year and we are trying to assist them by obtaining definite information regarding our desired\nbuilding programme.\n\nUnder these circumstances we trust that you will give this matter your immediate attention as if we cannot make arrangements, it is extremely doubtful if the Surveys and Engineering Branch will be able to handle the matter during the coming summer.\n\nBernard F.

G. Hamilton,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nWith reference to the proposed new residence for the principal at this school, I regret very much that the proposed house is of the two full storey type. This type of house has long been considered unsuitable for this climate and is not being built by any of the contractors at present doing business in Brandon.\n\nI beg to submit a set of plans for a semi-bungalow type of residence which for this climate has a number of decided advantages in the matter of low wind resistance, good floor space, adequate lighting, and ease of heating.\n\nThis semi-bungalow type is used entirely for the larger one family residences on the Experimental Farm next door to our school farm and is highly recommended by their service bureau for the prairie climate.\n\nThese plans are VERY MUCH in the rough and would need some working over by an architect but they will give some idea of the type of building that would fit in best with the surroundings at the present site.\n\nI would strongly recommend wrecking the present building for the material that can be obtained, as there will be enough joists, scantling, and rough lumber available to almost frame and rough sheet a semi bungalow type of house. This would not only make a saving in costs of new material but would give us well seasoned lumber as well. Should Indian Affairs decide to wreck the present building at once, I can make arrangements for living quarters and storage of extra furniture during the period until the new residence is ready.\n\nI shall be glad to render any assistance possible in the matter of arranging for wrecking etc. that you may require.\n\nI remain, Yours truly,\n\nOliver B. Strapp,\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI was at Brandon May 13th in connection with the new residence being authorized for the Principal, Mr. Strapp. I consulted the following contractors:\n\nHiggins & Sons - now engaged in the Wartime Housing Program\nLissaman & Spratling\nMr. Walter Erickson, who represents the Pearson Bros., Winnipeg\n\nThe first two will consider the work on a cost plus basis but due to the shortage of finishing lumber and nails could not promise when the work might be completed.\n\nMr. Erickson stated his firm would quote either on a cost plus basis or on a complete job. He thought it might even be possible to quote on wrecking the old house and using as much of the material as possible and make the wrecking a part of the entire quotation. He claimed that at the present time he was sure his firm was in a position, should their quotation be accepted, to complete the house within a reasonable time. The old house has some valuable material in it which could be used to advantage in the new building.\n\nMr. Strapp stated he could arrange accommodation for himself and his wife by taking over one of the small cottages now rented to a party working on the experimental farm. This arrangement would make it possible to salvage the lumber from the old house and rebuild on the present site. It is desirable to do this in order to use the present water line as well as the old septic tank. It is very expensive to build at the present time due to the high cost of material and the advance in wages, however, in this particular case we have certain advantages -\n\n1. It may be possible to salvage from the old house enough dimension to put up the frame and build the partitions and in addition we should be able to obtain a large quantity of boards, which can be used for sheeting and roof purposes.\n\n2. A new furnace was installed last winter in the old residence. This, of course, is in good condition and can be used for the new house.\n\n3. Some two or three years ago we purchased shingles to repair a roof of a barn. The work was never done and now Mr. Strapp has recommended the barn be taken down. These shingles could be used for the new house.\n\n4. I think Mr. Strapp would be willing to undertake digging the basement for the new house. All this extra should make it possible to complete the house within the allowance, namely, $10,000.00.\n\n- over -\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6257, file 576-5, part 8)\nMr. Strapp has been working on a plan for a semi-bungalow and the above plan is being forwarded under separate cover. Enclosed with this letter is a copy of one received from Mr. Strapp, which is self-explanatory. I would add that I believe a semi-bungalow would look better located on the side of a hill than a high two-story house. Furthermore, some of the salvaged dimension will, no doubt, have broken ends and need to be cut into shorter lengths. This material could be used to better advantage in a smaller type of house.\n\nThe experimental farm joins the school property on the East. At present a new semi-bungalow type of house is under construction for the Superintendent, Mr. Hopper. The landscape is similar to that of the school and undoubtedly the lower house nestled among the trees on the hillside presents a striking picture. All the newer homes at the farm are of this type. The house on the school property west of the Principal's is a bungalow and a new one of similar type would, I am sure, suit the location better than a two-story house. I think Mr. Strapp's request is reasonable and should be considered. Before making a further investigation or securing prices I would be pleased to have the following information:\n\n1. If the plan submitted by Ottawa is the only one to be considered?\n2. Does the Department wish a quotation from the three firms on a cost plus basis?\n3. If the quotation is supplied on a cost plus basis - does the Department wish a quotation from Pearson Brothers on a complete job - covering the wrecking of the old house and using as much of the old material as possible? This quotation would also include plumbing, heating and painting.\n\nIf the building of this house is to be carried out this year it is necessary that a decision be made as soon as possible in connection with the type of house we can build and the contractors quoting would all like to be furnished with plans and specifications. Unless we can give a decision within a reasonable length of time the materials now on hand may be gone and I am told that the date of future deliveries is most uncertain. Further direction in connection with this matter will be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\n\nEnc.\nIndian Affairs.

I think it almost certain that those suggesting such design are not familiar with the general prospect, and I would suggest that this feature be carefully studied before deciding on any plan.\n\nThere is no doubt that a semi bungalow type would eclipse any other style in its fitting into the landscape. The whole general outlook is very fine and lends itself admirably to a building of the latter type. Since also the cost would probably be greater, it would seem regrettable to erect a building that would be completely out of conformity with the general very desirable and attractive setting.\n\nIt is better to have it done right when the cost need not be any greater, if as great, and now is the time to decide.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.)

The situation is somewhat difficult to handle due -\n\n1. To the fact that we have no specifications\n2. The old house must be demolished as we wish to build on the same site\n3. Materials from the old house should be salvaged for the new structure\n4. We have in the old house a new oil furnace - same to be used for the new house\n5. A quantity of new shingles is on hand - perhaps enough for the house\n\nNo doubt the Department would expect the work to be supervised by an engineer and in view of this I think it advisable to ask Mr. Gow of the Dominion Water & Power Bureau, Surveys and Engineering Branch, to take charge now and present to those called on to tender complete requirements and specifications both in relation to demolishing the old house and erecting the new house.\n\nI have already approached the following contractors -\n\nHiggins & Sons\nLissaman & Spratling\nMr. R. C. Shanks, Brandon\n\nMr. Walter Erickson, Brandon,\nrepresenting Pearson Bros.,\nWinnipeg\n\nThe first two listed stated they could only take the work on a cost plus basis.

He was already committed to quite a large programme of work\nb. He only had a couple of helpers\nc. He could not be sure of securing materials - He will, however, give the matter further consideration.\n\nover\nWill the Department please instruct regarding -\n\n1. If and when specifications will be available\n\n2. Does the Department approve of asking assistance from the Dominion Water & Power Bureau, Surveys and Engineering Branch?\n\nI understand Mr. Gow is now doing work at the Branch School in connection with the high pressure boiler.\n\n3.

This is due to present conditions when materials are so difficult to obtain and they have found it more satisfactory to allow their officers to decide what materials should be used, keeping in mind any materials that are locally available.\n\nReverend Mr. Strapp, principal of the Brandon School has had considerable experience in building and I suggest that Mr. Strapp and yourself confer immediately with the under mentioned firms:\n\nMr. Walter Erickson\nHiggins & Sons\nLissaman & Spratling\n\nIt might be inferred from your letter that Mr. Erickson is most interested in erecting the building and if both of you interview him he will possibly be in a position to advise you regarding the materials that are obtainable and might assist you in preparing specifications.\n\nIf at all possible, you should obtain quotations from all three firms mentioned above.\nand these quotations should include not only the erection of the new building but the demolishing of the old house on the understanding that some of the material should be salvaged for the new structure and that the oil furnace and shingles which are on hand can be used.\n\nIt should be kept in mind that the total amount available is $10,000. As soon as you have received the quotations you should submit same for our consideration.\n\nBernard F.

These plans have been prepared for buildings of standard sizes and types, but drawings to meet special needs or to suit individual requirements are not furnished by this service. Practising architects, reputable dealers or equipment manufacturers are recommended for special plans.\n\nOnly when drawing number below is marked #, are blue prints of drawings in more detail and at a larger scale available. Should you choose one of these plans (#) for your proposed building, give the sketch plan number in making application for the larger scale working drawings.\n\nWe hope you find this material helpful, and if you build from our plans, we should be very glad to hear from you when the work is completed and to have your suggestions which might assist us to improve our service.

He has promised a quotation on the complete job.\n\nAfter the specifications are completed we will try to get a price from the other two contractors. I expect it will take two or three weeks to secure all the tenders. They will, however, be forwarded as soon as received.\n\nA. G.

He points out that this should be installed as soon as possible and must be completed before the end of September at the latest.\n\nPlease advise if the new heating plant has been purchased and when delivery can be expected.\n\nA new kitchen range has arrived and has been installed. I see no reason why it should not be entirely satisfactory.\n\nA. G.

G. Hamilton:\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAfter familiarizing ourselves with the plans of the proposed Superintendent's Residence at the Experimental Farm at Brandon, Manitoba, we find that due to the fact that there is an existing house on the property which is to be demolished and all salvageable material to be used in the new house, we feel that this work should be carried out on a percentage basis as it is almost impossible to ascertain at this time, the amount of usable which there will be. That is, both the demolishing of the existing house and the erection of the new residence, which we would propose to carry out on a cost plus basis on total material and labor, at a rate of 10% plus 3% overhead. All payroll vouchers and receipted bills to be presented to the Department along with a monthly progress estimate, until the work is completed.\n\nShould your department accept this proposal of work, we wish to assure you that we will do our utmost to carry out the work as fast as time and material delivery makes it possible, and in the best workmanlike manner to your entire satisfaction.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPearson Bros. Limited.\n\nPer. [Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Matthews, Esq., M.P., that we now erect a new principal's residence at Brandon. Therefore, the sum of $10,000, for the erection of this building was included in our Supplementary Estimates for 1947-48.\n\nInspector Hamilton was requested on July 4th to contact local contractors requesting the submission of tenders. He was sent a copy of the plans from the Department of Agriculture's Architect for buildings 13-2-11, 1234, 1235, 1236 and 1237. This building was being erected for the Superintendent of the Brandon Experimental Farm and Rev. Mr. Strapp, principal of our school, requested the same type of residence.\n\nWe have now received a letter from Inspector Hamilton reading as follows:\n\n\"I requested quotations from the following\n\nHiggins & Sons Mr. Walter Erickson, Brandon,\nLissaman & Spartling representing Pearson Bros.,\nMr. R.C.

I had the opportunity of hearing the children play and I consider they made remarkable progress.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nInspector Hamilton,\nFederal Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am taking the privilege of writing to you re the Indian Residential School at Brandon, Manitoba.\n\nIn June I was privileged to be the adjudicator for the Music Recital held in the school, as prizes were awarded for the performances. I was very interested and anxious to know what response would be made to musical instruction to these Indian children. I must say, I was tremendously impressed with the results. There were some twelve pupils in the class. These children have been taking piano instruction from Mrs. McNeill, a member of the Staff. She has been doing this entirely on a voluntary basis, providing music etc., for the sake of experiment.\n\nI think Mrs. McNeill is to be commended for the work she has done, under limitations. The piano is in bad shape. It should at least be in tune, to cultivate tonal appreciation. And the periods for practice were very limited.\n\nThese pupils, with few exceptions, played a hymn with their selected pieces and I was amazed at their interpretation. What an asset to the missionary when they return to their homes. I have been wondering Mr. Hamilton and this has prompted me to write you, could it be arranged to have said instrument improved in condition or a better one put in its place? Also, could a place be given in the curriculum of the school's activities to give those children who show interest a chance to develop the art? Could their music be provided?\n\nIn time it might prove necessary to allot a teacher to this art alone.\n\nThe Junior and Intermediate pupils sang a group of two songs each. They were very good. In any school I feel this work means so much towards the development of character in students. I noticed two or three pupils with particular ability. On especially, if given a chance, I am satisfied he would go\n\n-over\na long way in the field of music. These children had only had nine months tuition. I just wish some of my own pupils could have heard them.\n\nTrusting that you will see fit to look into this subject and that Mrs. McNeill may be encouraged to continue with this valuable part of a child's education by those in charge of Indian Affairs,\n\nI am yours sincerely,\nEmma J.

The matter was discussed with the City Engineer of Brandon and the Superintendent of the Experimental Farm.\n\nSuperintendent Hopper of the Experimental Farm admitted that their water supply was somewhat precarious and that at present they had no measure whatsoever of fire protection. He appeared anxious that his department should co-operate with the Indian Affairs Branch in any arrangements that could be made for connecting up with the City of Brandon water supply. In fact, he had, a year ago, engaged in discussions with the Principal of the Brandon Indian Residential School with reference to this matter. It was his idea that the study should be hurried so that water could be made available at the earliest possible date.\n\nWhile we have secured certain plans which show the location of the Brandon pumping supply in relation to the Experimental Farm, these plans do not go beyond the Experimental Farm and so do not take in the lands of the Indian Residential School. We would request authorization from you to proceed to make certain surveys in connection with this project. These surveys would include the running of a line directly from the Brandon Pumping Station to the Experimental Farm and thence to the Indian Residential School. The survey would necessarily include more or less detailed work in connection with the buildings and the Indian Residential School inasmuch as we know of no plan at present existing for that Institution. This survey would cost in field expenses possibly $150.00 and I believe would be well worthwhile. I would, therefore, ask that you consider this matter and if it is deemed advisable to proceed to so advise us so that the work can be carried out during the month of September while we have the University Student Assistants available for the work. The survey party would only consist of two or three men for a period of possible one week.\n\nAn early reply would be greatly appreciated.\n\n(Sgd.) D. B. Gow\n\nD. B.

(RG 10, Volume 6257, file 576-5, part 10)\nSept. 5, 1947.\n\nMr. W. J. Pratt,\nMines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Pratt:\n\nAn experienced builder of Brandon drove out with me last evening to the Residential School and we went all through the present residence. Coming back he gave me his candid impressions as to what he thinks is the only course to follow. The main house is fairly large with some lean-tos added later and then a massive verandah around three sides of the building.\n\nThere is no basement, just a hole dug in the ground. As a result the place is pretty badly out of plumb and beneath the surface which Mr. and Mrs. Strapp have managed to keep respectable looking, I believe the building is in bad shape.\n\nMr. Shanks who accompanied me, says that it is out of the question now to endeavor to secure cement and to get in the basement before hard frost sets in. It will be a rather slow undertaking to take down the present building and salvage most of the material. Salvaging is necessary as Mr. Shanks says the material is in good condition. The work would have to be done by some careful workmen or it would otherwise be largely destroyed. Then again the new building could not possibly be available this fall and the Strepps would have no place for the winter.\nMr. Shanks is of the opinion that it would be advisable to have everything in readiness to begin work about the first of May in view of conditions mentioned above and others. Then there are two or three slight changes that he and Mr. Strappe would recommend in the plan, these are only slight but would probably cost less and fit into the scheme better.\n\nI am wondering whether you have in the Department an experienced builder who might be in the West and could stop over and inspect the whole project, if so I think it will be well to have Mr. Shanks along and they could on the ground decide the best course to follow.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJEM/L.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Following is a condensed summary of the proposals received from Mr. Gow:\n\n| Firm                  | Location     | Price       | Proposal                          |\n|-----------------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Relf Plumbing & Heating | Brandon, Man.| $9,000.00   | Cost plus 10%                     |\n| Neale, Stothard & Chapman | \"            | $12,753.96  | Firm tender for immediate acceptance |\n| John Plaxton & Co. Ltd. | Winnipeg, Man.| $12,200.00  | Cost plus 10%                     |\n| Randall & Co., Ltd.   | \"            | $14,657.00  | Firm tender for immediate acceptance |\n\nAfter carefully considering each tender, it is our opinion that the proposal received from Messrs. Neale, Stothard & Chapman, is the most favourable. Our own estimate for this work was $11,000.00. It is pointed out that their figure of $12,753.96 is a firm tender for immediate acceptance.\n\nThe Relf Plumbing & Heating figure is an estimate only, and on the cost plus 10% basis, this price could eventually equal or exceed the highest bid received. The same can be said of the John Plaxton & Co., Ltd., tender.\n\nIt is pointed out that Messrs. Neale, Stothard & Chapman reserve the right to invoice materials at the time of delivery, which might conceivably increase their figure. This is in line with the Dominion Government policy which states that a contractor shall not be penalized owing to price changes over which he has no control, which may occur between the time that a tender is accepted and deliveries made.\n\nWe, therefore, recommend that this work be awarded to Messrs. Neale, Stothard & Chapman, on the basis of their firm tender and that a Memorandum to Council be prepared to cover same. Mr. Gow gives us his opinion that this firm is reliable and trustworthy.\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys & Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I tried to get Mr. Strapp but was informed that he is holidaying in Ontario. His exact whereabouts is not known. Perhaps this could be found out through Dr. Dorey at Toronto. It is impossible to start the work until Mr. Strapp returns and moves his furniture out of the old house.\n\nMr. Higgins is not prepared to do anything until the contract arrives. In view of the lateness of the season and the possible delays in connection with Mr. Strapp's return and the preparation of the contract I am doubtful if it is wise to start the building this year. I explained to Mr. Higgins that our fiscal year ended 31st of March, 1948, and that the work would have to be completed by that date. He pointed out that Brandon district often experiences very cold weather and he would not be prepared to make any promises at such a late date.\n\nI would be pleased to hear from the Department at the earliest possible date and if it is the intention to proceed with the work that the contract be forwarded at once and that Mr. Strapp be notified to arrange for his furniture to be moved out of his old house.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Solomon called another boy, Walter Stonechild, and they then raised an alarm by knocking on the dormitory door.\n\nMiss Cochrane investigated the noise and immediately called Mr. Osborne, the herdsman, and instructed the barn duty boys to get dressed and proceed to the barn.\n\nI was then at the cottage, which I am using as a temporary residence, and was called by telephone. I at once notified the Brandon Fire Department and ask for their help.\n\nI proceeded to the barn, taking with me two Pyrene extinguishers and a box of glass fire bombs. On arrival at the barn I made use of the extinguishers but owing to the strong wind which was blowing from the East I was unable to bring the flames, which were located under the eave of the building, under control.\n\nI went inside the barn and inspected the milk room where a small sheet iron stove was in use to prevent the milking machine unit from freezing during the night. I found considerable smoke in the milk room but no sign of fire. The boys were now instructed to release the cattle and in a very short time had the 44 head, including a number of young calves, out of the barn and in an adjoining field.\nThe discipline of the boys was excellent, while of course somewhat excited by the fire, they responded at once to instructions and carried their duties out in a very creditable manner.\n\nThe detachment of the fire brigade arrived with their pumper unit but as we had not any water supply available they were not able to do more than attempt to give protection to the other buildings. In spite of their efforts it was not possible to save the hog barn which was in direct line of the fire and only about 25 feet due East of the dairy barn.\n\nThe Fire Marshal's representative has made an investigation, interviewing the two boys who first discovered the fire, Mr. Osborne our herdman, and myself.\n\nI am of the opinion that the fire was caused by a spark from the chimney lodging under the eave of the building and being fanned into flame by the strong East wind.\n\nI had personally made an inspection of the barns at about 8.00 P.M., and Mr. Osborne had visited the barn in the usual routine at about 8.30 P.M. The fire occurred just previous to the 10.00 P.M. inspection.\n\nI have today made a survey of the concrete foundation and walls and am of the opinion that the present foundation could be used for the erection of a new barn but the walls would need a considerable amount of re-inforcing.\n\nWe have arranged temporary accommodation for the milking cows by turning the horses out in the bluff North of the main building and stabling the cows in the horse barn.\n\nThe old West barn is almost in a state of collapse and will require a considerable amount of shoring up before it will be safe to use as a shelter for the young cattle and hogs.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In case the Contractor shall fail so to do, or fail at any time to pay to any employee or employees for any services performed or for any hours of labour wages according to the rates herein fixed in the schedule fixed hereby by the Minister of Labour, or any order regarding overtime and classification, the Minister of Labour may authorize and direct the Minister to pay any such wages at the rates so fixed and to deduct the amount thereof from any moneys owing by the Government to the Contractor. Any such payment shall be deemed to be between the Contractor and the Government be deemed and taken to be payment to the Contractor, and the Contractor shall be bound in every particular by any such authority, direction and payment as aforesaid.\n\n(3) For the protection of the workmen employed, the Contractor shall post and keep posted in a conspicuous place on the premises where the contract is being executed, occupied or frequented by the workmen, the Schedule inserted in this contract, also the preceding paragraph (2) and any decision of the Minister of Labour made thereunder.\n\n(4) The Contractor shall keep proper books and records showing the names, Books, etc., of trades, and addresses of all workmen in his employ and the wages paid to and open for time worked by such workmen, and the books or documents containing such record shall be open for inspection by the Fair Wages Officers of the Government at any time it may be expedient to the Minister of Labour to have the same inspected.\n\n(5) The Contractor shall not be entitled to payment of any money which would otherwise be payable under the terms of the contract for work or labour etc. and labour performed under the provisions of the contract unless and until he shall have filed with the Minister in support of his claim for payment a statement attested by statutory declaration, showing: (1) the rates of wages and hours of labour of the various classes of workmen employed in executing the contract; (2) whether any wages in respect of the said work and labour remain in arrear; and (3) that all the labour conditions of the contract have been duly complied with; nor in the event of notice from the Minister of Labour of claims for wages, until the same are adjusted. The Contractor shall also from time to time furnish the Minister such further information and evidence as the Minister may demand, sufficient to satisfy him that the conditions herein contained have been complied with, and that the workmen so employed as aforesaid upon the portion of the work in respect of which payment is demanded have been paid in full.\n\n(6) In the event of default in the payment of any money owing Power to pay wages in respect of any workmen employed on the said work and if a claim therefor is filed in the office of the Minister and proof thereof satisfactory to the Minister is furnished, the said Minister may pay such claim out of the moneys at any time payable to His Majesty's Receiver General for the contract and the amounts so paid shall be deemed payments to the Contractor.\n\n(7) These conditions shall extend and apply to moneys payable for the use or hire of horses or teams, and the persons entitled to payments for the use or hire of horses or teams shall have like rights in respect of moneys so owing them as if such moneys were payable for the use or hire of workmen.\n\n(8) With a view to the avoidance of any abuses which might arise from Subletting, the subletting of contracts it shall be understood that subletting, other than such as may be customary in the trades concerned, will not be permitted without the approval of the Minister; and subcontractors shall be bound in all cases to comply with the conditions of the main contract, and the main contractor shall be held responsible for strict adherence to all contract conditions on the part of subcontractor; the contract shall not, nor shall any portion thereof be transferred without the written consent of the Minister; no portion of the work to be done shall be done at the homes of the workmen.\n\n(9) All workmen employed upon the work comprehended in and to be executed pursuant to the said contract shall be residents of Canada, unless the Minister is of opinion that Canadian labour is not available or that other special circumstances exist which render it contrary to the public interest to enforce this provision.\n\nA.

I am not sure just what you can do about it. They have had to turn out their horses to make room for their milch cows in a poorly conditioned building at the best. Their young cattle, about 60 head altogether, are mostly also outside.\n\nI think if you write him, Rev. O. B. Strapp, to assure him that everything possible will be done, etc., it will ease his mind considerably. Mr. Strapp is a good man and his concern over the situation is commended.

The Contractor shall also from time to time, at the request of the Minister, deliver to him such further evidence as the Minister may deem necessary in order to satisfy him that the conditions herein contained to secure the payment of fair wages have been complied with, and that the workmen so employed as aforesaid upon the portion of the work in respect of which payment is demanded have been paid in full.\n\n(6) In the event of default by the Contractor in payment of any money owing in respect of wages of any workmen employed on the said work and if a claim therefor is filed in the office of the Minister and proof thereof satisfactory to the Minister is furnished, the said Minister may pay such claim out of the moneys at any time payable by the said Minister under said contract and the amounts so paid shall be deemed payments to the Contractor.\n\n(7) These conditions shall extend and apply to moneys payable for the use or hire of horses or teams, and the persons entitled to payments for the use or hire of horses or teams shall have like rights in respect of moneys so owing them as if such moneys were payable to them in respect of wages.\n\n(8) With a view to the avoidance of any abuses which might arise from subletting, the subletting of contracts it shall be understood that subletting, other than such as may be customary in the trade concerned, is prohibited unless the approval of the Minister is obtained; subcontractors shall be bound in all cases to conform to the conditions of the main contract, and the main contractor shall be held responsible for strict adherence to all contract conditions on the part of subcontractors.

If this is not possible, please find out the name of the official to whom I should write for the purpose of having one of their field representatives (probably the Superintendent of the Brandon Experimental Farm) visit our residential school and advise as to the best site for locating the new barn.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nPLANNING THE BARN\n\nExperimental Farms Service,\nCentral Experimental Farm,\nOttawa, Canada,\nF.W. Graves, Architect.\n\nBefore building a new barn or remodeling an old one, a careful study of barn plans should be undertaken. Visit and study existing barns in the neighborhood. Faults and mistakes may be seen in the old and avoided in the new. Good ideas may be noted and used to advantage. The farm barn is a heavy investment and troubles resulting from bad planning are very serious and lasting. In a well built and well planned barn there will be a reduction of time and labour in caring for the stock, a decrease in the loss of young animals and an increase in milk production. The animals sheltered in the barn should return a fair income on the cost of the building. High producing cows will justify a reasonably greater expenditure for shelter.\n\nSome of the more important factors to be considered in planning the barn are location, convenience of planning, type of construction, window area, cubic air space, ventilation and equipment.\n\nLOCATION - The site should be dry and well drained. Such a site will avoid much excessive dampness in the barn and feed rooms and mud in the barnyard. The barn should be located where prevailing winds will not blow from the barn towards the house, carrying odours from the stable and yard. It is preferable, if otherwise convenient, to run the building north and south so that the sides will get the morning and afternoon sun, which is an advantage in regulating stable temperatures. In planning the layout of the farm buildings, much can be done to reduce the fire risk. Where buildings are closely grouped, considerable time and labour is saved in doing chores and carrying out the routine of farm work. This gain, however, will hardly offset the risk of heavy loss from fire. In this respect it is better economy to have the buildings well separated. It is recommended that there should be a clear space of at least 150 feet between the principal farm buildings. Fire risk can be reduced also by so locating these buildings that the prevailing winds will blow across the line of the buildings.\n\nTYPE - In general purpose barns, cattle and horses are frequently kept together, but good practice calls for dairy herds to be separated at least by tight partitions from horses. There are many types of construction and shapes and styles of barn. The earlier barns in this country were built with heavy timber frames, mortised and tenoned, braced and pinned. These barns were usually roofed with a single pitch from ridge to eaves. Later the gambrel roof with two and sometimes even three slopes became popular. So-called \"Gothic\" or \"round\" roofed barns have also been built in many parts of the country. Great variations in plan and arrangement occur, with level cross drive barn floors, bank barns with the variant of cross drive and longitudinal drive floors, rectangular, L, U, or T-shaped plans, octagonal plans, and circular plans. In recent years mowless one storey cow barns with separate hay or ensilage storage have been looked upon with favour by some farmers. The latter type must have roof as well as walls insulated.\n\nIn construction, plank frame, braced rafter or laminated rafter construction have superseded almost entirely the old timber frame on account of their greater economy in the use of materials and labour. The gambrel roof seems to be the simplest and most practical shape. The \"Gothic\" type has the advantage of somewhat greater clear space in the loft, but there have been a number of failures in this type and great care must be taken in the construction of the rafters or ribs.\n\nSTALL ARRANGEMENT - The question of facing in or facing out is one for the individual farmer to decide as both have their advantages. With stock facing out, cleaning may be done from one alley, which is often arranged as a wide central drive; most of the work is done behind the stock; the mangers receive sunlight; the stock displays better and it is easier to bring the animals in one door. Advantages for stock facing in are more convenient in feeding which is done from one alley (this is a more frequent operation than milking or cleaning), the gutters get more sunlight which helps sanitation, better light for milking, two doors avoid crowding at the entrance and the ventilation system is more easily installed.\n\nCOW STALLS - These vary from 3' -0\" to 4' -0\" in width with an average of 3' -4\" or 3' -6\" and from 4' -3\" to 5' -6\" in length. It is possible to accommodate both large and small animals by varying the length of the platform from one end of the row to the other end, with adjustable steel stanchions, almost any desired length may be\nsecured. Gutters vary from 16\" to 18\" in width, with a depth of 4\" to 6\" on the alley side and 7\" to 9\" on the stall side. High and low manger fronts each have certain advantages.\n\nCONSTRUCTION - Concrete is about the only really satisfactory dairy stable floor, being durable and easily kept clean; in horse stalls, plank overlays, brick or creosoted wood paving blocks may be used. Plank floors should be removable for cleaning. Always use plenty of good bedding. Mangers and gutters should have a fall of 1\" in 25' -0\" up to a length of 50' -0\". In longer barns, they should pitch from the ends towards the centre. They should have drains with plugs so that they may be properly flushed.\n\nWalls may be of stone, tile, concrete or frame. An air space should be provided in masonry walls. The concrete wall may be carried up one foot only, up to the window sills or up to the loft floor, with frame above. Where the wood frame starts one foot above the floor, a warm, well insulated wall can be provided without great expense. For framing the gambrel roof either the braced rafter or the plank frame may be used. In the braced rafter, which is suitable for widths up to 36' -0\", where the loft side walls are not more than 10' -0\", each upper rafter is braced to each lower rafter and each lower rafter to the wall studding. The plank frame consists of trusses spaced at 10' -0\" to 14' -0\" on centres, with purlins running the length of the barn. The quantity of lumber in the two types is approximately the same. The braced rafter does not require any pieces over 14' -0\" in length, in the 34' width or over 16' -0\" in the 36' width. It is therefore sometimes more economical and is almost equally as strong.\n\nLIGHT - Ample window space should be provided. Regulations vary a great deal in this respect, but the average requirement is 4 square feet of glass per cow. Windows should be higher than their width as more floor area receives sunlight in this way. A suitable window consists of two sashes (each 6 light 10\" x 12\") the lower being fixed and the upper hinged to the lower to drop inwards on checks or a chain; a twelve light window of the type provides 10 square feet of glass. For box stalls, a six light sash is usually satisfactory and light may be provided for these on a basis of 1 sq. ft. of glass to 20 or 25 sq. ft. of floor area. Storm sash will add considerably to the comfort of the barn in winter.\n\nVENTILATION - Animals in a poorly ventilated barn require more feed to maintain body weight and condition and to keep up production than those in proper surroundings. Without proper circulation, the air, warmed by the animals rises and condenses on windows, walls and ceilings causing a damp barn. From 500 to 700 cu. ft. of air should be allowed per cow, which means that the ceiling shall be about 5' -0\", and the floor 8' -0\" high. If the barn is well lighted, the number of square inches of glass per sq. ft. of floor area is less, the ceilings may be reduced in height. In the average Canadian climate, insulation of the walls as well as the ceiling of the stable is advisable. The hay in the loft of the ordinary farm barn provides perfect insulation of the ceiling. In a one storey barn, some other form of insulation must be installed to take its place.\n\nInlets should be well distributed over the building. Each one should not be more than 50 to 100 square inches in area. They should always be provided with control dampers. The outlet must be tightly built, say of two ply matched lumber with paper between, and must also be equipped with a damper. These may vary in size; 20\" to 26\" square is usual in the Rutherford system, and often much larger in the single out-take modified King system. A table is given on the drawing indicating approximate flue sizes required.\n\nEQUIPMENT - High costs of farm labour may sometimes warrant the installation of equipment that will save additional help and thus reduce expense. All equipment such as litter and feed carriers, milking machines, etc., should be carefully planned before the barn is built in order to avoid unnecessary cutting and fitting to install this equipment later.\n\nRULES AND REGULATIONS - In most provinces of Canada there are Health By-laws governing certain requirements for Stable buildings. Inquiries should be made direct to the Board of Health or other local authority as to the regulations in force in the particular province, or in the milk district to which milk may be shipped. These regulations cover such matters as distances from barn to piggery, to manure shed, to milk house; window area for light, cubic content of stable or air space per cow, ventilation, etc.\n\n500 -- January 1944 (Revised).\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Brandon School Barn\n\nI have your letter of December 2nd, file No. 133-0-5 (WT), and have discussed its contents with Mr. Strapp.\n\nI consider there is little to add to the suggestions in sections A, B, C, D, and E of your letter. However, the question of location has been overlooked. Mr. Strapp claims he wants a bank barn and the suggested location, in my opinion, is too near the present horse barn. I think we should insist that it be erected at least 150 feet from all other buildings.\n\nI enclose for your information a plan of the grounds. The location suggested to me by Mr. Strapp is marked in red. If Mr. Strapp insists on a bank barn I would suggest an Engineer visit the school and decide on a suitable location for such a building. I might add, regardless of what type of barn is used, I think the location should be carefully considered by someone familiar with the planning and arranging of Government institutions.\n\nI enclose copies of a plan together with a circular (on planning the barn). A similar set was given to Mr. Strapp, not with the idea that it be used but only to serve as a guide. Mr. Higgins will continue the work when the plans and specifications are ready.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\n\nEnc.\nR. M. Hopper\nSup.

Mr. Strapp states he wants stall accommodation for 52 head. In addition box stalls will be required for calves and for cows about to freshen and a bull pen will also be required.\n\nA barn large enough to stable the above stock would have storage loft for at least 120 tons of hay, which amount, along with other feed, would last through the cold winter months.\n\nI would suggest that no definite plan be accepted until Mr. Strapp presents his plan, which he believes represents the requirements for a school the size of Brandon. On receipt of his plan it will then be possible to determine the cost. If then, the cost is considered too great perhaps the size of the barn could be reduced in a manner which later will lend itself to a suitable addition.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. G.

Gow, dated February 2, 1946, in connection with the vertical high pressure boiler which was rented last July for temporary use at the above.\n\nReviewing the circumstances which made this action necessary, you are advised that Principal O.B. Strapp of Brandon, Manitoba, wired the Indian Affairs Branch on June 14th to the effect that the existing vertical high pressure boiler used for laundry services had collapsed and was beyond repair. This was not unexpected as our Mr. Hargreaves, following an inspection of the boiler room equipment in June 1946, reported in a memorandum to Mr. Wardle dated June 20, 1946, that this Division would take no responsibility for the continued operation of the unit under the existing circumstances.\n\nA memorandum dated June 14th was received from the Indian Affairs Branch, requesting this Division to take immediate action with regard to renting a high pressure boiler for use in the school until the plant revisions were carried out.\n\nOn the same date a telegram was despatched to Mr. D.B. Gow, requesting him to rent a vertical high pressure boiler for an estimated several months duration. It should be brought to your attention that this unit will not be needed when the plant revisions are completed as the new work includes for a different type of high pressure boiler, one having capacity to serve not only the laundry but also the large domestic hot water demand.\n\nAfter some difficulty, Mr. Gow located and rented a 10 horsepower vertical high pressure boiler, at a rental charge of $25.00 per month plus carriage from Winnipeg to Brandon in the amount of $15.00. These accounts he was asked to certify and pass on to the Indian Affairs Branch for payment.\n\nDue to circumstances beyond our control, the revisions to the boiler room equipment have been delayed beyond our expectation, extending the continued use of the rented boiler; and to date no rental invoices have been received by this Division.\n\nMr. Gow suggests in his letter referred to above, that the Department give consideration to purchasing this boiler outright for possible future use elsewhere. In this aim, he contacted the owners J. Hayes and Sons, of Winnipeg, and they have agreed to abandon the rental account and to sell the boiler to the Department for a price of $225.00 plus interest at the rate of 6% calculated from July 1st to the date of payment. This total charge will amount to approximately $235.00.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nIt can be assumed that this boiler will be needed at Brandon, Manitoba, for another three months, which added to the seven months already passed since this installation will make a total rental charge of $250.00. Should the boiler be returned to its owners an additional dismantling and cartage charge will be incurred which would amount to approximately $50.00. Added to the rental charges for approximately ten months, the total would be $300.00.\n\nIt is felt advisable under the circumstances to recommend to Indian Affairs Branch the purchase of this unit, which is reported to be in good condition, for possible use elsewhere at a later date. It is felt likely that storage space could be found either at the Brandon or Portage la Prairie Indian Residential Schools.\n\nSince Mr. Gow has asked for an early decision in connection with this purchase, we would appreciate receiving your instructions so that he may be advised as to what action he should take.\n\nChief Engineer.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: New barn, Indian Residential School, Brandon.\n\nMr. Strapp called the other day, and stated he had consulted Mr. Hopper, in connection with the location for the new barn. He stated he was still working on the plans, which he hoped to have ready shortly. As soon as they are completed, he will forward them for the Department's approval.\n\nAttached is a copy of the letter just received from Mr. Hopper, Superintendent of the Experimental Farm, Brandon. You will note his remarks in connection with the location of the new barn.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\n\nEnc.\nMr. A. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr. Hamilton:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 14th ultimo in which you advise regarding the plans at the Indian Residential School for the erection of a barn to replace the one destroyed by fire.\n\nI have been in conversation on different occasions with Mr. Strapp regarding his plans and during the past week had an opportunity of examining the sketches he has developed. Mr. Strapp has developed a plan for a practical type of structure and one that should not be excessively costly to erect. Mr. Strapp's plan is to erect this barn north of the old site and this, I believe, is advisable. The hillside will provide a much better building site than the low land where the old barn was situated. I shall be glad to give Mr. Strapp any help I can with his building programme.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(signed) R. M.

A new motor, if available, would cost approximately $28.50\n\nWe will be pleased to follow your instructions regarding the above unit.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nS. H. BROWN LIMITED,\n\nH. P.

Visits were paid to\na number of large dairy barns in the vicinity of Brandon and\nWinnipeg. A study was made of barn dimensions, placement of\ndoors, windows, stalls, feed alleys, etc., and special attention was\npaid to ventilating systems.\n\nA rough draft plan was made and, upon the advice of Mr. R.M. Hopper,\nSupt. of the Experimental Farm, Brandon, was submitted to the\nArchitect, Dominion Experimental Farms, Ottawa, for suggestions\nand criticism.\n\nSuggestions made by Mr. Graves, Ottawa, were incorporated, as\nalso was the ventilating system recommended by Prof. Shanks of\nthe Department of Agriculture, University of Manitoba.\n\nThe idea of constructing an all metal barn similar to those\nat Muncey, Ontario, could not be entertained owing to the fact\nthat steel is in such short supply. I am assured that lumber\nwill be available.\n\nI contacted Beatty Bros. Ltd., and they have assured me that\nstanchions, pen fittings, water bowls, etc., will be made available\non order for early Spring.\nSeveral contractors in Brandon would be willing to submit a bid for the erection of the barn. Mr. E.C. Higgen's, who is at present engaged in the erection of the new residence would be willing to undertake the work upon terms similar to his present contract.\n\nIf I can be of further service in this matter I shall be only too willing to co-operate with your Branch.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nCopy to; Mr. A.G.

G. Higgens, Brandon, Manitoba. This Progress Payment is in connection with the erection of the principal's residence at Brandon Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nSuperintendent.\n\nEnc.\nIn accordance with the instructions outlined in your letter of April 15 last, Your File I.A. 1480-4, we made surveys and prepared plans, with estimates covering a scheme to connect the City of Brandon water supply with the Brandon Indian Residential School and the Dominion Experimental Farm which adjoins the Indian School property.\n\nYour correspondence file will reveal that for many years now the water supply at the Brandon Indian School has been at times insufficient to meet the demand and that the situation appears to be becoming more critical from year to year. The water supply is taken from two springs that appear to be failing and no further surface springs now remain. The Dominion Experimental Farm, which lies immediately to the east of the school farm, obtain their water supply from springs and shallow wells and according to the Superintendent of the Farm, they are experiencing the same difficulty from dwindling water supply as is experienced by the school. Neither the school nor the farm buildings have any surplus water in order to provide against fire and at both institutions there are large capital outlays invested in buildings. Insofar as this office is aware, no deep wells have been drilled in the area of the Experimental Farm or the school in order to explore the possibility of securing an adequate water supply from wells.\n\nWe are enclosing a memorandum prepared by Mr. W. H. Wallace of this staff, which together with enclosures, outlines the proposed connection from the City of Brandon water system to the Brandon Indian Residential School and the Dominion Experimental Farm. This memorandum outlines the main water features of the proposed scheme for water supply and fire protection, together with the estimated costs of the same. The memorandum does not go into details with respect to the connection between the mains and the individual connections to residences and buildings, nor does it cover the cost of the same. The City of Brandon has not been approached with a view to ascertaining the rates that would be charged for water supplied since special consideration would have to be given by the City Council to any such proposal as is outlined.\n\nYou will note that the estimated costs of the proposed mains, together with hydrants, are only slightly under $50,000. I might point out that the large barn at the Indian School at Brandon was destroyed by fire early in the winter and will have to be replaced by a new structure this coming year. I am advised by the Principal of the School that had there been available any water supply for fire protection purposes, this fire could have readily been put out soon after it was noticed. New residences are being completed at both the farm and at the school and the matter of fire protection for both institutions is most important and accordingly the proposed scheme should be given serious consideration.\n\nT. S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering & Construction Service,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nWe are enclosing two extra copies of the memorandum by Mr. Wallace, together with the accompanying plans and would ask that you submit one copy of the same to the Director of the Experimental Farm Service at Ottawa so that the seriousness of this matter can be brought to their attention. I might point out that we are also supplying a copy of the memorandum and plans to the Superintendent of the Dominion Experimental Farm at Brandon.\n\nWith respect to the estimates of cost covering material and labour, Mr. Wallace has prepared detailed estimates and these can be made available if it is so desired. However, they do not accompany his memorandum.\n\nIn view of the heavy capital outlay involved in the proposed connection to the Brandon water supply, I believe it will be advisable to explore the possibilities of securing an adequate water supply from a deep well. We will make inquiries through the services of the Provincial Government at Winnipeg as to any information they may have with respect to well drilling at Brandon and also make inquiries locally at Brandon as regards deep well drilling. If such inquiries are encouraging, we may submit further suggestions with respect to the drilling of a test well early this spring in the vicinity of the school and farm.\n\n(Sgd) D. B.

Gow\n\nRe: Proposed Water Supply from Brandon City\nPumping Mains to the Brandon Indian Residential School and to the Dominion Experimental Farm, Brandon, Manitoba.\n\nWATER REQUIREMENTS:\n\nIn giving consideration to the proposed size of water mains from the Brandon pumping station to the Indian Residential School and to the Experimental Farm at Brandon, the governing feature is the necessity of providing a sufficient volume of water to give adequate fire protection, which in this case is greatly in excess of normal domestic requirements.\n\nSOURCE OF SUPPLY:\n\nBrandon city water supply is obtained from the Assiniboine River and the water is filtered and treated for domestic consumption. The pumping plant has a capacity of 9,000,000 g.p.d., and at 95 to 100 lbs. pressure, the Brandon city consumption is estimated at about 1,600,000 g.p.d.\n\nPIPE LINE:\n\nThe proposed water supply line would be taken from the Brandon City 12\" main in the vicinity of the pumping plant. As shown on the general plan, an 8\" pipe (Type T.150 Universal G.I.) would be laid for 6,600 feet to a point in the vicinity of the boundary between the property of the Indian School and the Experimental Farm. This pipe would traverse about 1,200 feet of land, probably owned by the City of Brandon, to a point at the Assiniboine River, crossing under said river and continuing through property owned by the Dominion Experimental Farm, Brandon. From the end of the 8\" pipe line, two 6\" pipe lines (Universal G.I. Type T.150) would be taken off to serve the school (2,020 feet) and the Experimental Farm (2,620 feet), respectively.\n\nFIRE PROTECTION:\n\nBased on Hazen-Williams formula with C_w = 120 for cast iron pipes, the following pressures may be expected at the different hydrant locations for different flows:\n\n| Flow (g.p.m.) | Pressure at Hydrant |\n|---------------|---------------------|\n|               | No. 1 | No. 2 | No. 3 | No. 4 | No. 5 |\n| 250           | 74    | 66    | 63    | 62    | 75    |\n| 500           | 58    | 46    | 41    | 39    | 50    |\n| 650           | 3     |       |       |       |       |\n| 750           | 3     |       |       |       |       |\n\nD.

With the use of booster pumps on fire engines of 750 gal. capacity and hydrant pressure of about 20 lbs., a maximum of 3 fire streams of over 200 g.p.m. could be obtained. This is considered adequate fire protection but if it should be desirable to increase the number of g.p.m. available at the school hydrants to 800 to 22 lbs. pressure to supply 4 fire streams, this could be obtained by substituting an 8\" pipe the total distance to the school hydrants. The cost for this would be about $1200, more than the estimate submitted.\n\nDOMESTIC SUPPLY:\n\nBrandon Indian School - accommodating about 230 persons, including staff, and with about 120 head of cattle, would be the main consumer for domestic requirements. Allowing 30 g.p.d. per person and per head of cattle would require about 12,000 g.p.d.\n\nBrandon Experimental Farm - requirements not known. However, the total amount used would be very small compared with the amount proposed to be made available for fire protection.\n\nIn the following estimates, connections to domestic services are not included. Residences, barns, etc., on the Brandon School property, are all close to the proposed new 6\" pipe line and cost of connecting would be relatively small. In the case of the Dominion Experimental Farm Station, the amount of service required, also the condition of existing pipe lines are unknown.\n\nESTIMATE OF COSTS (Based on current prices).\n\nMaterial - pipe, hydrants, fittings, etc., ........ $28,893.74 (\u00a7)\n\nLabour - (Trenching, connecting pipe and fittings),\n          (Backfilling, etc., 11,640 @ $1.25 per ft.) $14,300.00 (\u00a7)\n\nContingencies - 10% ...................... $4,319.32\n\nTOTAL: $47,513.11.\n\n(\u00a7) Detailed estimates available.\n\nThe following plans accompany this memorandum:\n\n1.

With the use of booster pumps on fire engines of 750 gal. capacity and hydrant pressure of about 20 lbs., a maximum of 3 fire streams of over 200 g.p.m. could be obtained. This is considered adequate fire protection but if it should be desirable to increase the number of g.p.m. available at the school hydrants to 800 at 22 lbs. pressure to supply 4 fire streams, this could be obtained by substituting an 8\" pipe the total distance to the school hydrants. The cost for this would be about $1200, more than the estimate submitted.\n\nDOMESTIC SUPPLY:\n\nBrandon Indian School - accommodating about 230 persons, including staff, and with about 120 head of cattle, would be the main consumer for domestic requirements. Allowing 30 g.p.d. per person and per head of cattle would require about 12,000 g.p.d.\n\nBrandon Experimental Farm - requirements not known. However, the total amount used would be very small compared with the amount proposed to be made available for fire protection.\n\nIn the following estimates, connections to domestic services are not included. Residences, barns, etc., on the Brandon School property, are all close to the proposed new 6\" pipe line and cost of connecting would be relatively small.

The water supply is taken from two springs that appear to be failing and no further surface springs now remain. The Dominion Experimental Farm, which lies immediately to the east of the school farm, obtain their water supply from springs and shallow wells and according to the Superintendent of the Farm, they are experiencing the same difficulty from a dwindling water supply as is experienced by the school. Neither the school nor the farm buildings have any surplus water in order to provide against fire and at both institutions there are large capital outlays invested in buildings. Insofar as this office is aware, no deep wells have been drilled in the area of the Experimental Farm or the school in order to explore the possibility of securing an adequate water supply from wells.\n\nWe are enclosing a memorandum prepared by Mr. W. H. Wallace of this staff, which together with enclosures, outlines the proposed connection from the City of Brandon water system to the Brandon Indian Residential School and the Dominion Experimental Farm. This memorandum outlines the main essential features of the proposed scheme of water supply and fire protection, together with the estimated costs of the same. The memorandum does not go into details with respect to the connection between the mains and the individual connections to residences and buildings, nor does it cover the cost of the same. The City of Brandon has not been approached with a view to ascertaining the rates that would be charged for water supplied since special consideration would have to be given by the City Council to any such proposal as is outlined.\n\nYou will note that the estimated costs of the proposed mains, together with Hydrants, are only slightly under $50,000. I might point out that the large barn at the Indian School at Brandon was destroyed by fire early in the winter and will have to be replaced by a new structure this coming year. I am advised by the Principal of the School that had there been available any water supply for fire protection purposes, this fire could have readily been put out much earlier it was noticed. New residences are being completed at both the farm and at the school and the matter of fire protection for both institutions is most important and accordingly the proposed scheme should be given serious consideration.\n\nT. S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering & Construction Service,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nWe are enclosing two extra copies of the memorandum by Mr. Wallace, together with the accompanying plans and would ask that you submit one copy of the same to the Director of the Experimental Farm Service at Ottawa so that the shortcomings of this matter can be brought to their attention. I might point out that we are also supplying a copy of the memorandum and plans to the Superintendent of the Dominion Experimental Farm at Brandon.\n\nWith respect to the estimates of cost covering material and labour, Mr. Wallace has prepared detailed estimates and these can be made available if it is so desired. However, they do not accompany his memorandum.\n\nIn view of the heavy capital outlay involved in the proposed connection to the Brandon water supply, I believe it will be advisable to explore the possibilities of securing an adequate water supply from a deep well. We will make inquiries through the services of the Provincial Government at Winnipeg as to any information they may have with respect to well drilling at Brandon and also make inquiries locally at Brandon as regards deep well drilling. If such inquiries are encouraging, we may submit further suggestions with respect to the drilling of a test well early this spring in the vicinity of the school and farm.\n\n(Sgd) D. B. Gow.\nDistrict Chief Engineer\n\nenclos.\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Water Supply - Brandon Indian Residential School, Manitoba.\n\nReferring to a memorandum from Indian Affairs, dated April 9, 1947, we have now received a report from Mr. W.H. Wallace, dated March 11, 1948, with covering letter from Mr. Gow, dated March 18, 1948. Triplicate copies of the report, with plans and covering letter, are attached herewith.\n\nFrom the figures given in the report it can be inferred that the capacity of the present Brandon pumping plant is in excess of present consumption, but we do not yet know whether the filtration plant has the same excess capacity. However, one would not anticipate that the city would object to supplying the small amount of domestic water needed for the Brandon Residential School and for the Experimental Farm on the basis of lack of capacity of the plant. Fire requirements might be a different matter.\n\nYou will note that the cost of the proposal to supply both institutions (School and Farm) from one system connected to the Brandon supply is estimated at approximately $50,000.00. This figure might not cover the cost of distribution lines to individual buildings and the cost of securing right of way.\n\nMr. Gow intends to explore the possibilities of securing water for the School from a deep well and this general information is necessary and will be useful in coming to a final decision.\n\nSecuring water from the City of Brandon has many advantages, and if the cost can be shared with the Experimental Farm Service the scheme might be attractive to both the Indian Affairs Branch and the Experimental Farm Service of the Department of Agriculture.\n\nThe cost might be reduced by the elimination of fire protection and the use of smaller pipe which would save money on materials, but other installation costs would not be reduced to any great extent. Owing to the high elevation of the School a step would be needed to give efficient fire service after the pipes have deteriorated in capacity some years after installation. The figures on fire pressures in the report seem to be a trifle optimistic and based on the capacity of fairly new pipes.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands & Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nEncs.\nThis joint proposal is worthy of serious consideration, and we are enclosing a third copy of the report so that it will be available to you if you decide to forward it to the Director of Experimental Farm Service in Ottawa. We should like to know if the Indian Affairs Branch require further information.\n\nT.S.

Reference your marginal notation dated June 17th, Memorandum of June 16th, 1948, from Mr. Hoey,\n\nWe are in receipt of a report of an inspection made by Mr. O.J. Storsater of Mr. Gow's staff on June 11th, in which it is stated that the foundation walls have badly settled and cracked and basement floor has heaved.\n\nWe sent a Day Letter to Mr. Gow requesting further information and whether the situation had further deteriorated in the meantime.\n\nIn a letter dated June 26th, Mr. Gow states he has interviewed Mr. R.W. Davis, Regional Supervisor of Indian Affairs, Winnipeg. Mr. Davis reports that the deterioration in the building is increasing and that not the roof has pulled away from the walls and that there is additional breakage in the foundation walls. Mr. Gow continues as follows:\n\n\"Consideration will have to be given to the question as to whether or not the present site should be abandoned in favour of an adjoining site. Apparently the present site has encountered considerable underground drainage and unfortunately the proper precautions were not taken to provide adequate drainage to care for this situation. To overcome this lack of drainage now and to correct the footings and foundations and to repair damage to the building itself might be more expensive than to select a new site, provide new footings and foundations and move the existing structure to the same.\n\nThe writer plans to pay a visit to Brandon early next week in order to see personally how serious the existing situation really is.\"\n\nUpon receiving the report of Mr. Gow's personal inspection of conditions at the residence, we will advise what steps to remedy the situation we are prepared to recommend.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nJuly 2, 1948.\n\nMr. Hoey,\n\nIt seems to me that the type of inspection that is required in this case could be made by the Donald Inspection Company. What do you think? I am going to try to get some information from the Geological Survey that may be useful in locating a water supply.\n\nDirector.\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDeptmt. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nJuly 6, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI have your letter of the above noted date and file number.\n\nI note that memorandum differentiates between 'Fire protection' and 'Domestic supply'.\n\nRe Fire Protection; Throughout this section of the country large 'Dug Outs' have been excavated during the last few years and these maintain a reasonably high level of water. An excavation approximately 40' X 20' X 15' in depth would hold an average of 30,000 to 40,000 gallons of water even during dry seasons. One of these dug outs located reasonable close to the barns would provide sufficient water for the Brandon City pumper in the event of a fire occurring. A small pumping unit housed near the barns could be used by the staff of the school until the arrival of the large unit. The whole installation would not be very costly and the upkeep would be light.\n\nRe Domestic Supply; I am still of the opinion that if the present 'High' and 'Low' springs were properly exploited it would be possible to obtain a sufficient supply for our domestic use. The wooden dam constructed just below the 'High' spring has opened in a number of places and should be replaced with interlocking steel plates driven into the ground. The wooden box which is located at the spring should be replaced with a concrete tank with weeping tile running into it. The present storage tank...\nshould be augmented by the addition of another tank of similar dimensions.\n\nIf the above noted suggestions were carried out, a large quantity of water that is now being lost would be conserved.\n\nAnother item to be kept in mind is the additional grant which would be required to pay for the water which it is proposed to buy from the City of Brandon. I believe that the Residential school at Portage La Prairie is paying approximately $60.00 a month for their domestic supply from the city. This school would probably be taxed $100.00 per month and that amount could not be paid out of the per capita grant at the present rate.\n\nI expect to be in Ottawa on Friday of this week and will be glad to discuss the matter further with you then.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, July 20, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS & DEVELOPMENT SERVICES\n\nRe: Principal's Residence - Brandon, Manitoba.\n\nWe have your memorandum of July 2nd with reference to the above.

We pointed out to him that we had not approached either the city of Brandon or the Department of Agriculture. We also directed his attention to the fact that arrangements were completed with the City of Brandon and the expenditure involved is estimated at approximately $50,000.00 and that funds to this amount are not available in the current year's appropriation. In reply to that letter, the principal has written us as follows:\n\n\"I have your letter of June 25th, 1948, file 133-0-5.\n\n\"I note that memorandum differentiates between 'Fire Protection' and 'Domestic Supply'.\n\n\"Re Fire Protection.

Original on file 77-133.\n\nBrandon Indian Residential School - Mr. Strapp, the Principal, appears to be running a very good school. His buildings and grounds were in fair condition. However, his attitude is that the Department should do all the repairs, and very little repair is done by any of the school staff.\n\nThe basement and ground floor are badly in need of re-decorating. In the boy's playroom the wainscoting is in very bad shape, and urgently in need of repairs. It is all broken and in terrible condition. I would recommend that this be repaired before the school opens, also some decorating be done on the floors mentioned.\n\nThe contractor is busy putting in the new boiler, and this work should be completed before the school opens. I would strongly recommend that the school be forced to hire an engineer with at least 3rd class papers to look after the heating equipment after it has been repaired, and a new boiler put in. In the past they have had a low pressure boiler and the new one is high pressure. Without proper care it will not last as long as it should.\n\nThe cattle barn, which burned last fall, should be replaced before the school opens, as the cattle barn where they are keeping the cows at present is very unsuitable for this purpose, and very unsanitary. I cannot find anything on file regarding this fire or barn, and request that you give me any information you have on hand. Also, if it is the intention of the Department to replace it this year.\n\nThis school, like most Protestant schools, has locked doors, and takes on the appearance more of a jail than a school. If the Department insisted that this practice was discontinued, I think we would find that the children would take better care of the Department property and buildings. At present they feel that they are not trusted, and it makes them more or less hostile and they do not appreciate what is being done for them.\n### Certificate of Contractor\n\n1.

Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nRe new dwelling Brandon Residential School\n\nI am not sure to whom I should write in regard to this matter. As you are aware difficulty was encountered because of a spring that was located near the basement of above building. It has already done considerable damage, I may say that it will serve no purpose trying to ascertain who is to blame. The plain fact is no one is to blame. It is just one of those things that happen, and that could not have been foreseen by anyone.\n\nI know of no contractor anywhere more reliable than Mr. Higgen. I have known Mr. Higgen Sr. very closely for thirty-seven years and I have personal knowledge and experience of his reliability. The same is true of his sons. I submit that the only practical and the most economical step is to authorize Mr. Higgen to complete the work at once in accord with his best judgment. I have no hesitation in saying that he will give the matter the same care as if it were his own residence.\n\nDamage has already resulted from the delay. This damage will have to be repaired. The longer the delay the greater will be both the damage and cost. For this reason no private owner would even consider so long a delay as has already transpired.\nI am writing this letter less in a critical vein than in a desire to assist. Will you please forward it to the party directly clothed with the responsibility.\n\nThanking you,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJEM/L.\n\nP.S. I should make reference here to the loss by fire last winter of a large barn. I am not aware that any real steps have yet been taken toward the erection of a new barn. The cold weather in Manitoba will soon be upon us.\n\nKindest personal regards\nSeptember 2nd, 1948.\n\nJ.E. Matthews, Esq., M.P.,\nBrandon, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr. Matthews:\n\nI have just received your letter of August 26th, with reference to the principal's residence at the Brandon Residential School.\n\nThe Lands and Development Services Branch advised us early in July that the situation that had arisen in connection with the construction of this building was being carefully considered by their official in Winnipeg. We were under the impression that this official had made a recommendation and that the work was proceeding.\n\nIn view of the contents of your letter we are taking up the matter with them today, requesting them to give immediate attention to it.

Later, Mr. Gow had interviews with Mr. R.W. Davis, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies and Mr. Strapp, the Principal of the School, under whose supervision the work was supposedly carried out.\n\nIt is reported that no work has been done on the building since May last further than plastering, and as settlement of the foundations is reported to be progressing, it is unlikely that this building can be rehabilitated without the expenditure of a considerable sum of money.\n\nMr. Gow wrote on June 26th that he proposed to visit the site personally and report. We so advised you but this report has not materialized. The only communication received from Mr. Gow since that date has been a letter dated August 19th enclosing six photographs of the structure and stating that his office has not taken any action in connection with this residence.\n\nOn the information available we are not in a position to make a definite recommendation. We would suggest, however, three alternatives for the Indian Affairs Branch to consider:\n\nFirst - Select a new site and build new concrete foundations upon which the frame portion of the structure could be erected.\n\nG.E.B.

The obvious difficulty here is that no information as to the depth of firm ground is available without excavations on the site.\n\nThird - Excavate and place adequate sized open joint tile along the northwest and west walls of the building. By this means the water seepage causing the trouble should be intercepted and the soil on which the footings bear be stabilized.\n\nThe third alternative seems the least costly and might be accomplished before winter sets in.\n\nAs previously stated, we can do little more than make the foregoing suggestions for the consideration of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nUpon receiving instructions on any of the foregoing methods or retrieving the situation we shall immediately contact Mr. Gow for an investigation of the possibilities of the suggested undertaking and prepare a report with estimate of cost.\n\nMethods two and three would also require filling of cracks in foundation wall, making good settlement between footings and walls and applying membrane waterproofing to the exterior face of the foundation walls.\n\nChief Engineer.\nAIR MAIL\n\nSeptember 16, 1948.\n\nRev.

I feel satisfied that under Mr. Gow's direction, the work will be done at as reasonable a cost as possible.\n\nIt is noted in the last paragraph of your letter that by adopting method three, the cracks in the foundation wall will be filled in and that a membrane waterproofing will be applied to the exterior face of the foundation walls.\n\nActing Director.\n\nPP/MGD\nIn accordance with your marginal note dated September 18th on a memorandum from the Indian Affairs Branch of September 16th, we have prepared a set of instructions for work to be undertaken for the purpose of correcting the settlement of the foundations of the above building and repairs consequent to such settlement.\n\nThe instructions have been sent to Mr. Gow and he has been requested to instruct the Contractor to proceed immediately with the work and under the direct supervision of his office.\n\nIt is understood that the Contractor's accounts for the cost of this work shall be certified by Mr. Gow and sent direct to the Indian Affairs Branch for payment.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n\nR.A.

Storsater, follows his recent inspection to the above mentioned institution and to report on the suggestions outlined in your letter of July 22nd last in connection with the water supply at the above school. Mr. Storsater's inspection was made at the time he visited the school in connection with work on the Principal's residence.\n\nFollowing Mr. Gow's last visit to the school, on September 29, he advised that a cost estimate be made and that you should be requested to authorize expenditure of the necessary funds as the work will be of an emergency nature.\n\nExceptional low precipitation has held over Manitoba during the month of September and also into October which has quickly reversed the more favourable moisture and ground water conditions that had prevailed. For this reason it seems necessary to have the spring collection system improved this fall and the work should be done if possible while Mr. Storsater is at Brandon engaged at the school on the residence drainage and the building repair work and before severe weather sets in.\"\n\nDuplicate copies of the report by Mr. Storsater are attached herewith. You will note the cost to increase the supply of water at the upper spring is estimated at about $400.00.\n\nWould you kindly arrange to transfer $400.00 to this Division so that work recommended may be undertaken during the remaining suitable weather this Fall and while Mr. Storsater is engaged in other projects at the school.

Gow\n\nRe:- Brandon Indian Residential School,\nDomestic Water Supply\n\nThe domestic water supply from the \"high spring\" was examined on the occasion of a visit to the school on October 8 last.\n\nA pipe line, as shown on a plan of work performed in 1941, connects the wooden well structure at the main spring and the double concrete cistern at the dam. The water level in the upper well is 9.3 feet above the inlet to the concrete cistern 180' away, yet the yield to the cistern was estimated at one gallon per minute on the date of the visit. It is believed that this pipe line should be repaired and put back in operation as soon as possible to assist in maintaining all available yield from the spring for the coming winter. There is a possibility that a critically low water supply may be experienced due to dry conditions and lack of precipitation this fall.\n\nThe wooden well at the main spring, although very small, appears to be in a fair state of repair. The sheet piling cutoff near the cistern is broken at ground level in places and while not effective in retaining surface water, it is believed that it retards subsurface flow.\n\nThe outline of work proposed is briefly as follows:\n\nExcavate to the level of the present 4\" field tile line, beginning at the lower end.\n\nRelay the 4\" tile on prepared continuous cradles of 2\" material as excavating progresses.\n\nBackfill with 6\" of gravel, then earth as the tile are laid.\n\nIt is felt that the excavation costs will be relatively high on this undertaking due to the possible necessity for pumping and for shoring of the trench. However, should there be any unspent funds, it is felt that they should be used to increase the flow into the wooden well at the main spring by the laying of a field drain underneath the present ditch leading to the well.\n\nFollowing is an estimate of the probable cost of repairing the feed line from the sump to the concrete cistern:\n\nMATERIALS:\n500 FEM of 2\" material (for tile cradle and shoring) at $90.00 per M. ........................................... $45.00\nEstimate 10% new 4\" tile - 18' at 15\u00a2 per ft. ........ 2.70\n15 cubic yds. gravel (local) at $2.00 per cubic yd. ... 30.00\nRental of sump pump ........................................ 50.00\nNails and incidentals ....................................... 3.00\n\nLABOR:\nExcavation of trench, 100 cubic yards, at $1.25 per cubic yard .................................................. 125.00\nShoring and building of tile cradle ......................... 50.00\nCleaning and relaying tile .................................. 25.00\nBackfill - 100 cubic yards @ .50\u00a2 per cubic yard ....... 50.00\n\nTotal ............................................................ $380.70\n\nMr. P.

Storsater dated December 17th, 1948, from which you will note that the work to improve the domestic water supply has been completed at an approximate cost of $240.00.\n\nWe quote as follows from a covering letter from Mr. Gow:\n\n\"The Work just completed relates to the upper 150 feet of the water line. It was found that many of the tile had sunk out of place while others had become blocked with roots and etc. The whole 150 feet of this section was accordingly taken up and replaced. It was also necessary to replace many of the tile and to lay vitrified pipe in sections where quicksand prevails.\n\nThe work was carried out during very cold and unfavourable weather and no test was made as to whether the water supply has improved with this work.

Gow\n\nRe: Water Supply, Brandon Indian Residential School, Manitoba.\n\nDuring the period November 24 to December 3, 1948, the tile line connecting the \"Upper Spring\" to the concrete tank was relaid. The original line was of 4\" clay tile, with a 4\" cast iron pipe 25' in length connecting the tile to the tank. Alignment of the tile was found to be good except near the spring where the soil is very unstable. The tile line for a short distance near Station 0+50 was partially blocked with a fine fibrous growth which existed wholly within the tile.\n\nThe accompanying sketch represents the relaid tile line. Work was started at the lower end of the line in order to keep the trench as much as possible free from water. Soil for the greater distance of the line was found to be compact and stable making it unnecessary to provide any additional support to maintain alignment of the tile. The clay tile were inspected for breaks and possible obstructions before being relaid. Tar paper strips were used to cover the tile joints and the trench was filled with gravel to a depth of 1\u00bd feet above the tile. Earth was placed to complete the backfill. At Station 0+56 due to water a 4\" wye was introduced to the line and a secondary line run in advance to keep the trench dry. Quicksand was encountered at Station 0+36 making the use of field tile impracticable. Vitrified sewer tile were laid from this point to the spring. A metal mesh covering was here placed around the pipe inlet to prevent any obstruction from entering the line.\n\nApproximately $240.00 was spent on the outlined repairs. This amount includes labour, materials used, and the writer's living expenses while engaged on this work.\n\n(Sgd) O.J. Storsater\n\nO. J. Storsater.\n\nMr. D. B.

Higgins\nContractor\n\nAudit Report for Progress Claims 1 to 4 - $13,823.45\n\nThe audit of Progress Claims Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, has been completed at the contractor's Brandon office, and my report on same is submitted as follows:\n\nPayrolls and Payroll Charges\n\nHours worked, hourly rates and labour classifications as disclosed on payrolls were compared with corresponding information contained in a day-book or diary, which the Contractor informed me had been written up from the workmen's time sheets. Workmen's daily time sheets were not available for my inspection. The Contractor explained that these had been destroyed.\n\nPayrolls have been checked as to mathematical accuracy. Hourly rates for the various labour classifications have been formally approved by Rev. O.B. Strapp.\n\nAn excerpt from letter dated February 3, 1948, from Rev. O.B. Strapp addressed to Treasury Auditor J.W. Thomson, reads as follows:\n\n\"For my own satisfaction I have been checking the work as it has proceeded and am satisfied that the workmanship and all materials are up to standard. I have made periodic checks as to the number of men employed on the job and find this has agreed with the payroll submitted by Mr. Higgens.\"\n\nThe following discrepancies are noted:\n\nOvercharges re errors in extensions and additions\n\nClaim No. 1\n$ .70\n4\n$ 2.90\n\n$ 3.60\nMr. W. Lauchlan\n\nPayrolls and Payroll Charges (cont'd.)\n\nOvercharges re W.C.B. Assessments\n\nClaim No. 1. $10.86\n\" 2. 3.49\n\" 3. 2.26\n\" 4. 5.72\n\n$22.33\n\nThe adjustment in respect of overcharge on W.C.B. Assessments is because the rate of assessment may apply only to that portion of gross wages not in excess of rates of $2000.00 per year for 1947, and $2500.00 per year for 1948.\n\nIt is noted that all payrolls bear the approval signature of Rev. O.B. Strapp.\n\nThe contractor has omitted to claim for the company portion of unemployment insurance. This was pointed out to him, and I understand will be included in a future claim, supported by debit note containing details of the charge.\n\nEquipment Rentals\n\nThere was no segregation of equipment rentals in the claims as submitted, such cost being included together with that of materials and expenses.\n\nThere is tabulated below all charges covering equipment rentals included in these claims, as follows:\n\nContractor's Truck for hauling debris - $1.00 per hr. (Claim 1)\nBull-dozer - Rented from Ron Clark - 6.00 \"\nAir Compressor \" W.W. Campbell - 3.50 \"\n\nFormal approvals have been obtained from Rev. O.B. Strapp covering rental of this equipment at the rates as shown.\n\nMaterials, Expenses, etc.\n\nCharges as taken up in claims have been compared with suppliers' invoices, all of which bear the approval signature of Rev. O.B. Strapp.\n\nExtensions and additions have been checked, and material descriptions scrutinized.\n\nThere have been no small tools charged in materials and expenses costs.\n\nAn error is noted as follows: re Claim No. 1.\n\nWade and Sons Ltd. - Invoice amount (as corrected) $747.80\n\" \" \" (as claimed) 674.30\n\nDifference - Undercharge - re error in addition $73.50\nSub-Contract Charges\n\nThere was no segregation of sub-contract charges in the claims as originally submitted, such cost having been included in that of \"materials and expenses\".\n\nTabulated below are sub-contract charges that have been included in Claims 1 to 4.\n\nPlumbing only - Neale, Stothard & Chapman $705.35\nPlastering - W. Smith and T. Ryles 502.90\n\nConfirmation of approval of the sub-letting of the plumbing and plastering have been obtained from Rev. O.B. Strapp, as follows:\n\nPlumbing only - Neale, Stothard & Chapman $1,226.78\nPlastering - W. Smith and T. Ryles 502.90\n\nThe main contract does not make provision for any hold-back, either in respect of the prime contractor or the sub-contractors.\n\nContractor's Fee\n\nIt is noted that an amount of $300.00 has been taken up out of a total allowable fee of $1,200.00. Such portion of fee as taken up on face of progress certificates has been unsupported by Contractor's debit notes.\n\nThe expenditure (as adjusted) exclusive of fee, amounts to $13,070.82, as compared with a total estimated cost of $15,200.00, indicating work has been somewhat more than four fifths completed.\n\nGeneral\n\nNo statutory declaration has been filed by the Contractor as to payment of wages and settlement of accounts with suppliers.\n\nIt has been arranged that an audit of liquidation of such charges will be undertaken prior to accepting any further progress claim, and that a statutory declaration will be attached to the next claim, which will also reflect the adjustments as brought out in this audit.\n\nA summary of discrepancies noted is set out below:\n\n| Claim No. | Overcharges | Undercharges |\n|----------|-------------|-------------|\n| 1        |             |             |\n|          | Undercharge on Invoice - Wade & Sons Ltd. | $73.50 |\n|          | Overcharge re payroll error | .70 |\n|          | \" W.C.B.

Laughlan,\nChief Treasury Officer,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nre: Cost Plus Contract for Demolition of Old Residence and Construction of New Residence for Principal at Residential School, Brandon, Man.\n\nE.C. Higgens - Contractor\n\nAudit Report for Progress Claims 1 to 4 - $13,823.45\n\nThe audit of Progress Claims Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, has been completed at the contractor's Brandon office, and my report on same is submitted as follows:\n\nPayrolls and Payroll Charges\n\nHours worked, hourly rates and labour classifications as disclosed on payrolls were compared with corresponding information contained in a day-book or diary, which the Contractor informed me had been written up from the workmen's time sheets. Workmen's daily time sheets were not available for my inspection. The Contractor explained that these had been destroyed.\n\nPayrolls have been checked as to mathematical accuracy. Hourly rates for the various labour classifications have been formally approved by Rev. O.B. Strapp.\n\nAn excerpt from letter dated February 3, 1948, from Rev. O.B. Strapp addressed to Treasury Auditor J.W. Thomson, reads as follows:\n\n\"For my own satisfaction I have been checking the work as it has proceeded and am satisfied that the workmanship and all materials are up to standard. I have made periodic checks as to the number of men employed on the job and find this has agreed with the payroll submitted by Mr. Higgens.\"\n\nThe following discrepancies are noted:\n\nOvercharges re errors in extensions and additions\n\n| Claim No. | $    |\n|----------|------|\n| 1        | .70  |\n| 4        | 2.90 |\n|          | 3.60 |\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6257, file 576-5, part 10)\nPayrolls and Payroll Charges (cont'd.)\n\nOvercharges re W.C.B. Assessments\n\n| Claim No. | Amount |\n|----------|--------|\n| 1        | $10.86 |\n| 2        | 3.69   |\n| 3        | 2.26   |\n| 4        | 5.72   |\n\n$22.53\n\nThe adjustment in respect of overcharge on W.C.B. Assessments is because the rate of assessment may apply only to that portion of gross wages not in excess of rate of $2000.00 per year for 1947, and $2500.00 per year for 1948.\n\nIt is noted that all payrolls bear the approval signature of Rev. O.B. Strapp.\n\nThe contractor has omitted to claim for the company portion of unemployment insurance. This was pointed out to him, and I understand will be included in a future claim, supported by debit note containing details of the charge.\n\nEquipment Rentals\n\nThere was no segregation of equipment rentals in the claims as submitted, such cost being included together with that of materials and expenses.\n\nThere is tabulated below all charges covering equipment rentals included in these claims, as follows:\n\n- Contractor's Truck for hauling debris - $1.00 per hr. (Claim#1)\n- Bull-dozer - Rented from Ron Clark - 6.00 \"\n- Air Compressor \" W.W.Campbell - 3.50 \"\n\nFormal approvals have been obtained from Rev. O.B. Strapp covering rental of this equipment at the rates as shown.\n\nMaterials, Expenses, etc.\n\nCharges as taken up in claims have been compared with suppliers' invoices, all of which bear the approval signature of Rev. O.B. Strapp.\n\nExtensions and additions have been checked, and material descriptions scrutinized.\n\nThere have been no small tools charged in materials and expenses costs.\n\nAn error is noted as follows: re Claim No. 1.\n\nWade and Sons Ltd. - Invoice amount (as corrected) $747.80\n(as claimed) 674.30\n\nDifference - Undercharge - re error in addition $73.50\nSub-Contract Charges\n\nThere was no segregation of sub-contract charges in the claims as originally submitted, such cost having been included in that of \"materials and expenses\".\n\nTabulated below are sub-contract charges that have been included in Claims 1 to 4.\n\nPlumbing only - Neale, Stothard & Chapman $705.35\nPlastering - W. Smith and T. Ryles 502.90\n\nConfirmation of approval of the sub-letting of the plumbing and plastering have been obtained from Rev. O.B. Strapp, as follows:\n\nPlumbing only - Neale, Stothard & Chapman $1,226.30\nPlastering - W. Smith and T. Ryles 502.90\n\nThe main contract does not make provision for any hold-back, either in respect of the prime contractor or the sub-contractors.\n\nContractor's Fee\n\nIt is noted that an amount of $800.00 has been taken up out of a total allowable fee of $1,200.00. Such portion of fee as taken up on face of progress certificates has been unsupported by Contractor's debit notes.\n\nThe expenditure (as adjusted) exclusive of fee, amounts to $13,070.82, as compared with a total estimated cost of $15,200.00, indicating work has been somewhat more than four fifths completed.\n\nGeneral\n\nNo statutory declaration has been filed by the Contractor as to payment of wages and settlement of accounts with suppliers.\n\nIt has been arranged that an audit of liquidation of such charges will be undertaken prior to accepting any further progress claim, and that a statutory declaration will be attached to the next claim, which will also reflect the adjustments as brought out in this audit.\n\nA summary of discrepancies noted is set out below:\n\n| Claim No. | Overcharges | Undercharges |\n|-----------|-------------|--------------|\n| 1         |             |              |\n| Undercharge on Invoice - Wade & Sons Ltd. | $ 73.50 |              |\n| Overcharge re payroll error | .70 |              |\n| \" W.C.B.

Lauchlan....\n\nGeneral (Cont'd.)\n\nI have now been advised by Reverend O.B. Strapp that the sub-contract tender from Neale, Stothard and Chapman in the amount of $1,226.30, as originally submitted to Mr. Higgins, was withdrawn, as changes were made in the suggested equipment and location of drains, etc. I understand a revised estimate from this firm is being submitted as soon as possible, and confirmation of approval of the revised tender will be given at that time.\n\nCertificate\n\nIn accordance with the above and subject to the extent of my examination and exceptions mentioned, I report that in my opinion the claims Nos. 1 to 4, totalling $19,823.45, as shown above, are supported by proper documentary evidence and are in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract.\n\nEJS/JC\n\nR.J.

The loft to be supported by steel pipe columns on 20' centres throughout the building. These columns will not interfere with Beatty Brothers Equipment specified for the main floor. The loft will contain 40,000 cu. ft. and will have 3,300 sq. ft. of floor space.\n\nThere will be four 20\" roof ventilators to ventilate the insulated walls and one 20\" roof vent, with necessary duct, to remove foul air from the main section of the barn.\nDoors and windows will be of standard Quonset make and will be situated as close as possible to your original plan. The doors will consist of 3'6\"x7' steel walk doors where specified and a 12x9 steel sliding door in the loft.\n\nThe whole of the above will cost .................. $31,787.00. This price subject to 30 days acceptance. Work to commence as soon as the frost is out of the ground in the Spring.\n\nIt is to be realized that a barn of this type would be 100% fire-proof, would be warm in the winter and cool in the summer, and would last for years with little or no maintenance.\n\nWe are forwarding to you, under separate cover, the following items:\n\n- Photo of calf pen\n- Clearance chart for Quonset buildings\n- Foundation layout for Quonset buildings\n- Letter from Beatty Brothers, Limited\n- Plan of Quonset 36', 1\u00bd-storey layout\n- Beatty Brothers' plan for their equipment and your original sketch.\n\nWe are also sending a duplicate copy of this letter, so that you may retain a copy for your files and forward the other copy to Ottawa.\n\nTrusting we may be of service to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMAPLE LEAF CONSTRUCTION LIMITED,\n\nR.

F. Neary.\n\nFurther to your letter under file 576-1 (E) dated April 9th, 1949, I have taken the matter up with Pearson Construction Company at Brandon, regarding the repairs to the basement walls, washrooms, and repairs to the roofing, and they advise me they are unable to tender a price on work of this nature - as it is almost impossible to determine the ultimate cost. The roof is in extremely poor condition, and is at present leaking in 5 or 6 places; also some considerable exterior brick work which would have to be repaired.\n\nEnclosed herewith is a letter from the Pearson Construction Company, Ltd., clarifying my above remarks. Therefore, I would recommend that this work be handed over to the Engineering Branch - where they have available trained personnel who would be able to give this work immediate supervision. It would be impossible for any of my staff to be on the job at all times; and, further, I have very little faith in allowing Mr. Strapp to look after the supervision of work of this nature.\n\nFurther to your item No. (3) - redecorating of dormitories - I am securing a price for the paint and\n\n- over -\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have signed the Progress Report, however, I would like to bring the following information to your attention.\n\nWhen I took over my duties in the Province of Manitoba Mr. Strapp was looking after the above mentioned building and I was under the impression that he would be in full charge of the work.\n\nI understand Mr. Strapp has gone ahead and papered the house throughout and an extra bathroom has been built with fixtures being supplied from the old residence. I do not think this is according to the contract but as I have not seen the contract cannot say.\n\nMr. Thompson will be forwarding the Progress Report in a day or so.\n\nR. S.

Comparison was made between employees' time sheets and the Contractor's day book and found in agreement with hours claimed in payrolls.\n\nPayroll included in this claim is representative only of that portion of the employees' time and wages chargeable to this contract. Master payrolls of the Contractor have been examined in support of wage rates, time worked, deductions and net pay.\n\nThe mathematical accuracy of the payroll claimed has been verified. Unemployment Insurance charges are accepted as a proper charge to the contract, and represent employer's share only. Workmen's Compensation Board charges have been verified and computation of refund allowed, due to excess earnings, checked and found in order.\n\nThe Contractor has made no attempt to claim the employer's share of Unemployment Insurance charges referred to in previous audit report, and has again been advised that invoice covering such charges should be included in subsequent claim.\n\nEquipment Rentals\n\nNo further rentals charges are claimed and therefore call for no comment.\n\nSub-Contract Charges\n\nThe mathematical accuracy of Sub-Contractor's claims has been verified and approvals received from the Rev.

It is understood by the Contractor that, when applicable, notice as to date of cancellation will be received from the Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nProof of delivery of all supplies and materials was undertaken by the Indian Agent, the Rev.

We understand that the principal, the Reverend O.B.Strapp is now occupying the newly constructed residence and we are wondering whether it is the intention of the Department to maintain insurance on the dwelling, now that the building is about completed. We expect that the next claim will be the final.\n\nWe would like to bring to your attention the fact that the expenditures to date amount to $23,653.74, which is in excess of the amount authorized in the contract by $8,453.74.

Strapp,\nPrincipal,\nBrandon Residential School,\nBrandon, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr. Strapp:\n\nWe have just received another progress payment in connection with the construction of the Principal's residence at the Brandon Residential School. This payment brings the cost considerably higher than was originally intended. Of course, we realize that some of the extra cost was due to repairs to the foundation and other repairs necessary on account of the settlement of the original foundation.\n\nHowever, it has been brought to our attention that acting on your authority, the new residence has been completely papered and an extra bathroom with fixtures has been installed. Departmental officials have been anxious to provide a suitable residence for you, but we feel that we have not received full cooperation when you authorize expenditures over and above what was called for in the plans and specifications, without first obtaining our approval.\n\nPlease let me hear from you at the earliest possible date, and at the same time, you should advise if the building has been completed, and if not, the approximate cost that will be required to finish it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

The basement walls are badly in need of repairs and some rooms, such as the boys' playroom, are in very poor condition. The wainscoting is broken and the washroom is badly in need of repair. We should do something about redecorating the school this summer.\n\nThe playrooms have no facilities for the children to play games and only one or two benches to sit on. All the dormitories need redecorating. There are signs of the roof leaking in the sewing room and the boys' side of the building.\"\n\nIn replying to that letter we requested Mr. Davis to forward further information, and I enclose a copy of his letter together with a quotation he received from Pearson Construction Co. Ltd., Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nAs yet Mr. Davis has not forwarded to us the quotation for redecorating the dormitories which\nhe stated he was endeavouring to obtain from Crane Limited of Brandon.\n\nI would appreciate it if you could arrange to have one of your officials visit this school and forward an estimate of the cost of making the repairs that are necessary. A copy of this memorandum is being sent to Regional Supervisor Davis, and before visiting the school Mr. Gow might consult him.\n\nPP/ST Attachs.\n\nDirector.\n| DATE     | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|----------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1949     | To amount of account, detailed copies attached |        |\n| March 31 | Wiring done by C.W.

Strapp.\nDear Sir;\n\nI have your letter of the above noted date and file number.\n\nI regret very much that you have been given the impression that I have not been giving the fullest cooperation in the matter of the construction of the new house. It most certainly was not my intention to offend in any way.\n\nMay I say in explanation re the matter of the toilet and hand wash basin that was installed in the upper floor room, that I discussed with the plumber the substitution of these items in place of the laundry equipment that the plans called for in the basement as I found that in so many homes where laundry tubs etc were installed in the basement they were not used because of the heavy work entailed in carrying the wet clothing upstairs to hang it out of doors to dry. I did not expect that the amount of the finished contract would exceed the amount of the estimate. The finished job was billed at $1,405.58 the original estimated cost was $1,226.30, making a difference of $179.28. As the amount is not high I will be quite prepared to accept responsibility for the excess over the original estimate, if you consider I should do so.\n\nWith reference to the papering of the lower floor rooms, and the hall; When the house was jacked up to bring the floors to a level the plaster was badly cracked and in some places so uneven\nthat it was impossible to patch without stripping large surfaces, so that the patch would not show. In discussing this with the contractor it was decided that to paper the downstairs rooms and tint the walls of the rooms upstairs would be the best way to finish the job. This is what was done. It is to be regretted that your informant stated that the house had been \"completely papered\" as I most certainly would not have proceeded with such an expenditure without first consulting you as I did with reference to the refrigerator and the electric stove.\n\nI have been unable to contact the contractor Mr. E.C. Higgins as he is out of town for a few days but have contacted the Painter who has submitted a provisional estimate for completing the work on the outside of the house at approximately $500.00. The account for the painting is $112.14. The work is completed.\n\nThe house will then be completed with the exception of a walk from the road to the front door, a distance of approximately 20 feet. I would suggest that this be left until the fill around the basement has settled and then if a small grant can be made for cement we can do that work ourselves.\n\nI again wish to assure you that I had no intention of overstepping my responsibility in this matter but was concerned only with making the best out of a position which not only was causing a great deal of concern both to your branch and myself but was also getting out of bounds as far as cost was concerned.\n\nThere are a number of doors, frames and windows which are odd size in width and height but which could possibly be sold singly as the demand occurs. If you so wish I will take the matter up with Mr. Higgins and see what suggestions he has along this line.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nPrincipal.\n7th June, 1949.\n\nRev. O.B. Strepp,\nPrincipal,\nBrandon Residential School,\nBrandon, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr. Strepp:\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter of May 23rd, you should communicate with us as soon as you have discussed with Mr. Higgins the best manner of disposing of the doors, frames and windows from the old building which are not required.\n\nWhen replying you should, if possible, let us know the approximate amount that you can obtain for them. They should not be actually sold until you receive from us the official permission of the Salvage Officer.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttention: Mr. B.

If it is possible to erect a barn at a reasonable figure, we might be able to secure the funds in the supplementary estimates.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nPP/ST\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nEnc.\nAttention: Mr. Chas. H. Buck.\nRe: Indian Residential School, Brandon,\nManitoba.\n\nIn accordance with your letter of June 10, 1949 I have made an inspection of this school and beg to report that the work now required may be referred to almost entirely as maintenance, which has apparently been deferred for at least several years. The school building generally is in the worst condition of any that I have visited to date and it is impossible to furnish you with definite cost estimates covering the many items that now require attention.\n\nThe major, but by no means the most important, matter that should now be attended to is the interior decorating of the school. Practically the whole interior of the school is badly in need of decorating and this is a matter that, according to the Rev. O. B. Stropp, Principal, has been under consideration for some time. Apparently several estimates regarding interior decorating have been obtained and submitted to Indian Affairs and I am forwarding herewith a copy of the latest which was obtained from Crane Bros., Brandon. This estimate, in the amount of $2,662.35, covers only those rooms that are most urgently in need of painting and this work, at least, should be done this year. The work could be done by Crane Bros. on the basis of the estimate submitted, or estimates could be obtained from other Brandon Contractors who might be asked to tender on the items covered by the Crane quotation.\n\nThe following additional items also require immediate attention at this school:\n\n(1) The classrooms, although not included in the Crane estimate, are in need of attention. The plaster is badly cracked in places and should be repaired. Three 4' X 5' pieces of Ten-Test should be supplied for attachment to walls for use as notice boards in order to eliminate future damage to the walls.\n\n(2) The walls of the boys' and girls' playrooms were lined with \"V. Joint\" between the floor and the lower level of the windows. This \"V Joint\" has been broken out and the plaster beneath gouged out at every break. New \"V Joint\" could be installed but\nthe same thing would no doubt happen to it in a short time. It is therefore recommended that the walls in these rooms be faced with cement from floor to window level. This work will have to be done before the painting of these rooms could be finished.\n\n(3) The drinking fountain in the girls' playroom is in such bad shape that it can no longer be used and has been disconnected. A new fountain should be installed.\n\n(4) The taps for the wash basins in both the boys' and girls' washrooms are all in bad shape and all need replacing. The taps on the bath tubs are in a similar condition. New taps should be supplied, 50 for the wash basins and 6 for bath tubs.\n\n(5) The toilets in the boys' and girls' lavatories are likewise in bad condition. The old type of toilet installed here is anything but sanitary and I would suggest that new toilets be installed.\n\n(6) Many of the window sills are in very bad shape and some will have to be replaced in those rooms to which the boys have access.\n\n(7) The tables in the pupils dining room were covered with linoleum which is now full of holes which have been carved therein. These tables should be recovered with masonite or similar material. For the purpose 16 pcs. each 2'6\" X 8'0\" are required.\n\n(8) A number of the composition stair treads are badly cracked and should be replaced. One or two can be considered dangerous at present.\n\n(9) The plaster and woodwork in the vestibules is in bad shape and should be repaired.\n\n(10) The plaster above the toilet in the boys' dormitory is in bad shape and the toilet needs a new seat.\n\n(11) The cement floors throughout the building need patching in many places.\n\n(12) The insulation on the steam pipes should be renewed in a number of places, especially in the boys playroom.\n\n(13) Main Roof - The felt covering is exposed in many places, the flashing is loose in places and the cement around the stone coping now appears to be mostly sand and needs renewing. The two ventilators have the louvres broken out and as these ventilators no longer serve any useful purpose they should either be removed or have the louvres boarded up and the ventilators made rain proof.\n\n(14) The tops of the two chimneys over the boiler room are in very bad shape. The cement mortar has fallen out between the bricks for some distance below the chimney tops and the stone coping and upper bricks may fall before very long.\n(15) The brick facing over the tile at the N.E. corner of the laundry is badly cracked and the bricks are beginning to fall off. The condition of the tile can not be ascertained until the brick facing is removed.\n\nThe wall at this corner of the laundry building is butted against by a concrete retaining wall which holds up the earth approach to the barn. To repair the laundry wall it will be necessary to dig out a portion of the earth fill and break out a section of the concrete retaining wall.\n\n(16) Laundry Roof - This roof is in about the same condition as the main roof on the school building. The joints between the stone coping must be renewed and the ventilators which are no longer used should be removed.\n\n(17) In the laundry the plaster on walls and ceiling around ventilators is badly damaged from the water which has leaked through around the ventilators. The insulation on the steam pipes needs renewing. The water storage tank for the school water supply is located in the laundry room. This tank was never painted and is now badly rusted. The scale should be cleaned off and the tank painted.\n\n(18) The hot water heater for the staff water supply is now out of commission. The sections are in bad shape and need replacing. This heater is a Gurney No.907, Cottage Boiler.\n\nFrom the above you will note that the work that should be done at this school requires the services of painters, roofers, bricklayers, carpenters, plumbers and perhaps a steamfitter, also that certain jobs must be done before others can be proceeded with. The painting can be done on a contract basis but most, if not all, of the other work will have to be done on a day labour or cost-plus basis.\n\nIn view of the above it is hereby recommended:\n\n(1) That a sum of not less than $7,500.00 be provided for the purpose of completing as much of the above work as possible during the present season.\n\n(2) That a contract for the painting of at least those parts of the building covered by the Crane's estimate be awarded as soon as possible.\n\n(3) That arrangements be made immediately for the purchase of materials locally and the employment of the skilled labour necessary to complete the work which must be done in the interior of the building before the painting can be completed.\n\n(4) That a local builder be employed to repair the chimneys and roof copings and to remove the ventilators. This work can hardly be done on anything other than a cost-plus basis.\n(5) That, after the work covered by (4) has been done, a local roofing contractor be employed to make the necessary repairs to the roof. This will also have to be done on a cost-plus basis.\n\n(6) That authority to arrange for the work and supervise same be issued either to the Regional Supervisor, Indian Affairs, Manitoba, or to this office.\n\nThe above work will require a certain amount of supervision and same could, if desired, be handled from this office, in view of the fact that it is necessary to pass this school several times each month while enroute to the Riding Mountain National Park.\n\nWhile at the Brandon School the Rev. O. B. Strapp advised me that the wooden water tank at the source of the school water supply was badly in need of replacement, also that the pipe line from the spring to the tank was badly clogged. He stated that the situation at the spring had been previously investigated by engineers of the Engineering and Construction Division and it was his understanding that plans had been made for the installation of a new concrete tank at the spring.\n\nIn view of Mr. Strapp's understanding I made no investigation at the spring and am submitting no estimate on the repairs that are apparently necessary at the source of the school water supply.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupervising Engineer.\n\nEnclosure\n\nThe Chief,\nEngineering & Construction Division,\nLands & Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Perrie in which he includes the following comments on the roofs:\n\n(a) Main Roof - The felt covering is exposed in many places, the flashing is loose in places and the cement around the stone coping now appears to be mostly sand and needs renewing. The two ventilators have the louvres broken out and as these ventilators no longer serve any useful purpose they should either be removed or have the louvres boarded up and the ventilators made rain proof.\n\n(b) Laundry Roof - This roof is in about the same condition as the main roof on the school building. The joints between the stone coping must be renewed and the ventilators which are no longer used should be removed.\n\n(c) That a local builder be employed to repair the chimneys and roof copings and to remove the ventilators. This work can hardly be done on anything than a cost plus basis.\n\n(d) That, after the work under item (c) has been done, a local roofing contractor be employed to make the necessary repairs to the roof. This will also have to be done on a cost plus basis.\n\nWe agree that the work should be on a cost plus basis, as until repairs are actually under way, the extent of the work to be done cannot be safely estimated.\n\nMay it be pointed out that repairs made now may have to be repeated on other portions of the roof in four or five years and inspection and further repairs made at that time. Should funds be available it would be good policy to decide on a 20-year guaranteed roof now and avoid further vexation in this respect for years to come.\n\nShould roof repairs however be decided upon, may we be advised if it is desired to have this Division arrange for the work and supervision or by Indian Affairs through their Regional Supervisor in Manitoba.\n\nWe attach a copy of the complete report for the information of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nR.A.

Perrie, Supervising Engineer at our Regina office, was instructed to inspect and report on the condition of the above building. We are now in receipt of Mr. Perrie's report, and after some consideration, have made a separate report to you on items that refer specifically to roof repairs and which was sent to you on July 19th last.\n\nThe interior repairs to the building, requiring attention as stated in the report, are of considerable extent, no separate item however, being considered of too an extensive nature not to deserve attention, but added together form a rather deplorable picture of conditions due to lack of maintenance.\n\nThe report sums up as follows:\n\n(a) That ceilings, walls and floors in classrooms, playrooms and toilets require to be entirely renewed and others to be repaired.\n\n(b) Window sills require caulking and painting with some to be replaced.\n\n(c) Toilets, taps, stair treads, insulation on steam pipes and concrete floors throughout all need attention.\n\n(d) Some brick facing is cracked and needs repairs.\n\n(e) The hot water heater for the staff water supply, is out of commission and some steam pipes require replacing.\n\nThis is a brief summary of conditions at this school, and Mr. Perrie recommends that a sum of not less than $7,500.00 be provided for the purpose of completing as much of the above work as possible during the present season.\n\nThe report further states:\n\n(1) That a contract for the painting of at least those parts of the building covered by the Crane estimate be awarded as soon as possible.\n\n(2) That arrangements be made immediately for the purchase of materials locally and the employment of the skilled labour necessary to complete the work which must be done in the interior of the building before the painting can be completed.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nShould the above work be authorized, it will require a certain amount of supervision. May we be advised whether or not this Division will be required to provide name.\n\nWe attach herewith the complete report with a copy of Crane Brothers estimate of $3,791.50 for the cost of interior painting, which seems fair and reasonable in view of the scattered nature of the work to be done. The remainder of the $7,500.00 would be expended for the necessary repairs before painting can be done.\n\nChas. H. Buck,\nFor Chief, Engineering and Construction Division.\n416 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Sask.\nJuly 8, 1949\n\nAttention: Mr. Chas. H. Buck.\nRe: Indian Residential School, Brandon,\nManitoba.\n\nIn accordance with your letter of June 10, 1949 I have made an inspection of this school and beg to report that the work now required may be referred to almost nothing as maintenance, which has apparently been deferred for at least several years. The school building generally is in the worst condition of any that I have visited to date and it is impossible to furnish you with definite cost estimates covering the many items that now require attention.\n\nThe major, but by no means the most important, matter that should now be attended to is the interior decorating of the school. Practically the whole interior of the school is badly in need of decorating and this is matters that, according to the Rev. O. B. Strapp, Principal, has been under consideration for some time. Apparently several estimates covering interior decorating have been obtained and submitted to Indian Affairs and I am forwarding herewith a copy of the latest which was obtained from Crane Bros., Brandon. This estimate, in the amount of $2,862.35 covers only those rooms that are most urgently in need of painting and this work, at least, should be done this year. The work could be done by Crane Bros. on the basis of the estimate submitted, or estimates could be obtained from other Brandon Contractors who might be asked to tender on the items covered by the Crane quotation.\n\nThe following additional items also require immediate attention at this school:\n\n(1) The classrooms, although not included in the Crane estimate, are in need of attention. The plaster is badly cracked in places and should be repaired. Three 4' X 8' pieces of Ten-Test should be supplied for attachment to walls for use as notice boards in order to eliminate future damage to the walls.\n\n(2) The walls of the boys' and girls' playrooms were lined with \"V Joint\" between the floor and the lower level of the windows. This \"V Joint\" has been broken out and the plaster beneath gouged out at every break. New \"V Joint\" could be installed but\nthe same thing would no doubt happen to it in a short time. It is therefore recommended that the walls in these rooms be faced with cement from floor to window level. This work will have to be done before the painting of these rooms could be finished.\n\n(3) The drinking fountain in the girls' playroom is in such bad shape that it can no longer be used and has been disconnected. A new fountain should be installed.\n\n(4) The taps for the wash basins in both the boys' and girls' washrooms are all in bad shape and all need replacing. The taps on the bath tubs are in a similar condition. New taps should be supplied, 50 for the wash basins and 5 for bath tubs.\n\n(5) The toilets in the boys' and girls' lavatories are likewise in bad condition. The old type of toilet installed here is anything but sanitary and I would suggest that new toilets be installed.\n\n(6) Many of the window sills are in very bad shape and some will have to be replaced in those rooms to which the boys have access.\n\n(7) The tables in the pupils dining room were covered with linoleum which is now full of holes which have been carved therein. These tables should be recovered with masonite or similar material. For the purpose 16 pcs. each 2'6\" x 5'0\" are required.\n\n(8) A number of the composition stair treads are badly cracked and should be replaced. One or two can be considered dangerous at present.\n\n(9) The plaster and woodwork in the vestibules is in bad shape and should be repaired.\n\n(10) The plaster above the toilet in the boys' dormitory is in bad shape and the toilet needs a new seat.\n\n(11) The cement floors throughout the building need patching in many places.\n\n(12) The insulation on the steam pipes should be renewed in a number of places, especially in the boys' playroom.\n\n(13) Main Roof - The felt covering is exposed in many places, the flashing is loose in places and the cement around the stone coping appears to be mostly sand and needs renewing. The two ventilators have the louves broken out and as these ventilators no longer serve any useful purpose they should either be removed or have the louves boarded up and the ventilators made rain proof.\n\n(14) The tops of the two chimneys over the boiler room are in very bad shape. The cement mortar has fallen out between the bricks for some distance below the chimney tops and the stone coping and upper bricks may fall before very long.\n(15) The brick facing over the tile at the N.E. corner of the laundry is badly cracked and the bricks are beginning to fall off. The condition of the tile cannot be ascertained until the brick facing is removed.\n\nThe wall at this corner of the laundry building is butted against by a concrete retaining wall which holds up the earth approach to the barn. To repair the laundry wall it will be necessary to dig out a portion of the earth fill and break out a section of the concrete retaining wall.\n\n(16) Laundry Roof - This roof is in about the same condition as the main roof on the school building. The joints between the stone coping must be renewed and the ventilators which are no longer used should be removed.\n\n(17) In the laundry the plaster on walls and ceiling around ventilators is badly damaged from the water which has leaked through around the ventilators. The insulation on the steam pipes needs renewing. The water storage tank for the school water supply is located in the laundry room. This tank was never painted and is now badly rusted. The scale should be cleaned off and the tank painted.\n\n(18) The hot water heater for the staff water supply is now out of commission. The sections are in bad shape and need replacing. This heater is a Gurney No.907, Cottage Boiler.\n\nFrom the above you will note that the work that should be done at this school requires the services of painters, roofers, bricklayers, carpenters, plumbers and perhaps a steamfitter, also that certain jobs must be done before others can be proceeded with. The painting can be done on a contract basis but most, if not all, of the other work will have to be done on a day labour or cost-plus basis.\n\nIn view of the above it is hereby recommended:\n\n(1) That a sum of not less than $7,500.00 be provided for the purpose of completing as much of the above work as possible during the present season.\n\n(2) That a contract for the painting of at least those parts of the building covered by the Crane estimate be awarded as soon as possible.\n\n(3) That arrangements be made immediately for the purchase of materials locally and the employment of the skilled labour necessary to complete the work which must be done in the interior of the building before the painting can be completed.\n\n(4) That a local builder be employed to repair the chimneys and roof copings and to remove the ventilators. This work can hardly be done on anything other than a cost-plus basis.\n(5) That, after the work covered by (4) has been done, a local roofing contractor be employed to make the necessary repairs to the roof. This will also have to be done on a cost-plus basis.\n\n(6) That authority to arrange for the work and supervise same be issued either to the Regional Supervisor, Indian Affairs, Manitoba, or to this office.\n\nThe above work will require a certain amount of supervision and same could, if desired, be handled from this office, in view of the fact that it is necessary to pass this school several times each month while enroute to the Riding Mountain National Park.\n\nWhile at the Brandon School the Rev. O. B. Strapp advised me that the wooden water tank at the source of the school water supply was badly in need of replacement, also that the pipe line from the spring to the tank was badly clogged. He stated that the situation at the spring had been previously investigated by engineers of the Engineering and Construction Division and it was his understanding that plans had been made for the installation of a new concrete tank at the spring.\n\nIn view of Mr. Strapp's understanding I made no investigation at the spring and am submitting no estimate on the repairs that are apparently necessary at the source of the school water supply.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupervising Engineer.\n\nEnc.\n\nThe Chief,\nEngineering & Construction Division,\nLands & Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This building is 32' x 96'. They will deliver it to Brandon for $2,675.00, and it would cost us, at least, another $5,000.00 to put this building into shape - which would include floors, painting, etc. It might be a good plan if the Department had a representative of the Engineering Branch look over this building and estimate on the cost of turning it into a barn.\n\nIn my opinion $30,000.00 for a barn at the Brandon Residential School is not warranted, and before we do anything about a barn, the interior of the school should be repaired.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of the letter received from the North American Buildings, quoting a price on the building.\n\nH.

Ferrie,\nSupervising Engineer,\nEngineering & Construction Division,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\n416 Post Office Bldg.,\nREGINA, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrie:\n\nSometime ago I contacted Rev. O. Sharpe at the Indian Residential School, Brandon, Man. Since my last contact with him I have been transferred to Saskatoon, but Rev. Sharpe sent a letter to our office in Toronto asking that a representative see him in regard to the roofs at the School, so I have had my contractor in Brandon check over the roofs and give me a resume of the existing conditions.\n\nThe condition of the roofs are as follows:\n\nCopings - 1270 lineal feet.\nThese copings are of precast stone and numerous joints are open or cracked, and the present porosity is below normal allowing moisture to penetrate down into the parapet wall. The joints where open or cracked should be raked out and a heavy Tremco Mastic Caulking Compound applied by gun. After this has been done a waterproofing material should be trowelled over the entire stone so as to make it impervious to moisture, and thus prevent any further deterioration. This mastic waterproofing material is trowelled on at about 1/8\" and has sufficient oils and fibre to allow for expansion and contraction and yet make it 100% waterproof.\n\nParapets - As mentioned above, the moisture has caused cracking and opening of joints in the parapet which should be sealed or pointed with Tremco Caulking & Pointing Compound. To further counteract deterioration, a coat of 14% Clear Damproofing should be applied. This prevents further moisture getting into the brick and seals the porosity of both the brick and mortar joints.\n\nFlashings - The general condition of the flashings if fair except for the reglet, or leading edge, which is cracked and pulled away causing moisture to backpass the present flashings. If this is not attended to immediately, the coming winter will completely push out the flashing and cause considerable amount of damage to the existing well and present roof deck. A trowel application of a material called E.L.S. Mastic Roof Cement should be placed over the crack or seam through out the distance of 1270 feet, so as to prevent any further damage. The E.L.S. should be applied at approximately 5 lineal feet to the pound.\n\nProjections - Any projections can be dealt with in the same manner as the flashings and when coating the roof any metal work can be covered by the roof preservative, which is a rust inhibitive material and thus prevents any further rusting of the metal.\n\nRoof - There is approximately 13,000 sq. ft. of roof, all of which is of tar and gravel construction. Throughout all the roofs numerous bare spots are noticeable and a general dried out condition exists. The bare spots can be merely covered but this is taking a chance as numerous small areas can be missed and thus...\nA complete and thorough job of proper maintenance is not accomplished. Therefore, the recommendation is to remove the existing gravel, as much as possible, and give a heavy application of Tremco Roof Preservative at the rate of 3\u00bd to 4 gallons per square (100 sq. ft.). This resaturates and revitalizes the felts and prevents further drying out.\n\nOn some spots on the roof the felts are ripped, and where this has occurred the weakened area should have a trowel application of E.L.S. Mastic Roof Cement after which a jute fabric is embedded into the material and this in turn is followed by a further coat of E.L.S. The same procedure is followed where the existing blisters are sufficiently bad to warrant attention. The blister should be slit and the felts folded back and E.L.S. trowelled into and around the blister, then the felts are folded back into position and the same procedure as previously stated pertaining to rips is continued.\n\nAfter the above repairs have been completed, the roof is then coated with Tremco Roof Preservative.\n\nThe materials required are as follows:\n\n**Copings**\n- 60 gals. 101 Mastic Waterproofing, Trowel consistency, Natural Cement Colour - $278.50\n- 10 gals. 101 Primer - $35.50\n\nTotal - $314.00\n\n**Parapets**\n- 40 Gals. 145 Clear Damproofing - $204.00\n- 3 Gals. Tremco Caulking & Pointing Compound - $15.60\n\nTotal - $219.60\n\n**Flashings**\n- 300 lbs. E.L.S. Mastic Roof Cement - $15.50\n- 2 Rolls 12\" Impregnated Jute Fabric - $10.70\n- 500 Gals. Tremco Roof Preservative - $851.20\n\nTotal - $851.20\n\n$1,431.30\n\nThe prices quoted above are F.O.B. Winnipeg and subject to existing sales tax.\n\nMr. R. O. Ellis is the contractor who looked over the roofs, and I would recommend him to do the work as he is fully familiar with Tremco methods and is most dependable and satisfactory, with efficient workmanship. Mr. Ellis's address is 420 - 7th St., Brandon, Man., and if you contact him he will be able to give you an estimate of the labour involved.\n\nIf there are any further details you desire, do not hesitate to get in touch with me.\n\nCordially yours,\n\n(Sgd.)

He is willing to sell them at $850.00 each but we would be under the expense of moving them to whichever site we wished them placed.\n\n(3) Mr. Connolly stated that if you wanted any assistance in preparing your building program for submission to the next session of Parliament, he would be willing to come to Ottawa and give you any help he could. He further stated that if you intend to buy any prefabricated buildings he would be\nprepared to consider a proposal to send these buildings forward by winter freight on the understanding that payment would be made for them out of the 1950-51 Appropriation.\n\n(5) He also referred to a building that they had supplied at Aklavik.

Mr. Strapp, Principal of the above school, in connection with the cleaning out of the septic tank.\n\nIt is our understanding that it would be a much simpler matter to clean this tank than the Principal intimates in his letter. There is very little doubt that the Principal could rent, at the school's expense and for a very small sum, a pump from the City of Brandon for cleaning the tank.

D. Spratling\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Sirs;-\n\nRe- Proposed Dairy Barn at Indian Residential School, Brandon, Manitoba.\n\nI have been pressed by Mr. Hamilton to give a quotation on erecting the shed which was delivered from Shilo, for a proposed Dairy Barn.\n\nOn examination of the shed, I find the following;-\n\nWalls. The walls are in sections 8 ft. wide x 12 ft. high. It would be necessary to cut the wall down to about 6 ft., to set on the proposed concrete walls. The windows and doors in these sections would have to be all changed in height and location, which would involve more work than framing a complete new wall. The walls are covered with 5/8 x 8 bevelled spruce boards 8 ft. long, which would not give a very good appearance for a new Building, being in 8 ft. lengths and straight joints. Shiplap would have to be purchased to line up the inside of the Building. The 3 Ply which was formerly used on the roof could be used to cover the ceiling inside; it also might be advisable to use the present siding to cover the inside of walls and purchase new siding for the outside.\n\nRoof. I find that there are only 15 sets of 2 x 6 rafters for the roof, with 2 x 4 collar ties or joists, which would mean the rafters would be over 7 ft. apart - which should be only 2 ft. OC at the most for a permanent building. Then again, the 2 x 4 joists would not be strong enough to carry a litter carrier. The roof of this shed has previously been covered by 3/8 - 3 Ply sheeting, which would not be satisfactory to nail shingles on; therefore, new shiplap would have to be purchased, also shingles and cornice.\n\nHaving already submitted a firm quotation for the construction of walls and floor, and an alternative price of Cost Plus 10% for supervision, I would be pleased to give a quotation for completing the building of a new Barn of proper construction using what materials are available out of sections of shed which are on the ground, or as an alternative I would supervise the construction of a complete new Barn on a Cost Plus basis of 10%, or for a set fee.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.D.

G.

This construction would not take shingles without considerable changes being made.

I have endeavoured to obtain prices in Brandon regarding the completing of this barn but with the exception of the cement work I have only been able to secure prices on a cost plus basis.\n\nFrom the enclosed quotations you will note Ron Clark, Contractor, has given us a quotation on bulldozing about 500 yards at $250.00. In my opinion it will be necessary to remove 1,000 yards of earth as it is on the side of a hill. It would be better to have this barn located on the hill as the valley is generally damp in the spring. You will find enclosed quotations on the cement work for the foundation received from the following:\n\nH. D. Spratling, Brandon, Manitoba - $4500.00\nJoe Holloway, Brandon, Man. - $4475.00\n\nBulldozing only - Ron Clark, Brandon, Man., $250.00\n\nI believe it would be more satisfactory if the putting up of this barn was handed over to the Engineering Branch as it is impossible for us to look after the work if it has to be done on a cost plus basis or day labour.\n\nR.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. Order No. 46751.\n\nVoucher No. T.1191\n\nDATE November 2nd, 1949\nPersonal & Confidential\n\nDear Mr. Murray,\n\nI wonder if by writing this note I could help you to know more fully a local situation which has given me many hours of worry and indeed much concern.\n\nAs long as I have known Burnton School it has been the dumping ground for truancy pupils from other schools, mostly Manitoba schools but schools in Saskatchewan. This type of pupil has left its mark. This year encouraged by expulsion some 24 pupils have run away. I recall a similar situation some 25 years ago.\n\nJust prior to the day he leaving discipline was slipping and the boys attacked Dr. Doyle one evening striking him badly. Fortunately members of the staff was near and so prevented further trouble.\n\nMr. Chapman took charge of this but only retained the position 2 years. The children ran wild and staff members were even afraid to go into certain dormitories alone. When Mr. Chapman left panels of doors were missing, lights were off others and even the private panes of glass had to be removed replaced. This was the heritage handed to Mr. Shipp. The condition today is changed but not without severe measures. As the Principal naturally is not too popular.\nIt is not hard to understand the reason. I reported on the recent vacancy but I do not know if you received a copy. It is my personal belief that most our pupils had a just reason for leaving\u2014except perhaps the little chap away from home for the first time and he was lonely for his baby brother. There was the food complaint\u2014but there must come a limit to this unless we expect to operate a Fort Garry or Prince Edward dining-room. When we show what these same children set down to at home & then see them in the school dining-room will be as different as day is from night. I believe there is plenty of food for all and I find it well served.\n\nOur other real worry is the new barn\u2014there is no authorized plan, specifications and at best it looks like a patched-up job. The Principal has ideas\u2014some good & some bad till he has nothing to do with the building program\u2014I am to get the work done under very difficult instructions & so I place that all materials\u2014all possible plans and all unforeseen problems will be laid at my feet & there is nothing I can do\u2014to me to explain to and get the careful considered help one in the field so urgently needs. I think tonight I may secure one quotation on the cement work\u2014but for erecting the walls & completing the building I trust if anyone will touch it except on a cost-plus basis. One man said he firmly believed he could build the 4 walls\nin a proper manner with new lumber,\nfor the money it will take to cut down\nand piece together the old building. The\nwindows are wrongly located, also the\ndoors, & the 12 ft. height will need to be\ncut down to from 6\u00bd li 7\u00bd ft. Siding spaces\nwill be high & the present walls will need\nmodulation as well as inside shelving.

Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nRe: Brandon Indian Residential School\n\nI desire to confirm the following army signal sent to you this morning:\n\n\"Reference army signal December 10 advising that tender of H.D. Spratling had been accepted for barn at Brandon Residential School, we have reviewed correspondence and find it necessary to have more definite information before Mr. Spratling proceeds with the work. Advise him at once to delay work until we give further orders.\"\n\nOur reason for sending the above communication is due to the fact that we have reviewed previous correspondence, and before proceeding we wish to have some definite assurance regarding the total cost of the barn.\n\nNo doubt you have on file a copy of Mr. Connolly's letter of August 29th, offering us the building at Camp Shilo at a cost of $2,675.00 delivered to the Brandon School. We approved purchase of this building, and arrangements were made accordingly. The third paragraph of this particular letter reads as follows:\n\n\"It is estimated that the erection cost will be $300.00 and shingling would cost in the vicinity of $500.00.\"\nWhen we first read Mr. Spratling's tender of October 26th, copy of which is enclosed, we were under the impression that his tender of $4,300.00 would be sufficient to provide the foundation and erect the building. However, on rereading his letter of October 27th, copy of which is also enclosed, we are not certain that our first impression was correct.\n\nIt would appear from very careful reading of Mr. Spratling's latter letter that Mr. Spratling considers it is going to be a rather costly job to complete the barn, even after spending $4,300.00 for the work mentioned in his letter of October 26th. If so, this information is considerably different from the information contained in Mr. Connolly's letter of August 29th.\n\nBefore proceeding further, we would like to have a complete report from you answering the questions raised in this letter.\n\nWe have had some unfortunate experiences in awarding contracts on a cost plus basis, and it is our intention to avoid these in future.\n\nWe are not prepared to proceed further at the present time until we receive for consideration a quotation on fully completing the barn.\n\nI suggest you interview Mr. Connolly of North American Buildings Limited with a view to obtaining a price from him.\n\nBernard F.

However, before committing myself on this matter I will check it over and advise you.\n\n(2) It is recommended that the electric hand pressing iron be equipped with a red pilot light. I am not just certain what this is, but I do not feel the expense would be very great.\n\n(3) The services of a Night Watchman are recommended for this building. I consider it would be just as well to have the services of a Night Watchman, as this school has a large number of pupils, and while it is fire proof, it could still have quite a fire on the inside with the furniture, etc. Would you please advise me in this connection.\n\n(4) The Rev. Mr. Strapp has been advised both from my office and your office, that he must not lock dormitory doors. This school is locked up more like a jail than a boarding school. I feel that the matter should be again taken up with\nMr. Strapp, with instructions that these doors are not to be locked, as if there was a fire, it would be very dangerous with the children locked in their rooms.\n\nR.

Rental rates were checked to approvals on file. Checks of machines at work on the project were made by the Principal.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Verification was made to the record of materials returned maintained by the Indian Agent and prices checked to invoices of original supply.\n\nCredit invoice covering fire insurance premium rebate in the amount of $4.40 was obtained, and in this respect, it is pointed out that even although the residence had been occupied for some months prior to final claim submission, no advice had been given the Contractor to cancel insurance coverage until November 28, 1949. Cancellation notice of the insurance policy held by Indian Affairs Branch at Ottawa, was given under the signature of the Principal, the Rev. O. B. Strepp.\n\nLiquidation Audit\n\nAn examination was made of all paid cheques issued for wages, equipment rentals, subcontract payments, suppliers' accounts and to the Income Tax Department for deductions at source. There were no outstanding cheques at the time of audit of the final claim.\n\nOld Residence\n\nIn respect of the materials, supplies, fittings, etc., acquired from the demolition of the old residence, a report has been obtained from the Office of the Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, Manitoba, in which their field agent has outlined the disposition made.

Dr. Luthersland, General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society of Toronto, was advised by letter from this Dept't that the Dept't of the Interior had set apart Section 6, Township 5, Range 7, West of the 1st Meridian, as a site for the above school, being situated in Southern Manitoba as asked for by the Church. The Rev. Gentleman replied in the 2nd ult. that he had recently received another communication from the Rev. John MacDougall, in which a letter was enclosed from the Indian Commissioner for the\n\n[Signature]\n\nSup't Gen'l of Ind Affairs.\nN.W. Territories intimating that\na certain property known as the\nNorquay Homestead, and which\nwas regarded as in every suitable\nway,\nfor the purpose of the proposed\ninstitute, could be obtained for\nabout $3,800. Sutherland\nstated that he was not personally\nacquainted with the exact\nlocation of the land referred to, or\nof Section 6 which had been\nset apart for the school by\nthe Deptt of the Interior, but that,\nin the estimation alike of Mr.\nReed and Mr. Macdonald, the\nNorquay property seemed to be\nregarded as the best and most\nsuitable; and he added that if\nany practicable arrangement\ncould be arrived at whereby the\nNorquay Homestead could be\nsecured, he would be glad to be\ninformed of it.\n\nOn the 16th ult., the\nDeptt notified the Indian Comm.\nfor the N.W. Territories, that Section\n6 above referred to had been\noutside as the site of the industrial institution to be conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church. At the same time a copy of the letter last referred to from the Rev. D. Sutherland was enclosed to the Commissioner, and he was requested to report on the proposition therein stated to have been made by him to procure the Norway Homestead as a site for the school, and to state how it was proposed to pay for the same, as no funds had been provided by Parliament for the purpose.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner, in acknowledging in the 28th ult. the letter to him of the 16th, stated that the proposition to procure the Norway Homestead as a site for the institution was made to him by the Rev. J. McDougall, and that, upon making inquiry, he found that the price asked for the property, including buildings,\nwas $3800; that he then wrote his friend that, while the Norway land appeared to have much to recommend it, he feared that there was no chance of getting the Government to pay cash for it, but that, possibly, if the Methodist Church had a strong preference for it, some such arrangement as was come to in the case of St Paul's School might be made, by which the Church might purchase the desired site and recoup the expenditure by a grant of public land in exchange. He heard nothing more of the matter, however, and so let it drop.\n\nOn the 4th met the Rev. Dr. Sutherland who advised of the statements made by Mr. Reed, and at the same time was informed that no money has been provided for the purchase of land for a site for, or in connection with, the\ninstitution, and that consequently\nthe Dept had no funds at\nits disposal for the purchase of\na Norway Homestead; moreover\nthat there was an abundance\nof public land which could be\nused for such purposes without\nthe expenditure of any money.\nHe was, however, further informed\nthat the Dept would be glad\nto hear from them whether\nthe proposition made by Mr.\nReed to the Rev. Wm. Donaldson,\nthat the Methodist Church\npurchase the Homestead and\ngive it as a site for the school\nin exchange for public lands,\nwould be favorably entertained\nby the Methodist body. He was\nat the same time reminded that\nsection 6, Township 5, Range 7,\nwest of the 100 meridian had\nbeen set aside by the Dept\nof the Interior as a site for the\ninstitution, and that public\nnotice thereof had been given\nin the official Gazette.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6258, file 576-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nOn the 7th inst., the Rev. Dr. Luthersand replied to the letter addressed to him on the 4th inst., that there had been a meeting of the Missionary Committee of the Methodist Church; and that, after consideration of all the correspondence, it was deemed expedient that he should visit Manitoba in the early spring\u2014probably in May\u2014and that, if it met with the Department's approval, the final decision might be deferred until after that date. The object, he stated, of his mission to Manitoba, was to suggest delay in the selection of a site, was in order that he might confer with the Rev. Mr. Longley and others on the subject, and also, if the Department approved, with the Indian Commissioner and Mr. Inspector M. Coll, so that there might be perfect harmony of opinion and action.\namong all persons concerned.\n\nIn conclusion, Mr. Sutherland asked to be informed whether the Deptt approved that course.\n\nOn the 15th inst he was informed in reply that the money voted for the construction of the school buildings would lapse on the 30th June next, and that he would, therefore, see the necessity of expeditious being used in the final determination of the site, in order that the work of construction might be commenced at as early a date in the spring as practicable.\n\nThat before tenders could be invited for the erection of the buildings, it would be necessary that the site should be known and declared to intending tenderers, and tenders would have to be fully advertised for, received and adjudicated upon before the contract could be awarded.\n\nIn replying to this\nletter on the 20th inst., the Rev. Gurney acknowledged the force of the reasons adduced for expedition being used in the final determination of the site for the school, but stated that, while he wished like the work to go on with all reasonable speed, it was at the same time very important that a site should be selected in all respects suitable, and that even a few weeks delay would be preferable to subsequent disappointment. He further stated that the Rev. Mr. Drayton, the representative of the Methodist body in the North West, lived at too remote a distance from Manitoba to make it practicable for him to give personal attention to the matter; that it seemed impossible for him (Dr. Sutherland) to visit that province sooner.\nthan the latter part of April; and that, therefore, if it was essential to make the selection sooner, it would have to be done by the Dept through its officers. With respect to the Norway Homestead, Mr. Sutherland added that, if that property were regarded as specially suitable, it might be practicable to come to an arrangement similar to that suggested in a previous letter from the Dept., i.e., that the land might be purchased by the Missionary Society, they to receive in lieu thereof equal value in public lands, the buildings on the property to be purchased by the Government and utilized as far as they go for the purposes of the institution, and the value of both land and buildings to be estimated by \"the agent of the government at Winnipeg.\" In conclusion,\nwith the proposed delay in the selection of the site and subsequent construction of the buildings, Mr. Rutherford asks whether it would be practicable to have the amount, \"or a larger sum, which would be much better,\" re-voiced for the ensuing year, and, if not, he states, the only course will be for the Government to decide the question of the site forthwith and proceed with the work; but he concludes that, if an opportunity can be conveniently given for a little further investigation, it would be preferable.\n\nThe undersigned begs to report that he sees no objection to the sum appropriated by Parliament for this school being included as a re-voice in the Estimates for 1891-92, with such additional appropriation as it may be considered necessary to make.\nIn connection with the construction of the building, maintenance etc., of the institution when established... The Dept. of course is not responsible for the delay, inasmuch as it has, in accordance with the desire of the Methodist Church as previously expressed through its General Secretary, set apart a site in Southern Manitoba for the institution, and the delay in the final appropriation of the land for the purpose will, if granted, be made at the request of the Methodist body.\n\nA.

School in Manitoba being selected even if a few weeks delay in the selection should be occasioned, I suggest whether the sum appropriated by Parliament for the construction of the buildings might not be placed in the Estimates for the ensuing year as a re-vote, thus raising the question of the possibility of an arrangement similar to that suggested in my letter of the 4th...\nult, i.e., that the land might be purchased by the missionary Soc., they to receive in land lieu thereof equal value in public lands in some other part of the country; the buildings to be purchased by the Gov't utilized as far as they wd. go further purposes of the institution, &c. to property be required regarded as especially suitable for the same, I beg to inform you that, having brought all the facts in connection with the site for the proposed Institute and the construction of School before the S.B. of P.A. for consideration, I am directed by him to state that he sees no objection to include the amt voted by Parliament for this purpose in the estimates.\nfor next year as a\nre-vote; quick regard\nto the site, the S.G.\nis of opinion that the\nNorquay Homestead should\nnot be thought of as\nsuch, as it will not\nlead to complications.\nI have accordingly\nincluded in the Estimates,\nproposed to be submitted\nto Parliament the\nappropriation noted for\nits Industrial School\nreferred to as a re-vote\nof the unit, but will\nbe available for\nexpenditure after the\n30th June next.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Dewdney,\nOttawa.\nMay 5th,\n\nMy Dear Rowell,\n\nWith reference to your note of yesterday, enclosing a letter from the Rev. F. M. Finn, I may say that the question of locating a site for the proposed new Industrial School under the auspices of the Methodist Church will be left pretty much to the Church authorities. In a letter received from the Rev. Dr. Sutherland, dated the 10th of April, he says\u2014\"I expect to be in Winnipeg about the 30th of the present month, and will be pleased to cooperate in any way in my power with the Agents of the Government in a final selection of a site and commencement of the work.\"\n\nI think it would be well if Mr. Finn communicated\nBrandon, Man.

It being understood that the city of Brandon is to be reimbursed for its outlay by being granted Government lands equal in value or acreage which it is proposed to be granted for a site for such school.\"\n\nCertified Correct,\n\n(sgd) John C.

At a mass meeting held last evening the following motions were put and unanimously carried. Moved by Wm. McMillan seconded by Wm. Hunt that this meeting take immediate steps to provide a site for said school as suggested by Hayter Reed Esq. in his memorandum to Mr McMillan.\n\nMoved by Jas. Kines seconded by R. F. Lyons that Messrs Thos. Huckell, A. McKenzie, Wm. McMillan, Wm. Dickie and the members of the village Council be a committee to carry out the intentions of the meeting.\n\nAt a meeting of that Committee this morning it was moved by A. McKenzie seconded by Wm. McMillan and unanimously resolved that this Committee guarantee the amount of 320 acres of land as suggested by Mr Reed in his Memo. to Mr McMillan.\n\nMr Lyons and Mr Lowes will sell. Mr Lyon's farm will be purchased if possible the school section otherwise Mr Lowe's farm, that is if it is decided to locate the school here.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(sgd) Wm. Dickie\n\nSecy.\nOFFICE OF THE\nIndian Commissioner,\n\nNORTH-WEST TERRITORIES\n\nRegina, 9th June, 1881\n\nSir,\n\nBy direction of the Commissioner I have the honour to refer to your letter of 20th April last, and prior correspondence relative to the selection of a site for the proposed Methodist Industrial School in Manitoba, and to transmit herewith,\n\n1st. A copy of a communication from Mr. John Kerr, Clerk of the City of Brandon, in which he informs the Rev. Mr. Woodsworth that the City Council agrees to provide a suitable site in or near Brandon, and accept in exchange Government lands equal in value or area.\n\n2nd. Copy of letter to the Commissioner in which Mr. Wm. Dickie of Carberry states the action taken by the People of Carberry, in the matter of providing a site, should it be determined to locate the school there.\n\nWith regard to these two offers the Commissioner desires me to state that although the Carberry site is a fine one, yet everything considered he prefers the one at\n\nThe Deputy of the\nSupt. Gen'l of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nat Brandon, which is also the choice of the Rev. Dr. Sutherland, after a personal inspection.\n\nIn recommending the Brandon site the Commissioner desires me to point out that the half section adjoins the Experimental Farm, which he considers is likely to afford advantages to the pupils in the way of instruction and of employment for some of them, as they become advanced.\n\nHe thinks moreover that heretofore in the location of such schools, we have been inclined to go somewhat too far away from the line of traffic, and that much more interest might be taken by the public generally, and the Church concerned, in particular, in a school kept as prominently before the public eye, as would be the case, were the site now recommended adopted.\n\nThe terms of purchase offered, he considers very easy, and is under the impression that the lands would be taken in exchange where already set apart by Order-in-Council (vide Department's letter 16th February last) if so desired.\n\nThere was at one time an inclination in the Commissioner's mind to prefer a site further South, because he felt a doubt as to whether parents would consent to sending their children, for whose benefit the school is proposed to be erected and maintained, to so great a distance, but he has since come to the opinion that this will not offer any serious difficulty.\n\nRev. J. McDougall at one time spoke of the Norquay Homestead, or of part of the Indian Reserve, thrown open near\nnear Selkirk.\n\nFrom copy of correspondence between Department and Rev. Dr. Sutherland, sent to Commissioner by Department, it is seen that the idea of the Norquay Homestead has been dismissed.\n\nWith regard to the site near Selkirk, the Commissioner, in the course of enquiries, ascertained that if the Institution were located there, the people of West Selkirk would contribute a bonus in lands towards a site, but he considers the situation open to grave objection, first on account of its proximity to an Indian Reserve, second, because of its nearness to the existing school at St. Paul's.\n\nWith regard to the building for the proposed school, the commissioner would recommend that with some minor alterations, that at St. Paul's be copied. The money provided, and as stated by Department to Dr. Sutherland, to be devoted in estimates for the approaching fiscal year, would be insufficient, and the Commissioner suggests that the money for the second building at Red Deer, might be diverted, for the present, from that purpose, and applied on the school now under consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor Commissioner.\nMr. Burgess, Esq.,\nD.M. of the Interior\n\nSECY'S BRANCH,\nJUN 17 1891\nWRITTEN\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 29th January last, informing me that Sec. 6, in Tp. 5, R. 7, West 1st Dist., was available and be reserved for Ind. School purposes that an O.C. was passed confirming the Res., &c., likewise to the O.C. of the 7th Sect., making the reservation of the land above referred to for a site for an Ind. Industrial School, I beg now to inform you that this Dept. is advised that the Methodist Church authorities under whose auspices the school proposed to be established...\nFarm, the pupils in attendance at the Industrial School will be afforded advantages in the way of instruction, &c., employment for some of them so they become advanced.\n\nThe Dept. is also desirous of adopting the system, in connection with as many of its industrial schools as possible, the system of apprenticing the male pupils to artisans who carry on their business in white centres of population, & therefore, the prospect of such institutions to cities or towns is considered to be a matter of importance.\n\nWill you be good enough to inform me whether the Dept. will\nthereon was to be conducted has, with the concurrence of the third Court for the N.W.T., concluded that a better site for the above institution can be obtained in the vicinity of Brandon, so that the corporation of that city has offered to provide such site, which, it is understood, will consist of one half section of land adjoining the Experimental Farm, provided that said lands be given thereunder exchange, \"equal in value or more,\" for the site which they offer.\n\nThe third Court reports that he has personally inspected the proposed site at Brandon, as has also the Rev. Dr. Hutterland as representative to Methodist Church, that it is in every way a desirable site for the school, & that, as it adjoins the Experimental...\na view to facilitating\nthe acceptance by this\nDept of the offer of the\ncorporation of Brandon\nof the site, as proposed,\nfor the institution,\nwe agree to assign\nlands to that corporation\n\"equal in value or\naverage\" to the said\nsite.\n\nThe deed copy for the\nN.W.T. States shall be handed,\nthe impression that the lands set\napart by Act of the 7th Assembly last\nyear for this school would be transferred\nto the Municipality of Brandon for\nthis school site offered this Dept\nby it.\nSir:-\n\nDuring the past few days I have made, in company with the Revd. J. Woodsworth, a careful examination of certain proposed sites for an Indian Institute at Carberry and Brandon. Taking into account all the circumstances we have come to the conclusion that the site offered by the Corporation of Brandon, adjoining the experimental farm on the West, is the most suitable, and I would therefore request, on behalf of the Methodist Church, that the proposed institute be located there. The site consists of a half section, part of which has been, for some years under cultivation. There is good variety of soil, and several springs of water issuing from the hillside can easily be utilized for the purposes of the Institution.\n\nI have been given to understand that the present proprietor reserves the growing crops, but in view of the delay that has already occurred, and the importance of proceeding promptly with the work, I would suggest the propriety of negotiating with Mr Stewart for the purchase of the crops as improvements. If this is done we could almost immediately put a competent Farmer in charge, and by next Autumn quite a supply of breadstuffs would be available for the purposes of the Institution, with but little expenditure beyond the cost of seed and planting.\n\nThe\nThe present house could be quickly fitted for the occupancy of the Farm Instructor, and the present barn would shelter a few head of stock till a better one could be built. In this connection I would suggest a spot nearly in line with Mr Stewart's house, but a few hundred yards farther west, as a suitable site for the Institute.\n\nWe will be ready, at almost any time to nominate a principal, and I very much desire that we may be allowed a choice in regard to some, at least, of the Employees.\n\nOur aim will be to nominate only persons who are thoroughly competent in their respective departments, and whose moral influence will be of the best. The importance of this latter element you will readily appreciate.\n\nIn view of the prominent site to be occupied by the Institute, in full view of Brandon and the C. P. Railway, immediately adjoining the experimental farm, and near the branch asylum, and other public buildings, I feel sure you will see the necessity for making it a model alike in its architecture and equipment. This done, I can assure you we will do our best to make it a model in regard to management and results. At the beginning it should be large enough to accommodate at least one hundred children, with provision for enlargement as circumstances require.\n\nTouching the future relation of the Institute to the Government on the one hand, and the Church on the other, I think that for the first two or three years, which will be the construction period, the entire cost of maintenance should be provided by the Government. When the buildings are\nare fully completed, necessary stock and implements provided, and the farm put in a position to raise a part, at least, of the needed supplies, we will be ready to assume responsibility for maintenance on the basis of a per capita grant. At the present stage we could hardly do this.\n\nHoping that this important enterprise will now be pushed forward to completion,\n\nI have etc,\n\n(sgd) A. Sutherland\n\nGenl.

D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAfter examination of the files and file 341,392 of the Department of the Interior, I find the position to be as follows:\u2014 By C. C. 7th February, 1861, Section 5 Township 5, Range 7, west of the first meridian was set apart for the purpose of an Industrial school. The section was found to be unsuitable and the town of Brandon desired the industrial school there. Accordingly the town agree to acquire in the name of Her Majesty and pay for part half, 30-10-10 W.1st M., the last mentioned property was so acquired and now forms the site of the Industrial school. Certain documents of title were forwarded to the Department; but the Department of the Interior objected to issue a patent to the town of Brandon for the lands first mentioned, to be given in exchange for the lands last mentioned until a certificate of title under the Real Property Act of Manitoba issued to the Crown in respect of the last mentioned land. The documents of title were then submitted to the Department of Justice; and after a fresh investigation of title by the Agent of that Department the Deputy Minister of Justice reported on 7th February, 1903, that the title was then clear in Her Majesty.\n\nIt is now intended to transfer the Town of Brandon.\n\nAs the land purchased by the Crown is given in exchange for Dominion lands it becomes vested in the Crown as Dominion lands; and it is primarily a question for the Depart...\ndepartment of the Interior as to whether the title is satisfactory. So far as this Department is concerned the report of the Minister of Justice will, I take it, be accepted.\n\nAt present the first described lands are held by this Department only under an O.C. in accordance with Section 31 of the Dominion Lands Act. The lands given in exchange for the lands so held will be public lands to be held by this Department upon the same terms as those for which they are given in exchange. Consequently an O.C. under Section 31 will be necessary revoking the former order in council and setting aside East half, 28-10-19 W. 1st M., for an Industrial school site.\n\nI recommend that a copy of this memorandum be forwarded to the Department of the Interior for the use of the Law Clerk of that Department; and that the Department of the Interior files be returned therewith; and that Department be informed that the documents of title on file in this Department will be produced with a copy of the opinion of the Deputy Minister of Justice, if required.\n\nLaw Clerk.\nDepartment of the Interior,\n\nOttawa, 12th July, 1900.\n\nReferring to Mr. Rimmer's memorandum of the 6th ultimo, with regard to the Brandon Industrial School Site, I am directed to request you to forward to this Department, to be retained of record here, the title deeds referred to in the last paragraph of that memorandum, including the certificate of title in favour of Her Majesty, Queen Victoria, and any certificates or abstracts of title of Section 6, Township 5, Range 7, West of the 1st Meridian, now in the Department of Indian Affairs, as this land will be dealt with by this Department and the muniments of the Crown's title should, therefore, be here and not in the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nI am also to request you to forward the letter of the Deputy Minister of Justice containing his opinion as to the title of the Crown to such land, or a copy of it.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Brier\nDepartment of Indian Affairs:\nOTTAWA, 2nd December, 1902:\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nThe Principal of the Brandon Industrial School asks that the West half-section adjoining the school, which is situated on the East \u00bd Section 28, Township 10, Range 19, West of the 1st Meridian, may be purchased for the use of the school. No application has been received from Dr Sutherland for the purchase of this lot, although the Principal states that it is the desire of the General Board of Missions that the Department should acquire it for the school.\n\nThe land now attached to the school comprises 320 acres, 220 of which are said to be fit for cultivation and the balance suited for grazing land. The report of the Principal for the year ended 30th June last shows that 126 acres were under crop, including a garden of 5 acres.\n\nThe lot which the Principal wishes the Department to purchase is held at $30.00 an acre and would cost the Department $9600.00\n\nThe present enrollment at this school is: 104 pupils, -54 boys and 60 girls, nearly all of whom come from the neighborhood of Lake Winnipeg, and if they return to their reserves, they will have very little opportunity of following farming for a living. The additional land would no doubt help the school financially and as a training in farming, cattle raising and dairying for the pupils, but as is remarked in a clipping from the Winnipeg Free Press, of Oct. 2nd, which contained the impressions gathered by visitors of the General Board of Missions to the Brandon Industrial School, \"to learn farming will be 'Largely a loss of time if one is to live where there is no land that can be cultivated' (Clipping turned out).\nOTTAWA, 6th December, 1902\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ulto., relative to the application for the purchase by the Department of the West half-section of land adjoining the Brandon Industrial school for school purposes.

Sutherland\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 18th December, 1902:\n\nThe Superintendent General:-\n\nDr Sutherland's telegram hereunder is the first intimation we have had that there was an option held on the property, although the Department was advised by Mr Ferrier, the Principal of the Brandon School, that the East \u00bd of Section 28, Twp. 10, Rge. 19, West of the 1st Meridian, which is the land in question, was held at $30.00 per acre, or $9600.00 in all.\n\nThe land now attached to the school comprises 320 acres, of which 220 are fit for cultivation and the balance suitable for grazing. The Principal's report for the year ended 30th June last, shows that 126 acres were under crop, including a garden of 5 acres.\n\nThe Department now provides for 100 pupils at this school at a per capita rate of $120.00 and this grant of $12,000.00 with $106.79 from the Methodist Missionary Society was sufficient to meet the total expenditure for the year.\n\nThe present enrollment is 104, -- 54 boys and 60 girls.\n\nThe school could accommodate 125 pupils and the necessary staff.\n\nShould this additional land be secured, it would evidently mean more work unless there is a corresponding increase in numbers and accommodation.\n\nIn view of the foregoing facts, I am doubtful if the expenditure of the amount asked for is justifiable.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Clifford Sifton, dated 19th December, 1902.\n\n\"I venture to trespass upon your time long enough to state a few facts respecting the possible purchase of an additional half section of land adjoining the Indian Industrial Institute farm at Brandon, which was referred to in my telegram yesterday. When visiting the Institute about the end of September last, the Principal, Mr. Ferrier, pointed out what a great advantage it would be to the school if the adjoining half section could be secured; and we drove over to the property that I might know just its character and position with regard to the Institute farm. The question was also brought before the Board of Missions in Brandon at the same time, and they all seemed to be of opinion that the acquisition of this land was very desirable for a two-fold reason. First, it would enable the Principal to provide, if possible, for all the needs of the Institute without applying to the Government for anything but the per capita grant; and second, to afford larger...\"\nlarger scope for the training of the Indian boys.\n\nPossibly you are aware that Mr. Ferrier is doing his best to train the Indian lads to be competent farm servants, and to find remunerative employment for them when their time is out at the Institute.\n\n\"As the present Institute farm, buildings, etc., is the property of the Department, it was deemed impracticable for the Missionary Society to be the purchaser of the additional half section, as a divided ownership of the Institute farm would be a very awkward arrangement.\n\n\"Your telegram of yesterday intimating that the Commissioner would be instructed to look into the matter and report, was duly received, and I am glad that this step has been taken. I sincerely hope that it may be possible for you to consider this matter favourably, and I am sure that the Institute, especially while under the control of Mr. Ferrier, will do credit to the Department, and those concerned in its management.\"\nOttawa, 20th December, 1902.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nThe attached extract from a letter from the Rev. A. Sutherland refers to the proposed purchase of additional land adjoining the Indian School at Brandon. Please send it on to the Commissioner, so that he may have the benefit of the information therein contained when making his report upon the application.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I now address you for the purpose of drawing your attention to the advisability, or necessity of the Department purchasing the west half of this section of land, 25.10.17, west of the 1st m.\n\nMr. Jory the present owner offered last fall for $9600. He now intimates that he will take $8000. It is not likely that it will ever be on the market for a less amount.\n\nThere is no other half section available that would be anything near the value that this half would prove to be for the work of this Institution, and we need it both for agriculture and pasture.\n\nWe have asked for the number of pupils to be raised from 100 to 125. This request has been made for two years, and is one of the items in the estimates for the coming year. The addition to the number of pupils ought to be allowed if the Institution is to be managed in a first class manner and good honest wages paid for good honest work and a fair\nMarket price paid for food and other goods. This request has been made and is likely to continue with his estimate until it is known how much is worth the purchase of land for the purpose of making the following proposition.\n\nIf the Department will purchase this half section and raise the number of pupils to 125, the management will ask for no further grants for stock, implements, material for repair to buildings, fencing, painting and plumbing. We have a grant this year for such purposes of $250. In our estimate for the coming year we have asked for $60. Made up as follows:\n\nRepair and plumbing for main building $400\n40 barrels of cement for stable floor $160\nRepairs to the carpenter's house $30\n\nOf the above two-fold request if from these three items could be ruled out of the present estimate before the Department.\n\nThis proposition will practically mean the saving of about $1000 a year. In other words I would rather have this plan fail than $1000 per year which will mean to the Department at the end of ten years a half section of land as an asset instead of $1000 in repair.\n\nYour decision at your earliest convenience will greatly help. I have the honor to remain your obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6258, file 576-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letters of the 19th and 29th December ultimo, the latter covering copy of extracts from a letter from Rev. Dr. Sutherland to the Minister respecting the possible purchase by the Department of an additional half-section of land adjoining the Indian industrial school at Brandon. You asked me to look into the matter and report at my earliest convenience.\n\nMy reply has been delayed in the hope that I might be able to visit Brandon School next week after I was through with the December returns, and discuss the whole question with the Principal of the institution. The Deputy's telegram of yesterday afternoon, however, calls for an immediate report and I respond because it is improbable that a visit to the school would alter my views on the subject.\n\nRev. Dr. Sutherland gives a two-fold reason why the acquisition of this land by the School is very desirable. His first reason is that it would enable the Principal to provide, if possible, for all the needs of the Institute without applying to the Government for anything but the per capita grant. I do not think the proposed purchase would accomplish so much. Repairs and improvements to all Industrial School\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSchool establishments cost a large amount, and the Principal could not provide for them out of the sale of the surplus products of the farm. It might enable him to purchase the necessary implements, machinery and stock; but it appears clear to me that the main object of the application for this land is that its acquisition would be a means of supplementing the per capita grant. If this grant is insufficient let the Department increase it, but I do not think it should depart from its present policy of providing the Industrial Schools with enough land to afford scope for the training of the Indian boy pupils in mixed farming, and incidentally supplying the schools with such vegetables, milk, butter, feed and a portion of the meats they require. If we go beyond that we enter upon doubtful ground. Rev. Mr. Ferrier, the present Principal of the Brandon School, is an excellent manager, and I have every confidence that he could make a large farm contribute to the finances of the institution; but no man is a permanency in any situation; he may be called to other duties, and his successor may fail to make valuable land yield an adequate return.\n\nIn regard to Rev. Dr. Sutherland's second reason for applying to the Department to purchase the half-section of land named at $30.00 per acre\u2014in all $9600.00\u2014I would not object to the expenditure if it was absolutely necessary to obtain land for the school to afford a fair scope for training Indian pupils; but, as you point out the Brandon School has already 320 acres of land, 220 of which are fit for cultivation, it appears to me that this quantity is sufficient to allow ample opportunity for training in mixed farming, when it is considered that a portion of the boys' time must also be devoted to class work.\n\nFurther\nFurther, if the Brandon School obtain additional land at a cost of nearly $10,000, other Industrial Schools that are urging the Department to grant them more land cannot very well, in equity, be altogether refused, as scarcely any other school is provided with such a quantity of land fit for cultivation as Brandon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 5th February, 1903\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nWith further reference to the application made by Rev. Dr Sutherland for the purchase of an additional half-section of land adjoining the Industrial school at Brandon, I beg to say that a report has been received from the Indian Commissioner on this subject from which you will see that he is not in favor of this purchase as he considers they have enough land attached to the school to afford scope for training the pupils in mixed farming, and that if the school were provided with this half-section it would be used as a precedent by other schools for requests for additional farming lands.\n\nA letter has been received from the Principal of the school since the Commissioner was asked for his report in which he proposes to forego the annual grants for equipment and repairs, provided the Department will purchase the land. I do not see that this should be any inducement to the Department to buy this property, as it is to its interest to see that the buildings are maintained in a proper state of repair. Additional land would most likely necessitate the over-working of the pupils and the Commissioner says they have enough for the needs of the school.\n\nMr Ferrier also asks that the number of pupils be raised from 100 to 125. The school has accommodation for the latter number and if it were allowed...\nallowed this increase, it would assist them financially as the same staff would suffice and the only expense would be the added cost of maintenance.\n\nThe Commissioner was not asked to report on the application for an increase in the number of pupils.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

On behalf of the Methodist Church I have made a proposition which Mr. Macallan is to present to the Department. When it comes before you be kind enough to give it your best thought and attention. The land will always be a valuable asset and the chances are that it will always be increasing in value. So in the end the Department cannot lose anything in the present delay.

A.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA, 6th December, 1904\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nTwo years ago the question of purchasing additional land adjoining the Industrial school at Brandon was brought before the Department by Rev. Dr. Sutherland. After the question had been fully gone into, it was decided that the Department did not see its way clear to acquire the land.\n\nThis matter was again brought to the notice of the Department by Mr. Inspector Marlatt last spring who submitted a proposition from the Principal of the school to the effect that if the Department would pay a per capita grant of $120.00 for 125 pupils and add the West \u00bc of Section 28, Twp. 10, Rge. 19, West of the 1st Meridian to the land they already hold, the Methodist Church would be willing to pay all expense of management and maintenance, except material required for new buildings which would cost $500.00 and over. The Principal apparently speaks with the authority of the Methodist Missionary Society.\n\nWith regard to this proposition I may say that the Department is now paying for 115 pupils at $120.00 per capita, being an increase of 15 for the current year. They have accommodation for 125 at the school and seem to have no difficulty in keeping up the enrollment. This school and the one at Qu'Appelle are apparently the only ones that are able to secure their full quota of pupils, and if they are allowed 10 more, no doubt they will be able to obtain...\nthem.\n\nAll the officials of the Department who have visited it, report most favorably of the management of this school and in connection with the application for additional land, which has already been refused, I beg to refer you to my memorandum of 5th Feb., 1903 and the Commissioner's letter of the 31st Jan. of that year, which are turned out on this file.\n\nIf the Department should now entertain the proposition to purchase this land, it would need to provide about $10,000.00 to pay for it. Two years ago it was held at $30.00 an acre, which would bring the cost up to $9,600.00, without incidental expenses.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Acting on the instructions contained in your letter, I visited Brandon on the 29th Ult. and went thoroughly into the matter.\n\nThe road in question runs east and west through the experimental farm, and through the school lands and continues in a westerly direction.\n\nI understand this road was given by the Government, through the experimental farm, to the Corporation of the City of Brandon, and through the School lands to the Municipality of Cornwallis, in lieu of the sectional roads to the north and south, running in the same direction, which, owing to the formation of the country, could only be opened at a very considerable cost. The sectional road allowance to the south of the Farm,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\ncrosses the Assiniboine River several times, which makes it impractical as a road. The Municipality have had to buy the continuation of the road west of the school property.\n\nThe road is now a public highway, much travelled, but not used to any extent by the school as they have an outlet through the Experimental Farm. The road in its passage through the Experimental Farm is kept in condition by the farm people, not as a matter of right, but because they desire a better road than the City could give them. For this reason they keep it in repair and it is a beautiful piece of highway.\n\nI drove over the road through the School Lands. It is not in bad condition. Two thirds of it has been gravelled and graded, the balance is on the natural prairie. It is not nearly as good as the portion passing through the Experimental Farm, but I would consider it a fair road as it is.\n\nTo sum up; the road as I understand it is under the control of the Municipality and they are responsible for its condition. The Department did them a very kind action in giving them the road, as it cuts the farm in two, and runs through the best part of the arable lands.\n\nNo doubt the road could be much improved by grading and graveling, but the Municipality have no claim on the Department for the cost.\n\nMy recommendation is that as the School pays no taxes, and does no statute labor, that the Municipality be given a grant of $100.00, which would be about equal to one year's assessment. This could be continued from year to year if the Department think it advisable.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 25th July, 1905\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nMr Inspector Marlatt has reported on the application received from the Municipality of Cornwallis for a grant for the grading and levelling of a road through the Brandon Industrial school farm, the cost of which is estimated at $500.00.

He informed me that he had referred the matter again and would give it his consideration on his return to Ottawa which would be about July 18th.\n\nA few words of appreciation may not be out of place.\n\nFor a number of years we have rented 50 acres from Mr.\nThe Experimental Farm.

This is owned by a Scotch company and the whole of it can be purchased for $25 per acre. This is more than we require but the company will not sell a portion of it. If the Department purchase the whole see I do not think that we would have difficulty in selling the half. If this mode of procedure is not satisfactory arrangements can be made whereby a half of the section can be\nobtained for $5 per acre.\n\nThis land is not nearly so valuable as the land in the valley. But at the present prices of farm land it is worth the above.\n\nTrusting this will receive the favorable consideration of Mr. Oliver and yourself,\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. Ferrier\nOttawa June 28, 1911.\n\nMemorandum\n\nMr Pedley. Re Purchase of Land for Brandon Industrial School.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier, Principal of the Brandon Industrial School, has made application to the Superintendent General requesting the Department to purchase a quantity of land which he states is very much needed by the school for farming purposes.\n\nThe land at present connected with the school comprises 320 acres, being the east \u00bd of Section 28, Township 10, Range 19 west of the first meridian. 220 acres of this is excellent land and is under crop, the balance is used for buildings and playgrounds and for pasture.\n\nThe only land at present available, is the section adjoining the present school land, on the north. It is owned by a Scotch company who will sell the whole section (640 acres) en bloc at $25.00 per acre, but will not sell half or a part. The amount necessary to purchase the whole section at the price asked, is $16,000.00.\n\nDuring\nDuring my visit to Brandon last summer I went thoroughly over the school land in company with Mr Ferrier and recognized that it would be necessary before long to acquire more land for this school, especially for pasturage purposes. A fifty acre lot which they have had rented from the Experimental farm for the past six years has now been taken over by the farm. They have a herd of cattle for which it is necessary that arrangements be made to provide pasturage.\n\nIf it is decided to purchase this section, only one half (320 acres) will be required for the use of the school and the balance could be disposed of, or if held for a time would no doubt increase in value. It would not be difficult to find sale for the half section not required.\n\nThere are no funds specially provided in the current year's school appropriation for this purchase, but if it is decided to acquire more land for this school, some arrangement could possibly be made to provide the money required.\n\nWe will undoubtedly have to maintain this school, and as it is one of the best training schools we have, I think we should make it thoroughly efficient.\nMunicipality of Cornwallis\n\nBrandon, Manitoba.\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Honorable\nThe Minister Indian Affairs\n\n[Signature]\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThis Municipality has expended $500 on the road between the Indian School farm (E.S.T. 17) and the Government Experimental Farm (E.S.T. 10).

It is the very best land in the valley, and upon which we have spent a vast amount of labor and expense in bringing it into its present state of cultivation; one acre of this land is worth more to the school for the purpose we need it than ten acres of the land on the hill to the north.

While you so kindly gave authority to purchase for the school, before any action is taken, I trust the interests of this Institute, and its management will be considered. If necessary, I can furnish you all the facts from the standpoint of the Institute.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Ferrier.\nThe Secretary Department\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe section of land recently purchased by the Department for the use of this Institute is without fencing of any kind. Before we can use it, it will need a fence. To divide it into three equal fields, we need to place a fence all around, which will require 6 miles of fence.\n\nA wire fence or cedar posts as follows can be purchased for $250 per mile, and it may be in a condition of that size a little less.\n\nCedar posts: 8 strand wire, 4\" inches high all #9 hard steel wire.\n\nThe poles to be not less than 5' in diameter, and up to 6' in.\n\nThe total cost about $15-00.\n\nThis should be built this fall, authority for the same will greatly please.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nT.

Ferrier,\nPrincipal,\nBrandon Industrial School,\nBrandon, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to yours of September 26th, re the fencing of the section of land recently purchased by the Department for the use of the Brandon Industrial School.\n\nNow that the section has been purchased, it will be better to fence the whole of it since by so doing the value will be increased, and the chances of selling it should the Department wish to dispose of one-half of it, will be greater than in its present condition. It may be said that if it is fenced and worked as the management are planning to work it, it will become more valuable the longer we work it, and thus easier of sale.\n\nI may also say that without the fence, it is absolutely useless for school purposes, for there is nothing we can do with it except herd our cattle upon it. This would require the attention of herd boys day and night in order to keep them from our neighbor's crop.\n\nI have been making further enquiries re the cost of fencing, and I find that it will take about $300.00 a mile. One tender I received was as high as $350.00 per mile. This, I think, was beyond the real value.\n\nI would like to know at the earliest possible date so that we might put up a part of this fence this Fall before the frost enters the ground; and it is the best time of the year to secure labor for that purpose.\n\nTrusting to have a favorable reply,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nTF-VS\n\nSecretary\nof the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSec.

We understand that the vendors are to pay three-fourths of this year's taxes, which amount to $98.69. Three-fourths of this amount will be $74.37, the share to be paid by the vendors. The difference therefore, between the interest to be paid by the purchasers, and the share of taxes to be borne by the vendors, would amount to $6.87.\n\nIf you agree with these figures, and will send us a cheque for this amount, this will enable us to finally close the matter out.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenderson & Matheson\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is the practice of other Departments in all purchases of land for public purposes to have an Order-in-Council passed authorizing the purchase and fixing the price. I should like to know if an Order-in-Council has been passed in this instance. The voucher for the payment does not bear any certificate that the price is according to contract or that the price is fair and just. I am of opinion that there should be an Order-in-Council authorizing the purchase and fixing the price.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAuditor General.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nSchools.\n\nHas O.C. been\n\n[signature]\nOttawa, January 24, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant in reference to the purchase of land for public purposes.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your opinion as expressed in the closing sentence of your letter is noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. Fraser, Esq.,\nAuditor General,\nOttawa.\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSince this Institution was opened in 1895, those who have died have been buried at the lower end of the farm close to the Assiniboine River. The City purposes negotiating with the Department for a portion of that land to be used as a Park. The time has come when we should cease burying any more in that plot of land, for the following reasons:\n\nIt is close to the Banks of the Assiniboine River, from which the City supply of water is taken, and above the intake of that water supply. The soil is perfectly dry and hard, with no sign of spring formation, and I do not for one moment think that any seepage has occurred from this burying plot to contaminate the water of the river in any degree. About two weeks ago I requested the civil engineer and the health inspector of the City of Brandon to come over and interview me regarding the matter. We discussed the situation, and came to the conclusion that in-as-much as the general public might have an opportunity in the future of observing this burying ground from a public park, some sentiment might arise regarding the matter, therefore I believe that it is unwise to continue burying in that plot of land.\nWe have now a section of land to the North. I have gone over this this morning for the purpose of locating a suitable and proper site for a burial plot, believing that we will have to use it in the near future for three pupils whom I have mentioned in another communication. I would like the consent of the Department to the changing of the burying ground to this new site, and also the authority of the Department to fence it properly.\n\nMy own thought for a fence would be a beautiful picket fence painted white, with properly dressed and finished cedar posts. The site I propose would be 150 feet by 75 feet. The exact cost of the fence I have not figured out, but will if the Department consents to the changing and the fencing of the plot.\n\nI would also suggest the advisability of placing in the centre of the plot a plain stone monument with four smooth sides upon which might be chiseled the name and date of death of every child buried therein.\n\nThe Department's views upon this matter will be appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 20, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo in reference to the location of the new burial ground on the farm in connection with the Brandon Industrial School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department would like to know definitely where you propose to locate this burial ground and the area that will be required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev.

You will see at the south west corner the location of the old graveyard close by the River. You will also notice at the east side and about the centre of our permanent pasture field the proposed location for the new burying ground. We propose taking about an acre and a half or two acres which is surrounded on the three sides by a nice natural grove. The land is of a very gravelly nature and quite dry. There is a ravine between it and the water flow that is indicated through the pasture, so that there is no possibility of any connection by natural drainage from the graveyard to the water supply of the pasture. It is a nice cosy spot amid one of the natural bluffs, of which we have quite a number throughout this pasture field.\n\nTrusting this will make the matter clear,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, August 2, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo enclosing a plan showing the location of the proposed new burying ground to be used in connection with the Brandon Industrial School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this location is approved. You may, therefore, submit an estimate of the cost, with a full description, of a suitable fence to enclose the lot 75 by 150 feet.

Marlatt the Indian Commissioner was authorized to inform the Secretary Treasurer of the Municipality that this Department would on the receipt of proper vouchers expend the sum of $100.00 in repairing the road. This expenditure does not appear to have been made.\n\nI have consulted Mr. Scott in this matter; he says there are funds available to a reasonable extent, that is, about $300.00 or $400.00. There appears to be no doubt that the expenditure is a legitimate one, especially in view of the fact that no taxes are paid on account of\nthese lands. I beg to recommend that the Rev. T.

I have to request you to make an examination of the said road with the view of ascertaining the repairs that may be necessary and to have these attended to at a cost not to exceed about $200.00.\n\nThe work may be done by days labour; any materials required should be purchased and vouchers returned in duplicate together with pay-rolls to the Department; the whole in careful detail in order that it may be readily audited. If it is now too late to carry out these repairs this season please take care to have them done at the earliest date in the spring at which they may be advantageously undertaken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev.

The road needs grading, and then graveling. We could cover the surface with gravel at this season of the year but it would not be satisfactory, and to some extent would be just a waste of the money.

My own thought is that the entire amount should be invested in hauling gravel which is within a quarter of a mile of the road. I think probably we should have between three and four hundred cubic yards placed on the road for that amount of money.

Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nReplying to yours of July 26th, I submit the following report re the work on the hill and the road between this and the Experimental Farm.\n\nThe City Council had their City Engineer, Mr. Speakman, survey the hill and road, and Mr. Smith, the City Foreman of Public Works oversee the execution of the work. From the entrance to the Indian School Farm to the top of the grade is about 1500 feet. This has been cut down and filled up to a uniform grade of about 7\u00bd%. The top of the road-bed is 24 feet wide and covered with about 6 inches of gravel. This road-bed has a ditch on each side. The water which gathers from the top of the hill to about half way down is run off into the ravine. The water which gathers from the middle of the hill is well taken care of in 2 glazed-pipe culverts, 18 inches in diameter with a cement wall at each end.\n\nFrom the entrance to the Farms to the south road running East and West through the Farms is 1850 ft. This has been graded with the clay cut out of the hill and is covered with about 6 inches of gravel. This road-bed is 20 ft wide in the top.\n\nThe road-way from the entrance to the Farms has been brushed and ploughed. The work has been well supervised and well executed and is a first class job. In my judgment the money has been well and economically expended.\n\nThe $2000 given by the Government was sufficient to do the work with the exception of putting a coat of gravel on the grade of 1850 ft from the entrance to the Farms to the south road. This required about 600 cu. yards of gravel. To make a complete finish, the Brandon City Council paid $100, the Cornwallis Municipality $100 and the Indian School another $100. So you will see that for the entire work, the cost is $2300. We have now a first-class road.

Stewart, purports to convey the whole of it to His Majesty the King in right of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs; but there is no grant from the Crown to Stewart registered; and, consequently, there is no foundation shown for the title assumed to be granted to the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs. I presume there must be an unregistered grant to Stewart somewhere; but so far as the Registry Office shows, he had no title to make the grant he did make.\n\nAs to the North East quarter of Section 21, title appears to be in W.J. Birchell to all that portion of the quarter section lying to the South of the Assiniboine River, except the Right of Way of the C.P.R., and a strip containing 6.14 acres conveyed by Birchell & Howey to the C.P.R.

That the lease of said lands shall be for a term of Ninety-nine years.\n\n2. That the said lands shall be used by the City of Brandon exclusively for Park Purposes and should they cease to be needed for that purpose, are to revert back to the Industrial School Farm.\n\n3. That during the Summer Season the Park shall be given proper police patrol with specific instructions for the protection of the Indian Girls.\n\n4. That the right of the Indian Boys bathing in the lake during the Summer and the pupils skating on same during the Winter, be reserved.\n\n5. That a sufficient portion of Lake Percy shall be retained by the School for watering their horses and cattle.\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nEnclosed you will find a cheque for $6,000.00, from the city of Brandon, also a map showing the exact portion of land that is to be leased for ninety-nine years. I am also sending a copy of certain provisions that we wish incorporated in the lease.\n\nThis deal was initiated in 1913. The General Board of Missions agreed to the transfer and the sanction of the Department was secured. Both the Board and the Department at that time consented to a cash payment of $5,000.00 to be given to the management of the school for the purchase of cattle and machinery. This addition of stock and machinery was required on account of the extension of the farm operations through the purchase of an additional section of land. The city of Brandon failed to consummate the deal. The cattle and machinery were purchased with the expectation that the money would be forthcoming.\n\nI had to borrow the money which amounted to $6,000.00. I have been able to pay back $2,000.00 of this amount. There is still a debt of $4,000.00. The time has come when the principle should be paid. The city Council and Parks Board are acquainted with the nature of the transaction and are paying the $6,000.00 with the expectation that it is for the benefit of the management of the school to settle the debt incurred by their failure to keep their part of the contract six years ago. I am greatly in need of this money at the present time and would like if the $6,000.00 could be returned at the earliest possible date to be given as a special grant for live stock and machinery.\n\nTrusting that this arrangement will meet with your hearty approval and with the consent of the Minister, I remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndustrial School, Brandon.\n\n*This I have left with you when last in Ottawa.*\n\nIndian Affairs.

Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nController.\nFRIDAY, APRIL 16, 1920\n\nWANTED! A PARK\n\nVersacious delays in connection with securing title to the new Suburban Park, should not be permitted to block the plans and efforts that have been made to give Brandon people a real playground for this Summer. If the Parks Board permits them to, it will show itself singularly out of touch with popular sentiment.\n\nThe time wasters at Ottawa, may not be able to straighten out the difficulties concerning legal technicalities over the delivery of title, but this should not be permitted to interfere with development plans. As it is generally understood, the principals in the deal have signified their willingness to make the transfer. They should be asked to sign so in writing, and have done so. Development be proceeded with immediately the ground is fit. Then the time wasters can move along in their leisurely fashion without interference on our part.\n\nNothing less than the adaptation of the natural facilities of the site to the use of a suburban park, early this Spring, should be the objective of the Parks Board. If this body finds obstruction in the way of finances or labor, an appeal to the red-blooded men of Brandon to turn out on an agreed day, say Arbor Day, May 16th, and \"brush up\" the park, will meet with a hearty response.\n\nThough there is no expectation that in one short season Brandon can effect the transformation of this site from a wilderness and scrub into a complete natural park, yet a great deal can be done if there is the right blend of wise leadership, enthusiasm and effort.\n\nThere does not appear to be any reason why the underbrush cannot be removed, some roads cut, a cattle-shanty built, and a store set up, to provide hot water, an athletic ground laid out, a bathing beach staked and roped off to make it safe for swimmers old and young, tables and benches erected, and other facilities installed essential to a picnic grounds.\n\nThere is no secret about what should be provided in order to attract holiday makers. Hundreds of men and women can name them off without stopping to think. Most of the fundamentals are not costly. What is transportation will have to be arranged for is leadership.\n\nThough the park project can never be the success it should be until some means of transportation is provided this year, delay in taking action to provide desirable park facilities, at this natural beauty spot, and the most required if these are to be arranged.\n\nBrandon has a potential asset in its park. Left as it is, this asset is valueless. Equipped as it can be, easily and inexpensively, it will yield returns in healthful vigor, in enjoyment of life and living, in a splendid sham parking throughout the coffee season, and business houses, benefitting everybody.\n\nAre we then content to accept the passive assurance that the title difficulties cannot be overcome in time for work to be made to have the park in shape next Summer. Certainly not. Brandon demands this park, this Summer.\n\nWHY IS BRANDON LEFT OUT?\n\nAn order-in-council, issued by the government of Manitoba, authorizes the expenditure of $516,599 for the extension of the hydro-electric project under the Manitoba Power Commission.\n\nIt is proposed to tap the power line to Portage la Prairie and run a line or lines to Carman, Borden, Roland, Winkler, Manitou and Gladstone. The balance of the money to be spent for the purpose is expected providing for construction and surveying.\n\nBrandon is one of the points in this province where there is a demand for cheap electric power. A committee of the Board of Trade has been busy on this question for some time past. The City Council likewise has a committee. Other places in the province seem to be unable to get linked up with this big project. Brandon appears to be getting nowhere.\n\nThere must be a reason. The public is entitled to it. If it is left to political considerations, with an election coming on, the people might be somewhat skeptical. Politicians have been known, during election times, to present one certain aspect of a situation, except of course, favorable to themselves and their party.\n\nBrandon people are entitled to the truth about the electric power question without delay.\n\nFARMERS AND LABOR\n\nHours of labor is the only thing against which efforts to unite farmers and labor beats in vain. Mr. Macdonald combines in his person both bosses and the laborers. He is able to rob both sides of the park road, maples and elms being the possible selections.\n\nExcept for some under scrub being cut away, it is not expected that much of this work will be attempted this year.\nApril 17th\n\n537104\n\nMy dear Scott,\n\nI enclose you a clipping from the Brandon Sun.\n\nI trust the minister will be able to join in attending to this and the other matters referred to him.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Ferrier\nMr. Duncan O. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nReplying to yours of the 19th:\n\nI am very much pleased with this decision of the Minister. When I was out in Edmonton on my last visit I called on Mr. Moorehouse the Architect and informed him that I did not think it was necessary to continue his services under the arrangement we are making for building by day labor for I considered that Mr. Parney would be able to give us first-class satisfaction. With Mr. Woodsworth there to consult with and what assistance I can give in passing to and fro I thought the services of an architect were not necessary now that we have the plans and specifications. I am pleased to know that you are of the same mind. I asked Mr. Moorehouse to render his account.\n\nI am hoping that the Minister's decision will be as favorable regarding the Park situation here and the purchase of the engine. We are feeling more and more the financial pressure on account of the high cost of everything. I was in hopes of making quite a lot out of our fat cattle but had to sell for about four cents a pound.\nless than I expected on account of the slump in the cattle market. On fifty head that averaged over a thousand pounds made this a good deal on the aggregate. The fact is that we dropped money on our fat cattle this year. Any help that we can receive financially will be greatly appreciated for it is very much needed.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.

Is it intended that such control should be given the city?\n\nThe City Clerk's letter states that the new description is sent because of errors found in the first one and he does not refer to the area being increased. I did not find however any error in the old description, as it correctly describes the area shown on the plan originally submitted and the new description instead of being a correction is a description of a revised area.\n\nThe new plan submitted is a blueprint from the one previously recorded here with the northerly boundary changed so as to include Percy Lake.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Unfortunately, having been away in the field, your letter has remained unanswered until I arrive here.\n\nThe Parks Board of this City have been making changes from time to time to \"Percy Lake Park\" on the 28th of October, 1920. Having new plans made every time I would like to know finally how many plans or blue prints you require?\n\nWith regard to the average, I cannot see how I can change my figures by any means. As follows:\n\n- $1.78\n- Administration R 6.55\n- 3.00\n\nThis last 3 acres is the portion of this 3-acre lot Park Reservation. The above average includes \"Percy Lake\" in the \u00bc acre according to the Blue print. However, I have gone over these figures twice and make them practically the same. Am I not sure you have not included the road allowance &c. South of this \u00bc acre. Because the average is it is just the difference between us?\n\n\"Percy Lake\" does not I think come under the category of \"Navigable waters\" as it is a slough and is really an overflow of the River in flood time.\n\nThe reason why I took in \"Percy Lake\" in my average is that the Parks Board wish to keep the water for boating.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The plan forwarded by the City Clerk in July last, which is enclosed herewith, does not agree with the revised description and blueprint forwarded by him in September last. It is therefore required that either a new plan be filed here or that the present one be so amended as to correctly indicate the boundaries of the parcel to be conveyed.

The Rev.T.Ferrier, the Superintendent of the Indian Industrial School which is upon the said land, has written you under date of May 7th regarding this matter.\n\nThe Half Section lies in the valley of the Assiniboine River, which at this point is about a mile and a half wide, with very high Banks on each side, rising to something over one hundred feet above the bed of the River. The banks of the valley on each side are very much broken with deep ravines and gullies that lead down into the valley from the prairie above. The allowance for road on the North side of the School Farm on the said Half Section runs along the brow of the hill in an East and West direc-\n\nIndian Affairs.

The same situation occurs on the Dominion Experimental Farm on Section 27, East of the Indian School Farm and the Dominion Government laid out a road East and West across their Section at a convenient distance from the River and from the Bank of the valley. The Indian School Farm laid out a continuation of that road across their Half Section to the West of the Dominion Experimental Farm, and it has been made up and used as a road ever since the Indian Industrial School was established on the East Half of 28. The same road is continued Westerly up the Valley across other lands for some eight or nine miles and the two Municipalities through which it runs have acquired title from the private owners for the road in the valley in substitution for the allowances for road above described. The Municipality never seem to have acquired title from the Government for the road across the Indian School Farm, and now that the Municipality are spending large sums of money upon good roads, and this is one of which they intend to build up, they require some sort of title to the proposed road. What is desired to be got is a Conveyance or Patent from the Crown to the King in his right of the province of Manitoba for an allowan\nD.C.S.\n\nfor Road as it is now made out across the Indian School Farm. We have asked the Municipality to have the road surveyed by a Land Surveyor properly qualified and Plans made of it to forward to you showing what the Road Allowance consists of, and we would like to hear from you as to what will be required to enable the Government to pass an Order-in-Council setting apart this proposed Road as a Public Highway and later on issuing a Patent therefor to the Municipality or to the King in the Right of the Province of Manitoba.\n\nWould you kindly let us hear from you regarding the matter at an early date, as the Municipality are desirous of starting work upon the road as soon as possible.\n\nPlease let us hear from you at your early convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The transfer will be made by Order in Council.

It is also the property adjacent to a large portion about three-quarters of the Road Allowance on the East side. The Dominion Experimental Farm lies to the East of that Road Allowance.\n\nUnder the Statutes of the Province of Manitoba, being the Municipal Act, Chapter 133 of the Revised Statutes of Manitoba 1913, you will see by Sections 655 and following sections, and particularly 663, the powers that are given to the Municipality for disposing of original allowances for road. They first have to be closed under By-law, and then they may be disposed of as provided in Section 663. Section 662 provides for ingress and egress being reserved, and there may arise some difficulty over that on account of the owners of adjoining property South of the Road Allowance. However, the only portion that can be conveyed under the Municipal Act to your Department on behalf of the Indian Industrial School is the piece North of what is called Lake Percy, colored Yellow on the Blue Print to the point of intersection of the proposed new road. We will advise the Municipality to do what is necessary to close these roads under the provisions of the Act referred to and to con-\nJ.D.McL.\n\n-3-\n\nvey them as provided in Section 663 or sub-section \"D\" of 665 of the Municipal Act.\n\nIf these Plans and the information we have given you meet with your approval, please advise us accordingly, and we should like to have an Order-in-Council passed directing the transfer of the proposed new road to the Rural Municipality of Cornwallis at as early a date as possible. It should be conveyed by metes and bounds, and if you have any difficulty in writing a description of the proposed road from the information contained on the Surveyor's Plan, please let us know and we will ask the Surveyor to write the necessary description. It is usual to describe the actual position of the centre line of the road and the land to be conveyed, being 33 feet on each side thereof.\n\nWe should be pleased to hear from you at an early date, as the Municipality are waiting to get this cleared up so as to begin road improvement work on the same.\n\nAttached to the Blue Print which we enclose is a description of part of the South Half of the South East \u00bc of 28-10-19, West, which is transferred to the City of Brandon for Park purposes.

The original allowances for road that you refer to can only be closed by the Municipality and conveyed to the Department under the provisions of the Municipal Act of this Province, which authorizes the Municipality to deal with these. This requires Notices to be posted thirty days before the By-laws closing the roads can be passed. Then the By-law has to receive the assent of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council of Manitoba. After these formalities have been complied with, the Municipality can deal with the original allowances for road. We have no doubt that there will be no difficulty or obstacle except that of time, in carrying out what you suggest.\nThe Municipal Act provides that when original allowances for road, such as in the present case, are closed, they must be sold to the owners of the lands adjoining these original allowances for road.\n\nIn the case of the portion of the East road, the City of Brandon has acquired a portion of the land adjoining the allowance for road from the South East corner of the School farm to the South bank of what is called the \"Slough\" on the Blue Print, and the Experimental Farm, through the Department which manages that, owns the land on the East side of that piece of road. Then the City of Brandon owns the portion of land from the South East corner of the School Farm to the Assiniboine River in a Westerly direction.\n\nThe Indian School Farm appears to own the land from the South West corner of the School Farm as shown on the Plan in a Easterly direction to the intersection of the Assiniboine River, and also likely the piece in the loop of the Assiniboine River North of the road allowance. We do not know who owns the other pieces, but they will likely have to be settled with if the Indian School Farm does not own them, and we have no doubt that the Munici-\nJ.D.McL.\n\npality will carry out your request so far as the law will permit them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGRC.\n\nColdwell Co.

(RG 10, Volume 6258, file 576-9, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES OF CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nRev. T. Ferrier,\n\nIndustrial School.\n\nBrandon,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIndustrial School Plan.\n\nI have today mailed you plan to send to Ottawa.\n\nThe contour lines shew the lay of the ground and should be reasonably accurate but a survey of the ground after the snow is gone would of course be more accurate. For the main purpose of the plan, i.e., shewing the cross section through the building, may be taken as correct for the purpose of preparing plans of the building. You will note that the contour line \"94\" will be the new grade and is 3 ft. below the present grade at the old building. The depth of the new Basement below this will depend, of course, on the height of main floor above grade and the height of Basement story. The depth of Boiler-room floor is shewn as 10 ft. below new Basement floor to permit of gravity return of condensation from radiators in Basement, this will be governed by the height of water line of boilers and is to avoid the use of pumps for returning condensation to boilers.\n\nAs to amount of excavation to level the ground to the west of the building and to lower the grade to the new level, I make this approximately 15000 to 16000 cu. yds.\n\nI am enclosing my account to date which I trust you will find satisfactory.\n\nIf there is any further information in connection with this which you may require please let me know.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nW. H. Shillinglaw\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM REV. T. FERRIER,\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN SCHOOLS & HOSPITALS,\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA, BRANDON, Man.\ndated March 7, 1928.\n\nOriginal on 133-0-15.\n\nI expect to be in the East about the 15th of April and will visit Ottawa, when all can be discussed in detail. I am enclosing you a letter from Mr. Shillinglaw. The 15,000 or 16,000 yards of earth mentioned by Mr. Shillinglaw include the hill to the west of the building.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM REV. T. FERRIER,\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN SCHOOLS & HOSPITALS,\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA, BRANDON, Man.\ndated March 7, 1928.\n\nOriginal on 133-0-15.\n\nThe pencil sketch shows the amount of earth that will be required to be moved. This can be mostly accomplished by plow and scraper, about 1,600 yards of the earth to be removed for the building this year. The rear end of the old building will have to be torn down before building or removal of earth can be commenced. This part was not a portion of the original building. About twenty feet of the root-house which was added to the original should be removed.\n\nI have given the question of the site a great deal of thought and attention, in which Architect Shillinglaw has assisted. I have sought the advice of other practical men such as Mr. Yates, and we are of one opinion and that is that the present building occupies the best site on the farm, when compared with the position of all the other buildings.\nStyle S\u2014ORNAMENTAL FENCE\n\nBy using our style S Lawn Fence illustrated here you can add very much to the beauty of your home. The Horizontals are two No. 13 gauge wires twisted together. Uprights are No. 9 hard steel deeply crimped and securely held in the cable twist. It has 1 inch mesh at the bottom and 2 inch mesh at the top. The style in most demand is 36 inch.\n\nThe gate to match this fence is made of the same fabric and is usually sold with scroll top. The frame is galvanized steel pipe, and presents a very neat appearance.\n\nA. L. CAMPBELL\nBRANDON, MANITOBA\nEstablished 1909\nDISTRIBUTOR OF\n\"FROST\" WIRE FENCE\n\nREMARKS\n\nFor nearly twenty years our exclusive business has been selling and erecting woven wire fencing on farms and railways in the West.\n\nThe ever increasing sales are proof of the numerous satisfied customers we have had for these products. For many years we have sold large quantities of Frost Tight Lock Fence made from wire drawn and galvanized in their extensive plant at Hamilton, Ontario.\n\nFrost Tight Lock Fence presents a very neat and attractive appearance, and being securely locked the stays are always held in position. Another strong feature of Frost Fence is the long deep spring wave in the horizontals, which keeps the fence tight enough all season, and also provides a reserve spring for shocks from animals and climatic changes.\n\nWhen you are interested in building woven wire fencing, we believe we can furnish and erect your fence complete, cheaper, faster and quicker, than you can do it for yourself. Fence and workmanship guaranteed to purchaser's satisfaction.\nPOULTRY AND GARDEN FENCE\n\nThis combined Poultry and Garden fence has been used extensively for years.

A 16 foot gate fills a space 16 feet.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThere is some fencing greatly needed on the Brandon School Farm. The section on the north was fenced into three fields, each one-third of a mile wide. We have to divide the west and east fields. This will take two-thirds of a mile of wire fencing. The wire required is No. 740 - 9, stands 40 inches high, 9 stays per rod and 9 pounds per rod, three rolls of barbed wire, all properly built on cedar posts 5 to 7 inches for $191.00. I enclose you a price list from A. L. Campbell, the only firm carrying this line of goods in Brandon.\n\nThe fence is required at once to keep our stock from growing crops and I would appreciate very much authority to erect this fence.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGRD\n\nIndian Affairs.

Doyle, D.D.\nBrandon, Man., June 18th, 1930.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAbout a week ago we had a very heavy downpour of rain, and it has been raining a good deal since. The grading around the school was left in very presentable form, but almost at a dead level, and on the east side a little hollow just in front of the two doors. It was therefore impossible to get into the building without going through a good deal of mud. After consulting Mr. Shillinglaw I had our men do some grading. We have cut down the level in front of the school for about twenty feet wide, and are covering this with gravel, also at Mr. Shillinglaw's direction have filled in a low place back of the school and done such grading as was necessary to run the water off, instead of having it stand in front of the doors.\n\nA considerable amount of gravel should yet be hauled and spread on both the east and west sides of the building. We will defer this however to be done at odd times when the men cannot work on the land.\n\nTrusting that this meets with your approval,\n\nI am,\n\nyours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle,\nOttawa, July 8, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th ultimo, with reference to the preliminary grading and the hauling of gravel to fill in the low spots around the building at the Brandon Indian Residential School. Your action in this connection is approved. I note that more gravel will be hauled when the men and teams are not engaged on the land.\n\nWith further reference to your letter of April 26th, concerning the general grading scheme, as Mr. Orr may not be in Brandon for some weeks, I have asked Mr. Ferrier to discuss it with you, in the event that anything should be done in the early future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Also the curbstone on the North half of the oval to be made in front of the building. After advising with Mr. Shillinglaw in regard to this matter I asked Mr. A.E.

The Department will allow an expenditure of $175 this year for this purpose. Any work that is to be performed must be done on a day labour basis, under your supervision. In connection with any materials you purchase, you should forward properly certified accounts, in duplicate, and, for any labour that it is really necessary to engage, you may submit returns, in duplicate, properly receipted by those engaged.

Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe outside fence on the West and North of the North section of land has been giving us serious trouble during this summer. The posts have rotted off, a few have been replaced from time to time during the last few years but this summer a large number have broken off and the last couple of weeks our horses have been getting out constantly. This fence is quite old and should be renewed but on account of the shortage in finances we have not asked for this work to be done. Harvest is now over and our boys can go ahead and put in the necessary number of posts and it will take about 150 to repair this fence so that it will last for a few years yet. We will also need several spools of barbed wire to stretch a wire above the fence to prevent the horses from breaking off posts that are not very sound. These two fences never had a barbed wire on top. It is increasingly necessary now, as the serious soil drifting this year has made the fence much less efficient in places.

There was an error in the first item in question of almost a foot and they have made the correction to $1.10 instead of $1.20. In the last item in the bill, as the curb required a full six-inch board they had to use an eight-inch width in order to secure this. This item therefore, remains as it was.

The Wade voucher is for $65.00 making a total of $87.00.\n\nThese amounts exceed the amount authorized for this purpose by your letter of Oct. 7, #133-0-19. We secured quotations over phone and understood the amount to be 25 cents per post. We secured 150 posts believing that we were spending the amount authorized by your letter. When the bill came for the posts it turned out the price was 45 cents instead of 25. We took the matter up with Wade & Sons, they reduced the price to 42 cents. But this still leaves us $27.00 in excess. We secured a stouter post than we might otherwise have done but we felt this necessary in order that these posts used now for repair would be suitable to remain in the ground when the whole fence has to be renewed. I might say that even this number was not sufficient and we had the boys cut a large number of oak posts to complete the work.\n\nWe will be glad if you can see your way clear to include the extra $27.00 in your cheque to Wade & Sons. If you cannot do this we will pay the bill out of School funds. I might say that increased expenses this year and very much reduced income from the farm is making financing very difficult. And I am exceedingly sorry that the above error occurred.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle.\nMEMO RE THE LAND USED BY\nTHE BRANDON INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nAs early as 1898, Dr. A. Sutherland, of the General Board of Missions of the Methodist Church, pressed for the establishment of an industrial school for the benefit of children of Lake Winnipeg Indians. The Department's policy at that time was to establish institutions in white centres and to emphasize vocational training of pupils.\n\nIn 1899, the Department approved of the scheme and the question of a suitable site was given consideration. Various localities were suggested - Fisher River, Berens River and Selkirk. Dr. Sutherland, the Rev. John McBeugall and Dr. J. Woodsworth were in favour of a site in the southern part of the province. They were not satisfied, however, with the property near Carman, which was set aside by Order in Council for the school.\n\nPeople of both Brandon and Carberry became interested and John Kerr, Clerk of the City of Brandon, wrote Rev. Mr. Woodsworth, of the Methodist Church, that the City Council would give a site next to the Experimental Farm and accept in exchange government lands elsewhere. Dr. Sutherland visited the West in 1891, examined the sites and recommended that the one at Brandon be secured. The City of Brandon purchased from J. W. Stewart the half section on which the school is situated. The price was $5,700. Mr. A. Kelly, Mayor of Brandon, wrote to the Department in 1891, accepting the section near Carman in trade for the site at Brandon. The site was occupied and the building operations commenced in 1892. In 1900, the deal was finally completed and regularized by Order in Council.\n\nIn 1911, the section on the hill was purchased for the use of the school for the sum of $16,000. In 1920, the City of Brandon completed a 99 year lease of the most southerly part of the school property for $6,000. 52 acres was required for municipal park purposes.\nMEMORANDUM RE LANDS OF THE BRANDON INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\n960 acres.

Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., March 13, 1934.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn regard to additional fencing required on our farm:\n\nThere is a sand ridge running across two-thirds of the north section of this farm. During the years it has drifted very seriously and this last few years this trouble has increased. Some years ago, part of this ridge was seeded to broom and other grasses and this experiment has been a success. The seeding to grass should now be extended the full two-thirds of a mile, making a field this length and about twenty-five rods in width, which would be fifty acres. From the best advice we can secure there seems to be no other way of saving this land and preventing the drifting portion from extending over parts of the better land.\n\nWe urgently need this land for pasture as we to break other land to take its place in our crop rotation and to use it as the pasture field a lane must be built from the main pasture field to the south, making necessary in all 440 rods of new fence. I enclose herewith estimate of cost from Mr. A. L. Campbell and sincerely hope it will be possible to have this fencing done during the early summer. The estimate is $420.45.\n\nWe also have received notice from the city that they intend to take over this year at least part of the land south of Lake Percy, which has been re-deeded to them by the Department and which we have been using as one of our splendid alfalfa fields and further that they will commence to use the right-of-way which also was deeded to them across our property from the Valley Road to Lake Percy. This will\nOttawa, March 17, 1934.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to additional fencing required at the Brandon Indian Residential School. In the second paragraph of your letter, you state that you are forwarding an estimate from Mr. A. L. Campbell. This was not received. I note that you would require 440 rods of fencing. Please let me have full particulars regarding the kind of fencing that you wish to use.

Doyle, D.D., Principal of the Brandon Indian Residential School, Brandon, Man., (Federal District of Brandon) has requested, during the past two years, that additional fencing be installed on the school farm. I quote from the Principal's letter:-\n\n\"There is a sand ridge running across two-thirds of the north section of this farm. During the years it has drifted very seriously and this last few years this trouble has increased. Some years ago, part of this ridge was seeded to broom and other grasses and this experiment has been a success. The seeding to grass should now be extended the full two-thirds of a mile, making a field this length and about twenty-five rods in width, which would be fifty acres. From the best advice we can secure there seems to be no other way of saving this land and preventing the drifting portion from extending over parts of the better land.\n\n\"We urgently need this land for pasture as we, too, break other land to take its place in our crop rotation and to use it as the pasture field a lane must be built from the main pasture field to the south, making necessary in all 440 rods of new fence.\n\n\"We have a fair catch of grass on the land which we desire to fence and this, we believe, after thorough investigation, is the only method of preventing soil-drift on this light ridge and will appreciate it very much if this request can be complied with.\"\n\nIt would require 440 rods 9-strand woven wire fencing, No. 9 gauge, and 400 cedar posts, a quantity of cedar braces and 50 pounds of staples. The fencing material required would cost approximately $875. Besides, there would be labour in erecting the fence, to a cost of approximately $50. Dr. Doyle has forwarded a quotation from A. L. Campbell, Brandon, for the supplying of the above fencing material and labour, to the total amount of $420.45. I am informed that this firm is on the approved list.

He states that approximately 440 rods of fencing is required to make a pasture field out of a sand ridge which runs across the north section of the farm. He says there is a fair catch of grass on the land which he desires to fence, and, after a thorough investigation, he considers this is the only method of preventing soil-drift on this light ridge.\n\nIt will require 440 rods 9-strand woven wire fencing, No. 9 gauge; 400 cedar posts; a quantity of cedar braces; and 50 pounds of staples. The Honourable the Minister has directed that the following firms in Brandon be asked to quote on the wire fencing and staples, viz.:-\n\nMitchell Hardware Company,\nJohnston Hardware Company,\nWade & Sons,\n\nand that quotations on the posts and braces required be obtained from Wade & Sons and B. H. Campbell, both of Brandon.\n\nI would therefore request that you consult the Principal as to the quantity and type of fencing required and obtain prices from the firms mentioned above - the purchase to be made from the firm quoting the lowest price. Please obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nThe Principal is being informed that the purchase of the fencing materials is being placed in your hands.\n\nRegarding the labour in erecting the fence, it is considered that the school staff should be able to do this work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

H. Campbell, of Brandon - and in due course the voucher will be forwarded for payment.\n\nWith reference to the fencing required, I am informed that a 9 strand woven fence, all No. 9 wire, is not manufactured, but that I can obtain a 7 strand, all No. 9, for a total of $244.40, or a 10 strand, all No. 9, for $347.60. I have discussed this matter with Doctor Doyle, Principal of the Brandon Residential School, and he would be satisfied with the 7 strand woven fence, providing we could supply 2 strands of barbed wire for on top. Personally, I think this would make a better fence and the barbed wire could be purchased for approximately $60.00, thus showing a considerable saving over the purchase price of the 10 strand fence.\n\nThe Department did not grant authority to purchase any brace wire and a quantity of this will be needed.\n\nI would like to have authority by return mail to purchase the 7 strand woven fencing, instead of that mentioned in the Department's letter, and also to purchase the necessary quantity of barbed wire and brace wire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G.

I am informed by Mr. Hopper, Asst. Supt., that all the repair and upkeep of this road has been carried out by his Department. The half mile through the school property is certainly not in good condition and I understand from Dr. Doyle, Principal of the Brandon Indian Residential School, that several cars and trucks were stuck on this portion of the road during the past spring and summer. West, and adjoining the school property, is the Country Club Golf Course and this half mile of road is in good shape. I understand some of the work in connection with this road is paid for by the Golf Club. The road running west from this point is gravelled and in fair condition.\n\nIn view of the fact that there is so much Government property along this road, it is perhaps only fair that some assistance should be given to the Municipality. The Dominion Experimental Farm have assumed their responsibility and it is perhaps only right that our Department should grant some assistance.\n\nThe Councillor states that the Road Engineer advises that it costs approximately $1200. per mile to properly gravel a market road. He thinks the Municipality should be granted $500, but adds that any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

I think if the Department were to allow $300., the repair work necessary could be carried out and the road made equally as good as any other portion I inspected.\n\nIn view of the information obtained, I would recommend that assistance be granted to the amount as stated above. I am returning herewith the two maps, showing the road in question marked in red ink.\n\nI shall be glad to know the Department's decision in connection with this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

G. Hamilton of Winnipeg, who made an inspection of the above mentioned road conditions.\n\nAccording to the information given in this report it appears that the portion of the road in question, which has a length of about a half mile through the school property, is in a bad condition, and that the portions outside have been kept in fairly good shape by the interested parties.\n\nThe improvements required to put our portion of the road in a similar condition as the parts leading to it would consist in grading and surfacing with gravel at a cost estimated at approximately $500. It is considered, however, by the Inspector and Doctor Doyle, Principal of the School, that an amount of about $300 would be sufficient contribution by this department to put this portion of the road in as good condition as the portions outside the school property.\n\nIn view of the circumstances as set forth I would concur with Inspector Hamilton's recommendation that an amount of $300 be allowed the Municipality of Cornwallis to assist in the improvements applied for.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nAugust 31, 1935.\n\nMr. Buskard,\n\nReferring to your memorandum of the 1st instant, and the petition from the ratepayers of the Municipality of Cornwallis and adjoining towns in Manitoba, asking this department for assistance towards the cost of surfacing a piece of road running East and West through the Brandon Indian Residential School property, I beg to advise that the Department is now in receipt of a report from Inspector A.
