At an early stage of your Lordship's Catholic life, the hand of Divine Providence brought you into contact with Monseigneur de Mazenod. In him you beheld a great Bishop of God's Church, and a true Apostle of the poor of Jesus Christ, whose exalted virtues you revered, whose wise counsels you valued, and whose friendship you enjoyed. In your Lordship, at that time, the venerable Founder of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, saw the youthful but intrepid Confessor of the Faith, who had then made the generous sacrifice of class and home feelings, and of much that was to be prized in future prospects, at the shrine of his religious convictions. In later years, when a work had to be accomplished which Monseigneur de Mazenod had much at heart, and which he had often urged myself to seek to bring about\u2014the establishment of his Missionaries in London among the poor of that metropolis,\nyour Lordship became a providential agent in its furtherance. The leading and generous part which you took in co-operating with the Fathers of Tower Hill Mission in establishing Schools for their poor children, entitles your Lordship to our deep and lasting gratitude.\n\nWith sentiments of affectionate respect,\n\nI remain,\n\nMy dear Lord Denbigh,\n\nYours ever faithfully,\n\nROBERT COOKE, O.M.I.\n\nCHURCH OF ENGLISH MARTYRS,\nGreat Prescot Street,\nLondon, E.\n\nJune 14th, 1879.\nCONTENTS.\n\nCHAPTER I. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 1\n\nBirth and parentage\u2014Traits of early virtue\u2014Feats of charity in childhood\u2014Eugene and

OBLATES OF MARY.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nCHARLES JOSEPH EUGENE DE MAZENOD\nwas born at Aix-en-Provence, the 1st of August, 1782. His family was illustrious by its rank, and by the eminent position in the magistracy of that country, occupied at various times with distinction by some of its members. His father was admitted to the intimate friendship of the Dauphin, the father of Louis XVI. Signs of future greatness and sanctity began to manifest themselves at an early age in young Eugene de Mazenod. Whilst yet a child in the arms of his nurse, an infallible means of silencing his cries when he wept, was to take him to a church. There he instantly became calm and still, no matter how excited he was before entering the sacred edifice. Was this a presage of that deep reverence for the Sanctuaries of God which became a striking characteristic of his after-life? A great force of will began to show itself in him at a very\nearly age. He never asked for anything with the sobs or tears of a child, no matter how much he desired it; but with calm resoluteness would he say: \"I will have it.\" Such proud bearing in a child so young often provoked the smile of the cursory looker-on; but more thoughtful observers would predict for him a future, marked by a strong will, either for good or evil. Happily it has been for the former.\n\nSurrounded by a numerous retinue of domestics, all ready to lavish their services upon him, young Eugene refused to receive at their hands any service that was not absolutely required, or which he could render to himself. He was scarcely six years old when he began to exercise acts of benevolence towards the poor, even at personal inconvenience and sacrifice. One day at this age, he met in the street a poor little charcoal vendor, all in rags. Moved with a sudden feeling of compassion, he quickly divested himself of his jacket and joyfully placed it on the shoulders of the poor half-naked boy. His maternal grandfather, a venerable nobleman of extraordinary piety and great experience of the world, had much to do in forming the character of Eugene. He wisely counselled that a free scope should be given to his childish ardour in relieving the wants of the poor, and that small sums of money should be placed at his disposal for this object. A close intimacy existed between the family of the De Mazenods and that of\nM. Revest, an eminent lawyer, who resided also at Aix. One day Eugene, who was a frequent and welcome visitor of the Revest family, entering their drawing-room, perceived they had no fire, though the day was cold. \"What!\" he exclaimed, \"you have no fire on so cold a day.\" A lady present, wishing to test what she had heard of his compassion for every sort of suffering in others which came under his notice, feigning poverty, said: \"We are poor, and wood is dear.\" Hearing these words, Eugene quickly bowed and withdrew. An hour elapsed, and a knocking was heard at the outer gate. It was young Eugene rolling a small wheelbarrow filled with pieces of wood which he had collected. Advancing with his precious burden, the fruits of his charitable labour, he deposited it at the door of the apartment where the Revests were assembled, saying: \"Now you can make a fire and warm yourselves.\" Wiping the tiny sweat drops from his little brow, he hastily retired. He was only six years old when he performed this feat of charity. Great was the emotion of those who witnessed that act of juvenile devotedness. Many years afterwards, members of the Revest family related this occurrence with tears in their eyes. His thoughtful parents, whilst yielding to the advice of his grandfather in giving full scope to the benevolent zeal of Eugene, always kept him in view themselves, or had him\nfollowed by a tutor, whose eye was ever upon him in their absence, without his being aware of the strict surveillance which was being exercised over him. He never spoke himself of the good works he thus performed, and his parents acted as if they were in complete ignorance of them. During his whole life a tender sympathy for the sufferings and afflictions of others, and especially of those from whom he had received marks of kindness, was a beautiful feature in his character. When ten years old, being at the College of Turin, he received news of the death of the daughter of the femme de chambre of Madame de Mazenod, his mother. The thought of the grief which this poor woman, who had been very kind to him, would suffer at the death of her child, so afflicted him that he lay for hours upon his bed, bathed in tears and moaning deeply. He manifested from the beginning a frank and upright spirit, and showed an abhorrence of every species of untruthfulness. He never excused himself when he committed a fault. One day, thoughtlessly, he gave to a young boy whom he chanced to meet, a costly article from his mother's toilet table in exchange for some other object. The parents of this boy were frightened when they found in his possession an article of such value. Discovering that it belonged to Madame de Mazenod, they compelled him to go with them to restore to her the article in question. Eugene hear-\ning the cries of the poor boy, whom his parents were accusing of dishonesty, rushed out, exclaiming with vehemence: \"He is innocent; it is I who committed the fault. Do not blame him, it is I who ought to be punished.\" Madame de Mazenod, addressing some words of gentle reproof to her son, praised the upright conduct of the parents of the poor boy, and handed back to his mother the article that had been restored to her, as a gift, in testimony of her appreciation of their conduct in the matter.\n\nEugene, even when a mere child, took no interest in the ordinary sports of children. He showed a preference for the society of grown-up persons, and would listen for hours attentively to conversations upon serious matters, seated at the feet of the speakers, and looking up with deep interest into their faces, scanning every expression of their countenances. He amused himself, however, willingly, in erecting mimic oratories, and in representing with his companions the ceremonies of the Church. He did this with great gravity and composure, and he would show himself much displeased if his companions smiled at his sermons, or seemed distracted or dissipated in the functions he assigned to them.\nCHAPTER II.\n\nHITHERTO the days of young Eugene de Mazenod were spent in the sunshine of a happy home. In a human sense, his position was well-nigh everything that could be desired; wealth, rank, refinement, shed their lustre upon his path. The last male heir of an honoured house, he was the object of the fond love of devoted and most worthy parents. His father's hospitality often assembled around him some of the most distinguished names of the noblesse of Provence, and other parts of France. But it was the religious character of his father's household that gave its chief charm in the eyes of this pious child to his early home. Good example and inducement to piety encircled him on every side. His soul remained ever pure and unworldly. This was the secret of his unselfishness, of the depth and tenderness of his friendships, and of his pure attachments. If young De Mazenod had been destined merely to fill the place of a christian gentleman in the world, he might have been well formed for his post in such a home as that which we have been de-\nscribing. But his was to be a loftier destiny. The plant of holiness within his soul has to grow up and become strong as the young oak amidst storms. This happy household is to be dispersed; its members have to seek safety in flight to another land. The Revolutionary tempest has burst over France. Eugene's father is marked out for death by a decree of Robespierre. Fortunately he received an early intimation of his intended doom, and saved himself by fleeing to Italy. Another decree is passed by the infamous convention, ordering the children of nobles to be put to death. Eugene's life is in danger. An immediate departure from France is necessary for his safety. A day's delay may be fatal to him. He has not yet reached his ninth year, and he has just risen from a bed of severe illness, when he is forced to set out upon an exile which will continue for several years. The morrow is fixed for his departure. All arrangements have to be made in profound secrecy; an indiscreet word might prove fatal. The secret is confided to the child, and he keeps it with fidelity. The only favour he asks is, that he may be allowed to embrace his friends of the Revest family before parting from them, perhaps for ever. His request is granted, but on condition that he makes no mention of his departure. He paid his visit, and he kept his secret. But it cost him sorely to do so; the tears in his eyes and his sobbing breast\nas he bade them adieu, almost betrayed him. The next day they learnt the cause of his emotion, and then it became their turn to shed many tears. Eugene left Aix in the company of his uncle, for Nice, where he sojourned for months, and where he was joined by his mother and his grandfather. In one of his notes, written when a boy, he says, in reference to this occurrence of his life: \"As it appeared likely that things would not alter soon in France, my parents decided on providing for my education, by placing me in the College of Nobles at Turin; my mother and my grandmother undertook to conduct me thither. My mother was then but thirty years old, and my grandmother was over fifty. Everything that reminds me of my grandmother touches me to the heart. I loved her as dearly as I loved my mother; that is to say, I loved her as much as one can love another in this life.\" The tenderness of the filial love of this pious child appears in these words. His piety did not interfere with his deep affections for those to whom he was bound by the ties of kindred, nor did his love for them cloud or chill his piety. The college in which he was placed at Turin was conducted by the Barnabite Fathers. Eugene stayed there three years. He made his first Communion on Holy Thursday, 1792. He had not then reached his tenth year. He always headed his class whilst in that college. He\nwas remarkable for his spirit of regularity and love of rule. The Rector, noticing these qualities in him, assigned to him a certain post of authority over his fellow-pupils. With perfect ease he took up his proper position, and his ascendency was cheerfully acknowledged by those placed under his surveillance. He gave tokens, even then, of being born to guide and direct others. His father, who never lost an occasion of giving good counsel to Eugene, wrote to him to use wisely the authority confided to him, and to temper it with compassion for the weaknesses of his companions. The superiors of the college, who always treated him with the greatest affection, often proposed him as a model for the other pupils to imitate. In the interval between his first Communion and his Confirmation, he gave proof of great delicacy of sentiment and firmness of character. An excrescence had appeared close to one of his eyes, for the removal of which it was necessary that he should undergo a painful operation, which was to be performed by Dr. Pinchinati, the first Surgeon to the King. The day for the operation was fixed, and Madame de Mazenod was to come from Nice on the previous day to be present at it. Eugene wished to spare his mother the pain of seeing him suffer. He begged earnestly of the Rector to fix an earlier day for the operation than that which had been appointed, so that when his mother arrived she might find\nit already performed. The Rector was greatly pleased with the delicate foresight of Eugene, and readily consented to his wishes. Arrangements were speedily made for the performing of the operation, which was to take place in the Rector's room. The surgeon arrived, accompanied by several of his pupils. Eugene was complimented on his courage. But what a humiliation was awaiting him! The poor child's resolution began to fail him at sight of the array of surgical instruments which were to be employed in the operation. He begged the doctor and his pupils to retire, and he withdrew, terrified, into his chamber. Presently he began to reflect upon his sudden cowardice, and to seek to discover its cause. A moment's reflection brought to his mind the fact that he had not prepared himself for the operation by earnest prayer, and that he had been trusting too much in his own resolution and courage, without asking God for help. Not losing a moment, he flung himself on his knees in spirit at the feet of Jesus Christ, whom he tenderly invoked. He addressed, also, a most fervent prayer to the Holy Ghost, asking for the gift of fortitude. His prayer was heard, for he immediately felt a new courage kindling within his breast. He returned without delay to the Rector's rooms, and declared himself ready to undergo the operation, and begged that the doctor, who had not yet left the premises, might\nagain be asked to perform it. The operation was very long and very painful; the heroic child never once winced under it. Not a tear rolled down his cheek, not a sigh or complaint escaped from his lips, for then he was sustained not merely by a human, but by a supernatural courage\u2014by that gift of fortitude which the Holy Ghost, in answer to his fervent prayer, bestowed upon him. His mother arrived that same evening. Her joy was great when she learnt that, owing to the affectionate thoughtfulness of her child, and his heroic courage, she was spared the pain of witnessing his great sufferings under the operation. On Trinity Sunday, 1792, he received the Sacrament of Confirmation at the hands of the Archbishop of Turin. The ardour of Eugene in the practice of piety was not slackened during his stay in the college.\nCHAPTER III.\n\nLouis XVI., the martyr-king, had laid his head upon the block. The revolutionary wave was rolling from France towards neighbouring countries. Piedmont was threatened. The emigr\u00e9s who had taken refuge there had to seek for a safer asylum. Eugene had to flee with the rest. Shelter was to be sought by many in Venice. The departure from Turin was solemn and touching. Many of the first families of France were assembled in this latter place, in comparative poverty. To save their lives they had to quit their homes in haste, taking with them whatever fragments of their fortunes they could collect together in the hurry and terror of the moment. Many ecclesiastics,\u2014some of the highest rank, and some far advanced in years\u2014were also amongst the exiles. Let us allow Eugene to describe, in his own words, the departure for Venice:\n\n\"On the 2nd of May, 1794, my father freighted a vessel of considerable size, in which he embarked with all his family, which was composed of the following members: my father, Charles Antoine...\"\nde Mazenod; my mother, Marie Rose Eugenie de Joannis; my great-uncle, Auguste Andr\u00e9 de Mazenod, Archdeacon and Vicar-General of Marseilles; my uncle, Charles Fortun\u00e9 de Mazenod, Vicar-General of Aix; my uncle, Eugene de Mazenod, Vice-Admiral of the king's navy; my aunt, the Marquise de Pierrefere; and the young Marquis, her son; and Nanon, the femme de chambre of my mother. A great number of emigr\u00e9s begged of my father to be allowed to embark with us, to which request he willingly consented. Amongst these were very many Priests.\n\nOur voyage lasted twelve days. We stopped every night in some place along the banks of the Po. We met everywhere with the most cordial hospitality. The revolutionary bands had not yet reached these places. All vied with one another in acts of kindness towards us. At Cremona the Marquise de Colonia, who, with her husband, had joined our party, was followed in the street by a devoted and generous person, who, touched with compassion at the sight of the misfortunes of so many noble emigr\u00e9s fleeing from their country, sought to slip into her hand a package containing several pieces of gold, which, however, this lady politely refused. The next day we cast anchor in a delicious spot. Here our party wished to repose under the shade of wide-spreading trees. The\njoyousness of the scene communicated itself to our hearts: some sang, some engaged in lively conversation. No one seeing us would imagine that we were a band of refugees fleeing from tyrants who sought our lives, and had taken possession of our goods. A vessel, also laden with emigr\u00e9s, among whom were many priests, followed us closely and stopped at the same spot. My parents had here the consolation of meeting many old friends, amongst whom were the Bishop of Frejus, and the Marquis Grimaldi. They shed tears together over their common misfortunes, and consoled one another as well as they were able.\"\n\nVenice was at last reached, and lodgings were secured with difficulty. The city was crowded on their arrival, owing to the public festivals which were then being celebrated, and the price for apartments was high. Poverty began to tell painfully on this occasion. That noble family of exiles, including two venerable ecclesiastics, and one faithful domestic\u2014eleven in all\u2014had to crowd themselves into a narrow dingy lodging; but every heart was resigned, and God's holy will was praised. Here Eugene was schooled by personal experience in the knowledge of the privations which the poor have to endure. It was well that it should be so, for he was afterwards to become the distinguished apostle of the poor. By the sale of Madame de Mazenod's\ndiamonds, his father was enabled to secure a more suitable abode for his family.\n\nWe will here draw attention to a circumstance in connection with this new residence, of a most Providential character, and which had a marked and most decisive influence on the whole of the after career of Eugene. Opposite this residence stood the house of one of the richest commercial families of Venice, which was noted for the piety and munificent character of its members. The name of this family was Zinelli. It consisted of a venerable mother and six sons, two of whom were ecclesiastics\u2014one in deacon's orders, and the other, who was named De Bartolo, was a priest, who died afterwards in the odour of sanctity. It was this holy priest whom God placed in the way of Eugene at a critical and trying moment. The poor boy found himself in Venice without books or professors, and the straitened circumstances of his exiled family forbade all human hope of his educational needs being soon supplied. He was then in his thirteenth year, and a precious period of his life was being spent in forced idleness. The attention of the Zinellis was drawn to Eugene; even at that early age he had a grave and noble bearing stamped upon him, that forcibly struck beholders. He was tall beyond his years, and a chaste beauty, which distinguished him through after-life, was marked upon his features.\nThe holy priest, De Bartolo Zinelli, became deeply interested in this modest and intelligent boy, whom he saw frequently passing before his door. He perceived that Eugene was following no course of studies, he guessed at the probable cause of his inaction, and was most desirous to render him assistance. One day seeing Eugene listlessly gazing from a window he accosted him, saying: \"Master Eugene, are you not afraid of losing your time in thus gazing idly from a window?\" \"Alas! sir,\" replied Eugene, \"I cannot help it. I am a stranger here, and I have not a single book at my disposal.\" \"Let that be no obstacle, my child,\" kindly answered De Bartolo, \"my library is well supplied with all the books you may require, and it is entirely at your service.\" De Bartolo invited Eugene to visit him the following day, which he did with his father's ready consent. Eugene thus describes his first visit to De Bartolo. \"He received me with the greatest kindness. He conducted me through his library, and from that to his cabinet where he spent his days in study with his brother, who was then only a deacon. He pointed to a vacant place at the study table and said: 'That place was occupied by a dear brother whom God has lately called to Himself. I shall be most happy to see you occupy it in his stead. It will be a great gratification to me to direct your studies, and\nto help you to complete them.' One may well imagine how great was my surprise and joy at such a proposal. I accepted it with expressions of lively gratitude, being certain that my father would gladly give his consent. When I communicated the good news to my parents, they thanked God for having secured for me so great an advantage. From that day, for four years, I pursued my course of studies with unvarying constancy, under the guidance of my benevolent tutor, whom I sought every morning immediately after hearing Mass. I worked at my studies till mid-day, when I returned home for dinner. After dinner De Bartolo came for me to join him in a walk to visit some church, where we stopped for a while to pray. I then returned to my studies, and continued at them till evening. At that hour several priests in the neighbourhood assembled to recite the Holy Office with De Bartolo, after which all met in the drawing-room, where we joined some friends of the family in an hour's cheerful recreation. Coffee was then served round, and everybody but the members of the household, and myself, retired. As I was looked upon as one of the family I stayed behind for supper, and also for the Rosary and night prayers.\" Such was the manner of life led by Eugene for four years, under the judicious and saintly care of De Bartolo, who was a refined scholar and a great servant of God. Under\nsuch tuition, the soul of Eugene made rapid progress in the most exalted virtues. He learned quickly to despise the vanities of the world, for which he began to conceive a supreme contempt. Prayer became his chief delight, and he secretly practised extraordinary mortifications. He slept on the bare ground and fasted frequently. The intervals between his hours of study were spent, for the most part, in prayer or spiritual reading. He made his confession every Saturday, and received Holy Communion on Sundays and on the chief festivals. He served Mass every morning, and recited daily the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin. Such was his method of life between his thirteenth and sixteenth years. The desire of consecrating himself to God, and of becoming a priest, manifested itself about this time.\n\n\"One day,\" as he relates himself, \"after I had read for my great-uncle, as I had been daily accustomed to do, a chapter of the New Testament, he said to me gravely, 'Eugene, is it true that you wish to embrace the ecclesiastical state?' 'Yes, Uncle,' I replied without hesitation, 'it is quite true!' 'How could you think, my child,' he then said, 'of such a thing? Are you not the last link of our family, which will become extinct if you accomplish such an intention?' I was astonished to hear such words fall from the lips of one so venera-\nble and holy; I answered with much emotion, 'Uncle, what could be more honourable for our family than to end in a priest.' My uncle had spoken thus only for the purpose of testing my feelings. When he heard my answer, he at once expressed his delight that a child of thirteen years should utter such sentiments. He tenderly embraced me, and gave me his blessing.\" This early vocation was to be followed only after the lapse of several years. Eugene had to pass through many trials, and undergo a long period of exile, before the desire of consecrating himself to God in the priesthood could be accomplished. In the meanwhile De Bartolo proceeded in carrying out the pleasing task he had undertaken, of educating the mind, heart, and inner soul of his holy pupil. The intellectual progress of Eugene corresponded with the high expectations which had been formed of his capacity during his stay at the College of Turin. But what delighted his pious teacher most, was to witness the unmistakeable signs of his rapid and solid progress in the knowledge and love of God.\n\nA short journey that he had to make at this time gave him an opportunity of exhibiting, on a small scale, that zeal for the divine glory and the good of souls, which in after years was to display itself over so wide a surface. Madame de Mazenod had to return to France to settle some family affairs. Eugene\naccompanied her to Tuscany. The great revolution was then extending its ramifications: the overthrow of Christianity was its main object. Eugene longed for an opportunity of publicly declaring his faith in Christ crucified, and even of suffering for it. In starting on his journey he hung a large crucifix around his neck, as a symbol of his belief in the great mystery of the redemption, and of his readiness to confess it before the world. The servants at the first hotel at which he stopped on his journey, were tainted with infidel notions. His crucifix was caught sight of, and forthwith they commenced to utter blasphemies against Jesus Christ, and to laugh mockingly at the devout child, who lovingly bore the sacred image. The holy boy, instead of being cowed or intimidated, boldly rebuked them for their unbelief, and reduced them quickly to silence. Their scorn was soon changed into admiration by his words, so full of energy and wisdom, and by his courageous attitude in defending, on that occasion, the interests of religion, which bespoke in him the true confessor of the faith. When he reached Livorno, his party delayed for some days in that city. Eugene made the discovery, that a poor servant in the house where they were staying, was ignorant of the principal mysteries of religion. Filled with zeal in her behalf, he undertook at once the task of instructing her. This became his chief\noccupation during the days he remained in that city. He explained the catechism to her in a manner so interesting, and so full of holy doctrine, that the proprietress of the establishment, a lady of good education, came to listen to him, and acknowledged that she had profited greatly by his instructions. This was a prelude to that ministry of zeal which he was to exercise at a future day in behalf of ignorant and neglected souls. He returned to Venice, and resumed his studies under the direction of De Bartolo. An accident occurred to him about this time, which nearly cost him his life. One day while taking his recreation after dinner, close to his house on the banks of the Grand Canal, his foot slipped, and he fell into the water, which was twelve feet deep. No one was present to render him assistance, but God was watching over a life which was to be dedicated entirely to His glory. He rose again to the surface, and was able to extricate himself without any help. His great fear was, that his mother should hear of the occurrence before he could assure her himself that he was quite safe.\n\nThe tender affectionateness of his disposition, which showed itself so frequently through his life, lessened in no degree that firmness of character, which on future occasions he knew how to employ. The following instance will show how ready he was to trample human respect under foot, whenever the\nfulfilment of a religious duty was in question. One day, being invited to a public dinner at the Spanish Embassy, he perceived that all were taking their places without the usual prayers being said: he remained still standing after the company, which was very numerous, had sat at table. Every eye was fixed upon him. Indignant with himself for having hesitated a moment, he openly made the sign of the Cross; he recited quietly and devoutly the accustomed prayers, not heeding what remarks people might make about him. He has been sometimes heard to say, that he never conquered human respect without being interiorly rewarded by our divine Lord.\n\nIt was Eugene's good fortune, when at Venice, to mix in the society of learned and holy men, and to take part in their conversation. He turned this opportunity to the fullest account, and frequently listened to discussions upon questions of philosophy and religion. Occasionally he interrogated the speakers in terms that filled them with astonishment. They were amazed that one, who was still a child in years, should display such an amount of knowledge, and such lucidity of thought, on abstruse and difficult questions.\n\nThe following incident will show how far he was versed in the question of grace, and what a horror he had conceived of the heresy of Jansenism. A\nlittle book fell into his hands, entitled \"L'ami de la Jeunesse,\" written by the Abb\u00e9 Felasier, which he read with much pleasure, but having discovered that its author was suspected of a tendency to Jansenism, Eugene felt it his duty to write a profession of anti-Jansenist faith in the commencement of the volume. The book was lying on Eugene's table, when one day he was visited by Monseigneur de Montenac, Bishop of Tarbes, who happened to open it and read what Eugene had written. The clear and precise terms in which the subtle heresy of the Jansenists was repudiated, and the opposite doctrine of grace set forth in this profession of Eugene's faith, made it difficult for the good prelate to believe that it had been written by a child.\n\nThat filial reverence and love for the Vicar of Jesus Christ, that readiness to defend the rights of the Holy See, for which he was to become conspicuous in after-life, as a great Bishop of God's Church, began to appear in his early youth. One day, a Canon of Paris forgot himself so far as to indulge in an unbecoming witticism, of which the Holy Father was the object. The high-spirited boy waited to see whether somebody in the company, older than himself, would remonstrate on the impropriety of such language; but finding that nobody undertook this duty, he ventured himself respectfully but courageously to do so. He spoke\nin tones of fearless energy, that startled the aged ecclesiastic into a sense of the impropriety of his language, and silenced him for the rest of the evening. This incident, which was much spoken of, reached the ears of members of the exiled Royal Family of France, and drew words of high praise from their lips.\n\nThe Venetian government, alarmed at the prospect of danger, sent a vessel to rescue the unfortunate man. He gratefully embarked on the Zinelli, and was conveyed to safety. The reception he met with was most cordial; he was treated for life as a distinguished guest. He returned to Naples, where he was received by the prince de Talleyrand, who treated him in terms of the highest consideration. He had to remain in Italy until the French land forces could be landed, when he joined the royalists. In January, 1815, he left Venice, and landed at Genoa. A wretched journey brought him back to Paris on 1st January, 1816, where he died of consumption.\n\nEug\u00e8ne de Mazenod\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nThe army of the French Republic had entered Venice. A further residence in that city was full of danger for the emigr\u00e9s. Eugene's father resolved to remove with his family to Naples. It cost the grateful boy a bitter pang to separate from the Zinelli family, and especially from his beloved preceptor and friend, De Bartolo. The separation was for life; but an intercourse by letter was kept up till the saintly death of the latter. The journey to Naples was decided upon, partly in consequence of the pressing invitation of the family of Baron Talleyrand, with whom the De Mazenods were on terms of intimacy at Venice. The utmost economy had to be practised on that journey. To travel by land from Venice to Naples would be too expensive; the route by sea was consequently selected. They left Venice on the 11th November, 1797, in a wretched cattle-boat, and arrived in Naples on the 1st January, 1798, having spent fifty-one days at sea, and suffered fearful hardships.\n\nEugene passed sorrowfully the year he spent at\nNaples. He led a retired life in that capital, and did not wish to make new acquaintances. He went occasionally with his father to spend the evening with the Marquise de Talleyrand. Whilst at Naples, and again at Palermo, in the salons of the Russian Embassy, he met Admiral Lord Nelson. Speaking in one of his notes of this meeting, he says: \"Nelson, no doubt, is a great sailor, but neither his appearance nor his manner is in his favour.\"\n\nStill onward rolls the tide of Republican triumph. The French army is approaching the gates of Naples. The royal family is preparing for flight. Nelson is commanding a squadron of the British fleet in the Bay of Naples, to afford a safe means of escape for the King and Queen, and their followers. Some Portuguese ships of war are also cruising in the Bay for the same object. The Queen of Naples, who took a kind and deep interest in the De Mazenod family, sent a messenger to inform them of the approaching danger, and to offer them means of escape on board one of the royal ships. On the memorable morning of the 21st of December, 1798, the whole population of Naples and its environs was on the alert at an early hour. A vast multitude advanced tumultuously towards the royal palace. The rumour had spread that the King and Queen were about to flee from Naples, and the people were bent on preventing their flight. It was a moment full of dan-\nger for the French emigr\u00e9s. The Republican army, led by General Championet, was approaching the gates of Naples. A further delay in that city on the part of the emigr\u00e9s would be likely to lead to imprisonment or death. The populace, in frantic dread of the approaching invasion, began to treat all foreigners as Jacobins or spies. Departure from Naples was the only chance of safety. This might have been accomplished easily a few days before, but now access to the shipping is cut off. The streets are full of angry crowds, who block up all approaches to the harbour, being determined to allow nobody to embark. Several poor emigr\u00e9 families who were endeavouring to escape, were seized and cast into prison, and the packages containing their goods were broken open and scattered. Some lost their lives; the Russian Consul received a mortal wound and a royal courier was massacred on that occasion.\n\nThe Portugese Admiral, who was an old friend of Admiral de Mazenod, Eugene\u2019s uncle, had made arrangements for the reception on board his ship of the De Mazenod family. A few sailors were sent on shore to aid in embarking their luggage. Eugene, who had spent the previous night in packing up, started at day-break in company of the armed band of Portugese sailors, unaware of the tumult that had been suddenly aroused in the city. The news of the rapid approach of the Republican army had come\nduring the night, and the city awakened up in terror. Unexpectedly Eugene found himself in the midst of a fierce multitude. His way to the harbour lay through the square that fronted the royal palace, where the crowd was thickest, and the excitement greatest. Eugene was then a youth of seventeen, but he looked already the full-grown man. A glance of his eyes revealed to him the full extent of his danger, and in his heart he renewed the prayer which he had made that morning before setting out upon his way. Who can be so brave in the hour of peril as those who feel that God is with them? Eugene had something to preserve almost as precious in his eyes as his own life; it was the last remnant of the household goods of his family. Modest in bulk, yet it contained many souvenirs, to nearly every one of which was attached some special value. Some were sacred objects, holy vessels of the altar, and vestments which had been in the use of his venerable uncle. Some had a domestic sacredness about them. They had come down as heirlooms\u2014as gifts made upon death beds, by the loving to the beloved. Some were of a more homely character, but their loss would impose grave privations, especially in their present straitened circumstances, on the members of his family. These Eugene was resolved to preserve as a sacred deposit, even at the risk of his life. Some are born to sway crowds;\nthey have the gift of fascinating multitudes. Eugene seemed to be possessed of some such gift on that memorable day. Onward he continued to advance, inspiring with confidence the few brave men who carried his effects, though at every step death stared them in the face. The door of the arsenal was seen in the distance; he resolves to reach it through the crowd. Fierce glances are bent upon him, but no one dares to molest him. He arrives at the arsenal gate. He speaks with authority to the sentinel, and is allowed to pass in. He is saved! That day the rumour had reached his father and his uncle that he had been assassinated. Eugene's presence, happily, dispelled their fears. His first act was to go to the nearest church to give thanks to God for his deliverance from danger, by assisting at the Holy Mass. The next day a reaction set in; the wild excitement that had agitated the population of Naples, gave way to a stupor of despondency. The departure of the emigr\u00e9s was no longer opposed by the people. The King and Queen and royal children took refuge on board Lord Nelson's ship, which immediately put to sea and sailed for Palermo. The following day the De Mazenod family embarked for the same port, in the ship commanded by the Count de Puys\u00e9gur, the Portuguese Admiral. A violent gale suddenly sprang up. Fortunately Eugene's party had not yet left the harbour. But\nthe king and his suite were overtaken by a storm on the high sea. Prince Albert, the king's youngest son, died in the transit from fatigue. For several days the Portuguese ship lay at anchor in the Bay, waiting for the gale to subside. During this delay, Eugene visited the shore to arrange some matters which had been overlooked in the hurry of departure. In returning to the ship, an opportunity was afforded him of giving proof of great personal courage and physical prowess, by which probably several lives, including his own, were saved. They had scarcely put off from the shore, when their little bark was caught in a hurricane. The night had fallen, and it was pitch-dark. The sailors gave themselves up as lost. A poor woman who was going to join her husband on board the ship, lay paralysed with fear. Eugene alone retained his presence of mind. Instinct in that perilous moment served him in place of experience. He assumed the command of the boat, and enforced obedience. His voice was heard above the storm, encouraging the crew to make those desperate efforts that were necessary for their safety. With great difficulty the ship's side was reached. The great frigate rolled fearfully. The little boat threatened every moment to disappear in the surf. With rope in hand, Eugene sprang upon the bulwarks of the ship: the distance he had to span in that leap was so great, that those\nwho witnessed it expected, in the instant, that he would sink midway. Great was their surprise when they saw him emerge from the spray in safety, and proceed heroically to the rescue of the companions of his danger. Palermo was reached on the Feast of the Epiphany, 1799.\n\nEugene had now arrived, in appearance, though not in years, at man's estate. In person he was tall and well-proportioned. A manly beauty shone in his countenance; his bearing was courtly, without being in any way effeminate. A great gentleness of manner, combined with a cheerful disposition, graced his intercourse with those around him. He was a close observer of men and things; in conversation he could pass, with easy transition, from the great questions of religion and politics, which were then agitating Europe, to the eloquent critique on works of ancient and modern art. He had a rare power of putting his soul into his words, especially when virtue had to be defended, or the cause of the poor and afflicted pleaded. We need not be surprised that he should become quickly the favourite of that distinguished society, which was then assembled in Palermo, where the royal family of Naples were holding their Court. He was in particular relationship with the family of Prince Vintimelli, with whom he was connected by ties of kindred. The holy Princess Vintimelli desired very much that\nher two sons, who were grown-up youths, should be brought, as much as possible, into contact with Eugene, to be benefited by the example of his extraordinary virtues. He had a second home in the beautiful residence of the Prince Vintimelli. It was there that he became the intimate companion and friend of the unfortunate Duke de Berry, brother of the martyr-king, Louis XVI., who was a frequent visitor there, and who quickly entered into terms of close friendship with Eugene. They frequently made excursions together, during one of which Eugene met with a severe accident, which became the occasion of his receiving much kindness on the young prince's part.\n\nIt required a virtue as solidly grounded as that of Eugene, to resist the false charms and enticements which the world put in his way at this period of his life. He was possessed of those qualities which the world would seek most for in its favourites,\u2014rank, beauty, a noble bearing, sparkling powers of conversation, a winning fascination of manner, ready wit, and the prospect of some day inheriting great ancestral wealth. He might have become one of its idols, had he so chosen. The paths to its honors and pleasures were open to him. Tempters were not absent, who brought all their powers to bear on his young heart and imagination. Those vices which are too often fostered in the atmosphere\nof Courts, rose as a stumbling block in his way, but they did not cause him to stumble. His heart ever remained chaste and pure. It was tender to overflowing, and full of loving sympathies, but it was also as firm as a rock in resisting the torrent of evil. The chastity of the young christian heart under temptation, is a thing not of sentiment, but of faith. O yes, it is that faith which opens heaven and hell, and the view of the judgment-seat of God, to the eye of the young soul under temptation, which keeps that soul chaste and pure. It is that faith which reveals God's perfections to the gaze of the soul, and fills it with the love of His eternal beauty, that disenchants it from the spell of earthly fascination. His faith was Eugene's safeguard. Living in the midst of a Court, assailed by the most seductive forms of temptation, sometimes having to battle against special temptations, wickedly and designedly put in his way to cause his fall, he allowed not the innocence of his soul to be sullied.\nCHAPTER V.\n\nThe advent of Napoleon to power enabled the emigr\u00e9s to return to their homes. Eugene is again in his native town, Aix, surrounded by the members of his family. The death of his father, who died in the sentiments of a devout and humble Christian, placed him at the head of his house. From the straitened circumstances of his exile, he passed to the sudden possession of great wealth, on the restoration of their estates to his family; but this made no change in the simple and austere habits of his life. It afforded him but greater opportunities of doing good to others. An ample field for the exercise of his charity lay before him. The victims of the revolutionary tempest were craving on every side for help. Crowds of homeless wandering poor were to be met everywhere. The widows and orphans of those who had fallen in the recent wars were, in most cases, left to their own resources. The prisons were full. The sight of all this misery deeply affected the compassionate heart of young\nDe Mazenod; he laboured with all his might to render aid to the suffering poor of his native city. His deepest compassion was excited by the wretched condition of the unhappy prisoners, who had to bear the two-fold torments of close confinement and insufficient food. Their rations consisted almost entirely of black bread. Eugene took a leading part in a society formed for their relief. He himself had recently passed through the privations of a long exile, and learnt thereby to sympathize with those who were there, under his eyes, suffering from cold and hunger within their blank prison walls. Several times every week he visited these poor captives in their cells, distributing with his own hands portions of bread and meat to each, and supplying to those of delicate health such food as their condition needed. There was a charm in his manner that consoled and cheered them, more than any gift of his, by itself, could do. But his enlightened charity aimed more at benefiting their souls than their bodies. He discovered among them many who were steeped in ignorance of the principal truths of religion. These he would come, day after day, to instruct. When he heard of a poor prisoner being condemned to death, he would seek access to him, and endeavour to dispose him to repentance and for the voluntary sacrifice of his life, by his exhortations and prayers, especially during the night preceding the\npoor prisoner's execution, which he would spend with him in his cell.\n\nSome years of Eugene's early manhood, after his return from exile, were spent in the discharge of these works of devoted charity. But his soul sighed for a higher form of promoting the divine glory and of doing good to others, especially to the poor and the spiritually abandoned. The temporal desolation which the Revolution left in its wake, was a small evil to his glance of strong faith, when compared to the spiritual wilderness which it produced on its track. The faithful clergy had been sent en masse either to the scaffold or into exile. Those who managed to conceal themselves were few in number, and broken down by privations. The spiritual abandonment, especially of the poor in country places, was appalling. In sight of these evils, the desire of renouncing the world and of entering the priesthood, to devote himself to the salvation of souls, which had been so long stirring within his breast, now became irresistible. There was much to keep him then in the world. The charms of a holy and happy home, which had special attractions for one with a heart so warm in its affections as his; his duties as the head of his house, and as the last male representative of the elder branch of the De Mazenods; the brilliant worldly career which seemed to lie before him; the prospect of the good\nhe might do as a devout layman in the world. All these obstacles to his vocation yielded to the voice which spoke within his heart, saying, \"Follow thou Me.\"\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nIn the lives of holy personages, we may remark how strikingly God watches over their journeying forwards on the path of their special call. How, at critical and decisive moments, He comes marvellously to their help. How He sends to the individual soul, at the very moment she needs it, her guide, her prophet, her apostle. Thus saints become the precursors of saints. Such was Elias to Eliseus; such was Paul to Timothy; such was Ignatius to Xavier. We have seen, already, how a holy priest rose up upon the path of young De Mazenod, when in exile at Venice, sent on his way by God, to plant the first seeds of the priestly calling in his soul, and to foster their growth by the light and warmth of his teaching and example. Eugene was then a mere youth. Years had to elapse before it was permitted to him to approach the threshold of the sanctuary. He has now arrived at man's estate; a great future is before him. If we lift the curtain of that future, we shall behold, appearing on the scene, the zealous missionary\u2014the holy Founder, in the Church, of a new...\nsociety of apostolic men\u2014the great Bishop of the oldest Christian city in France. All these he will one day become. In his soul, in his mind and heart, there were aptitudes for every single phase and development of his triple calling. But the skilful hand was needed to mould them on the perfect priestly type, and to fit them for the great works which he was called to accomplish. At that time there was in France a man providentially raised up by the hand of God, as another Noah, whose ark, during the revolutionary tempest, was to ride upon the waters of the deluge, laden with the germs of the priestly life, for the bringing forth of new generations of learned and holy priests in his country, after the floods had subsided. The venerable Abb\u00e9 Emery, the worthy successor of M. Olier, and the faithful disciple of his virtues, was then Superior of St. Sulpice. He was an intrepid confessor of the faith; he suffered imprisonment, and was condemned to be guillotined, but escaped death by a sort of miracle. But he was to exhibit no less courage and firmness in opposing the daring encroachments of Napoleon upon the liberties of the Church. One day, during his contest with the saintly Pius VII., the Emperor sent for M. Emery, and asked, in a tone of furious anger, \"What is the Pope?\" \"Sire,\" he replied, \"I can hold no other opinion on that point than that which is contained\nin the catechism, taught by your Majesty's orders in all the churches of France: 'The Pope is the Head of the Church, the Vicar of Jesus Christ, to whom all christians owe obedience.' Can a body exist without its head, without Him to whom, by Divine right, it owes obedience?' \"Well,\" rejoined the Emperor, \"I grant the spiritual power; but the temporal power was given to the Pope by Charlemagne, and I, as Charlemagne's successor, feel bound to take it back from him, because he does not know how to use it, and it hinders him in the discharge of his spiritual functions.\" Emery was prepared for this attack. \"Your Majesty,\" he said, \"knows the great Bossuet, and Bossuet, Sire, speaks thus: 'We are all aware that the Roman Pontiffs and the priestly order have received, by the grant of kings, and do lawfully hold, property, rights, and principalities, as other men do, on very good titles. We know that these possessions, inasmuch as they are dedicated to God, should be sacred, and that no one can, without sacrilege, invade or seize them, or give them away to seculars. To the Apostolic See has been given the Sovereignty of the City of Rome, and of other possessions, that the Holy See may, more freely and securely, exercise its power throughout the whole world. On this we sincerely congratulate, not only the Apostolic See, but also the Universal Church; and we pray, with all the fervor...\"\nvour of our heart, that this sacred principle may remain safe and untouched.'\u201d Napoleon then broke off the conference. The Emperor afterwards said: \u201cThe Abb\u00e9 Emery spoke as a man who is thoroughly master of his subject. I like to be talked to in that way.\u201d\u2014(Darras\u2019 History of the Church.)\n\nUnited to this firmness, which was unmoved under the frown of princes and under the shadow of the scaffold, in M. Emery we find a deep and tender piety, a most ardent love of Jesus Christ, especially in the mystery of the Holy Eucharist, a child-like devotion to the Blessed Virgin, a zeal for religious discipline and exactitude, and also for the sanctification of souls, but especially for the sanctification of the clergy. Such was the spiritual master and guide which a special and loving Providence ordained for Eugene de Mazenod, as he approached the holy mountain of God, in following His call to the priestly state. The virtues and the spirit of the saintly Emery seemed to run, like liquid gold, into the mind and heart and bearing of young De Mazenod, in whose life they will often appear again in bright traits of priestly, and religious, and episcopal perfection.\n\nDuring the years which he spent in the seminary of St. Sulpice, he was privileged by being admitted, from the beginning, to the intimate friendship and confidence of the venerable M. Emery, who was then\napproaching his eightieth year. He was daily invited to M. Emery's room, and he frequently enjoyed the advantage of his intimate conversation. Considering the burning questions that were then agitating Europe, and France especially, of the right solution of many of which M. Emery held the key, such conversations must have been most profitable in forming the ecclesiastical mind of De Mazenod. He had been but a short time promoted to deacons' orders, when he was to be deprived of his spiritual father and friend. The good fight had been fought, and the faith had been kept, even in prison and under chains, and God was about to call His faithful servant to Himself, to give him the crown of glory he so well merited. M. Emery may be said to have died in the arms of the Abb\u00e9 de Mazenod, who was his constant attendant during his last illness. After his death, the Abb\u00e9 de Mazenod wrote in the following terms, to his mother, of the last illness and death of his spiritual father and friend:\n\n\"If you read the public journals, you will not be surprised at my prolonged silence. We have lost our venerable Superior. During his last illness, all my time was employed in waiting upon him; and, after his death, which we all feel most deeply, the carrying out of the funeral arrangements devolved chiefly on me. To give you a true idea of the virtue of M. Emery, I should have to borrow the tongues of all men of merit to whom he was known. His death is one of the greatest calamities which could befall the Church in France, in the present critical times. He was the only bond...\"\nof union capable of holding together the divided spirits of these sad times. All parties respected him, and acknowledged the sway of his undisputed merits. The Emperor himself was silent in his presence. He was one of those noble spirits\u2014alas! so rare in our days\u2014who could not betray a duty, nor forsake a right principle. At the same time he possessed, in a supreme degree, the gift of conciliating all parties. He was, in a word, such a man as the Church most needed among her defenders in the present crisis. But God, who would have us feel that it is on Himself alone we should place our confidence, has taken from us one who seemed to be our last resource. May His holy will be in all things accomplished! I shall never forget the example of priestly vigour and energy which he gave us up to the last. He yielded only when the approach of death laid him prostrate. It was impossible to prevent him from saying the Divine Office on his sick bed. As his end approached, he insisted on saying the Holy Mass once more before he died. It was a touching sight to behold that venerable priest, who was close upon his eightieth year, supported by two assistants, slowly advancing to the altar, thereon to offer the sacrifice of his life to the Lamb that he, with trembling hands, was about to immolate. It was my happiness to serve that last Mass. Deeply was I moved in witnessing this holy priest, who was almost in the agony of death, celebrating the sacred mysteries. The impressions then produced will remain ever indelible in my breast.\"\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nAfter his ordination as priest, his distinguished merits opened to him the path of early preferment, but it was not for the sake of the honours of the sanctuary that he quitted those of the world. During the years of his seminary life, he had constantly before his mind the motive which had induced him to abandon the world, and to embrace the ecclesiastical state\u2014that of spending himself in labours for the souls of the poor and the spiritually destitute. The prisoners of Aix, his native town, where, as a layman, he had exercised already a true apostleship of zeal, came first before his mind. After his ordination, he felt a burning desire to labour among those poor prisoners. His ecclesiastical superiors willingly seconded his zealous wishes. Though not officially named Chaplain of the prison, he performed all the duties attached to that office. He felt moved, by an interior impulse to seek occasions of accompanying criminals to the scaffold, and marvellous were the fruits of his courageous and pious zeal in this doleful ministry. Hardened hearts were\nsoftened by his words to repentance, and many died craving for mercy, who, had it not been for his charitable endeavours in their behalf, would have died in their despair. At that time a large number of Austrian prisoners of war arrived at Aix. Shortly after their arrival, a fearful plague broke out in their midst; their chaplain, their physician, and the military officer in charge of them, were carried off amongst the first victims of this dreadful malady. The Abb\u00e9 de Mazenod hastened to offer his services to those poor, plague-stricken prisoners. The civil authorities were slow to accept this generous offer, being unwilling to expose a life so precious as his to so grave a danger; for in the eyes of the public it was looked upon as certain death for any one to enter into the plague-stricken circle where those poor prisoners lay. But he was not to be deterred by such fears; looking on it as a privilege to be coveted, were God so to will it, to die on such a battle-field of priestly devotedness. He was not long permitted to discharge his ministry of zeal amongst the victims of the plague, when the dread malady seized upon himself. Finding himself attacked, as he thought mortally, before taking to his bed, he went for the last time, as it seemed to him, to celebrate the holy sacrifice of the Mass, and to offer himself as a victim to God, in union with the Divine Victim of the altar. When it was known that the\nAbb\u00e9 de Mazenod was lying amongst the victims of the plague, a deep and universal sorrow spread amongst the inhabitants of Aix. The churches were filled with devout crowds, imploring of God the favour of his recovery. The last sacraments had been administered to him, and he sank into unconsciousness, and it seemed that his death could not be long delayed. But God was moved by the earnest prayers offered for his recovery, and a favourable crisis put an end to the anxious fears felt for his life.\n\nOn his recovery he felt, in his gratitude to God, still more than ever called to devote himself to the work of promoting the divine glory, and of labouring for the salvation of souls. At Aix he found himself surrounded by young men of the upper classes. The example of his sacrifices, the fervour of his exhortations, and the sway of his personal influence, drew them around him, and attached them to him in filial reverence and submission. Availing himself of the favourable dispositions on their part, he formed them into a society entitled, \"La Congr\u00e9gation de la Jeunesse Chr\u00e9tienne.\" This society became thoroughly imbued with the spirit of its holy founder; consisting, as it did, of young men belonging to the first families of Aix, the edification given by those who composed it was the more impressive. Many came forth from it to shed the\nlustre of high christian virtue on their various paths of life. This association presented many vocations to the priesthood, and some of the first missionary companions of Father de Mazenod were drawn from its ranks.\n\nBut the evangelizing of the rich was not the mission that he was to choose as the work of his predilection; his heart was set upon labouring among the poor. Those splendid gifts of mind and utterance and of personal prestige which he possessed, were not to be employed in drawing around him fashionable crowds in favoured localities, but they were to be lavished amidst the poor in the villages of Provence, or amongst the working classes in the slums of great cities. \"He has sent me to preach the gospel to the poor,\" was his chosen motto.\n\nBut he aimed at doing a greater good than could be accomplished by his individual efforts. Association with kindred spirits became a necessity, in his mind, for the evangelizing of the masses of the poor, on the scale which his ardent zeal suggested to him. He looked around him for those who would be fit and willing to join in his undertaking; he prayed much for light and assistance from God in this most important matter\u2014the selection of the first companions of his labours. He felt that the missionaries should be not only men of action, but men of prayer, in order to walk worthily in the footsteps of the\nApostles, and gain souls to Jesus Christ. He felt that if the missionaries were to sanctify themselves whilst working for others, that the exhaustive labours of the missionary life should be preceded and followed by fitting intervals of community life, with its circle of religious exercises, its practice of obedience and humility, and its opportunities for sacred studies and quiet reflection. His first aim was to bring around him men gifted with a spirit of interior piety\u2014lovers of solitude and retirement, but ready, for the good of souls, to go forth at the call of obedience into the midst of the crowd, yea, to the ends of the earth, if the saving of souls demanded it. He found little difficulty in bringing to his side helpers in his missionary works, but he had not yet found that man of God who would be his second self in the foundation of the work to which the Divine spirit was leading him. God is not slow in seconding the designs of those who labour with a pure intention for His glory. At that time, the recollection of a young priest, the Abb\u00e9 Tempier, with whom Father de Mazenod had formed an acquaintance when both were pursuing their studies at St. Sulpice, and whom he esteemed very much for his great piety, rare prudence, learning, modesty, and spirit of regularity, came vividly before his mind. An interior voice seemed to say to his soul: \"This is he after whom you have been seeking as the associate...\"\nof your undertaking.\" Presently, after an invocation of the Holy Spirit, he sat down and wrote to the Abb\u00e9 Tempier, who was then at Arles, the following impressive and beautiful letter:\n\n\"Aix, October 9th, 1815.\n\n\"My Dear Friend,\n\n\"Read this letter at the foot of your Crucifix, with the intention of listening to the voice of God alone, and of considering only what the interests of His glory, and the salvation of souls, demand of you. Impose silence in your soul on all cravings of the natural man for the goods of this life; renounce all seeking for your own ease and convenience; reflect seriously on the spiritual destitution of our poor, especially in rural districts; consider how great the number of those is, who have already fallen away from the faith, and what multitudes are now exposed to a like danger. Irreligion and apostacy are making a frightful havoc of souls in our midst, and little is being done to impede the progress of such evils. Question your own heart, and ask yourself what sacrifice are you prepared to make, in order to take your part in the remedying of these disasters, and then answer my letter without delay.\n\n\"In truth, my dear friend, and I will speak to you plainly, you are necessary for the work which I feel the Lord has inspired me to undertake. The Head of the Church is firmly of the opinion, that in the present deplorable state of France, missions alone can bring the people back to the faith which they have actually abandoned. And the views of the Supreme Pastor are fully borne out by all that we know of the spiritual desolation of different dioceses. I am profoundly convinced, that in missions lies the remedy for this deplorable state of things. Full of this conviction, and placing entire reliance on God, I have undertaken to found in this diocese a house of missionaries, who,\ngiving the example of a truly sacerdotal spirit, will endeavour unceasingly to destroy the empire of Satan, and draw souls to God, by their labours amongst the poor, especially in rural districts. We shall live together in a house which I have purchased, according to a rule which we shall unanimously adopt. We shall be happy in this holy society, which will have but one heart and one soul. One part of the year will be employed in the conversion of souls, and the other in retreat, study, and our own sanctification. I shall say no more to you about it just now. This is enough to give you a foretaste of the spiritual pleasures we shall enjoy together. If, as I hope, you will become one of us, you will not find yourself in an unknown land. You will have four companions. As yet we are not more numerous, for we wish to choose men who have the will and the courage to tread in the footsteps of the Apostles. We must begin by laying solid foundations. We must introduce and establish the greatest regularity in the house, as soon as we enter it ourselves. And this is the precise reason why you are so necessary for me, for I know you have the courage to embrace, and the steadfastness to follow out, a life of strict religious observance. When I receive your reply, I will give you all the details you may wish for. But in the meantime, my dear friend, I would entreat you not to demur taking part in this good work, which is one of the greatest we could undertake for the interests of God's Holy Church. It will be easy to find somebody to take your place in the post you now occupy. But it is not easy for me to find men who wish to devote and consecrate themselves to the glory of God, and the salvation of souls, without any reward upon earth; but with the certain prospect before them of much fatigue, and of many of those trials and contradictions which our Lord predicted would be the lot of His true disciples. Your refusal would be exceedingly detrimental to our rising work. I speak with sincerity and reflection. Your modesty will suffer, but no matter. I will even add, that, if I thought\nit necessary to go to Arles, in order to determine you, I would do so at once. Everything depends upon our beginning well; on our being of one mind, and united in devotedness. With you at my side, this will be possible. Lose no time, then, in sending me an affirmative answer, and I shall be satisfied.\n\n\"Adieu, my beloved Brother.\"\n\nTo the foregoing letter the following reply was forwarded by the Abb\u00e9 Tompier:\n\n\"SIR, AND VERY DEAR BROTHER,\n\n\"May God be blessed for having inspired you with the design of establishing a house of missionaries, to preach the gospel to the poor, especially to those poor people who, living in remote country districts, are most destitute of spiritual aids. I assure you, my very dear brother, that I completely share your views. Far from needing your pressing entreaties to join in a work so much in harmony with my own wishes, had I been acquainted with your plans, I would have been the first to beg admission into your society. Accept my humble thanks for judging me worthy to be your fellow-labourer in the work of promoting the glory of God, and the salvation of souls. It is true I do not possess the gift of eloquence necessary for a missionary; but alius sic\u2014alias autem sic. What I may not be able to effect by eloquent sermons, I will try to make up for by catechetical instructions and familiar discourses, by my labours in the tribunal of penance, and by such humble works of zeal for establishing the reign of Jesus Christ in souls, as may come within my reach. I shall find nothing low or painful in any humble or laborious function of the missionary life. In the meantime, practice will make me more familiar with the duties of the holy ministry than I am at present. Moreover, I clearly see what you wish to find in those you choose as your fellow-labourers. You want priests who, as our\nFather Director in the Seminary used to say, 'Do not follow the ordinary humdrum of routine'\u2014priests who are willing to walk in the footsteps of the Apostles, and to labour for the salvation of souls, without expecting any return on this earth, but much toil and hardship. By God's grace, I feel in myself this desire; or if I feel it not, I eagerly wish to do so. I am sure, with your help, everything will become easy to me; so you may fully reckon upon my good will and cooperation.\n\n\"Good-bye, very dear Brother.\n\n\"Templer.\"\n\nFather de Mazenod wrote again in these terms:\u2014\n\n\"May God be blessed, my very dear Brother, for the holy dispositions which He has awakened in your heart. You cannot believe what joy I felt on reading your letter. I opened it with some anxiety, but was soon consoled. I assure you, that I consider it most important for the work of God, that you be one of us. I depend more on you than on myself, for the fervour and regularity of a community which, in my ideas and hopes, will imitate the perfection of the first disciples of the Apostles. I rest my hopes more firmly upon that than upon grand sermons. Have grand sermons ever converted anybody? Oh, how well, with God's blessing, you will perform your part in this important affair! Why are you not near me, in order that I might press you to my heart? How sweet are the bonds of perfect charity! Humble yourself as much as you like, but nevertheless know that you are necessary for the work of the missions. I speak to you before God and with sincerity. If we only wanted to go and preach the word of God in an off-hand way, to go through the country with the view, if you like, of gaining souls to God, but without taking much trouble to become ourselves interior men\u2014truly apostolic men, I think it would not be hard to find some one instead of you. But can you believe that I want people of that\nstamp? We must simply be saints ourselves. This word comprises everything. The second reason why I look upon your resolution of joining us as a gift from heaven, is the need we have of a priest who thinks, as you do, regarding the interior of our community. I am so sure we shall always understand one another, that I am not afraid to make a promise of never thinking differently from you on anything relating to the interior life, and to the obligations of the priestly calling, which are more comprehensive than they are generally supposed to be. We will draw up together, when we meet, our regulations, and take mutual counsel with one another regarding all that God may inspire us to do, for our own sanctification, and the good of our neighbour.\n\n\"Good-bye, my very dear and good Brother. I embrace you from my heart, and long for the happy moment of our meeting.\n\n\"EUGENE DE MAZENOD.\"\n\nTo this letter the Abb\u00e9 Tempier wrote the following reply:\n\n\"ARLES, December 20th, 1815.\n\n\"Holy Friend and true Brother,\n\n\"I cannot tell you how much you have done for my salvation. You are truly the dearest friend of my heart. I loved you before, and had a special esteem for you; but since you have fixed your eyes upon me with the intention of associating me with yourself, in your apostolic labours, and of making me a sharer in the fruits of holiness, which we shall find in our dear congregation, I have no words to express my sentiments in your regard. May God be praised for all that he has inspired you to do for me. I would beg of you, however, to moderate the too good opinion you have formed of me, and not to think me so necessary for the work you have undertaken, as you are pleased to say I am. You\nmay find yourself disappointed, when you are in a position to form a true judgment of me. You will soon see that if I have a certain amount of good will, I have little else beside. I am determined to leave for Aix on the day after Christmas, with the firm resolution of not returning to Arles.\n\n\"Good-bye, my very dear and good Brother, let us pray earnestly to the Lord that He may bless our undertaking, if it be conformable to His will.\n\n\"Tempier.\"\n\nOn the feast of St. John the Evangelist, 1815, Father Tempier arrived in Aix, and became the humble and loving disciple of Father de Mazenod. This spiritual relationship continued unbroken, unchilled, and unclouded, for a period extending over forty-five years. A few weeks elapsed after the meeting of the two holy friends, before their plans were ripe for execution. They saw one another every day, and, we might add, all day long. They mutually encouraged and comforted each other, and prepared themselves for that great act which, according to God's intention, was to give birth to a new religious family in His Church. Father de Mazenod had already purchased a residence for his future community. It was an old Carmelite Convent, from which the daughters of St. Teresa had been driven forth in the time of the revolution, and which had since then been in secular hands. He felt happy in being the instrument, in God's hands, of re-awakening within those holy cloisters the chant of the\ndivine praises, after so many years of sorrowful silence.\n\nOn the 25th of January, 1816, Father de Mazenod, Father Tempier, Father Mye, and two others, assembled together for the first time in community, the requisite diocesan sanction being obtained. The new Congregation was then founded. A Superior had to be chosen. His companions at once named Father de Mazenod to that office. In his humility, he refused its title and functions. He suggested that they should spend some days in fasting and praying, and then proceed to the regular nomination of a Superior. This being done, the choice again falling upon him, he at last consented to accept the office of Superior, but with the express condition that he himself might be allowed to practice obedience under the direction of Father Tempier.\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nEvery christian virtue flourished in the new community, the members of which rivalled one another in the ardent love of God, and in heroic charity for their neighbour. They were all of one mind and one heart. The fragrance of their virtues went abroad, and other disciples came to range themselves under the guidance of Father de Mazenod. He possessed an extraordinary power of moulding souls upon his own type. There was a holy fascination in his manner which few could resist. He had the facility of setting hearts on fire with the purest flames of holy love, simply by his ordinary conversation. This came from his vivid faith. It was his habit to speak of the mysteries of faith, as if they were not mysteries, but things that he saw and touched and handled. The brightness of his faith was ever acting on the tenderness of his heart; hence the copiousness of his weeping at the foot of the altar, which frequently overtook him whilst celebrating the Holy Sacrifice of Christ\u2019s Body and Blood, or whilst officiating at Exposition or Pro-\ncession of the Blessed Sacrament. The writer of these lines once saw him, when Bishop of Marseilles, in presence of the Blessed Sacrament, kneeling before the high altar of the cathedral of that city; his face was flushed with emotion, and the great tears chased one another down his venerable cheeks. The occasion was the opening of a novena of prayer for the conversion of England. After the ceremony we ventured to ask the holy prelate the cause of his emotion. \"My child,\" the good bishop replied, \"I could not help weeping when I thought of England, once so Catholic, once the island of saints, but now overrun with all manner of heresies.\" These manifestations of vivid faith, and of a piety tender and vehement at the same time, were frequent occurrences in his priestly and episcopal life. Cardinal Giraud, Archbishop of Cambrai, who was a cleric in minor orders at Amiens, when Father de Mazenod was ordained priest in the cathedral of that city, and who, the next morning, served his first Mass, thus describes in a conversation he held with Monsigneur Jeancard, shortly after Monsigneur de Mazenod's death, the impression produced on him by what he witnessed on that occasion: \"Father de Mazenod, turning to those who were then present to ask their prayers before beginning his first Mass, was carried away by an outburst of faith and fervour, to utter words that astonished all present, and\nbrought tears to every eye. I never heard such a discourse; I never witnessed anything like the effect produced by it. The emotion was general, and I was overcome like the others. We were all in tears. His words seemed to raise us out of ourselves, and above things of earth, and to transport us to some region all on fire with the love of God. The furnace of his own loving heart seemed to communicate its flames to our breasts. What lofty ideas of the priesthood, of the sacrifice of the altar, and of the mission upon which he was entering, did he not then impart to us: what eloquence vibrated in his impassioned words! No, it was not eloquence simply; it was an outpouring of the Holy Spirit that came rushing on as an impetuous torrent, flooding our souls with the love of God. Forty years have since passed away, and the remembrance of that fervid discourse is still fresh within my breast. I shall never forget it.\" As a priest, Father de Mazenod never administered Baptism without shedding tears, when the moment for conferring that sacrament arrived. Afterwards, as a bishop, in administering the Sacrament of Holy Orders, when the moment came for conferring the priestly character on those who were to be ordained, he found it often impossible to control his sighs and tears, so affected was he by a lively sense of the sublime function he was performing.\nThere was a startling energy in his utterances when denouncing vice, even in ordinary conversation. Impressed, as he habitually was, with a sense of the infinite perfections of God, he felt in the keenest way any failing in reverence in holy places; and still more, any grievous violation of God's law that came under his notice. In his sermons there was an absence of empty enthusiasm and effervescence, but there was an earnestness of conviction in every word he said, which kindled, as he went along, into a sort of prophet-like power of speech, which in turn smote with fear, awakened tenderest hope, and excited to a heroic love of God. He seemed ever to live for those around him, and not for himself merely. The young novice, approaching him for the first time, was often amazed to find how quickly he was understood and sympathized with, and how he had found a father's kindly care, and a mother's tender fondness, in his new Superior. This came from a special gift, which the venerable founder of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate had received from God, to fit him for that patriarchal office which he was to exercise in holy Church, as the founder of a new family of missionaries, who were to go forth to the ends of the earth, bearing the tidings of salvation to many sitting in darkness, and in the shadow of death. One day the holy founder expressed himself to the writer thus: \"God\nhas conferred on the founders of religious orders special gifts to fit them for their special works. St. Ignatius, St. Philip Neri, the blessed Liguori, had each his own peculiar and appropriate gift. The gift, my son, which God I feel has conferred upon me, unworthy though I am to be named with those great servants of His, is that of the love of a mother for her children.\" But there was no weakness in the tenderness of his love for his spiritual sons. His aim was to make them truly apostolic men, and missionaries of the poor. This end he sought to accomplish first by his own example. In him they saw one who had trampled the world under foot, at a moment when some of its highest dignities and emoluments, and of its most captivating pleasures were within his reach, to give himself to an austere and humble mode of life, and to the work of a laborious and obscure ministry. His fasts were frequent; several times in the week he used the discipline; his brief sleep was taken upon a hard bed; his meals were of the simplest and most frugal kind. Looking on himself as the servant of the poor, he would imitate the poor, as far as priestly propriety would allow, in the manner of his attire. His cassock was often threadbare, and sometimes patched with his own hands, but always perfectly clean and without a speck. The length and fervour of his prayers, and his profound and loving rever-\nence when in the presence of the Blessed Sacrament, afforded a grand lesson of practical piety to all who had the privilege of dwelling with him under the same roof. The first, himself, at every spiritual exercise, he stimulated all round him to regularity and fervour in keeping the appointed hours of community worship. His zeal was unbounded for the sanctification of his first companions. Several times every week he addressed spiritual conferences to the members of his new community. He would speak to them so strikingly, as often to move them to tears, of the necessity of imitating Jesus Christ in his life of obedience and humility, silence and prayer, in the obscurity of Nazareth, in order afterwards to go forth as his disciples, to save souls with Him. The holy Founder spared not the reprimand or reproach when he deemed such to be needed. A simple irreverence in the divine worship, some want of punctuality in the performance of religious exercises, or some negligence in keeping the rules of the community, would draw from his lips expressions of reproof so severe and stern, that one would be disposed to tax them with exaggeration, who took not into account the burning zeal of Father de Mazenod for the perfection of those whom God had intrusted to his care. He possessed a marvellous tact in discovering the secret virtues and the hidden weaknesses of his subjects. The latter, with resolute yet\ngentle hand, he would seek to weed out, in order to give full play to the growth of the former. No amount of good dispositions, or brilliancy of talents, would cause him to shut his eyes to a real defect in a member of his community, no matter what it would cost his own feelings, or what pain it would cause to somebody very dear to him; he would not rest until the evil was amputated, and the defect torn up by the root.\n\nTwo short months of holy community-life had barely elapsed when Fathers de Mazenod and Tempier felt mutually drawn, by the Spirit of God, to perform an act which would bind them still more to the divine service, and place them in a state of holy dependence upon one another. On the night of Holy Thursday, 1816, which these two devoted priests spent together in adoration before the Altar of Repose, after hours passed in prayer, each knelt before the other, and pronounced the vow of obedience one to the other. They united this act of self-immolation with the mystery of Calvary, which they were then commemorating. This was an act of private devotion on the part of Fathers de Mazenod and Tempier, of which the other members of the community at Aix were not cognizant.\n\nThe first mission given by the newly-formed community of Aix, opened at Grans on February 11th, and closed on March 17th. It produced an abun-\ndant harvest of souls. Two years well nigh elapsed, during which Father de Mazenod, and his little body of missionaries, laboured with extraordinary fruits of benediction in different towns and hamlets of Provence. Their numbers had already considerably increased. A second house had been founded, Notre Dame de Laus, in the diocese of Gap. Father de Mazenod felt that the time had come to give a more definite form to his work, and to prepare a code of constitutions and rules for the new society. Hitherto he had confined himself to the establishing of general regulations, whilst waiting for the acquiring of further experience, and additional light from God, to complete his work. Now he feels the time has come to put his undertaking into definite shape, and to draw up the final rules for the government and mode of life of the members of his society.\n\nOne of the family estates of Father de Mazenod was situated at St. Laurent de Verdon, a hamlet in the department of the Lower Alps. On it stood an ancient Chateau, the favorite resort of the De Mazenods in former times, when they sought repose from official labours in the silent woods in which it was embedded, and amidst the noble mountain scenery by which it was surrounded. It was to this spot, so favorable to quiet contemplation and retirement, that Father de Mazenod came to draw up the\nconstitutions and rules of his new institute. He sought for a spot where he could reflect and pray much, without being distracted by missionary works or the concourse of visitors, whilst occupied with the important task he had laid before himself. His companions were Father Moureau and Father Susanne. His venerable mother, Madame de Mazenod, knowing for what object her holy son was going to St. Laurent de Verdon, begged that she also might be allowed to accompany him. This truly christian mother deserves a special notice in this biographical sketch. The great virtues of Eugene de Mazenod, which ripened with his years into heroic deeds, were in a large measure, under God, the result of her training and of her example. Instead of throwing obstacles in the way of her son's vocation, as too many weak-minded and selfish mothers in similar cases would have done, she, on the contrary, did everything she could to aid and encourage her son in accomplishing the sacrifice which God demanded of him. He revered her, not merely as his mother, but as a great servant of God, and sought her counsel and her prayers somewhat as we may believe St. Augustine did those of St. Monica. Madame de Mazenod took with her, as a companion on that occasion, to St. Laurent de Verdon, an aged lady friend\u2014the Marquise de Requesse.\n\nThe Ch\u00e2teau of St. Laurent became for the time\na holy solitude. Its inmates held no communication with the external world: no visits were made or received. A rule of life drawn up by Father de Mazenod was strictly followed by all. At an early hour, all rose and engaged in mental prayer. A great part of the day was given to silence and private devotion. Everybody seemed anxious to draw down, by fervent and prolonged prayers, the blessings of the Holy Spirit on the work of Father de Mazenod. The venerable founder himself redoubled his prayers and austerities for the same object. Two months were thus spent at St. Laurent de Verdon.\n\nIt was during that time that Father de Mazenod drew up the code of rules and constitutions of his new congregation. Page after page of this holy volume was written by him on his knees, with his missionary cross placed before him, to serve, no doubt, as his source of inspiration, and to suggest to him the framing of such laws for the spiritual government of the members of his society, as would bring their lives most into conformity with the image of Christ Jesus crucified, and would help them to imitate this divine model in labouring for the salvation of souls.\n\nIn the opening pages of the first chapter he treats of the ends of the society, which he declares to be the evangelizing of the poor; the direction of seminaries for the training of young ecclesiastics, and in\ngeneral the guidance of the young in the ways of piety; and the giving of retreats to the clergy and laity, in the houses of the society, or elsewhere. In the second chapter he lays down regulations for the giving of missions, which he declares to be the chief means by which the society is to accomplish its end of evangelizing the poor. In the third chapter he enters minutely into the mode of government and order of discipline, of the theological seminaries under the care of the Fathers of the society. In the fourth chapter he treats of preaching and of the administering of the sacraments; the direction of youths; the visiting of prisons; the assisting of the dying; the performing of the canonical hours; and the public spiritual exercises to be held during the year in the churches of the society. In the second section, chapter the first, he treats of the vows of poverty, chastity, obedience, and perseverance. In the second chapter of the same section, he lays down rules for the observance of silence, and of interior recollection, for the proper distribution of the devotional exercises of the community, and also for the practice of mortification, and for the community meetings and conferences. In the third chapter of this section, he speaks of the virtues which the members of the society should chiefly practise, such as charity, humility, and renouncement of the world. He speaks also, in this chapter, of the reception of\nthe sacraments and spiritual direction, of the food and raiment of the members of the society, of intercourse with the neighbour, and of journeys. In the fourth chapter, second section, he lays down rules for the care of the sick members of the society, for the assistance of the dying, and for suffrages for the dead. In the third section he treats of the government of the society. There are special paragraphs in this section on the General Chapter, the Superior-General, the Assistants, Provincials, Local Superiors, and also on the noviciate; on the qualities candidates should have, to be admitted to the novice-ship, and on the reception of lay-brothers.\n\nThis rapid analysis of the rules of the society of the Oblates of Mary, will serve at least to make manifest the character of the work undertaken by its holy founder, during his seclusion in the Ch\u00e2teau of St. Laurent de Verdon. His first aim, in the drawing up of the rules of the new society, was to provide for the sanctification of its members; that they, being made holy themselves, might the more efficaciously labour for the sanctification of many. No very great austerity is imposed by the letter of these rules; at the same time, their spirit, if thoroughly imbibed, will lead to the crucifixion of the carnal man, and to a close imitation of the penitential life of the servants of God in all ages. Prayer, study, labour, the love of Jesus Christ, and\ntender devotion to His Blessed Mother, are the norma of the life of the true Oblate of Mary Immaculate. Such was the ideal which rose, in the vision of his prayer, to the mind of this new law-maker, whom the Spirit of God led up as if to the summit of another Sinai, there to reveal to him the precepts of holiness, which he was to deliver to the little band of chosen souls who had followed him from Egypt into the desert.\n\nFATHER Laurence, which Aix, by reflection had conceived which he composed his composition read a writing work read, very devoutly Self-improvisation observance led to an urged make of holy will hearts i\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nFather de Mazenod having completed the work which he undertook in seeking the solitude of St. Laurent de Verdon, returned to his community at Aix, bearing with him the precious fruits of his reflection and prayer, in the code of rules which he had completed. It was during the annual retreat, which was to close on the Feast of All Saints, that he communicated the knowledge of those rules to his community. Every day during the retreat he read a portion of the rules, and delivered, in burning words, a *viva voce* commentary on the portions read, which wonderfully moved the hearts of his devout hearers to receive them and observe them. Self-immolation was the theme of those glowing improvisations. He showed them how the faithful observance of the rules of life he proposed to them, led to a mystical death to self and the world. He urged them to become voluntary victims, and to make of themselves holocausts on the altar of God's holy will. A common desire sprang up within their hearts in listening to the words of their still youth-\nful though, by virtue, most venerable Superior. It was that of dying with him to the world, by the perpetual consecration of themselves to God. \"Eamus et nos ut moriamur cum eo.\" \"Let us also go that we may die with him,\" was the sentiment of their loving devotedness at the close of the retreat.\n\nOn the morning of the Feast of All Saints, the 1st of November, 1818, the whole community assisted at the Mass of the Superior-General. Before the communion, he addressed to the community a fervent exhortation. He then made known that he had the sanction of the Vicars-Capitular of the diocese of Aix, to receive their vows. Prostrating himself before the Blessed Sacrament, he pronounced aloud the formula of his own vows. Father Tempier then pronounced his vows, as also did Fathers Mye, Courtes, and others. Another important layer is now solidly placed on the foundations of the new society, and we shall see it rise, tier upon tier, until the summit of the edifice will be crowned by the hand of Peter with its finishing stone.\n\nA few days after the solemn ceremony of public pronouncing of vows by the community, the work of the missions was recommenced with new ardour. The missionaries of Provence, as they were then called, headed by their devoted Superior, Father de Mazenod, went from town to town, and from village to village, South and North, and all around, where the people were gathered in year by year. This missionaried Father M. Foucault, Superior General, Father Tempier, crowded round to his side. Mazenod's name was then heard in Marseille, in courses of study, master classes, and turned into evangelists among children who had been forgotten. A greater battle than thought possible by poor by poor and his followers arrived\nvillage to village, through many dioceses in the South of France, sowing the seed of the divine word, and always seeking, by preference, those places where the poor most abounded, and where souls were in the greatest spiritual destitution. In the year 1820 a great mission was opened at Marseilles. This mission was conducted by two bodies of missionaries. The missionaries of France, of whom M. Forbin Janson, afterwards Bishop of Nancy, was Superior; and the missionaries of Provence, under Father de Mazenod. The evangelizing of the most crowded and the poorest parishes of Marseilles fell, to his great gratification, to the share of Father de Mazenod and his missionaries. As the Proven\u00e7al was the popular language of the poorer localities of Marseilles, Father de Mazenod delivered all his discourses in that language, of which he was perfect master. He gained complete sway over those fiery and turbulent masses whom he had undertaken to evangelize. They became quiet and tractable as children under his guidance; ancient feuds were forgotten; multitudes of men, who had spent the greater part of their lives in the camp or on the battle field, and who had never once for years thought of God, were awakened up from their torpor by the inspired preaching of Father de Mazenod and his companions. During the mission, the news arrived in Marseilles of the assassination of the Duc\nde Berry. The inhabitants of the parishes evangelized by Father de Mazenod were intensely royalist, and a popular outbreak was dreaded on their part; but his influence was successful in calming them down. Several of the leading spirits among them afterwards confessed, that it was the influence alone of Father de Mazenod which checked their projects of vengeance against that party at Marseilles, whom they looked upon as being friendly to the enemies of the unfortunate Duc de Berry.\n\nThe labours of the missionaries of France were also very successful. The mission closed with the planting of the mission cross: forty thousand persons walked in procession at the ceremony, and Father de Mazenod preached in Proven\u00e7al at its close, from a platform erected on the spot where the cross was to be planted. This was the centre of the district which he and his brethren had been evangelizing. The pious enthusiasm of this vast multitude could not be restrained, even by the solemnity of the occasion, from manifesting itself by loud demonstrations, so moved were all hearts by the kindling and holy eloquence of the preacher. The cross, which was then planted, stands erect to this day, and it has become a place of holy pilgrimage. Shortly after the mission, the first house of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate was opened at Marseilles, and the site selected for this new establishment was very appro-\npriate, for the mission cross stands in the front of their house and church on the Place du Calvaire. Father Forbin Janson and Father de Mazenod commenced a mutual friendship on the occasion of their mission at Marseilles, which death only terminated. The mission of Marseilles was followed at a short interval by another great mission by Father de Mazenod, in the cathedral of Aix, with similar success. His labours during the mission seemed superhuman, but the ardour of his zeal for souls sweetened every fatigue and privation that he had to endure in their behalf. Ten years of active missionary life had now elapsed. During this period new recruits offered their services to Father de Mazenod, to be incorporated in his devoted little army of missionaries. During a mission given by him and Father Susanne, of holy memory, at Nice, a learned Professor of the Diocesan Seminary of that city, Don Carlo Albini, offered himself as a postulant to Father de Mazenod. Father Albini bore already a reputation of extraordinary sanctity. He had been for a long time secretly sighing for an opportunity of embracing community life in some society, dedicated to the conversion of sinners and the service of the poor. Having an opportunity of studying closely Father de Mazenod and his companions, whilst helping them in hearing confessions during the mission, it seemed to him that he had found all that he had\nbeen wishing for so long. He was profoundly edified both with the holy bearing and the apostolic zeal exhibited by these servants of God, and he resolved to seek admission into their ranks. At first, his bishop was greatly opposed to his designs, but afterwards he consented to the sacrifice, hoping to have, one day, a foundation of the missionaries of Father de Mazenod in his diocese. Without suffering any delay to intervene, Father Albini prepared to follow the divine call; so dead was he to the world, that he came away without visiting his native home, which was within a few miles of Nice, and during the twenty years that he lived as an Oblate of Mary Immaculate, he never sought the consolation of a visit to his early friends. He always endeavoured to conceal his great sanctity under the veil of profound humility; but, with all his efforts, he could not hide it. At missions and elsewhere, when people did not know his name, and wished to speak of him, they designated him by the title of \"the saint.\" He died in the odour of sanctity, and miracles are reported to have been worked at his grave.\n\nShortly after Father Albini joined the new society of missionaries of Provence, a young ecclesiastical student offered himself as a postulant to Father de Mazenod. His name was Guibert. The experienced eye of the holy Superior quickly discovered in his\nnew postulant, signs of a marked vocation, and he admitted him to the noviciate without hesitation. Brother Guibert was destined to become one of the lights of the new congregation of missionaries. After his ordination to the priesthood, he was engaged for awhile in giving missions. Afterwards, his rare prudence, great piety, and his disciplinary spirit, marked him out as one eminently fitted for the important office of master of novices. To this post he was called by Father de Mazenod. Later on he was appointed Superior of the Diocesan Ecclesiastical Seminary, founded in Ajaccio by the Oblates of Mary, for the education of the young clergy of Corsica, and which is still under their direction. He was afterwards named Bishop of Viviers, and then Archbishop of Tours, and he is at present Cardinal Archbishop of Paris. Amidst all these successive honours, this holy prelate still remains the humble religious, and glories in his title of \"Oblate of Mary Immaculate.\"\n\nThe ranks of the new society being considerably increased, and fortified by the accession of such subjects as Fathers Albini and Guibert, and many others of the same saintly type, an interior voice seemed to say to Father de Mazenod, that the time had come for launching out the little bark, of which he was the pilot, into deeper waters, and that he should seek a place for his new society among the\nrecognized religious bodies in the church, by obtaining for its rules and constitutions the approbation of the Vicar of Jesus Christ. The humility of the holy priest shrank from the idea of putting himself forward as the founder of a new religious congregation, and, for a time, he could not bring himself to entertain it. At last he yielded to the pressing solicitations of the members of his community, and especially to the counsel of Father Albini, whom he revered as one full of the Spirit of God, and resolved to seek the formal approbation of the Holy See for the rules and constitutions of his society. In an affair of such importance, he felt the need of bringing into play all the agencies which holy prudence might suggest, and his spirit of lively faith disclose. He took counsel on the matter with several learned and holy men, but, above all, he consulted God in prayer. He had prayers said for the success of his undertaking, not only in the communities under his own jurisdiction, but in the religious houses in which he had influence, and these were many. The Capuchin Sisters at Marseilles, and the Poor Clares of that city, communities in which there were then many living saints, made frequent offerings of their prayers and acts of penance, to obtain the divine blessing on Father de Mazenod's undertaking. Aided by such supernatural helps, and furnished with letters of highest\nrecommendation given by various bishops in whose dioceses he and his missionaries had laboured, he left Marseilles for Rome on the 1st November, 1825.\n\nWe shall now proceed to give some extracts from the correspondence of Father de Mazenod, written from Rome to Father Tempier, and other Fathers in his society at Marseilles.\n\n\"Rome, November 26th, 1825.\n\n\"My dear Friend,\n\n\"I reached Rome to-day at too late an hour, unhappily, to say Mass, though I remained fasting until past two o'clock p.m. for that purpose. On leaving Genoa, my companions were Father Pizzi, a Jesuit; a Trappist Father; four Carmelite Fathers, and a secular priest from Sardinia. You see that I was in very good company. By common consent we organized, in starting, a community method of life for our journey. In the morning between three and four we made our meditation for one hour. After that we tried to sleep for awhile. When we had sufficient daylight to be able to read, we recited together the Rosary, and afterwards the little hours of the divine office. When the diligence stopped at breakfast time, I hastened to the nearest church, and said Mass, at which my companions assisted. During the day, at intervals, I read aloud passages from the Imitation of Christ. We said the Rosary together, and in the afternoon we recited vespers and complin. Our conversation was always on edifying subjects.\"\n\n\"Rome, December 6th, 1825.\n\n\"My dear Father Courtes,\n\n\"I write to you from the capital of the christian world. This beautiful city of Rome deserves well that title,\nfor it is the See of the Vicar of Christ, and in some manner, a compendium of christianity. Here alone, it seems to me, is understood what sort of dwelling man should prepare for his God upon the earth. No idea can be formed by one who has not been here, of the magnificence which reveals itself at every step, in the holy temples you meet as you go along. Sometimes you meet five or six churches clustered in the same vicinity, each rivalling the others in splendour, and surpassing them by some special beauty of its own. Here one can form an idea of how, when in heaven, we shall never tire of giving praise to God, or never lessen in love as we contemplate His infinite perfections, when we find that the sight of those beautiful productions of human skill\u2014the works of the feeble hands of men\u2014excites an admiration that continues to grow as we gaze. And what a stimulant to piety is furnished to us by the sight of those many monuments that attest the victories won by those martyrs who drowned idolatry in their blood. Their bodies are here, and their memories are as fresh to-day, after the lapse of seventeen or eighteen centuries, as if they had been lately in our midst. These centuries have swallowed up their persecutors, and destroyed their works, which they had flattered themselves would be eternal. Here everything is holy for him who comes hither in the spirit of a true pilgrim. For my own part, I only see here the Apostles, and Martyrs, and Confessors of all ages. There is not a step in Rome where you do not find some monument of faith and piety.\"\n\n\"Rome, December 9th, 1825.\n\n\"I cannot accustom myself, my dear Father Tempier, to a separation from those I love; I have no joy apart from them. Oh, how great shall our happiness in heaven be! There we shall abide in loving society with one another, and shall not be obliged to travel into distances away from our friends. And though we shall all there be completely absorbed in God, nevertheless we shall be free to love one another. God will be present in our hearts, and our minds will be filled with the memory of His presence. We shall be able to see Him as He is, and to feel His love as He loves us. We shall be able to communicate with Him, and to receive His blessings. We shall be able to pray to Him, and to offer our prayers to Him. We shall be able to give thanks to Him, and to express our gratitude to Him. We shall be able to confess our sins to Him, and to ask His forgiveness. We shall be able to seek His guidance, and to follow His will. We shall be able to experience His peace, and to find rest in His presence. We shall be able to enjoy His glory, and to be filled with His holiness.\"\nanother with intense mutual love. The intuitive vision of God did not prevent Jesus Christ from loving men, and among men, some more than others. There are certain over-refined mystics who deny this, and who would force upon us another nature, inferior to that which God has given to us. In my own case, I cannot be fully happy whilst separated from the members of my community, whom I love so tenderly. . . .\n\nI have not yet seen the Holy Father. Cardinal de Gregorio, to whom I have been warmly recommended from Turin, and who has received me with great kindness, gives it as his positive opinion that the Pope will not grant his solemn approbation to our Rules. The Holy Father may possibly, he thinks, give an indirect approbation to our work, by expressing some words of praise in our behalf, and by granting us certain privileges and indulgences. I say Mass during this Octave of the Blessed Virgin, to obtain from God the favours we are seeking for. I do not neglect, at the same time, the human means which I think needful to employ. If in the end I do not succeed, I shall have nothing to reproach myself with.\"\n\nThe 20th of December, the Vigil of the Feast of St. Thomas the Apostle, was the day appointed for his audience with the Holy Father. The morning of that day he visited the tomb of St. Peter in the crypt of the Vatican, and placed the manuscript of the rules and constitutions of his new institute on the altar over the tomb of the Prince of the Apostles. He wept copiously on that occasion, and prayed with great fervour, invoking the intercession of that blessed apostle, whom Jesus Christ had appointed to be head of His church. He then celebrated the holy Mass, being in tears all the time. At the ap-\npointed hour he repaired to the palace of the Pope. The Holy Father was prepossessed in his favour by the reports which had reached him of his virtues and labours. As he entered the audience chamber, his first appearance produced a most favourable impression on the mind and heart of the holy Pontiff. His noble bearing, blended with an expression of the most profound humility and loving reverence for the Vicar of Jesus Christ, was judged by the Holy Father to be a faithful revelation of his inner spirit. Kneeling beside the holy Pontiff, he exposed the object of his visit to Rome. For three quarters of an hour he had the privilege allowed to him of developing the nature of the work he had undertaken for the saving of perishing souls. The holy Pope was deeply moved as he heard of the good already accomplished by the members of this new Society of Missionaries, of whom Father de Mazenod was the founder. He seemed much impressed with the practical character of the project presented to him, and evidently looked on Father de Mazenod as one raised by God to do some great work in his day, for the interests of the holy church. At the conclusion of Father de Mazenod's supplication, the Holy Father appeared to be much affected by what he had been listening to. Lifting his eyes to heaven, he clasped his hands together, and bent his head for some moments in earnest prayer. He then\nentered into familiar conversation with Father de Mazenod about his project, and seemed to become at once its warm advocate. He instructed him in detail as to the steps he should take to obtain the approbation and confirmation of the rules and constitutions of his society. \"In the first place,\" his Holiness said, \"the secretary of the congregation will present a report to me on the subject. I will then appoint a Cardinal to examine it, who will present his report to the congregation. After that each Cardinal gives his vote. The number of applications which come to us, especially from France, compels us to adopt a special mode of procedure which consists in giving praise and encouragement to the new Institutes, without however granting them a formal approbation.\" Father de Mazenod hesitated not to say to his Holiness that it was the formal approbation of the Holy See which he was then seeking to obtain for his new congregation. The condescension of the Sovereign Pontiff on this occasion was something remarkable. He seemed from that hour resolved that no time should be lost in raising the new congregation of Father de Mazenod to the rank of the canonically appointed religious bodies of the Church of Christ. Was he moved by some supernatural power to this condescending patronage of an infant work? Leo XII. was a man of God, who looked with an eye of more than\nhuman penetration into the future. Had his Holiness then some foresight or presentiment of the work which was to be done for God by this new congregation, once that the blessing of Peter, as a baptism of the Holy Spirit, had descended upon it, and that a new name had been given to it at that baptism\u2014that of the \"Society of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate?\"* Did he see, in mental glance, at that hour, the future sons of this new congregation going forth to reap the ripened harvest of souls, not only under the sunny skies of France, but also in the lands of Saxon and of Celt; yea, traversing earth and ocean in search of other harvest-fields, in regions never trodden by civilized foot, amidst the glaciers of Arctic forests, or amidst the burning sands of African wilds? Certain it is that it was no common cause that led the Vicar of Jesus Christ to depart from the ordinary reserve with which the Sovereign Pontiff deals with new projects, even when proposed by Saints, some of whom spent many years in obtaining, for orders founded by them, an approbation similar to that granted almost at the first audience by Leo XII. to Father de Mazenod. At the close of this memorable audience\n\n* When Leo XII. conceded to the new congregation the title of \"The Society of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate,\" his Holiness expressed to Father de Mazenod the great gratification he experienced in having such an opportunity afforded him, of manifesting his devotion to the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin.\nthe Holy Father, in his evident zeal to promote Father de Mazenod's undertaking, gave him precise instructions as to the first steps he should take to advance his work. \"Go\" he said, \"to the Arch-priest, the secretary of the congregation, and tell him in my name to present his report to me on Friday next, the day of his audience.\" Fearing that Father de Mazenod might forget the name or address of the Arch-priest, his Holiness rose and took from his desk a sheet of paper and a pen, and placed them before Father de Mazenod that he might write them down under his dictation.\n\nThe following day, Father de Mazenod presented himself to the Arch-priest, and informed him of his Holiness's wishes on the subject of the report he would have him prepare on the rules and constitutions of the society of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate. The Arch-priest, who gave a most gracious reception to Father de Mazenod, bade him, however, not expect a formal approbation of his society, and said that the most he could look forward to, would be a declaration that the rules of his institute were worthy of praise,\u2014laudand\u00e6. \"This manner of proceeding is,\" he said, \"in accordance with the custom now established in dealing with new institutes, and it is the view which I will support.\" These words of the secretary of the congregation were a blow to the hopes of Father de\nMazenod, and threw his mind, for a moment, into a state of much perplexity. The thought presented itself forcibly to him of abandoning all further attempts to obtain the formal approbation of the Holy See for his society, and of returning to France. But, on reflection, he dismissed this thought, feeling that he was bound, through respect for the Holy Father, to pursue, to the end, the negotiations with the Arch-priest, which he had entered upon under the direction of his Holiness. In withdrawing from the Arch-priest, he said, \"I leave this affair in your hands, and I seek for nothing else but that God's design may be accomplished.\" It was arranged, on that occasion, that he was to return to the Arch-priest's on the following Saturday morning, to learn the result of the latter's audience with the Holy Father, which was to take place on the Friday.\n\nWe will give an extract from a letter written about this time, by the venerable Superior-General to Father Tempier, in which he touchingly narrates the circumstances of this eventful period in the history of his society. It will serve to give us an insight into that spirit of lively faith, and entire dependence upon God, which was habitual to him, especially when anything great or difficult had to be accomplished by him for the divine glory.\n\n\"I continued to recommend the affair to God, through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin, and of the Angels and...\"\nSaints, and, in a spirit of entire abandonment of my project to His holy providence, I awaited the issue of the Arch-priest's audience with the Holy Father, whatever it might be. At the hour when I supposed the audience was taking place, I addressed myself to God in prayer; not that I thought that my poor prayers could accomplish what I desired, but it seemed befitting that I should remain in our Lord's presence, notwithstanding my unworthiness, at a moment when divine grace was operating, and the holy spirit was guiding the Head of the Church in a matter which concerned the existence of our society, and the salvation of countless souls. This morning, according to appointment, I visited again the Arch-priest to ascertain the result of his audience with the Holy Father, which took place yesterday. He first read to me the report which he had presented to his Holiness, which concluded, as he had said already it would do, with a recommendation to his Holiness that our society should be pronounced praiseworthy (laudanda), simply. But mark the goodness of God, and give thanks with me to Him, without ceasing. The Holy Father's views were other than those of the report presented to him. 'No,' said the Sovereign Pontiff, 'this society pleases me; I know the good it is doing.' He then entered into a number of details concerning the society, which astonished very much the Arch-priest. 'I wish,' his Holiness continued, 'to favour it. Choose a Cardinal amongst the most kindly disposed in the sacred congregation, to be the promoter of this cause. Go to him in my name; tell him that it is my intention that these rules be not simply approved, but that they be formally confirmed!' O Leo XII.! you will always be regarded as the Benefactor and the Father of our society. In leaving the house of the Arch-priest Andolfi, I said a Te Deum, and I entered a church, where reposes the body of St. Joseph Calasanctius, to give thanks to our Lord, and to beg of Him to complete the work which He had begun. Let all the brethren of our\ncommunity increase their fervour in the punctual observance of our rules. You must feel that to-day they become invested with a more solemn character. Let us accomplish all that the Head of the Church expects of us. This will be the means of drawing down new blessings from Heaven upon ourselves and our ministry. Let us especially increase in devotion to the Blessed Virgin, in order that we may be worthy to be named Oblates of Mary Immaculate. This name is a passport to Heaven. How is it we did not think of it before? How consoling and glorious for us to be dedicated to her, and to bear her name, 'Oblates of Mary Immaculate!' How grateful is this name to the ear, and how soothing to the heart! Let us rejoice in it, and bear her name and her livery.\"\n\nThe Holy Father had manifested his favourable disposition towards the new society, but the formal approbation of the rules had not yet been pronounced by him. Things might still take an unfavourable turn, and the expectations of the holy Founder might not be realized.\n\nIn the lives of all who do great works for God, we find alternate hopes and fears. If coming success shines without a cloud to-day, to-morrow the sky may become overcast and menacing, and signs of success may disappear. God permits this for the greater merit of His servants, and to give them an opportunity of putting forth an increase of faith and love and confidence. He also thus provides an opportunity for Himself of making manifest His providential care and Fatherly love, by coming to\ntheir aid in critical and decisive moments when all other helps fail. Great works, undertaken for God and for the good of souls, have a manner of their own of reaching the goal of success. They seem often to fail, when all the while they are in reality advancing. In the meantime, those who are engaged in carrying them on come in for their meed of censure and dispraise, much to the soul's profit. And, like the incoming tide, against which the wind bloweth, which presents on its surface countless receding waves, whilst it is steadily and irresistibly advancing; so with the progress of many a work, undertaken for God's glory, in the development of which superficial failures often cover the deep and irresistible under-current of supernatural success. Father de Mazenod's undertaking is not to form an exception to the ordinary rule concerning great works set on foot by God's servants for the promotion of the divine glory. It has to pass through the crucible of a great and unexpected opposition. Letter after letter came from certain influential personages in France, addressed to the Holy See with the intention of defeating Father de Mazenod's designs of obtaining the confirmation and approbation of his Institute. Those whom he had been looking upon as the warm advocates of his undertaking suddenly, without any seeming reason, became its bitter opponents. In the midst\nof this storm of opposition, his soul remained calm and full of a child-like trust in God. His manner of acting on this critical occasion affords matter of deep instruction for all who labour under great opposition in carrying on works undertaken for God's glory and the interests of souls. He felt, at such a time, more than ever bound to avoid the least voluntary fault which might render him, in any manner, less worthy of the aid of that special Providence to which he had been looking to for success. He thus unbosoms himself in a letter, written at this period, to Father Tempier, his alter ego\u2014his other self\u2014to whom, as his spiritual guide, he was in the habit of opening the innermost recesses of his heart:\n\n\"Having in my hands an affair of such importance, the result of which may prove of the greatest consequence to the interests of Holy Church, the glory of God, and the sanctification of souls,\u2014an affair which is sure to stir up against it the malice of demons, and which cannot succeed except through the very special protection of God, to whom it belongs to touch the hearts and guide the wills of men, I must necessarily feel convinced that it is my duty to do all that depends on me to live in the most intimate possible union with God, and to form the resolution of avoiding every fault, however slight, which would grieve His Holy Spirit. In the present position of affairs, the least voluntary transgression would appear to me a crime, not only because of its displeasing God, which would be its chief evil, but also because of the consequences which might follow in its train. Ever since I left France, and especially since I arrived in Rome, God has assisted me in all things, in a manner so sensible\nthat it seems to me that I could not, if I tried, cease to experience a loving gratitude which leads me to praise, to bless and to give thanks to God and our Lord Jesus Christ, and, in due proportion, to the Blessed Virgin, and to the Angels, and to the Saints, to whom I feel indebted for that protection and consolation which I experience. With all that, I find matter for self-reproach, and for humbling myself before God in my confession, which I make twice a week.\"\n\nIn a subsequent letter addressed to the same Father, Father de Mazenod thus writes:\n\n\"To-day I visited again the tomb of the Apostles, there to imbibe fresh spiritual strength, and to implore further help from Heaven. For the third time, I have said Mass at the Confession of St. Peter. I must acknowledge that God, in His great goodness, has, by the consolation of His grace, more than made up for all the troubles that the malice of Hell has excited against us. I have invoked Him with all the fervour of my heart, and He has shown Himself to be a true protector. I availed myself of that occasion to recommend you all most earnestly to God. I asked for you an ample participation in the virtues and merits of that great apostle. One prays with confidence, I can assure you, when one finds oneself with Jesus and His Vicar, and the Apostles and Martyrs. In offering the Holy Mass on altars, under which repose bodies that once were animated with such great souls, and which in life had been in contact with our Blessed Saviour Himself, one's own soul readily catches the flames of that sacred fire of love which glowed within their breasts, as they confessed, by their sufferings and death, the name of their Master and ours. Let us continue to pray, my dear friend, and let us not cease to place all our confidence in God. To Him alone it belongs to rule and dispose all things according to His infinite wisdom and to the greater glory of His Holy name.\"\nI must confess that never in my life did I understand and feel, as I now do, the value of an unreserved abandonment of one's self into God's hands. I rejoice now at not having omitted anything which might render this virtue familiar to me. The practice of this holy abandonment into God's hands does not, however, prevent me from asking earnestly certain special favours from Him; on the contrary, when we abandon ourselves to God, we pray with greater confidence and with an almost perfect assurance of our prayer being heard. I have told you, already, that, since my arrival in Rome, I offer the Holy Mass every day for the success of our undertaking. I never kneel before the Lord, in the Blessed Sacrament, without placing my petitions at His feet. I never invoke a saint without asking him to become our intercessor in this matter. At the same time, I do not omit to employ such lawful and profitable means, as human prudence may suggest, to secure a favourable issue for our cause. I do not spare my feet in journeying hither and thither. I willingly sacrifice my repose of mind in furthering what I believe to be the designs of God's Holy Providence. Till now everything has succeeded beyond my expectations: God has, however, allowed certain drawbacks and disappointments to occur, thus leaving room for some anxieties; but He has not permitted my confidence in Him to diminish. On the contrary, it is in times of greatest interior trial that my prayer assumes its most tender and confiding tone, and addresses itself to God in words fond and familiar as those of a child speaking to a father. As I pass in review, before my mind, the progress, from stage to stage, of this affair, I feel myself carried away by sentiments of admiration of God's goodness, whose loving hand is so visible in the whole matter.\"\n\nAt length the great undertaking of Father de Mazenod reached the crowning point of success. The benediction, which was upon it from the onset, bore\nit safely through the host of difficulties which beset its progress. On the 16th of February, 1826, Father de Mazenod communicated the following joyful news to Father Tempier:\u2014\u201cThe Congregation of Cardinals, presided over by Cardinal Pacca, has unanimously approved of our rules, and has petitioned the Holy Father to give his supreme sanction to them in due canonical form.\u201d\n\nFull of a sense of the immense debt of gratitude he owed to God, to whom alone he attributed the success of his undertaking, he thus writes to his friend:\n\n\u201cTake measures to obtain prayers of thanksgiving on the part of all those devout friends to whom, in your prudence, you have communicated the good news I have forwarded to you. We must acknowledge that the ways of Divine Providence, in this affair, have been wonderful. God has shewn Himself, in this matter, to be indeed the Ruler of the hearts of men. It was He who inspired those with whom I came into contact, whilst carrying it on, with favourable dispositions in my regard. I felt all the while that He was leading me by the hand, and that His light was guiding my steps. This gave me such an absolute and filial confidence, that I spoke to Our Lord, in prayer, as I believe I would have done if I had the happiness of conversing with Him when He was on earth.\u201d\n\nOn the following day, the 17th of February, 1826, the Holy Father, Leo XII., confirmed the decision of the Congregation of Cardinals, and gave his solemn approbation to the Institute, to the Rules and\nConstitutions of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate. Writing after this event to Father Tempier, the holy Founder having first expressed his thankfulness to God, says:\n\n\"Henceforward it will be our duty to labour with a new ardour, and a more entire devotedness, in increasing the Divine glory by gaining souls to God. From this hour we should observe our rules with more loving exactitude and reverence than before. They have now, after a most minute examination, received the solemn approbation of the Church. They are declared to be holy and eminently fitted to guide those who embrace them to the sublime end of Christian and religious perfection. They have now become the common property of God's Church. The Vicar of Christ stands guarantee for them. He whom God employed to prepare them from this day disappears. He was only the exterior instrument which the hand of God deigned to employ to make manifest the way of perfection to chosen souls, called by Him from the beginning to take part in this work of mercy, and to become incorporated in this new and humble society. Our members, as yet, are not many; but our society has already an existence as real as that of any of the most ancient and venerable Religious Institutes of the Church of God. Let us acknowledge, with gratitude, the dignity conferred upon the society, our Mother, who has been raised to the rank of a Queen, and enthroned in the house of the Heavenly Bridegroom, to become the fruitful parent of a numerous offspring, in case we prove faithful to our calling, but otherwise to be smitten with barrenness. Let us therefore resolve upon becoming saints, in order to be worthy of such a Mother.\"\n\nThe Holy Father had, during the stay of Father de Mazenod in Rome, already conferred many fa-\nvours upon him, but there is one which deserves exceptional mention: it is the notification he received of the intention of his Holiness to raise him to the dignity of Cardinal. This circumstance, so honorable to Father de Mazenod, was much spoken of at the time of its occurrence, but afterwards was seldom alluded to. The recollection of it seemed to be forgotten. It was, however, revived twenty years later, in a conversation which took place in Rome, between Cardinal Orioli and Monsignor Jeancard, and which we give in the words of this latter Prelate who, at the time alluded to, was Secretary to Monseigneur de Mazenod:\n\n\"I was at Rome in the year 1845, and was engaged one day in conversation with his Eminence Cardinal Orioli, who said to me, 'You entertain a great veneration for Monseigneur de Mazenod, your Bishop, but are you aware that he, at one time, formally disobeyed the Pope?' I manifested astonishment. His Eminence continued, 'Yes, he disobeyed the Pope, and it was Leo XII. himself, who informed me of it. His Holiness wished to make him Cardinal, but Monseigneur de Mazenod refused the dignity, for he preferred to employ his devotedness in France, rather than consecrate it to the service of the Holy See in Rome.' 'But His Holiness,' I said, 'must have admitted the force of his reasons for that refusal.' 'Yes,' replied the Cardinal, 'and he admired his generosity.' Cardinal Orioli was a personal friend of Leo XII., and one of the most distinguished members of the Sacred College.\"\nCHAPTER X.\n\nDuring his sojourn in Rome, Father de Mazenod was admitted to the intimate friendship of Cardinal Pacca. His Eminence had then completed his Memoirs of Pius VII., which he hesitated to publish, in consequence of the freedom with which certain high personages were spoken of in them. He felt also, that their publication might not be well received at Rome, owing to the greater publicity which would be thereby given to the act of weakness, into which the aged and infirm Pius VII. allowed himself to be surprised, under the menaces of Napoleon, but which he afterwards gloriously and courageously retracted. The aged Pontiff had affixed his signature to the pretended Concordat of Fontainebleau, hoping thereby to stem the evils which threatened religion. He speedily repented of this act, for he found that, in consenting to it, he had infringed upon the liberty of the Church. Once that he had made this discovery, he hesitated not to acknowledge his mistake, and he boldly faced the\nanger of the Emperor by withdrawing his consent from the document named. Cardinal Pacca, who deeply revered the saintly Pontiff, dreaded that the publication of the Memoirs in question might cast some shade upon his glorious memory. It was on this point that he consulted Father de Mazenod, in whose enlightened judgment he placed great confidence. He asked him to read over attentively the manuscript of his Memoirs, in order to judge as to their fitness for publication. Father de Mazenod, after a careful perusal of the manuscript, handed it back to the Cardinal, with these words:\n\n\"I entreat your Eminence to consider these memoirs. Far from lowering Pius VII., you exalt him in public veneration, by doing so. Nothing could be more honourable for him than that full publicity should be given to facts which reveal the beautiful simplicity of his character, his humility, his sensitive delicacy of conscience, which forbade him to approach the altar, and which led him to acknowledge, in the presence of all the Cardinals assembled around him, the mistake into which he had been betrayed. Nothing could better show what a Roman Pontiff really is, than this courageous resolution to repair a fault regardless of all consequences. The Sacred College appears at the full height of its position, and the Roman Church triumphs at a moment when the world was prepared to hear of its entire destruction. Your Memoirs, my Lord Cardinal, form a magnificent page in the history of the Church, and they should be preserved for the edification of posterity.\"\n\nCardinal Pacca was pleased with this advice, and years afterwards he acknowledged to Monseigneur\nde Mazenod that it contributed very much to induce him to publish the Memoirs. Another circumstance arising from the esteem and friendship of Cardinal Pacca for Father de Mazenod, deserves here to be noted. His Eminence wished to introduce the French Seminary system into Italy. It was his desire that one seminary should be formed for the six suburban dioceses of Rome, over one of which he himself was bishop, and that this new seminary should be confided to the direction of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate. The Convent of St. Alexis, a spacious building on Mount Palatine, was the place he had in view for this seminary. Negotiations were set on foot, and carried on for some time, to accomplish the proposed project, but owing to unexpected difficulties presenting themselves, it had to be abandoned.\n\nDuring Father de Mazenod's residence in Rome, he formed an intimate friendship with Father Mantone, a Redemptorist, who had the happiness of knowing personally St. Liguori. He frequently sought the society of this good Father to have an opportunity of conversing with him on the life and virtues of a saint, towards whom he entertained a most tender devotion. He had already erected in the Church of his community at Aix, the first altar raised in France in honour of the blessed Liguori.\nWe find the following entry in Father de Mazenod's journal of his first visit to Rome:\n\n\"I have to-day again visited the Liguorian Fathers. The Father Procurator-General presented me with a large piece of the Blessed Liguori's cassock. He also allowed me to see the manuscript of his Moral Theology, written with his own hand. I kissed the precious miscellany with deep emotion and reverence. Father Mantone was received into his society by St. Liguori himself. He told me there were then forty Redemptorists still living, who personally knew the beatified servant of God. This evening, Father Mantone made me a precious gift, which I value as a great treasure. It consists of a portion of one of the bones of the beatified, and of a letter written with his own hand. I can never tire contemplating these precious objects.\"\n\nThe time of quitting Rome and returning to France had now arrived. Father de Mazenod proceeded to the Vatican, to present himself in grateful homage, at the feet of Leo XII., before taking his departure from the Holy City. We will quote his own words to describe what occurred at his final audience with the Sovereign Pontiff.\n\n\"I was received in the same chamber as on the occasion of my first audience with His Holiness. I began by giving expression to my gratitude for the favours which His Holiness had bestowed upon me in such abundance. The Holy Father made me at once feel at home in his presence, and entered into an interesting conversation with me. I availed myself of this excellent opportunity of presenting a petition for different favours, which I had marked down under sixteen heads. He granted me, in the most gracious manner, all that I had asked of him. He handed me a\nletter he had prepared to send to my uncle. I caused him to smile when I told him that I had a certain scruple of conscience in not having previously discharged a duty, imposed upon me by the King of Sardinia. 'I have been charged,' I said, 'by his Majesty to express to your Holiness his regret at not being able to come to Rome for the Jubilee, notwithstanding his great desire to do so. I did not dare, Holy Father, to acquit myself of this commission when I first had the honour of being admitted to an audience, lest I might seem to take the airs of an Ambassador Extraordinary.' His Holiness smiled very graciously, and having pronounced an eulogium on that sovereign, he charged me, if I saw His Majesty when passing through his States, to make known to him the sentiments with which he was animated in his regard. His Holiness then spoke to me of France. He understands her condition much better than those who would be her counsellors. I was surprised at his doing me the honour of entering so unreservedly into particulars in my presence on such high and delicate questions. On my part, I corresponded with this confidence by expressing freely what I thought of the actual state of things. I asked His Holiness to give his blessing to our society and to myself. 'Yes, from my heart, I bless you,' he replied, 'de rore coeli,' in saying which he lifted his eyes to Heaven.'\n\nFather de Mazenod having secured, through God's goodness, the great object which had taken him to Rome, and having obtained far greater favours than he had ventured to expect, became as earnest in his thanksgivings as he had been fervent in his petitions to Heaven, before the blessings he had been seeking for were granted him. His last days spent in Rome, on this occasion, were employed in visiting different\nchurches and sanctuaries of special devotion, everywhere offering thanks to God for the favours that had been conferred upon him. He made the pilgrimage to Loreto on his way back to France, there to seek for further blessings on his new society.\n\nHe returned, after an absence of several months, to the circle of his devoted and attached brethren. A General Chapter was assembled in the House of Calvary at Marseilles. All the members of the society renewed their vows in the presence of the Blessed Sacrament; a joyful Te Deum concluded the ceremony.\n\nThe solemn approbation given by the Church to a religious society is something marvellously sacramental, which imparts to it new impulses and powers for the accomplishment of its special ends. The founders of societies thus approved of come in personally, we may feel sure, for a large share of the sacramental benedictions, which follow the solemn approbation of the Church given to their Institutes. The evangelizing of the poor and the reclaiming of abandoned sinners were always the chief ends proposed by Father de Mazenod to the zeal of his missionaries. Hitherto such works of zeal were matters of choice, now they were works of obligation. A Divine voice would seem to say to him and to his: \"Go ye to the lost sheep of the House of Israel, and say to them, The kingdom of\nHeaven is at hand.\" The apostle now appears in the holy Founder with authority, and benediction, and power. He has now a right to call disciples to himself; to bless them and fit them for their work of saving souls, and send them forth, yea, to the very ends of the earth. Band after band of missionaries of his society kneel before him, with staff in hand and breviary under the arm, to receive his blessing before they go forth to cultivate their appointed portion of the vineyard. Over each successive group of missionaries he pronounced, according to the ritual of his society, the following words of blessing:\n\n\"Go ye forth, dearest brothers, to the perishing sheep of the House of Israel. Let the powers of darkness vanish at your approach. May the angel of the Lord accompany you on your way, and may you return to your brethren in peace, and joy, and holiness. To God alone, the Invisible and the Immortal, be honour and glory, for ever and ever. Amen. May the blessing of Almighty God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, descend upon you and remain with you for ever.\"\n\nThe Missionaries having received the blessing of their Superior, go and prostrate themselves before our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament, in adoration. They then rise and go forth.\n\nFather de Mazenod drew up the following regulations for his missionaries when on their journey to the place they are proceeding to evangelize:\n\n\"If the town or village where the Mission is to be given\nis not far distant, the Fathers are recommended to proceed thither on foot, in order to imitate more perfectly Jesus Christ and the Apostles, and to have a larger share in the merits of their journeys and labours.\n\n\"On their journey they will frequently converse together on the virtues of the early missionaries, who had under their eyes the example of Jesus Christ as he went about doing good. By this means they will be encouraged to bear, with cheerfulness, the fatigues and labour they may have to encounter.\n\n\"They will, as far as possible, perform their spiritual exercises in common.\n\n\"They will endeavour, when travelling, to find an opportunity every day of saying Holy Mass. If all cannot have this happiness, one, at least, should say Mass, at which the others should communicate. At the same time the Fathers should make all possible efforts to avoid being deprived, even on one day, of the fruit of offering the Holy Sacrifice.\n\n\"If they are travelling on foot through a town or village, they will go to the Church of the place to visit the Blessed Sacrament. Should the Church be closed, they will kneel at the gate for a short time in adoration. If they are travelling in a public vehicle, and cannot perform such visits, they will, in spirit, direct their thoughts to our Lord in the Holy Eucharist, and recite the Tantum ergo, to which they will add prayers to the Blessed Virgin, and the Guardian Angel, and Patron Saints of the place, and also prayers for the souls of those buried in the local cemetery.\n\n\"Whenever the missionaries, in travelling, hear blasphemies uttered against the Holy name of God, they will uncover their heads and make the sign of the cross, all together or each one by himself, according as it will be judged most expedient, to repair the insult offered to the Divine Majesty. They will recite the following or some similar prayer: 'To God alone be honour and glory, for ever and ever. Amen.' If the blasphemy is spoken against\nthe Divine person of our Lord, they will say: 'Praised be Jesus Christ for ever,' or some prayer of the same kind.\"\n\nThis extract will suffice to make manifest the burning zeal of Father de Mazenod for the Divine glory, and for the sanctification of the members of his society, especially in their missionary character.\n\nThe intermingling of joys and sorrows following one another in appointed succession, appears in the lives of all the servants of God. Great was the joy of Father de Mazenod in seeing the society, as he says, in words already cited, crowned as a Queen and enthroned by its solemn approbation in the house of the Bridegroom. Great was his joy in witnessing how the number of his spiritual sons went on increasing, and how God continued to bless their labours with marvellous results. But he had to endure keen sorrows, and his loving and sympathizing spirit was often wounded deeply and painfully. This happened especially whenever death removed from his side any of his cherished sons and disciples. No mother could show more anguish of heart at the death-bed of an only child, than he on such occasions. As an episode in this biographical sketch, we will here introduce an account of the last days on earth, and of the holy death, of one of his first disciples, and of the most beloved of his sons, Father Susanne. We trust our readers will not consider us as thereby straying\nneedlessly from our text. In introducing this notice of Father Susanne, our object is twofold. In the first place, in doing so, we shall find an opportunity of disclosing certain beautiful traits in the character of Father de Mazenod which, in order to be appreciated, must be seen in living action. Secondly, we shall thus have occasion of putting before our readers several edifying facts, connected with the closing days of the life of a holy young Oblate Priest.\n\nFather Susanne was a young missionary according to the heart of Father de Mazenod. He became first acquainted with the Oblates of Mary at Foveau, in Provence, a great mining district, where Father de Mazenod was conducting a mission. He was then a Church student, and was spending his vacation at Foveau. Struck by the miracles of grace he witnessed, edified by the lives of the missionaries, but especially impressed by the virtues of Father de Mazenod, he felt strongly attracted to seek admission into the new society. He placed himself entirely, without reserve, under the guidance of Father de Mazenod. He became in a short time, a faithful copyist of a perfect model. Father de Mazenod's virtues, as a Religious and missionary, began soon to come out distinctly, in bright reflection, in the life of Father Susanne. There existed between them, from their first acquaintance\nuntil death separated them, the love of father for son, and the love of son for father. Parental love displays itself not simply in tenderness of affection, but chiefly in its aims at promoting the highest good of the object loved. If, in order to promote this end, it be necessary to give momentary pain, by administering admonition or correction, true parental love shrinks not from doing so. Amidst the many virtues of his youthful disciple, Father de Mazenod detected certain marks of affectation in his epistolary style, which manifested a spirit not yet entirely free from vanity and egotism. Unable to suffer this in one so much loved, he wrote to him in the following severe terms:\n\n\"I have seen a letter, lately written by you to C\u2014\u2014. I was greatly pained to discover in it marks of a pretentious spirit in the studied search for fine words, and the ill-concealed affectation it displays. I could not help tracing all this to its latent source\u2014hidden self-love.\"\n\nHe continued, at much length, to write in similar severe and plain-spoken terms:\n\n\"Having written thus far, I have debated within myself whether I should send this letter to you or not, but I came to the conclusion of doing so, feeling sure that you had virtue enough to bear with my reproach; and besides, I love you too much to shrink from administering to you a wholesome reprimand, through the dread of giving you pain. If I loved you less, I should tear this letter up and not send it to you. You know my heart, and you know how great is my repugnance to cause even the smallest pain to those I love.\"\nThis young Father flung himself with such devotedness into the arena of missionary strife, that his prudent superior frequently found it necessary to moderate his zeal. We find him writing to Father Susanne in these words:\n\n\"Why do you labour in a manner that must shorten your days? Having worked as a galley slave at the mission of Tallard, and after having endured sufferings and fatigues at the mission of Lauzet, you preach twice a day, and, forgetting yourself, you hear confessions for thirty hours consecutively! Can you imagine that such conduct on your part would not cause me grave apprehension for your sake? You may say to me, you do not feel overworked; that you eat and sleep well. All that does not set my mind at ease, for I feel sure you are shortening your existence by such excesses of zeal. When you arrive at Entrevaux, provide yourself at once with such warm clothing as you may require; in a word, take all necessary precautions to preserve yourself against the rigorous cold of these mountains, to the chills of which we are not accustomed. I regret very much that I am at a distance from you, and that I cannot share in your heroic labours. Moderate your zeal, my dear Father, have more confidence in God's grace for the conversion of souls, than in any extra labour on your own part. Restrain your ardour in preaching, so that you may not come down habitually from the pulpit breathless and exhausted.\"\n\nBlessed excess of missionary zeal, which needed such a reprimand! No doubt, Father Susanne's humble spirit sought to obey the counsels of his prudent and beloved Superior. But again and again, carried away by the vehemence of his desire to draw souls from sin to God, he would forget him-\nself, and risk his very life by almost superhuman efforts of zeal.\n\nAfter a mission of five weeks in the Cathedral of Aix, during which Father Susanne laboured day and night, with wonderful success, especially among the working men of that city, his health began visibly and rapidly to give away. When it became known that the life of this apostolic man was in danger, prayers were offered up, by crowds of fervent souls, for his recovery. We should not pass over in silence an act of heroic generosity performed by three young scholastic Oblates to obtain from God the preservation of a life so precious to the congregation, and to the Church at large. Each offered his life to God, praying that he might be taken in the stead of Father Susanne, if such were the Divine will. But the hour was approaching for the faithful servant to receive his reward, and the prayers offered for his recovery were not to be granted. Father Susanne had not yet realized the grave nature of his malady, and entertained a full hope of his recovery. He had been for seventy days laid upon a bed of pain; but still the prospect of returning to his cherished labour for souls had not abandoned him. It became necessary to break to him the intelligence that his life was despaired of. His afflicted Superior undertook this mournful work of charity. The news of his approaching death took\nFather Susanne by surprise, but it did not sadden or terrify him. The moment he heard his life was drawing to its close, a ray of joy beamed over his countenance, and a holy transformation seemed immediately to be accomplished in him. All pre-occupation about his recovery ceased, and his thoughts, from that moment, became fixed on Heaven. His bodily sufferings were very great. He was a mass of wounds from head to foot. Violent internal spasms followed one another in quick succession. He breathed with the greatest difficulty, but no complaint fell from his lips, from which sighs of loving resignation were continually ascending to God. The Superior-General was at his side encouraging him to patience by his presence and his tender words of consolation. Looking into the face of his spiritual Father, he exclaimed, \"I suffer much, but I accept all most willingly.\" Then fixing his eyes on the Crucifix, which Father de Mazenod presented, he cried out, \"Oh, how deep are the wounds of my Saviour, yet He was innocence itself.\" The hour came for administering to him a very bitter draught, for which he felt a great natural repugnance, but this he quickly conquered as he remembered the bitter chalice of Our Lord's Passion. His charitable Superior was about to place some grains of sugar upon his lips, to remove the bitterness of the draught, but he declined this consolation with a\nsmile, wishing to become more intimately united to the sufferings of our Lord, who, for his sake, had drunk vinegar and gall upon the Cross. It was during those hours of the last illness of his beloved son, which Father de Mazenod spent day after day at his bedside, that he received from his dying lips avowals of filial attachment, reverence, and love, which Father Susanne had never ventured to communicate to him before.\n\n\"My Father,\" would he say to his Superior, \"such has been my attachment to the congregation of the Oblates that, even though I remained alone with you, I would never forsake it.\" Nothing gave the dying Father greater consolation than to hear of the successful labours of his brother missionaries. Knowing this, Father de Mazenod would inform him, from time to time, of the conversions worked by his confr\u00e8res who were then giving missions. On such occasions, the sense of bodily pain would appear to be for the time suspended, as his apostolic spirit became absorbed in the joyful feelings awakened by such good news. From time to time he was heard repeating, with great earnestness, to himself: \"My God and my all. Eternity, O Eternity! to love God for all eternity!\"\n\nHis soul was continually directing its aspirations to Our Lord in the Holy Eucharist. It was his habit frequently to place himself in spirit, in adora-\ntion before the Holy Tabernacle. He received the Viaticum several times during his last illness. On one of these occasions, he renewed his vows as Oblate of Mary Immaculate. Having done so, he poured out his soul in words of tender thanksgiving to God for having given him a vocation to the Society of the Oblates of Mary. He then was heard to say: \"If I had not entered this society, where should I now be?\" Day after day went by of his painful malady. All that time his devoted Superior was seldom absent from his bed-side. He was there helping him to acquire further merits, and to become more and more holy as he approached his end. Father de Mazenod had a great power of inspiring souls with a love of Christ Jesus crucified. He brought this power fully to bear on the willing heart of Father Susanne. The latter would, under this holy guidance, give utterance to prayers breathing the fullest confidence in the mercy of Jesus Christ who died for him. At the same time he made many acts of contrition for his sins. The thought of his sins, notwithstanding all he had done to efface them, would sometimes fill him with anxiety. At such moments he would appeal with fresh confidence to the Divine mercy, and, having done so, his habitual peace of soul would return to him. \"Ah!\" would he say, \"in what state must he be, at the moment of death, who has never done\nanything for his salvation?\" To a holy priest, who had come to visit him, and who was to have been his associate in a work they were to do conjointly for God's glory, he said, with a smile: \"I thought we were to be companions for a long time, but we shall be companions for ever in Heaven. What are thirty or forty years of life compared to eternity?\" Then, after a moment's silence, he exclaimed: \"O beautiful Heaven! thou shalt be my abode for ever.\"\n\nOn the morning of the 27th January, 1829, Father de Mazenod entered the room of the holy invalid at an early hour. The latter, who had suffered much during the previous night, exclaimed: \"O my Father, what a happiness it is to suffer for God! I ask for no abatement of my sufferings.\" \"My son,\" replied the former, \"it is thus the Christian and the faithful Priest of God accomplishes his sacrifice on the Cross of Jesus Christ and in union with His sufferings.\" \"Be it so for me,\" replied Father Susanne, \"may my sacrifice be thus accomplished!\" These words of the dying son went to the heart of his loving Father in God, who could no longer restrain his emotion, but was compelled to withdraw, to hide his tears. He felt that he also had a share in the sacrifice of that deathbed. Father Susanne, perceiving the ill-concealed grief of his beloved Superior, said to him, \"My\nFather, be consoled; we shall meet again.\u201d The Superior, his heart still bleeding, recommended the society to the prayers of the dying servant of God. \u201cMy Father,\u201d replied the holy Oblate, \u201cI will never forget our dear society. After the happiness of possessing God, my next thought will be to pray for my Brothers in Religion.\u201d Tears filled his eyes, and after a pause of a few moments he asked, \u201cBut is it not presumptuous on my part to make this promise?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied his spiritual Father, \u201cGod is faithful to His promises, His mercy encircles you, and you do not count on your own merits.\u201d \u201cO no,\u201d exclaimed the dying Oblate, \u201cI have no merits.\u201d The Superior-General suggested to him to prepare for absolution, and to make a general accusation of the sins of his life. It was not necessary to excite him to contrition, for he was heard praying aloud in these words: \u201cO my God! how I wish to die of penitent grief! How I wish that my heart would break with sorrow for having offended Thee, a God so good, who hast loaded me with so many favours!\u201d He pronounced these words in accents of the deepest compunction. His Superior was still speaking to him, when his eyes became fixed, as if upon some bright vision, and he exclaimed: \u201cI see clearly, O glorious Heaven!\u201d His further utterance then sank into a whisper. Resuming his ordinary tone, he exclaimed: \u201cI\nowe this to the Blessed Virgin, my good Mother.\" These words were spoken in soliloquy. They would indicate that he was favoured at that moment with some bright comforting vision, which he attributed to the intervention of the Blessed Virgin. The Superior-General thought it well not to question him on the matter, or to endeavour to penetrate his holy secret. One of the Fathers of the community was at his bed-side, and heard him speaking in low tones words which at first were not intelligible, but which, on drawing nearer to him, he could clearly distinguish. They were ejaculatory prayers which he was addressing to God. They were spoken with pauses between each short phrase, as if his soul was tasting in holy meditation the heavenly sweetness of the sentiments he was uttering. He was heard thus to pour forth his soul in God's presence: \"My God, I love Thee with my whole heart, and above all things; I would wish to love Thee as the Angels and Saints love Thee; I would wish to love Thee as much as the Blessed Virgin loves Thee; yet she cannot love Thee as much as Thou deservest to be loved. O my God, how good and how lovely Thou art! To possess God, to enjoy His presence, to see Him face to face, to be united to Him, to become one with Him! Oh, how little do men understand this happiness! It is true I suffer much; but what is all that compared to what Thou hast suffered? How much hast Thou suffered? Now I am suffering, and now I am happy. I am suffering to the glory of God, and saying, 'Thou art my God, my priest, my King.' I have been long in contemplation, and I have always wished for this happiness, for my consolation, for my places of rest. Now I see that he has been given me the divine protection, the divine grace, the grace to Heaven, the grace to be united to Him, the grace to be united to God!\n\nThe superior and the members of the community, who were members of the same order, heard a deathly silence, and then came the appearance of joy. They knew they were near death. The Father General said to them: \"Some will say, 'It is not for them'\u2014but I see it from another view in this case.\"\nhast suffered for me, O my God! Increase my sufferings, Lord. Fool that I was; I desired life; now I long to die.\" The Father, who was listening to these pious ejaculations, here interrupted him, saying: \"You die, then, willingly.\" The dying priest replied, \"Is the moment of my death to be long delayed? What are twenty or thirty years in comparison with eternity\u2014always to be happy\u2014always to be with God. Do we reflect on this happiness? Holy Virgin, my good Mother, I place my confidence in thee. Can any one be lost who places himself under thy powerful protection? No, he has nothing to fear. O my Mother! Mater divin\u00e6 grati\u00e6, Mater Misericordi\u00e6, tu nos ah hoste protege et hora morti's suscipe. Let us hasten to go to Heaven to see God, to possess Him, to be united to Him. Can we ever do too much for Thee, O God! My happiness is to suffer for Thee.\"\n\nThe Superior-General, wishing that all the members of his community, and especially the junior members, should benefit by the edification of so holy a death, introduced them quietly, one by one, into the apartment of the dying servant of God. When they were all assembled, addressing himself to Father Susanne, he asked him to speak to them some words of holy counsel. \"I recommend to them\" said the holy invalid, \"ever to keep God in view in each circumstance of their lives; never to\nact but for Him; never to seek themselves in anything they do. It is only by acting thus, that they will possess true happiness. Oh! how great the blindness and folly of worldlings, who know not how to serve to God, and who spend the greater part of their lives without thinking that it is for Him alone they were created. Ah! the thought of such indifference towards God is enough to make me die of grief. Let us, at least, who are dedicated to Him in the religious state, seek, by an increased fervour, to make amends to Him in some way for the coldheartedness of worldlings. What a happiness that God should give us so many facilities for serving and loving Him. This thought should transport us with joy. It will console us greatly at the hour of death. Be happy in suffering for God. I should wish to live in order to suffer more, but God calls me to Himself. We part from one another only for a short time. We shall see one another soon again. A few years will pass by, then you, my brothers, will be with me in Heaven, there to be immersed for ever in God. Oh, what a happiness! Withdraw now, my sons. Take heed that you employ fruitfully every moment of the time that God has given you to spend in His service. I would have you understand how pleasant it is to die, when one has faithfully served so good a Master.\"\nAfter the professed Religious withdrew, the novices were introduced to the bedside of Father Susanne. The Superior-General asked him to address to them also some words of edification.\n\n\"I pray,\" said the holy priest, \"that they may be possessed of a great love of the Society of the Oblates and of its rules; that they may practice great regularity and obedience, and especially great simplicity; that they may manifest an open-hearted confidence in their Master of novices, and, after their profession, in their Superior; that their religious submission be complete; that simple obedience may rule their hearts. Happy days of the noviciate!\"\n\nThen, looking with an affectionate glance on two novices, whose period of noviceship was about to expire, he said: \"Oh, what a happiness is soon to be yours, that of dedicating yourselves for ever to God! Is it not a blessed privilege to be members of our society? This privilege is now my consolation. Where should I now be, if I had not become a Religious in our society. I further pray that they may not be afraid to suffer for Jesus Christ. By suffering for Him, we become like Him. I pray that they may love God with a great love, and labour for his glory with indefatigable zeal; never seeking themselves in any of their works, but always having God in view, God alone, God alone, God before all things. Let them make no account\nof human praise, for if they do, they will have no other reward. Ah, what a miserable reward is human praise, even though it be sincere! If you are successful in your labours, some will be jealous of you, and others will speak to your advantage; but their praises will only be momentary.\" \"You pray for many blessings then upon them?\" said the Superior-General. \"Yes,\" said Father Susanne, \"I am bound in gratitude to do so. They have done me many services during my long illness. The prayers of a dying Religious are ever heard; and if from the height of Heaven, where I hope soon to be, I saw that any one of them was on the point of straying from the right path, I would pray for him that God's holy hand would hold him back from such danger.\"\n\nHe lived on still for several days, edifying all who approached him, by the heroic virtues which he continued to practice on his bed of death. His loving Superior scarcely ever left his side all the time. He was there ready to render him every possible service in ministering tenderly, with his own hands, to the wants of the holy sufferer. But he was far more intent still in ministering consolation and help to the devout soul of his dying son. The voice of the departing servant of God now sank to a low whisper; but, in the breathings of that whisper, one could distinguish these words: \"Cupio\ndissolvi et esse cum Christo,\u201d\u2014\"I desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ.\u201d At last, fixing his eyes on the face of his Superior, he said softly: \u201cOh, my father, is it not the end that has come?\u201d \u201cYes, my son, I believe it approaches.\u201d Then let me go to God! It is time.\u201d The prayers for the agonizing were then recited, and, at the words, \u201cGo forth, O christian soul! in the name of God the Father who created thee,\u201d he believed that his deliverance was already accomplished, and he said: \u201cIs my soul already separated from my body?\u201d \u201cNot yet, my son,\u201d his Superior answered him, \u201cbut it will soon go to take possession of that heaven which Jesus Christ has purchased for it.\u201d He sank into silence for some moments before his death, a radiant smile passed over his countenance, and he gently breathed forth his spirit into the hands of Jesus Christ.\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nThe new society of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate was ushered into existence at a time when France, and it may be said Europe, was but slowly recovering from the shock of the great Revolution. The atmosphere was still laden with explosive elements, and new revolutions were brewing in the air. It was a time highly unfavourable for the growth and development of a new religious order. But God, who provides shelter for the young birds of the air amidst the storms of early spring-tide, was not to leave unsheltered a work which, from its earliest days, exhibited such signs of being born of Him. His loving providence was to raise up for its protection a friend and a father in the person of a saintly prelate, the uncle of Father de Mazenod,\u2014Monseigneur Fortunatus de Mazenod.\n\nThe See of Marseilles was then vacant. This ancient city was the first in France, it is supposed, to receive the Christian faith. On the shores of Marseilles, according to a venerable and well authenticated tradition, arrived Martha, Mary Mag-\ndalen, and Lazarus, whom Our Lord had raised from the dead, having been borne thither, providentially, in an open boat, in which they had been purposely sent out to sea to perish. Lazarus became the first Bishop of Marseilles. Many of his successors in that See were illustrious saints in God's church. Among them stand out prominently the names of Theodore and Serenus. The glories of this ancient See shone forth with new splendour from the middle to the close of the eighteenth century in the person of the illustrious Belsunce, and his successor, Monseigneur Belloy. According to the terms of the Concordat between Pius VII. and the first consul Napoleon, new limits were to be assigned to the dioceses of France, and several dioceses had to become altogether extinct. The diocese of Marseilles was included in this latter category. In 1823, Marseilles was restored to its former diocesan rank, and Monseigneur Fortunatus de Mazenod, uncle of Father de Mazenod, was named its first Bishop after the Restoration. This holy prelate, who was already advanced in years before his nomination, had to wait for six years before he could take possession of his diocese. At last, all obstacles being removed, he was enthroned Bishop of Marseilles. In accepting the heavy burden of his charge, he stipulated that his nephew should be named his Vicar-General. This latter office opened\na wide field for the large administrative qualities and boundless zeal of Father de Mazenod. Whilst occupied with the affairs of a great diocese, he forgot not that his chief responsibility lay in the government of his Society of Missionaries. His character of Missionary and Religious was never hidden behind any of those dignities of the sanctuary which were forced upon him, and which in obedience he accepted. Monseigneur Fortunatus de Mazenod, the Bishop of Marseilles, his venerable uncle, was, as might be expected, the warm friend and patron of the society founded by his holy nephew. He gladly availed himself of the services of the Oblate Fathers in the evangelizing of his diocese. The prisons of Marseilles were thrown open to their missionary zeal. The training of the young clergy was also confided to them.\n\nFor thirty-three years the Oblates of Mary Immaculate were charged with the direction of the Theological Seminary of Marseilles. The crowds of holy and learned priests which came forth from that establishment during the period named, were witnesses to the learning, piety, and wisdom with which it was conducted.\n\nFather de Mazenod was Vicar-General to his uncle for nearly ten years. During that period the chief burden of the diocese devolved upon him, owing to the age and infirmities of his venerable uncle. This enabled him to take the supreme control of the diocese. It had been his wish that it should have been a hospital, but it had been used as a warehouse for the administration of the diocese to re-establish it as a hospital, and it was erected as such, being now used as a hospital for religious purposes. It existed as a hospital for action.\n\nGreat was the joy of His apostolic works in the diocese of Marseilles, where he now established the dread of the Holy See, the most illustrious seat of the Roman Catholic Church, to secure the peace of Marseilles.\nuncle. His prodigious energy and devotedness enabled him to preside over his community, and at the same time administer the affairs of an important diocese. It was a time when the walls of Jerusalem had to be rebuilt. The revolution had left behind it heaps of ruins. All religious institutions had been swept away, charitable asylums confiscated, hospitals closed, churches desecrated\u2014some had been levelled to the ground, and others turned into warehouses or other secular purposes. Under the administration of Father de Mazenod, the desert began to rejoice and flourish, religious communities were re-established, churches were restored, new churches erected; schools, orphanages, and hospitals sprang up as if by some blessed enchantment. The ancient religious glories of Marseilles were called back into existence, in a great measure, by the vivifying action of Father de Mazenod's zeal.\n\nGregory XVI. had ascended the chair of Peter. His attention was soon drawn to the important works in which Father de Mazenod was engaged at Marseilles as Vicar-General to his uncle, who was now evidently drawing nigh to his end. Gregory dreaded that, at the death of the aged Bishop of that See, the government of Louis Philippe would nominate some unfit person in his stead. He also wished to secure for the important city and diocese of Marseilles a continuance of the wise and holy adminis-\ntration of Father de Mazenod. With this double object in view, proprio motu, he nominated him Bishop of Icasia, in partibus, and coadjutor to his uncle. In obedience to the voice of Gregory, Father de Mazenod had to consent to be raised to the episcopal dignity. He was consecrated in Rome by Cardinal Odescalchi, on the 14th of October, 1832. Gregory's object was that he should succeed his uncle as Bishop of Marseilles. The French Government took umbrage at these proceedings. A storm of persecution was let loose upon the new Bishop. He was declared to have forfeited his rights as a citizen of France, and other trying and vexatious measures were adopted in his regard, but God bore him through the storm. His holy firmness, blended with the spirit of wise conciliation, conquered finally the opposition of the government. At the death of his uncle he became his successor in the ancient See of St. Lazarus, A.D. 1837.\n\nIt is not our purpose to enter upon the history of his glorious episcopate as Bishop of Marseilles; we leave that to abler hands. We shall content ourselves with a brief summary of that remarkable period of his life. In becoming Bishop of Marseilles, he aimed at once at copying, in his life and in the administration of his diocese, the examples of his sainted predecessors in that important See. The third in episcopal descent from the great Belsunce,\nhe would seem to have fully inherited the spirit of heroic charity and zeal of that illustrious Bishop. To the ancient Saints who had occupied the See of Marseilles, he bore a special devotion, and sought, with great zeal, to promote their public veneration in his diocese. One of the noblest churches in Marseilles was already dedicated to St. Theodore; but the memory of St. Serenus had almost fallen into oblivion during the revolutionary period. That saint was Bishop of Marseilles about the end of the seventh century. One circumstance in the life of Serenus should make his memory especially dear to English Catholics; it is the loving co-operation he lent to St. Augustine of Canterbury, in his first labours for the conversion of England to Christianity. St. Augustine and his companions, travelling from Rome to England, passed through Marseilles, and tarried for some days under the hospitable roof of Serenus. Proceeding on their journey, they reached Aix. Here the companions of Augustine lost the courage to advance further. At Aix they met with men who spoke to them discouragingly of their project, representing to them the English people as a race of monsters, whom it would be impossible to convert to Christianity. Discouraged by those reports, they refused to continue their journey to England. In vain did Augustine endeavour to reanimate their courage, and to induce them to accom-\nplish the great mission assigned to them by Gregory. Returning to Marseilles with his companions, Augustine placed them under the care of Serenus, and went back to Rome to take advice, in the emergency, from St. Gregory. In the meantime, the wise and holy counsel of Serenus, joined to the inner workings of divine grace, succeeded in dispelling their prejudices and in re-awakening their first missionary courage and zeal. When Augustine returned from Rome to Marseilles with the renewed order of St. Gregory to proceed to England, he found them joyful and willing to accompany him. On his arrival there, owing to the miraculous success of his labours, it became soon necessary for Gregory to send him additional help, to enable him to reap the harvest of souls which had suddenly sprung up in ripeness and abundance. Paulinus, who became the first Archbishop of York; Millitus, who was afterwards the first Bishop of London; and Justus, who was to be the first Bishop of Rochester, were chosen as Augustino's fellow labourers. St. Gregory wrote, at the same time, to St. Serenus, a very beautiful letter, in which he speaks of the wonders of grace that were being wrought in England by the preaching of Augustine, and in which also he recommended Paulinus, Millitus, and Justus to the hospitality of St. Serenus. We mention these circumstances, as we feel our readers will not be loath to believe that the efficacy of the mission was so evident, that even the most obstinate pagans were forced to confess their errors.\nloath to be reminded of the indirect, but loving and efficacious part which a Bishop of Marseilles, in the seventh century, took in the work of England's conversion to Christianity. St. Serenus, during a journey in Italy, died at Blandaret, a town in the diocese of Vercelli, where his holy body now reposes, and where also he is honoured as the patron saint of the locality. Monseigneur de Belsunce had, in his time, procured a relic of the saint from his shrine at Blandaret, which was deposited at Marseilles. During the revolution the relic disappeared, and devotion towards the saint had become almost extinct. Monseigneur de Mazenod resolved to restore this devotion, and to obtain another relic of St. Serenus from Blandaret. He published a pastoral on that occasion, in which he says:\u2014\"As David had promised not to give repose to his eyes until he had found a resting place for the ark, so did I resolve not to be at rest until the relics of my sainted predecessor had again found repose at Marseilles.\" Full of this spirit he undertook a holy journey to Blandaret, where he was to be met by the Archbishop of Vercelli. The news of the arrival of so illustrious a pilgrim, sped rapidly through the neighbouring country. Great crowds flocked to meet him. They rejoiced to see, at the shrine of their patron saint, his living successor in the See of Marseilles. They came in processional order to do him honour, filling\nthe air with the harmonies of sacred music, and singing canticles in honour of their Saint. As the Bishop of Marseilles prostrated himself, in the midst of a kneeling multitude, before the shrine of his predecessor, the scene was solemn and touching in the extreme. The holy prelate was favoured on that occasion by a gift of sensible grace which, while it illumined his mind with the light of a blessed vision, awakened the tenderest emotions of his soul, and brought floods of tears to his eyes. He lay prostrate before the shrine of the Saint for a considerable time, in a sort of rapture, sighing deeply and lovingly. The pious crowds were moved to tears themselves at such a sight, and all felt that a living Saint was there holding communion with a Saint departed. In a letter to his flock, published on his return to Marseilles, he gives us some insight as to what was passing in his mind on that memorable occasion:\n\n\"How can we describe to you, beloved brethren, the profound emotion we experienced when, after a long journey, we found ourselves at last in the presence of the venerable body which, in life, had been quickened by the soul of Serenus. As our eyes reposed on that holy body, we could imagine that we already beheld it transformed, as it shall be on the great day of the Lord\u2014risen in the glory, and vested in the brightness of the elect; its brow encircled with the immortal diadem of the Pontiffs of the living God. 'Behold,' we said to ourselves, 'the victory of faith. Behold the reward of those who have fought the good fight. He\nwho won that victory was once the pastor of that flock of which we are now the shepherd. He has traced out for us the path by which we should guide it to Heaven. He was its father, is now its protector. He will not refuse to help us, his successor, now that we are at his feet. He will bless the flock which we have come, from so great a distance, to recommend to his protection.' Such were the thoughts which filled our breast as we bent our head to the ground, moved by an irresistible impulse to recognize, by our profound homage, the incomprehensible glory conferred by God upon His Saints. From Serenus, our thoughts went back to Theodore, to Cannat, to Lazarus, the contemporary and friend of our Lord, whom He raised from the dead, and who was the founder of the See of Marseilles. We were then led to contemplate, in its full length, the long chain of Bishops who preceded us in that See\u2014a chain extending, link by link, back to the days of Jesus Christ and His Apostles. The same apostolic traditions were transmitted by all, the same doctrine was taught by all, the same sacraments were administered by all, the same authority was exercised by all. We were filled with admiration, as we contemplated how, in the history of this one See of Marseilles, we beheld, revealed in bright outlines, the unity, the perpetuity, the divine origin and economy of the episcopate of the Catholic Church at large. We marvelled, as we considered the perfect unity of our episcopate with that of Serenus, notwithstanding the interval of twelve hundred years which has occurred between our days and his. We are charged with the care of the flock, over which he ruled so wisely as the Good Shepherd. He is upon the altar; we kneel at his feet, our hearts, full of a sense of our own responsibility in being the successor of so great a Saint.\"\n\nSuch were the inner thoughts of Monseigneur de Mazenod, as he knelt before the shrine of St. Serenus. Reverently and lovingly did the holy Bishop\nof Marseilles convey to his diocese the precious relic of St. Serenus, given him by the Archbishop of Vercelli. An octave of celebrations, on the occasion of the translation of the holy relic, was inaugurated at Marseilles, and the devotion to St. Serenus was solemnly restored in that city.\n\nSerenus, in heaven, could not remain a passive or an indifferent witness of the signal honour which was being rendered to his memory by his saintly successor, to whom, we may believe, he, in return, communicated abundantly of his own gifts and merits. If ever living merit deserved to inherit the mantle of some heavenly patron, it was when De Mazenod knelt at the shrine of Serenus. Then, we may believe, that he was admitted to a share in the indirect, but efficacious, apostleship which that Saint, in his day, exercised with regard to England. Certain it is that, scarcely had the last notes of the Te Deum, which was sung in honour of St. Serenus, on the occasion of the translation of his relic, died away under the roof of the Cathedral of Marseilles, when an event of a providential character occurred which was to open a path to an apostleship in England for the sons of the devout De Mazenod. He is soon to see gathering around him, young disciples, whom the spirit of God is to conduct to him to be formed, under his tutelage, for missionary work in England. And on that spot on which knelt\nAugustine and his companions when on their way to England, and on which also knelt Paulinus, Millitus and Justus, to receive the blessing of a Bishop of Marseilles, there he will also behold group after group of his own missionary sons, kneeling to receive his blessing before setting forth for that same land, with intent of treading, albeit in the distance, in the footprints of England's Missionary Saints and Apostles.\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nWe now are about to part company, for a period, with the venerable Founder of the Oblates of Mary, whilst visiting, with our readers, field after field of the missionary labours of the sons of De Mazenod, to find them sowing the seed of the divine word, and labouring for the salvation of souls on the western shores of the great Atlantic, or amidst the snow-clad pine forests and dismal prairies of the Hudson Bay territory, or nigh the margin of the Polar Sea, or among the fastnesses of the Rocky Mountains, or over the surface of the vast region which stretches from the base of the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean, or on the plains of Texas, and by the coasts of the Gulf of Mexico, or amidst the burning sands of Southern Africa, or on one of the fairest Islands in the Indian Ocean\u2014Ceylon. To all these points of Asia, Africa, and America did De Mazenod live to see the labours of the Fathers Oblates of Mary extended.\n\nBut if we break off, for awhile, the recital of the personal history of Monseigneur de Mazenod, we\ndo so in order to follow the transit of his great missionary spirit to those far regions of earth, where destitute souls are to be saved through the labours of his devoted disciples. His spirit of prayer ever accompanied his missionaries, taking part in their combats and in their triumphs. His spirit of piety, fortitude, and knowledge which they had already imbibed, was marvellously stirred up and kept alive within their breasts by his active and loving correspondence, which had a tone of inspiration about it, as if he had been largely aided by the Holy Spirit in its composition. No exile longed for father or mother's letter to cheer him in the land of the stranger more keenly than did the son of De Mazenod sigh for the consolation of a letter from his father, to gladden him amidst the loneliness of the trackless forest, or of ocean-like prairie, to enlighten him in his doubts, to guide him in his undertakings, and to bless him in his labours.\n\n\"Your letter,\" writes an Oblate missionary from a distant region in Africa to Monseigneur de Mazenod, \"has afforded me joy and consolation beyond expression. It imparted to me a new stimulus to labour for God and for souls, with re-kindled fervour, and with a courage equal to the emergencies of my difficult position in the midst of these poor heathens. Accept, my venerated and most beloved Father, the assurances of my deepest gratitude for this proof of\nconsiderate kindness which you have shown to the least worthy of your sons.\"\n\nIn another letter addressed from a remote mission to Monseigneur de Mazenod acknowledging one received from his lordship, we find the following passage:\n\n\"The day on which I received your letter, my Lord and beloved Father, was a real festival day for me, I could not tire feasting my eyes upon its pages. One should have experienced my sense of isolation and loneliness in the midst of these desert regions, and amongst those poor wandering tribes to understand my feelings of relief and happiness in receiving such a letter. It seemed to me for the moment, venerated Father, as if I were transported again into your presence, and allowed to enjoy the great happiness of being nigh to you, and of sharing with those Fathers and Brothers who are privileged to dwell beside you, the holy charm of your society and conversation. You can understand, my Lord, how those of your sons who in these remote regions are fighting the good fight against such terrible odds, stand in need of being guided and inspirited in the hour of combat by the voice of their General. The soldier spirit within my breast as a missionary could not fail to be stirred into bold and courageous action, when the voice of my spiritual chieftain thus addresses me: 'Be a true Soldier of Christ, a good Oblate, and you will force your way through the ranks of your enemies. Victory will be the certain reward of your perseverance.'\"\n\nFrom these extracts we may judge of the character of Monseigneur de Mazenod's correspondence with his missionaries, and of the extent to which he contributed, by his guiding and inspiriting counsels, to\nthe wide-spread and enduring success of their labours.\n\nCanada was the first trans-ocean scene of missionary exploit opened to the zeal of the Oblates of Mary. At the invitation of the Bishop of Montreal, the venerable Monseigneur Bourget addressed to the Founder and Superior General of the Oblates of Mary, a community of that Missionary Congregation was established in 1841 in the diocese of Montreal. From Montreal the Society extended to Ottawa, which was then named Bytown. The geographical position of Ottawa evidently destined it to become a place of great importance. In 1854 it was raised to the rank of a city and became the capital of Canada. The first Mass said at Ottawa was celebrated in 1827 in the cabin of a poor Irishman. In 1832 a wooden chapel was built there, which was still the only place of Catholic worship in Ottawa, on the arrival there of the Oblates of Mary in 1844. A certain progress towards the erection of a new church had, however, been already made, the foundations of which were laid and the walls raised a few feet above ground. Father Guiges, Superior of the Noviciate House of Notre Dame de l'Osier, in the diocese of Grenoble, in France, was chosen as the Superior of the new community at Ottawa. The question of creating a new diocese, of which Ottawa was to be the centre, was promoted by\nthe Bishops of Canada, and accepted by the Holy See. The eyes of the Canadian prelates, and especially of Monseigneur Bourget, were fixed on the learned and holy Father Guiges, as the fittest choice which could be made to fill the new See. The acceptance by Father Guiges of the dignity of Bishop of Ottawa made no change in his ordinary mode of life as a humble Religious. He continued to live after his consecration with the Fathers of his Society until the end of his days, following all the community exercises with the same exactitude as he practised before his promotion to the episcopacy. At the same time he displayed a marvellous energy in the administration of his immense diocese, and in cooperating by his personal labours in the missionary works of the Oblate Fathers. The wooden chapel gave place to a noble church, which was brought to completion under the surveillance of Fathers Telmon and Dundurand, both of whom were gifted with a considerable amount of architectural skill and genius. The devoted missionary labours of those two last-named Fathers, in which Fathers Baudrand and Molloy generously co-operated, were eminently successful in forming and organising a large Catholic community at Ottawa. One of the special works of the Oblates of Mary at Ottawa, was the founding there of a University College chartered by the State, which they still continue successfully to direct. In\nthe meantime, Father Honorat and his brother missionaries were engaged in planting the roots of the new society in the diocese of Quebec. The large and populous district of St. Saviour's, in that city, was assigned to their care.\n\nBut the spirit which Father de Mazzin communicated to his society impelled his Oblates to go forward in search of souls more in need of help than those that presented themselves in the ordinary fields of missionary zeal. In the vast Canadian forests bordering the St. Lawrence, the Ottawa, and other great rivers, tens of thousands of men were dispersed in groups, called Chantiers, during the winter months of the year, their occupation being to fell great trees and to prepare them to be floated down the rivers when the ice broke up in spring. These poor men, who for several consecutive months were separated from all ordinary means of approaching the Sacraments, and of taking part in the public exercises of their religion, were certainly fit objects for extraordinary missionary effort, especially as they were exposed to the great temptations which are ever to be found in such promiscuous gatherings as theirs. The missionary who approaches these poor sons of the wild woods must be prepared to endure privations as great and greater than theirs. He must be prepared to advance through a trackless wilderness\u2014to be lost in labyrinths of high brushwood, and of the\ninterception branches of fallen trees, through which, with axe in hand, he will oftentimes have to cut his way. He will find himself at the approach of night still a wanderer, and compelled to seek shelter until day again breaks in the hollow of some aged tree. He will find his path crossed at times by the swollen torrent, through which he will have to wade at peril of life. Knee-deep in sludge will he have to travel through dense forests, which are gloomy and dismal at mid-day, even as though it were mid-night, by reason of the heavy curtains of thick snow that hang upon the bent branches of the giant trees, shutting out almost every ray of daylight. He arrives at last at the goal of his journey, hungry, cold, and wearied. A welcome may await him, or he may be received with frowns. Even though it be a welcome which greets him on his arrival, kind wishes may lighten, but they cannot remove the bulk of those privations\u2014mental, physical, and moral\u2014which he as a priest, as a man of education and fine feeling, will have to endure whilst passing through the rigours of five long winter months in the open forest, without other companions than those gangs of rough untutored men. But it must be acknowledged that there are attractions of a high order for men of zeal in such missionary exploits. Returning from the Chantiers in the forest, each Oblate missionary counts by the thousand the number of poor woodmen he\nhas been instrumental in admitting to the holy sacraments of Penance and the Eucharist. The evangelizing of the Indian tribes on the Canadian border, and of the inhabitants of the ice-bound coast of Labrador was undertaken by Oblate missionaries soon after their arrival in Canada. Among the devoted labourers in those difficult fields of missionary toil we find the names of Durocher, Pinet, Arnaud, Babel, Charpeney, and others. But still more distant fields of missionary labour await the cultivating zeal of the Oblate missionary.\n\nWe find the labours of Fathers Arnaud and Babel spoken of in the following terms by a Protestant writer, Professor Hind, of the University College, Toronto, in his work *Explorations in Labrador*, published by Longman:\n\n\"The description given by P\u00e8re Arnaud of his journey up the Manicouagan, and his residence with the Montagnais in the interior, is very interesting. I met P\u00e8re Arnaud at Seven Islands, and also one of the Indians who accompanied him on his perilous journey. The Indian drew a map of the country, which I subsequently compared with one which I obtained from Pierre. The delineations of the windings of the river and the lakes and portages resembled one another so completely, that if I had not seen the Indian draw the map in my tent I should have thought that one had been copied from the other, on a different scale. P\u00e8re Arnaud started from the mouth of the Manicouagan on August 29th, 1853, in company with a little flotilla, consisting of seventeen birch-bark canoes, eleven manned by Montagnais who were returning to their hunting-grounds, and six by Nasquapees...\"\nwho had come from the far interior to see the priest of whom they had heard so much from their Montagnais neighbours.\"\n\n\"P\u00e8re Arnaud lost the whole of his baggage at the foot of a rapid they were endeavouring to ascend, and after a month's toil they reached the borders of Lake Mushualagan at the beginning of October. At this lake the Montagnais who accompanied him determined to winter, not only because it was good hunting-ground, but also on account of its being a great rendezvous in the spring for the heathen Indians of their tribe. Lake Mushualagan is about fifty miles long, and varies from three to nine miles in breadth; it is surrounded by high mountains, is very deep, and contains pike, the kokomesh, a variety of salmon trout, the memehil, 'a red kind of fish,' &c. P\u00e8re Arnaud was soon left by the Montagnais and Nasquapee who journeyed with him to Lake Mushualagan. The Indians found that they could not support such a large party by fishing and hunting in one locality. The Montagnais departed to seek better hunting-grounds, the Nasquapees set out to rejoin those of their people who had their lodges on Lake Pletpi, three days' journey from Mushualagan, only one family of Montagnais remaining with the missionary. Three weeks were spent in endeavouring to lay up a store of food for the winter, when another party in eleven canoes came to the lake from the coast, but many of them were ill, and an unusually large proportion were widows and young orphan children. The fish began to retire to deep water beyond the reach of nets, the hunt in the woods was unsuccessful, and a rigorous winter began to set in. The Indians who had left the missionary some weeks before began to return, having also been unsuccessful in their hunt; so that the entire party were compelled to have recourse to their supply of winter provisions until the snow became deep and hard enough for snow-shoes, and the caribou began to descend from the mountains to the valleys. As soon as the caribou\nseason at the beginning of December arrived, the camp was raised, and the whole band proceeded to fresh hunting-grounds. They soon found tracks in the snow; but, to their despair, they ascertained that wolves had been in pursuit. The hunters followed the tracks, and after three days returned with the announcement that they had come upon the bones of a freshly-killed deer, and that wolves were numerous in the neighbourhood. 'Wolves are around us; they will block and disperse the caribou: we cannot escape death if this continues,' exclaims the distressed Indians. A party of hunters arrived from a different direction two days afterwards, and brought with them the flesh of six caribou and two porcupines; but they confirmed the impression which began to prevail that the wolves had driven the caribou away, and it would be necessary to seek other and distant hunting-grounds. Their only hope was the tripe 'de roche' when the caribou failed, and they could not support strength for any length of time upon such meagre diet. At this period a runner came from the Nasquapees, who had left them at Lake Mushualagan, bringing the intelligence that this people were starving, and begging for some provisions. He was soon followed by a poor Indian with his family, who had become blind during the previous week. The Indian imputed his misfortune, unparalleled in the forests which cover the country like a sea, to having slept on the snow, with spruce branches for his pillow, without fire or any covering beyond the clothes he wore. He was overcome with fatigue, and far too weary to make a temporary lodge of spruce boughs, and perhaps, like all his race, too indifferent to the consequences which might follow the terrible exposure to which he so thoughtlessly submitted himself. Fortunately for the missionary, the ptarmigan, or white partridge, came in large numbers to the borders of the lake where they were at this juncture, so that he was able to relieve the necessities of the Nasquapees and the blind Indian's family. They also caught some porcupine and a\nfew rabbits, which enabled them to delay having recourse to the tripe 'de roche.' It now became evident that the whole encampment must break up and separate into single families, scattering themselves over a wide extent of country, in order to find the means of subsistence. During three long months P\u00e8re Arnaud remained in one encampment with a number of the Montagnais who still clung to him; but no heathen Nasquapees came near their lodges, as he had been led to expect. Provisions now began to fail; the ptarmigan, which had been the principal means of support, were about taking their flight to the north. They tried to fish, introducing nets below the ice, but without much success. Their misery increased day by day, until at length it became absolutely necessary to separate and hunt in a new tract of country. P\u00e8re Arnaud returned with a young Canadian, who had accompanied him to Lake Mushualagan, still 279 to 300 miles from the sea. He descended in the spring to the mouth of the river, after having endured much privation and suffering.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"During the morning a number of squaws passed our tents with loads of wood on their back, and bundles of fresh sapin (spruce branches); they were making preparations for Sunday, collecting a little store of dry wood for cooking purposes, and the sapin for re-lining their lodges. P\u00e8re Arnaud is very particular in making them perform their necessary preparations on Saturday, in order to secure a due observance of the Sunday. Towards evening a runner arrived from the Moisie with a message to P\u00e8re Arnaud\u2014a man supposed to be dying wished to see the priest. Without a moment's hesitation, although it was raining heavily at the time, P\u00e8re Arnaud set out on foot to walk eighteen miles, to see the sick man and administer the last consolations of religion. He hoped to find the horse which had so astonished the Nasquapee two days before, but if he did not succeed, he would have to make the journey on foot and return to Seven...\"\nIslands in time for morning service at eight. Fortunately the horse was seen about two miles from the lodge, near the beach in the direction of the Moisie. P\u00e8re Arnaud caught him, and availed himself of the animal's services, much to the astonishment of the Nasquapec, who ran to see the extraordinary spectacle of a man mounting a horse and galloping away on his back. The poor Indian laughed, shouted, and danced with delight, expressing in a loud voice his admiration of both rider and steed. P\u00e8re Arnaud reached the Moisie settlements at 10 p.m. The night was dark and stormy, yet he crossed the broad Moisie Bay in a bark canoe, during a storm of wind and rain, administered the last sacraments to the dying man, re-crossed the bay, re-mounted his horse, and, following the shore of the gulf, reached Seven Islands at 2 a.m. Such actions win the esteem of the half-savage Montagnais and wholly savage Nasquapees with whom he comes in contact, and are a most effectual means of securing their lasting attachment. The influence which P\u00e8re Arnaud exercises over these Indians is extraordinary; and it appears to be well earned by numerous acts of charity, deeds of daring, and much self-denial, as well as by an entire devotion to the object of his mission.\"\n\n\"At half-past seven on Sunday morning the bell of the Mission chapel tolled for Mass. By twos and threes the Indians left their lodges and repaired to the sacred edifice. A little before eight I entered the chapel and found it already full; the Indians, however, made room for me, and I took my place among them. The appearance of the congregation was very impressive; on one side were kneeling about eighty squaws and young Indian girls, on the other side nearly the same number of men. The congregation consisted of Montagnais from the interior and from the coast, Nasquapees from Ashwanipi and Petichikapau, a lake beyond Ashwanipi on the table-land, a few French Canadians...\"\nfrom Seven Islands and the Moisie, and a few Montagnais half-breeds.\"\n\n\"When the Indians went one by one to the altar-railing to receive the Sacrament, the native habits of Otelne and Arkaske were well displayed. They were squatted on the floor near me in the background, but when their turn came they rose and wound their way through the other kneeling Indians with a silent and quick step, which reminded one irresistibly of their motions when stealing swiftly through a thick forest of young trees. They seemed scarcely to touch any of the worshippers kneeling close together, and when passing noiselessly through the crowd, they did not appear to cause the slightest inconvenience, or attract any perceptible attention.\"\n\n\"Another comparison forced itself upon my mind as I was surveying these Indians eating the 'pain beni,' which was handed round in the form of a pyramid prettily decorated with ribbons, more in keeping with the solemn service in which they had just been engaged. I thought of the condition of their wild brethren wandering through the dreary forests or over the moss-covered rocks of the Labrador Peninsula, who had never heard of the name of Christ, who had no real knowledge of sin, none of redemption, and none of the life to come\u2014who were steeped to the lips in superstition, holding imaginary communication with evil spirits, and endeavouring to appease their malice with miserable offerings of food, blood, and sometimes of human life. I thought, too, of the years of incessant labour and patient endurance which the missionary had undergone in order to bring these Indians together at stated periods and teach them morality, honesty, and truth, the responsibilities of the present and the hopes of a future world.\"\n\n\"At six in the evening we assembled at the chapel to...\"\ntake part in a procession which was to march to a large cross 400 yards distant. After a short preliminary service, the priest, in his robes, walked out of the chapel, and was followed by the women, dressed as at morning service. Some Indian lads bearing a small platform, on which was placed a half-veiled gilt image of the Virgin and Child three feet high, next took up their position. The men brought up the rear. As soon as the whole body of Indians were assembled in the open air, two children carrying a red cross headed the procession; the women followed two and two; then came the lads with the image; then the priest with his two assistants clothed in surplices, and holding lighted candles; and finally the men. As soon as the procession started the women began a chant, in which the men soon joined. The singing continued until the priest arrived at the cross, when he entered a little temporary chapel constructed of branches of trees, and chanted a short service, all the congregation kneeling on the wet grass. A hymn was then sung, and the procession returned to the chapel in the same order as before. The cross is about fifteen feet high, and bears the following inscription:\n\nJESUS NIRAN KAOTS NIPIKIUM.\n(Jesus who died on the cross.)\n\nAnd in smaller characters below\u2014\n\nKanaskamnest mak kakuskurtak\n(Oblat-Marie Immacul\u00e9e.)\n\nThe cross was placed in a small enclosure, and the path to it was ornamented with spruce trees stuck in the ground and forming an avenue. The singing of the women sounded very well in the open air, and the responses of the men were much less harsh than in a small and crowded chapel. It was dusk before the procession had returned and re-entered the chapel; a few candles were lit, a hymn sung, and the ceremony was closed with the customary priestly blessing. The effect of this display upon the Indians was very marked, and no one\npresent who was familiar with Indian heathen customs, could fail to rejoice at the contrast it presented to a Medicine dance, or Scalp dance, or a Dog feast, which were once common in the same camping ground before the Roman Catholic missionaries succeeded in winning the Montagnais from their earlier customs and superstitions, and instilling into their minds the germs of a better hope.\"\n\n\"On the 16th, P\u00e8re Arnaud, shortly before noon, set sail for Bersamits in an open boat, with a number of Montagnais. The whole Indian population of Seven Islands were about to disperse as soon as the priest had taken his departure, birch-bark lodges were taken down, canoes were launched, and their little store of worldly goods were all embarked ready for a start the moment the P\u00e8re left the shore. A salute was fired by the Indians, which was repeated again and again. They watched the boat until it had reached half way across the bay, when, one by one, they walked slowly to their canoes. The Nasquapees were going to the Moisie\u2014some of them to retrace their steps to Ashwanipi and Petichikapau.\"\n\n\"The description of a station given by P\u00e8re Babel expresses the opinion which the Catholic missionaries have formed of the Montagnais. It differs in no respect from what we saw at Seven Islands, where P\u00e8re Arnaud officiated. 'This last spring (1854) I started for these missions in a schooner bound for Labrador, and after fourteen days of monotonous navigation, I reached the port of Itamameou (east of Natashquan).'\n\n\"I was truly happy to find myself among my Indians again; they are so good, so ingenuous, so submissive. The missionary is truly amidst them like a father amidst his children. These are the poor people who fear and detest sin. If you only knew how bitterly they deplore the errors of their past life; how their perseverance in well-doing, and\nthe harmony of their conduct, are capable of putting to the blush many Christians far more privileged than they by the abundance of the help which they receive!\n\n\"It is well worthy of notice, that the mission chapels at Itamameou, Mingan, Seven Islands, Manicouagan, Islets de Jeremic, &c., &c., are chiefly maintained by the contributions of the Indians. P\u00e8re Babel concludes his letter by the following tribute to the liberality of the Montagnais towards their religious teachers:\u2014'The Reverend Father Durocher, having attended this year the missions of the Islets de Jeremie, could interest you greatly by the recital of his travels. The good father could speak to you of the extraordinary generosity of the Indians who frequent that post, some of whom deprived themselves of necessaries in order to provide for the expenses of their chapel.'\"\n\nFar away within the north-western limits of America, lay regions vast almost as Europe, which extend from 49\u00b0 latitude to the Frozen Ocean and Baffin's Bay, from the Hudson Bay to the Rocky Mountains. Those desert regions were the domain of the red man, of the moose-deer and buffalo, of the wolf and the white bear. There grim winter held sway the greater part of the year, and fettered land and lake and river in its chains of black ice, and clad them in its mantle of thick snow. In the chief portion of those inhospitable climes, mother earth refuses bread to her children. There no corn waves in autumn-tide upon her plains, nor does vegetable life supply aught to the wants or gratification of the human palate. Man might die of hunger\nthere, though he were lord of boundless territory, if buffalo or deer or fish from lake or wild bird from cyrie came not within his reach to supply him with food from its own substance. But sometimes these feeders of man hold aloof and mysteriously disappear and then the awful solitude of the wilderness becomes more awful still, in the absence of its habitual denizens. Then does the shadow of death fall heavily on the gaunt spare figures of the hunger-smitten tribe. Woe then to the weakest, they often at such times become the food of the strongest. The strong fell the weak. The aged father and mother and the gentle child are struck down sometimes, and the men of the tribe devour the horrible repast. There are few attractions in these howling wildernesses to draw hither the footsteps of strangers from other lands. The skins and furs of their wild animals are the only objects which the miserable inhabitants of those places have to offer in exchange for the goods of the white man. Here, it is true, nature reveals herself in forms sublime and terrible in her forests, over her boundless prairies, up her mountain ranges, out upon her lakes and rivers and seas, aloft in her skies, which are sunless for months in certain latitudes, and which flame oftentimes by night with fires that rival sunflashes by their brilliancy. Pilgrims of science, and men of travel and adventure occasionally come hither; but dame nature is ever\nchurlish in the reception which she accords to them. Upon all new comers she imposes pains and penalties, hardships and privations, oftentimes of a most formidable kind. Many over-adventurous spirits have forfeited their lives in those frightful regions by being swept over foaming rapids, or by being crushed by icebergs, or by being frozen by night-frost, or by being devoured by red men, or by being hungered by food dearth. Thus perished upon those barren steppes, killed by hunger and frost, the noble Franklin and a hundred and more of his devoted followers.\n\nThe inhabitants of these melancholy solitudes had need of the advent of other visitors besides those who came to trade with them, or to study their manners and customs, or to photograph their likenesses, or to view the scenery of their lakes and prairies. They had need of those who would come to claim them as lost brothers, to acknowledge them as children of the same Father, to communicate to them the light of faith, to embrace them in the bonds of charity, and to teach them how to love God and how to love one another. To supply these most pressing spiritual wants of the wandering tribes of the lone north-west of America, was to become the very difficult, but the very meritorious mission of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate.\n\nThe immense portion of British America to which we have just been alluding, was formerly part of the\ndiocese of Quebec. More recently it became an independent district, of which Monseigneur Provencher was appointed Bishop. Gradually the number of priests under the jurisdiction of this zealous prelate continued to diminish, and no new vocations presented themselves to fill the vacancies thus created. Monseigneur Provencher was alarmed at the prospect of his new diocese becoming extinct for want of priests. He found himself at last left with only six priests, some of whom were old and infirm. In his perplexity he took counsel with the Bishops of Canada. The result of their deliberations was their agreeing to make a joint application to the Superior-General of the Oblates of Mary, in view of obtaining a body of his missionaries for the evangelizing of the tribes of the vast district in question. Many reasons at that time combined to deter Monseigneur de Mazenod from complying with this request. But there existed one superior motive for yielding consent to the proposal of Monseigneur Provencher, which prevailed in the mind of Monseigneur de Mazenod over all reasons to the contrary; it was that this proposal was made in behalf of the most destitute souls on the face of the earth. Who so shut out from the help and sympathy of their fellow men as those wild wandering tribes of the north-western deserts of America? Nobody without risk and hardship can visit them in their lonely encamp-\nments; much less can anybody live in their midst and become all to all among them in order to gain them to God, without having to endure mental, physical, and moral tortures that demand in him who patiently bears such trials, the faith and the courage of a martyr. There are other heathen lands where nothing seems to be wild, or savage, or repulsive, but man himself\u2014lands in which, if man repels, nature invites the approach and fosters the sojourn\u2014lands of bright skies and balmy health-giving breezes, where to dwell seems to be a paradise on earth. The home of the red man of the wild north has no such attraction to offer to the stranger who approaches it. Everything, on the contrary, connected with that melancholy land is calculated to isolate its unhappy inhabitants from the rest of human kind, and to exclude them from the knowledge and sympathy of their fellow men. Cupidity will induce traders to visit their ice-locked frontiers. But loftier motives than those inspired by thirst of earthly gain are required to induce other visitors to penetrate to the heart of their lonely encampments in the far wilderness, there to become partakers of all their sufferings and hardships. Their state of utter isolation and spiritual destitution is to form for the sons of De Mazenod one of the chief motives of their being the more earnestly sought after.\n\nIn undertaking for his society the evangelizing of\nthe vast regions referred to, Monseigneur de Mazenod counted upon God's sending many additional labourers into the vineyard, to enable him to carry on the great missionary work for which he had become responsible. His trust in God was not in vain. When the news spread abroad in France that the Society of the Oblates of Mary had undertaken missions for the conversion to Christianity of the Indian tribes inhabiting the north-western deserts of America, an extraordinary development of vocations to that society began to manifest itself. Applications for admission to its ranks came from divers points of France, from the shores of the Mediterranean, from the vineyards and olive groves on the banks of the Rhone, from the Alpine terraces overhanging the rapid Is\u00e8re, from the green fields and orchards of Brittany and La Vend\u00e9e, from the busy centres of Alsace, and the vine-clad plains of Lorraine. These applications came from church students, from young priests, from professors of seminaries, and in several cases from parish priests, who gave up good appointments to become Oblate Missionaries to the Indian tribes. The professions of law, medicine, and the army contributed also a share to the list of novice missionaries. To these generous hearts their own Belle France seemed to lose her power of attraction, and to give place to a rival land in their thoughts and affections. To their own\nhistoric and beautiful France, the land of literature, of the arts, and the sciences, they are about to give preference, as a place of abode till death, to a land without a history, without a past, without beauty\u2014lonely, desolate, and distant. To that land the finger of the Divine Will points, and thither are they prepared, at all cost and sacrifice, to go.\n\nThither are they prepared to go without hope or desire of coming back again, longing for nothing more than to be spent and to spend themselves in labours for the saving of the souls of those dusky children of the forest and the prairie. The greatest earthly recompense which these noble apostolic spirits aim at, is the privilege of dying on the battlefield of their labours, and of finding a grave somewhere on the steppes of the Barren Grounds, or by the margin of the Great Slave Lake, or by the banks of the Mackenzie, or the Peel River, or nigh to the shores of the Arctic Ocean. Other vocations are ripening beyond the Atlantic. Canada is to take a noble part in contributing her contingent to the little cohort of apostolic men who, with cross upon their breasts, are to invade the empire of the prince of darkness in the far north, and to establish on its ruins the triumphs of faith.\n\nOne morning, early in the year 1845, a youthful novice knelt before the altar of the oratory, in the Noviciate House of the Oblates of Mary, at\nLonguiel, near Montreal. He was one who had before him, whilst still in the world, a future full of bright promise of preferment and success, being the nephew of the Prime Minister of Canada, and being on his own part possessed of great natural abilities, which were highly cultivated by a careful education. All these advantages and prospects he renounced in order to become a humble Religious in the Society of the Oblates of Mary. On the morning to which we refer, he came to the foot of the altar to plead for the life of a beloved mother. He had then just received the news that nothing short of a miracle could save her life. With loving confidence he implores God in earnest prayer to work that miracle, and to grant to him his mother's life. He does not come empty handed to address this petition to God. He comes into the Divine presence with an offering: the offering is that of himself. He makes a promise in prayer to this effect, that should God restore his mother to health he would ask his Superiors to allow him to consecrate his whole life to the evangelizing of the Indian tribes in the far region of the Red River. Scarcely had this prayer been pronounced and this holy promise made, when his mother was suddenly restored to perfect health. In fulfilment of his promise, Alexander Tach\u00e9, for such was his name, having heard of his mother's restoration to health, presented himself to his Superiors to seek\ntheir consent to his devoting himself to the work of evangelizing the Indian tribes of the Red River regions. Such were the circumstances which led to the selection of Brother Tach\u00e9, while he was yet a novice, and before he was ordained a Priest, to be the companion of the first Oblate Father who was sent as a Missionary to the Red River. On the feast of St. John the Baptist, 1845, Father Peter Aubert and Brother Tach\u00e9 knelt in the Chapel of the Noviciate House at Longuiel, to receive their obedience for the Red River Missions from their Superior, the venerable Father Guiges, who afterwards was appointed first Bishop of Ottawa. The sentiments experienced by the youthful Missionary Brother Tach\u00e9, as he quitted, as he then thought for ever, the precincts of a home he affectionately loved, are thus portrayed in a letter written by him at a later period:\n\n\"You will allow me to tell you what I felt as I receded from the sources of the St. Lawrence, on whose banks Providence had fixed my birth-place, and by whose waters I first conceived the thought of becoming a Missionary of the Red River. I drank of those waters for the last time, and mingled with them some parting tears, and confided to them some of the secret thoughts and affectionate sentiments of my inmost heart. I could imagine how some of the bright waves of this dear old river, rolling down from lake to lake, would at last strike on the beach nigh to which a beloved mother was praying for her son that he might become a perfect Oblate and a holy Missionary. I knew that being\nintensely pre-occupied with that son's happiness, she would listen to the faintest murmuring sound, to the very beatings of the waves coming from the north-west as if to discover in them the echoes of her son's voice asking a prayer or promising a remembrance. I give expression to what I felt on that occasion, for the recollection now, after the lapse of twenty years, of the emotions I experienced in quitting home and friends, enables me more fully to appreciate the generous devotedness of those who give up all they hold most dear in human affection for the salvation of souls.\"\n\nAn unbroken journey of sixty-two days conducted the two young Missionaries to St. Boniface, on the Red River. They met on their arrival with a fraternal and cordial welcome from Monseigneur Provencher, who seemed, however, to be somewhat taken aback by the youthful appearance of Brother Tach\u00e9. \"I have asked\" he said, half playfully, \"for a Missionary, and they have sent me a mere boy.\" This \"mere boy\" in five years, was to become his coadjutor Bishop, then his successor, and owing to his merits and the success of his labours, St. Boniface, the title of the new diocese of the Red River districts, was to become an Archbishopric. We would here ask his Grace Monseigneur Tach\u00e9, Archbishop of St. Boniface, to pardon us if we think we have intruded too far into the sanctuary of his private life. We feel, however, we have no need of making an apology on this matter, for such a life as his belongs necessarily already to the domain of\nCatholic history. On the 1st of September, Brother Tach\u00e9, who had during his journey reached his twenty-second year, was ordained Deacon, and on the following 12th of October he was raised to the Priesthood. That same day his year's Noviciate terminated, and shortly before the ceremony of his ordination began, he had the happiness of pronouncing, in the presence of Father Aubert, his Religious Vows. These vows were the first ever pronounced in that land; they were pronounced on the banks of the Red River by the great-great-nephew of Varenue de la Veraudre, by whom that river and the surrounding country had been discovered. After his ordination as Priest, Father Tach\u00e9 remained some months at St. Boniface, doing Missionary work, and occupied also in studying the languages of those tribes which he expected soon to be engaged in evangelizing. On the 8th of July, 1846, he received his obedience to proceed to L'Ile a la Crosse, which was reached after a harassing journey that lasted for two months. On his arrival he heard of an Indian chief who lay dangerously ill at Lac Vert, a place ninety miles distant, who desired to be baptized. Thither the young Missionary hastened through dismal swamps and vast pine forests. On his return it was arranged that he was to proceed after four days rest to Lac Caribou, which\nlay 350 miles to the north-east of the L'Ile a la Crosse. On the feast of the Annunciation, 1847, he arrived at Lac Caribou, the first who ever reached that desolate spot, to announce there the gospel of peace. There he had the happiness of instructing and baptizing several poor Indians. His next missionary expedition was to Athabaska: on his way thither he was warned of the fierce and savage character of the Indian tribes who frequented that place; but, nevertheless, he courageously pursued his weary journey of 400 miles to the end, travelling almost the whole way on foot. A great consolation and a great missionary triumph awaited him at Athabaska, which was to compensate him abundantly for the harassing fatigues of his journey. In the course of three weeks he baptized 194 Indians of the Crees and Montaignais tribes. The efforts of the Missionary, aided by Divine grace, wrought a complete transformation in these poor children of the wilderness, who in their exterior became gentle and tractable, and in heart devout and fervent Christians. The next year he visited them again. He found that in the meantime the seeds of faith and piety he had been instrumental in planting, had taken deep root in their souls, and that all his hopes in their regard were fully realised. The extreme enthusiasm manifested on the occasion of his first visit had, however,\ndiminished. He did not look upon this as a circumstance to be regretted, for as he says himself in one of his letters:\n\n\"Enthusiasm is not the ordinary channel through which either the vocation to the Apostleship or the vocation to the true Faith acts. The mature calm of sober reflection sustained by the efficacy of Divine grace, is more to be depended upon and offers more reliable guarantee for perseverance than the excitement of an imagination that scarcely understands what it says or does, or of a heart that is too often forgetful of its own cowardice and weakness.\"\n\nIn 1848, the Indians of Athabaska showed themselves less enthusiastic than they were the previous year; but, in reality, far more deeply Christian. In the meantime those divine truths so new to them, and which their minds so readily imbibed at first, were pondered over by them leisurely; they examined and discussed them among themselves, and the precise way in which they appreciated them was calculated to fill one with surprise. It is true as the young Missionary himself writes:\n\n\"Although the heart which so often rebels against right reason, not only in the case of the untutored child of the forest, but also of him born and nurtured in the midst of civilization still offered its practical objections to the full Christianising of these Indians, nevertheless, the triumph of the Faith was secured at Athabaska. It is now one of the chief centres of Christianity in north-western America.\"\n\nThese happy beginnings inspired Father Tach\u00e9's\nzeal to pursue with continued ardour his apostolic career. The life of a Missionary in those distant regions is chequered by successes and disappointments. The latter would seem often to come in undue proportion. Sometimes, after accomplishing in face of frightful difficulties a journey of hundreds of miles, on arriving at the place of expected rendezvous, the Missionary Father finds that, owing to delays which unavoidably occurred upon his way, he has arrived too late, and that the tribes in search of whom he had set out, have already taken their departure. Meantime his little stock of provisions is becoming exhausted, and the few Indians who have been accompanying him abandon him alone in the wilderness. The dogs of his team are famishing. He divides with them the last remnants of food that remain. He starves himself to save the lives of these poor brutes. If they perish he will have to abandon all his possessions in the desert\u2014sacred vestments, chalices, temporary altar, books, everything. Under such circumstances he begins his return journey. The post from which he started lies perhaps three or four hundred miles away. He may have to pass two or three days without food (one Oblate father, Father Lacombe, was on one occasion six days without tasting food). He breaks the ice which covers some lake over which he is travelling in search of fish, which he may or may\nnot succeed in catching. He aims his rifle at the passing bird or beast. He may be a good marksman or he may fail\u2014failure means hunger perhaps for days to come. Sometimes bird, beast, and fish seem mysteriously to disappear from air, earth, and water, and nothing gives sign of life; all around\u2014everything seems dead or petrified in the black polar frost. Sometimes the missionary and his team lose themselves, and keep straying for a whole day and night over the frozen surface of some ocean lake, a wilderness of ice spreads out from horizon to horizon. No land-mark is there to guide him out of the frozen labyrinth, no friendly voice to direct him. No shelter can be found there by night; no fire can there be kindled; cold, hunger, thirst, the darkness and the storm all assail him at the one time, and hope there seems to be none, save in God. But in God the hope of His faithful servant in that supreme hour burns brightly. A feeling rises up within him that he is then more in the Divine presence than he ever was before. He knows that if he is in such straits it is because he has gone forth at God's bidding to do God's work and to save souls; therefore does he count with fullest assurance upon God's help. He does not count thus in vain, as is abundantly proved by the providential succours that have come repeatedly in marvellous ways to the rescue of Oblate missionaries at most critical moments.\nIn July, 1848, Father Tach\u00e9 was joined at L\u2019Ile a la Crosse by Father Faraud, who was afterwards to become a true apostle in the lone north of America. Lieutenant Hooper, R.N., who took a part in the Plover expedition in search of Sir John Franklin, thus speaks of Father Faraud, whom he met on the shores of the Athabaska Lake, at Fort Chipewyan:\n\n\u201cWe were politely received by Mr. Todd, and at supper were introduced to P\u00e8re Faraud, a French Missionary of the Roman Catholic Religion, with whom I enjoyed the privilege of much interesting conversation. Monsieur Faraud had apparently devoted considerable time to the study of the Indians in this locality.\u201d\u2014Hooper\u2019s Tents of the Taski, page 403.\n\nFor two years Father Tach\u00e9 had not met an Oblate father. His time was spent either with the Indians in the places of their encampments, or in journeying from point to point over the vast district confided to his personal charge. He had to endure often long periods of isolation and solitude. With unspeakable delight did he hail the advent of a brother missionary. For a while they enjoyed together the sweets of community life in the solitary prairie. Then each betook himself anew to his own special missionary occupations. In the commencement of January, 1849, they were both at Athabaska, where disquieting news reached them from St. Boniface. They were informed by their Superior,\nFather Aubert, that owing to the decrease in the receipts of the \"Work of Propagation of the Faith\" in France, caused by the revolution of the preceding year, it was probable that their missions would have to be abandoned in consequence of there being no means of supporting them. The thought of having to forsake the work they had undertaken in behalf of the poor red men of the wilderness was insupportable, especially at a time when the harvest fields of souls which they had been cultivating amidst so many personal sacrifices, now seemed to be ripening for the sickle. With common accord they wrote a joint-letter to their Superior, couched in the following noble and heroic words:\n\n\"The news which your letter brings us afflicts us profoundly, we cannot reconcile ourselves to the thought of abandoning our dear Neophytes and our numerous Catechumens. We will confine our demands upon your assistance to the narrowest limits. We hope that you will always be able to provide us at least with altar breads and wine for the Holy Sacrifice. We ask only one further favour, which is that we be allowed to continue our present labours. The fishes of the lakes will supply us with the food we shall require, and the wild beasts of the forests will furnish us with clothing. Again we beg of you, Reverend Father, not to call us away from a work to which our hearts are so much attached.\"\n\nAt that hour, in their distant homes, fond hearts would beat quickly with joy at the news of their return. Mothers with delighted welcome would hail the coming back of their sons from their distant\nmissions after an absence of years. All this the two young Oblate missionaries knew and felt. And were they to yield to their human feelings, they themselves would also rejoice at the prospect of being restored to civilized life, to the embraces of fond parents, and to the society of early friends. But they had made their sacrifice. They had at God's interior bidding given up father and mother, and houses and lands, and all things for the Gospel's sake. They are not now going to retract holy promises made to God. Nay, they renew their choice of the savage wilderness, with all its perils and privations as the place of their habitual abode; and they declare their continued preference for the society of those poor wild children of nature, whom they are seeking to reclaim from ignorance and vice, to all the endearments of home and to every prospect of earthly pleasure and emolument. Happily the dreaded evil was averted, and Fathers Tach\u00e9 and Faraud were allowed to continue their work of zeal in favour of the Indian tribes of the Red River forests and prairies.\n\nSir John Richardson, when he was on his expedition in search of Sir John Franklin, met Father Tach\u00e9 at L'\u00cele \u00e0 la Crosse, and thus speaks of him and his colleague:\n\n\"They were both intelligent and well-informed men, and devoted to the task of instructing the Indians. They have\nalready taught many of their pupils here to read and write.\"\n\nElsewhere he says of the Oblate Missionaries whom he met:\n\n\"By sympathising with the people in all their distresses, taking a strong interest in everything that concerns them, acting as their physicians when sick, and advisers on all occasions, the Priests of the Mission have gained their entire confidence.\"\u2014Arctic Searching Expedition.\n\nThe position of Father Tach\u00e9 is about to undergo an important change, his virtues and merits mark him out as the fitting coadjutor to Monseigneur Provencher, Vicar Apostolic of the North Western District. A letter of obedience from Monseigneur de Mazenod invites him to Marseilles. Thither he proceeds. His first meeting with the holy Founder was marked by signs of their mutual and deepest appreciation of one another. He beholds for the first time that father whom he had been loving and venerating in the far distance, with a filial devotedness not surpassed by that of any of his sons, who had been privileged to grow up like \"olive branches around his table\" in their native France. And Monseigneur de Mazenod rejoiced in clasping for the first time to his breast the young apostle who had borne the standard of the cross into far regions whither it had not till then penetrated, and into the midst of peoples to whom he was the first to proclaim\nthe glad tidings of redemption. Their minds and their hearts had already been in close and loving intercourse, and the spirit of De Mazenod had found its way beyond the seas and reappeared in the life and deeds of Alexander Tach\u00e9. When Monseigneur de Mazenod unfolded to Father Tach\u00e9 the intentions of the Holy See to create him coadjutor Bishop to Monseigneur Provencher, with right of succession, the humble missionary was startled at the proposal. He pleaded many reasons for not accepting the proffered dignity, and said moreover he wished to remain always an Oblate. \"It is that precisely,\" said Monseigneur de Mazenod, \"I wish you to do.\" \"But is not,\" rejoined Father Tach\u00e9, \"the episcopal dignity incompatible with the religious life?\" \"What,\" replied Monseigneur de Mazenod, \"is it to be supposed that the plenitude of the priesthood excludes the perfection to which the religious man is called?\" Then assuming that lofty bearing and sacred dignity which distinguished him on fitting occasions, he said, \"Nobody is more a Bishop than I am, yet, nobody is more an Oblate.\" He further intimated to him that his acceptance of the proposed dignity would help powerfully to consolidate and to develope the newly founded missions of the Red River; in fact, that the very existence of those missions depended in a great measure upon such compliance on his part. Moved by these words of his\nvenerated Superior, Father Tach\u00e9 yielded his consent to what was proposed in his regard. He received the Episcopal Consecration at the hands of Monseigneur de Mazenod, who was assisted in that function by another Oblate Bishop, Monseigneur Guibert, who was then Bishop of Viviers. Monseigneur Tach\u00e9 was named Superior of the mission of the Red River by the venerable Founder, who at the same time gave an obedience to several Fathers to prepare to take their departure for that distant region. Monseigneur Tach\u00e9 would willingly have prolonged his stay in Europe, had it not been for an engagement which he had entered into with some Indian tribes, to meet them at L\u2019Ile \u00e0 la Crosse early in the following September. He shortened his visits to Rome and to Marseilles, and spent only a few days with his mother and family in Canada, in order not to fail in his appointment with his Indian neophytes. He travelled from Europe in company with Father Grollier, of whom we shall speak later on. In Canada he was joined by Father Lacomb, a young and learned priest, who was soon to become an Oblate of Mary Immaculate, and one of the chief mainstays of the North American missions. Monseigneur Provencher\u2019s first intention on the arrival of his coadjutor, Monseigneur Tach\u00e9, Bishop of Arath, was to retain him at St. Boniface; but he readily yielded to the strong reasons adduced\nby the young missionary bishop for his fixing his residence at L\u2019Ile \u00e0 la Crosse. Monseigneur Tach\u00e9, on taking his departure for his distant home in the midst of the Indian tribes of L\u2019Ile \u00e0 la Crosse, knelt to receive the blessing of Monseigneur Provencher. The latter aged and saintly prelate gave expression on that occasion to the following prophetic words:\n\n\"It is not customary for a bishop to ask for another bishop\u2019s blessing, but as I am soon to die, and as we shall never again meet in this world, I will bless you once more on this earth, whilst awaiting the happiness of embracing you in heaven.\"\n\nMonseigneur Provencher breathed his last at St. Boniface, on the 7th of July, 1853, when he was succeeded by his coadjutor, Monseigneur Tach\u00e9. At the request of the latter when in Rome, the Holy Father gave to the whole of the north-western diocese the title of St. Boniface. Monseigneur Tach\u00e9 continued to reside for some years after his consecration at L\u2019Ile \u00e0 la Crosse. From this point he made frequent and distant missionary excursions to visit different tribes at certain places of rendezvous. The privations which he habitually had to endure, not only when journeying through his vast diocese, but also when at home in his episcopal residence at L\u2019Ile \u00e0 la Crosse, are in some measure revealed to us in the following playful but truthful\ndescription of his dwelling place and of his method of travelling:\n\n\"My episcopal palace is thirty feet in length, twenty in width, and seven in height. It is built of mud which, however, is not impermeable, for the wind and the rain and other atmospheric annoyances find easy access through its walls. A few panes of glass and some pieces of parchment constitute its luminary system. In this palace, though at first glance everything looks mean and diminutive, a character of real grandeur, nevertheless, pervades the whole establishment. For instance, my secretary is no less a personage than a bishop\u2014my valet is also a bishop\u2014my cook himself is a bishop. These illustrious employes have countless defects, but as they are all so much devoted to me personally, I quietly endure their shortcomings. When they grow tired of their domestic employments I give them some work to do out of doors, and I give orders for the whole establishment of Monseigneur to get ready for a journey of some months in the wilderness. The travelling party consists of his lordship, two Indians, and a half-breed, who conducts a team of four dogs. The team is laden with cooking utensils, bedding, a wardrobe, a portable altar and its fittings, a food basket, and other odds and ends. Instead of ordinary episcopal shoes, his lordship puts on a pair of rackets, or snow shoes, which are from three to four feet in length; laced in these his feet glide without sinking into the snow surfaces over which he advances at first very painfully, at the side of his baggage team. At the approach of evening the strength of the whole party, dogs, Indians, and bishop, being exhausted, they halt for the night. An hour's labour suffices to prepare a mansion wherein his lordship will repose till the next morning. The snow is carefully removed, branches of trees are spread over the cleared ground; these form the ornamental flooring of the new palace, the sky is its lofty roof, the moon and stars are its brilliant lamps, the dark pine forests or the boundless\nhorizon its sumptuous wainscoting. The four dogs of the team are its sentinels, the wolves and the owls preside over the musical orchestra, hunger and cold give zest to the joy experienced at the sight of the preparations which are being made for the evening banquet and the night's repose. The chilled and stiffened limbs bless the merciful warmth of the kindled pile to which the 'giants of the forest' have supplied abundant fuel. Having taken possession of their mansion, the proprietors partake of a common repast; the dogs are the first served, then comes his lordship's turn, his table is his knees, the table service consists of a pocket knife, a bowl, a tin plate, and a five-pronged fork, which is an old family heirloom. The 'Benedicite omnia opera Domini Domino' is pronounced before the repast begins. Nature is too grand and beautiful in the midst even of all its trying rigours for us to forget its Author; therefore, during these encampments our hearts become filled with thoughts that are solemn and touching and overpowering. We feel it then to be our duty to communicate such thoughts to the companions of our journey, and to invite them to love Him by whom all those wonderful things we behold around us were made, and to give thanks to Him from whom all blessings flow. Having rendered our homage to God, Monseigneur's valet removes from his lordship's shoulders the capote which he had worn during the day, and extending it on the ground calls it a mattress; his mittens and his travelling bag pass in the darkness of the night for a pillow; two woollen blankets undertake the task of protecting the bishop from the cold of the night, and of producing the warmth necessary for his repose; lest they should fail in such offices, Providence comes to their aid, by sending a kindly little layer of snow, which spreads a protecting mantle without distinction over all alike. Beneath its white folds sleep tranquilly the prelate and his suite, repairing in their calm slumbers the fatigues of the previous day, and gathering strength for the journey of the morrow. What would be the surprise of some spoiled\nchild of civilization if lifting this snow mantle he found lying beneath it bishop, Indians, and the four dogs of the team?\"\n\nThis is not the description of an occasional journey made by Monseigneur Tach\u00e9 in the wilderness; but of journeys habitually performed by himself and his brother missionaries, according as the requirements of their ministry demanded. It is no uncommon thing for an Oblate missionary in the Arctic regions to sleep every night successively for two or three months in the open air, lying upon a rug spread upon the frozen ground on a spot from which the snow has been just removed. On such occasions the whole party, priests, Indians, and even the poor dogs, will group together in one spot instinctively to maintain vital heat under the appalling cold of those worse than Siberian nights. Monseigneur Tach\u00e9 had not yet taken possession of his Cathedral; he preferred to remain for some further period at L'\u00cele \u00e0 la Crosse, from which place he could visit with greater facility the missionary posts in the north of his immense diocese. He thus describes his visit to Lac la Biche, where Fathers Tissot and Maisonneuve had pitched their tent:\n\n\"A canvas tent in the midst of snow, even though it be planted on British soil, does not present a proper idea of English comfort. On the day of the arrival of their bishop they took possession of their poor cabin, which cost them much trouble to erect. They did not possess even a single\nchair; a log of wood had to serve as an episcopal seat. He to whom it was presented would have accepted it with still greater pleasure, if he thought that by doing so he could lessen the discomforts of those by whom it was offered to him. Hard work and anxieties were not the only trials of these two young fathers; hunger also contributed its own share to their sufferings. I was profoundly afflicted in finding those beloved confr\u00e8res pale emaciated and grief-stricken.\"\n\nThe fisheries of Lac la Biche were a failure that year. A famine among the tribes on its borders was the consequence. The fathers had to suffer with the others. Monseigneur Tach\u00e9 continues:\n\n\"The visitors brought some provisions and other help. We then remembered the words of the Divine Master, 'When two or three are gathered together in my name, I am in the midst of them.' We were five, we should then be heard if we joined in prayer. A High Mass was sung, and a novena of prayer in honour of the fisherman Apostle, St. Peter, was inaugurated, to implore of God, through his intercession, a cessation of the fish famine. The prayers had scarcely been offered when an abundant take of fish, which appeared miraculous, followed. Since then the supply of fish has not failed. At their different missionary posts the Fathers have not only to catechise and administer sacraments, but they have also sometimes to perform the rudest manual works. They have to dig and plough, and sow potatoes and corn, where such luxuries can be made to grow in that inhospitable clime. By example and persuasion they finally succeed, though not always, in inducing the Indians to undertake the tilling of the earth and the raising of crops.\"\n\nThe missionary has further to act as mason, and carpenter, and blacksmith, &c., according to circum-\nstances. From Lac la Biche Monseigneur Tach\u00e9 set out for the mission of Our Lady of Victories, at Athabaska. He launched his canoe on the waters of the giant river, the Athabaska, at a point which was considered unnavigable and full of dangers. It was important for the object proposed in the establishment of the mission of our Lady of Victories, namely, that it should serve as a central depot for the various other missions, to ascertain whether that river was navigable or not. To his great satisfaction he was able to assure himself, by personal experience, of its being navigable at those points where it was supposed to offer insuperable obstacles to progress on its waters. On the morning of the 2nd of July, at 2 a.m., after a journey of ten days, he arrived at our Lady of Victories. At the sound of their Bishop's voice asking for admission in the early morning, Fathers Grolier and Grandin and Brother Alexis rose without delay to receive him. Tears of joy at the happy meeting were abundantly shed on both sides. When the news of the arrival of the \"great man of prayer\" reached the neighbouring tribes, they flocked in crowds to the mission to do honour to him who had been the first to preach to them, seven years previously, the message of salvation. The arrival at the same time of Father Faraud, and the good news he brought of the success of his mission at the great Slave Lake, completed the joy of the missionaries of\nAthabaska. They spent there one of those delicious weeks which one is rarely privileged to enjoy on earth. At last the morning of their separation came, and each had to return to his life of isolation in the vast solitude of the wilderness, where no other companions awaited him but the poor children of the forest and prairie. With heavy hearts they bade one another good-bye, feeling the keenness of the separation the more, because of the fulness of the joy they had experienced in one another's society, during the period of their temporary reunion. \"O you my brothers,\" exclaims Monseigneur Tach\u00e9 in referring to this incident, \"who have the happiness of living always in community, have pity upon those who cannot enjoy that consolation; pray for your isolated brethren.\" During the year 1856, the Fathers at Lac la Biche succeeded in opening a way through the thick forest which separated their beautiful lake from the prairies that fringed the borders of the river Athabaska. This herculean labour was accomplished by months of incessant toil on their part. The opening of this roadway through the forest facilitated very much the expedition which the missionary of Lac la Biche undertook, every year, to visit the Indians of Saskatchewan. Monseigneur Tach\u00e9 having visited several of the most distant parts of his diocese, at last directed his steps to St. Boniface. Here, through the zeal of his\npredecessor, he found erected a cathedral, an episcopal palace, which, though plain, was large and commodious, and a convent, which was tenanted by a community of Canadian Sisters of Charity. The cathedral was a fine church, and was the only building which deserved to be called a church in that diocese. His palace, besides being an episcopal residence, became an asylum for blind and aged Indians, and an orphanage, into which were gathered many poor little waifs and strays of humanity, whom he picked up on his missionary circuits. There also he fed and lodged, from time to time, several Indian Chieftains, whilst they were being trained in the practice and knowledge of the Christian religion, which it was intended they should afterwards become instrumental in propagating among their respective tribes. From St. Boniface Monseigneur Tach\u00e9 continued to visit point after point of his vast diocese. In December, 1860, he undertook a journey which was to last for six or seven weeks. It lay through one of the most desolate portions of his diocese, and he had to suffer more than ordinary discomforts, chiefly from the absence of fuel. The intense cold had destroyed all vegetation, and it was with difficulty that even the roots and stumps of trees could be found wherewith to kindle a fire at the close of the day's journey. On the morning of the 14th of December he writes:\n\n\"We left our snow bed at the early hour of one a.m. to\ncontinue our journey; we travelled all night; at ten a.m. we halted to rest and to partake of a little food. We found it almost impossible to kindle a fire; at last we partially succeeded. I sat beside the dying embers, cold and hungry and wearied; a peculiar sadness oppressed me. I was then nine hundred miles distant from St. Boniface.\"\n\nThis sadness of which the good bishop speaks would seem to be a presentiment of what was then occurring at St. Boniface, the news of which he would not learn till his return. Leaving the zealous prelate to pursue his journey in the desert with a solitary guide, we ask our readers to accompany us back to St. Boniface.\n\nThe hospitable shelter of the bishop's house had been extended, in his lordship's absence, to a great sufferer, a venerable missionary, Father Goiffon. This devoted priest, being on his way to the scene of his labours, listening only to the promptings of his zeal, left his companions behind and advanced alone on horseback, hoping thus to get quicker to his journey's end. On the 3rd of November he was overtaken by a furious tempest, alone, in the midst of a great prairie, where he could find no shelter. A violent and intensely cold wind lifted the snow in thick clouds from the ground. Father Goiffon's clothes, which were still wet from the rain of the previous day, became one mass of ice. He still struggled forward till the close of the day. His general sufferings were so great that he did not perceive that both his feet had become frozen. His\nhorse could carry him no further, he had to alight. It was then he discovered that he could no longer use his feet. At the side of his poor horse he sank down in the snow. There he lay for five long nights and four days. His horse died of hunger and fatigue. To save his own life from death by starvation, he contrived to cut some morsels from the dead body of his horse. On the morning of the 8th of November he was discovered in this frightful situation. The Fathers of St. Boniface hearing of his condition, went immediately in search of him. They stayed with him for a fortnight, awaiting his being sufficiently recovered to bear the fatigue of his removal to St. Boniface. Medical aid, with some difficulty, was procured for the invalid. On examination it was found that amputation of both feet would be necessary, in order to save his life. This operation was performed. That night hemorrhage set in. On the morning of the 14th of December his life was despaired of. At ten a.m. that day the attendants in the chamber of the holy sufferer were suddenly startled by the cry of \"fire.\" Presently Fathers Simonet and Mestre rushed into his room and informed him that the house was on fire, and that they had come to rescue him. \"Go quickly, Fathers,\" he said, \"and save other lives more precious than mine. Leave me to perish in the flames, for my life is worthless. I am ready now to die, if it be God's\nwill.\" Hurriedly seizing him, they bore him safely through the dense smoke and stifling heat. Perceiving that he was almost naked they endeavoured in vain to re-enter the burning house, to procure a covering of some sort to wrap him in. They were forced, by a sad necessity, to allow him to remain for a considerable time in the cold December air, without covering of any sort to preserve the needed warmth. But the kind providence of God rendered this circumstance instrumental in saving his life. The intense cold stopped the hemorrhage, and his life for that time was spared. The flames continued to spread. Vain were the efforts of the Fathers and the crowd of affrighted Indians who flocked to their help, to stay the progress of the fire. Alas! one poor blind man, who was housed through charity in the bishop's palace, perished in the conflagration, all efforts to rescue him proving useless. Burning embers from the house on fire were carried by a high wind towards the cathedral. That noble building was soon wrapt in flames. In two hours nothing remained of the finest edifice in the Hudson Bay territory but a few fragments of calcined walls. After a short interval the fire resumed its destructive course. This time it was the convent of Sisters of Charity that took fire. Vain was the struggle to save it. It perished with its granaries and stores of clothing and pro-\nvisions, which the good Sisters had charitably accumulated in view of providing food and raiment for orphans, and for the aged and infirm who depended on them for their support. What was the grief of the good bishop, Monseigneur Tach\u00e9, when, on his return from his painful journey, he found his whole establishment, and the noble cathedral on which his predecessor had spent thirty-five years in founding and erecting, now reduced to ashes! He thus writes on the subject to the Bishop of Montreal:\n\n\"You may judge, my lord, of my emotion when, on the 23rd of February, after a journey of fifty-four days in the depth of winter, after sleeping forty-four nights in the open air, I arrived at St. Boniface, and knelt in the midst of the ruins caused by the disaster of the 14th of December, on that spot where lately stood a thriving religious establishment. But the destruction of the episcopal establishment was not the only trial which it pleased God that year to send us. A frightful inundation invaded our colony, and plunged its population in profound misery. What should the bishop of St. Boniface do in presence of these ruins, and under the weight of so heavy a load of affliction, but bow down his head in christian and loving submission to the Divine will, whilst blessing the hand that smote him, and adoring the merciful justice of God who chastised him.\"\n\nWhilst the flood was at its height, another event occurred which caused additional grief to the heart of the good bishop. The Superiress of the Sisters of Charity, Sister Valade, died. No doubt her death was hastened by the calamities which she witnessed.\naround her, and in which she so largely shared herself. There was something peculiarly sad about her funeral procession. All who took part in it had to walk knee deep in water whilst conveying her holy remains for interment to the flooded ruins of the cathedral. Alas! not a dry spot could be found for her grave.\n\nThe missionary spirit of Monseigneur Tach\u00e9, though sorely tried and chastened by the succession of disasters we have spoken of, was not crushed or cast down thereby. He lost no time in setting to work for the rebuilding of what had been destroyed by fire and flood. An ample benediction was awaiting the heroic efforts of the devoted prelate to raise up again the ruined walls of Jerusalem. From the ashes of the former cathedral, phoenix-like, a church of nobler dimensions rose. Professor Hind, in his narrative of the Red River Exploring Expedition, published by Longman, thus describes the impressions produced upon him, though a Protestant, in visiting St. Boniface for the first time:\n\n\"From whatever direction Red River is approached, the journey has to be made through a wilderness in which no signs of civilization are to be seen for several hundred miles, much less a church in which divine service is celebrated by attentive and intelligent worshippers. By far the most imposing ecclesiastical building in the settlement is the Roman Catholic Cathedral. The spires, a hundred feet high, give an imposing aspect to the building. They can be seen from\na great distance, and are well-known landmarks. The internal decorations of St. Boniface, for so remote a region, are very striking, and must exercise a potent influence upon the large and singular congregation that worship every Sunday within its walls. Two or three very sweet-toned bells ring at Matins and Vespers, and to a stranger just arrived from a long journey through unpeopled wastes, no sight or sound in Red River creates such surprise and melancholy pleasure, as the sweet tones of the bells of St. Boniface breaking the stillness of the morning or evening air.\"\n\nThe sentiments here expressed are similar in feeling to those we find in lines written by a celebrated American poet, after a visit to St. Boniface, and which we preface with the words of a writer in the \"Chicago Advertiser:\"\u2014\n\n\"Some twenty-five years since, John G. Whittier, the Quaker poet of Massachusetts, visited this mission, and its peaceful quiet surroundings seemed to have impressed him much as it did me, as over it the Angel of Rest of a better and truer life seems constantly to spread her pinions. After his return he wrote the following lines, in part suggested by the beautiful chime of bells which it still has:\u2014\n\n'Out in the river are winding\nThe links of its long, red chain,\nThrough belts of dusky pine-land\nAnd gusty leagues of plain.\n\n'Only, at times, a smoke wreath\nWith the drifting cloud-rack joins,\u2014\nThe smoke of the hunting lodges\nOf the wild Assinneboins!\n\n'Drearly blows the north wind\nFrom the land of ice and snow;\nThe eyes that look are weary,\nAnd heavy the hands that row.'\n'And with one foot on the water,\n   And one upon the shore,\nThe Angel of Shadow gives warning\nThat day shall be no more.\n\n'Is it the clang of wild geese,\n   Is it the Indian's yell,\nThat lends to the voice of the north wind\n   The tones of a far-off bell?\n\n'The voyageur smiles as he listens\n   To the sound that grows apace,\nWell he knows the ringing\n   Of the bells of St. Boniface.\n\n'The bells of the Roman Mission,\n   That call from their turrets twain,\nTo the boatman on the river,\n   To the hunter on the plain!\n\n'Even so in our mortal journey\n   The bitter north winds blow,\nAnd thus upon life's Red River\n   Our hearts, as oarsmen, row.\n\n'And when the Angel of Shadow\n   Rests his feet on wave and shore,\nAnd our eyes grow dim with watching\n   And our hearts grow faint at the oar,\n\n'Happy is he who heareth\n   The signal of his release,\nIn the bells of the Holy City,\n   The chimes of eternal peace!'\n\nThe writer in the \"Chicago Advertiser\" thus further continues:\n\n\"Of Bishop Tach\u00e9, the Archbishop of this great domain, who resides at this mission, much, very much might be said. His travels, labours and ministry have been extensive and acceptable, still a few words of the Psalmist will better express him as he is, than any words of mine:\u2014'The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord; and he delighteth in his way. Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright; for the end of that man is peace.' And so it seems to be\nwith him, in the peaceful air of this mission, which, with his kindly, genial way, seems to make the above quoted words particularly appropriate, and to cause one to sincerely wish that 'his days may be long in the land, which the Lord his God hath given him.'\n\n* * * * * *\n\n\"The Red River country, Province of Manitoba, was discovered by French Canadians. Sieur Varennes de la Verandrye, born at Three Rivers, Lower Canada, organized an expedition at his own expense, in 1734, and travelled through the country from Lake Superior to Rainy Lake, thence to the Lake of the Wood and down Winnipeg River, to the lake of the same name; up the river to the mouth of the Assinneboine, where he built Fort Rouge, on the point south of the river Assinneboine, almost opposite to the actual Fort Garry. Mons. de la Verandrye, like all the discoverers of the time, had a missionary with him, and Rev. Father Messager was the first minister of the gospel known as having visited this part of our continent. Mons. de la Verandrye was accompanied by three of his sons. One of them was murdered with his party and their missionary, Rev. Father Arnaud, by the Sioux, on Lake St. Croix, between Rainy Lake and Lake Superior. Two other sons of the old gentleman discovered the Upper Missouri, from the Yellowstone. Accompanied by two servants they crossed the country, and were the first white men who saw and ascended the Rocky Mountains, north of the Missouri. The same gentlemen discovered the north branch of the Saskatchewan in its full length.\n\n\"The conquest of Canada by England put a stop, for a long period, to a regular French Canadian expedition in the wilderness of the northwest. The missionaries themselves had to abandon the country. The work of the Roman Catholic missionaries was re-assumed in 1818. Lord Selkirk, anxious to secure for his colony of Assinneboine the...\"\nco-operation of the French Canadians disseminated in the country, requested of the Bishop of Quebec the services of two priests. The Rev. J. N. Provencher, and S\u00e9v\u00e8re Dumoulin, both French Canadian priests of the diocese of Quebec, were asked by their bishop for the important and difficult task. They willingly accepted the proposal, started in birch canoes from Montreal, and landed at Point Douglas, now Winnipeg, on the 16th of July, 1818. They soon after crossed the river, and began the settlement of St. Boniface. Rev. Mr. Provencher remained in St. Boniface until his death, which occurred on the 7th of June, 1853. He was consecrated bishop in 1822, and consequently was thirty-three years Bishop of St. Boniface. After his death, Bishop Tach\u00e9, who had been his coadjutor, succeeded him in the See of St. Boniface. The diocese of St. Boniface, at first, comprehended an immense extent of territory; it is now divided, and was created an archdiocese in 1871. Bishop Tach\u00e9 was, at the same time, named Archbishop. The new ecclesiastical province of St. Boniface comprehends the archdiocese of the same name, the diocese of St. Albert, on the Saskatchewan, presided over by Bishop Grandin; the districts of Athabasca and McKenzie, under Bishops Farand and Clut, and British Columbia under Bishops d'Herbomez and Durieux.*\n\n\"Archbishop Tach\u00e9 has been in the country for thirty-two years, partly among the Indians of the far north and partly at St. Boniface. Archbishop Tach\u00e9, who is by his mother a great grand-nephew of Mr. Varennes de la Verandyre, who discovered Red River, is also descended from Mr. Joliette, the celebrated discoverer of the Mississippi. St. Boniface is nicely situated on the east side of the Red River, opposite the Assiniboine and facing Winnipeg, which affords from St. Boniface a pleasant view of the rivers and of the city. The religious edifices of\n\n* All of the Society of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate.\nthe locality all in a row, parallel to the river, present a pleasing scene, complete and comfortable, whether viewed from a passing steamer, the opposite shore, or the immediate vicinity. These edifices are six in number; the first is the college of St. Boniface, surmounted with its nice cupola, and in which sixty boys receive a good education, not only in English and French, but even in classics. The second edifice is the Archbishop's residence; a good dwelling-house built of stone, having in front walks planted with trees. Then comes the cathedral, built of beautiful stone and of fine design, far superior to any church north-west of St. Paul. The organ, which is really a very fine instrument, built in Montreal, was purchased by friends of Archbishop Tach\u00e9 in Lower Canada, and presented to him two years ago, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of his election as bishop. The fourth edifice, to the south on the row, is St. Boniface's academy for young ladies. This establishment is conducted by the Sisters of Charity, in which there are over thirty boarders, and an aggregate number of eighty pupils. Next comes the Convent of St. Boniface, where the Sisters support kindly some orphans or poor girls, aged and infirm women, whence they visit the sick at home, and perform a considerable amount of other charitable and useful work. At a few hundred yards from their residence the Sisters have just purchased a nice house, where they will have their hospital, which is just now a small building adjacent to the convent. This new acquisition completes, for St. Boniface, a full set of educational and charitable institutions, all directed and mostly supported by the Archbishop, assisted by his clergy and the Sisters of Charity. It is evident that the Roman Catholic church has done a great deal of work here, and that its staff has spared nothing in their power for the advancement and the comfort of those within their reach.\"\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nMissionary posts were now established two thousand miles distant from St. Boniface. The good bishop found it had become a matter of sheer impossibility for him to visit, at necessary intervals, the missions of his diocese. He consequently applied to the Holy See to have a coadjutor named to aid him in the discharge of his episcopal duties. Father Grandin was appointed to this office, with the consent of Monseigneur de Mazenod, under whose eye he had been trained to the duties of an Oblate Religious and Missionary, and who was consequently, well acquainted with his merits and fitness to become a missionary bishop and coadjutor to Monseigneur Tach\u00e9. Father Grandin received episcopal consecration at the hands of Monseigneur de Mazenod, in the Church of St. Martin, at Marseilles. His lordship hastened back from Europe after his consecration, to pursue the same laborious missionary career which he had been already following for several years.\n\nShortly after his return from Europe he under-\ntook, at Monseigneur Tach\u00e9's request, the visitation of the northern regions of the vast diocese of St. Boniface. He left L'Ile \u00e0 la Crosse on the 4th of June, 1861, and arrived at Great Portage la Loche on the evening of the 10th. A large number of Indians were awaiting his arrival. He devoted two days and nights to the work of instructing them, and of hearing their confessions. On the 20th of June he reached Athabaska, where he found Father Faraud, who had then been twelve years labouring at that post, and who had made himself perfect master of the Montaignais language. At the time of the arrival of Monseigneur Grandin, this good Father was suffering from great exhaustion, owing to his extraordinary labours and privations. He left Athabaska on the 1st of July, and embarked on the Slave River. That river was very much swollen below the point of its junction with the Peace River, which was greatly flooded by the thawing of the snow on the Rocky Mountains. Monseigneur Grandin's frail canoe was exposed that day to the danger of being broken and sunk, by coming into collision with some of the huge uprooted trees that were being swept along by the violent current. On the 2nd of July he perceived a large encampment of Indians on the banks of the river. They had intended to meet him at Athabaska, but were delayed on their way by the floods of the river. They were\ngreatly rejoiced at meeting him, and they wished him to remain with them for some days. But he was unable to comply with their request, owing to the scarcity of provisions from which they were suffering at the time. They informed him that the rapids which he was approaching were never, to their knowledge, in so dangerous a condition. They expressed great fears for the safety of his little bark, which they said was too slightly built and too heavily laden to be fit to encounter the fury of the torrents through which he would have to pass. An hour's sail brought the bishop and his little party of Indians to the proximity of the first great rapid. All had to disembark, and everybody (not excepting the bishop himself), had to charge his shoulders with a portion of the luggage. The little boat had to be lifted out of the water, and borne on the shoulders of the crew to the nearest navigable point of the river. These portages were of frequent occurrence, and were sometimes accompanied with considerable difficulties. High hills, capped with thick pine forests, had sometimes to be traversed on such occasions. The bishop had to bear his full part of the fatigue of those difficult portages. He was to be seen, not unfrequently either, heavily laden with some portion of the luggage, or advancing at the head of the party with axe in hand, cutting a passage for himself and the others through the thickets\nof pine wood which crowned the heights they had to scale. On the evening of the 5th of July they entered the Salt River. After a short sail they arrived opposite the hut of Beaulieu, an old chieftain, whose name deserves special mention in these pages. This good old man and his family were true christians, and they had rendered, on different occasions, important services to the Oblate missionaries. Sir John Richardson refers thus to Beaulieu:\u2014\"We received some bags of salt from Beaulieu, who was guide and hunter to Sir John Franklin on his second overland journey, and who has built a house at the mouth of the Salt River.\" In 1856 Beaulieu surrendered his house for several months to Fathers Grandin and Gascon, whilst they were engaged in evangelizing the tribes that frequented that locality. On the departure of these Fathers, Beaulieu and his family were unwilling to return to their house. They looked upon it as a sacred place, an altar having been erected, and the holy sacrifice of the Mass having been celebrated under its roof. They built another residence for themselves, and set their former one apart as a \"House of Prayer.\" The good old Beaulieu did his best to beautify this desert Oratory. He placed all his religious prints around the altar, which the Fathers, on their departure, left standing. At the foot of this altar the old chieftain, as a true patriarch, used\nto assemble, on Sundays and holidays, his children and grand-children, and such Indian families as happened at the time to be encamped in his neighbourhood, to recite the rosary, and sing devout hymns. He would on such occasions address some words of instruction to those assembled, and if he thought the circumstances of any particular case demanded public reproof, he did not shrink at such times from administering it. He recited family night prayers for the members of his own household every night. By such means he kept faith and piety alive in his family during the long intervals that necessarily elapsed between the visits of the missionary Fathers. As an instance of his zeal in co-operating with the Fathers in their labours for the sanctification of souls, we quote the following incident which Monseigneur Grandin relates:\n\n\"In 1856, when I visited Beaulieu for the first time, I met near his house a young man, whose wife had been carried away by a pagan Indian of another tribe. The forsaken husband fell into many irregularities of life after the departure of his wife. Moved, however, by the grace of God, he yielded to my exhortations, and came to the resolution of changing his manner of life. Being anxious about his perseverance, when I was on the point of taking my departure to proceed elsewhere, I placed him under the care of the patriarch of the Salt River, Beaulieu. The latter understood the importance of the trust confided to his charge. He took this young man to live with him under his own roof, for the purpose of exercising a continual surveillance over...\"\nhis conduct. He felt, however, that in order to consolidate the young Indian's conversion, it would be necessary to effect, if possible, a reconciliation between him and his wife. With this object in view, Beaulieu undertook a long and painful journey in search of this young man's wife. He was fortunate enough to discover her, and succeeded in inducing her to return to her husband. The young man, though willing to live again with his wife, felt some scruples as to its being lawful for him to do so. He imagined that before living together again a new marriage was necessary, as they had been so long separated from one another. Beaulieu, to whom he appealed for advice, felt embarrassed for some moments as to the counsel he should give. At last, after some reflection, he made the following reply:\u2014'If I lose an object, I do not thereby lose my right to it; consequently, if I find it again, I can lawfully take possession of it. I see therefore that we can argue in the same manner with regard to your taking back your wife. However, in order not to act imprudently, let us ask God to enlighten us; let us kneel down and recite the rosary together for that object.' Having prayed fervently to God for light, Beaulieu felt that he had given the right counsel to the young man. He then advised him anew to live with his wife, without seeking for any other marriage ceremony than that which had already taken place between them.'\n\nThis was the first time Monseigneur Grandin visited Beaulieu and his family since he had been a bishop. Unfortunately they were then suffering great privations from want of food. With tears in his eyes, Beaulieu informed the bishop that they had nothing but a few carp to offer him to eat, as the floods in the river prevented them catching any other sort of fish; besides, his sons had failed in\ntheir hunting expedition. \"This being so,\" said his lordship, \"I will spend the night in hearing the confessions of all who are prepared to approach the sacraments, and to-morrow I shall be ready to take my departure.\" This resolution was necessary to be adopted, for if the bishop drew upon his own stock of provisions whilst stopping with Beaulieu, he would find himself unable to proceed further with his journey. Beaulieu was much grieved when he heard that Monseigneur Grandin would be compelled to go away so soon. The old chieftain earnestly begged the bishop to send a missionary to stay always with his tribe. \"Formerly,\" he said, \"whenever I asked you to send us a Father, you used to say to me that I should apply to the 'great priest;' now that you have become a great priest yourself, it is to you I make application. The chief trader has informed me that a sum of thirty pounds is coming to me from the sale of my furs. This is all I possess in the world. I will put this sum aside for the support of the missionary Father. Moreover, he can count on the aid of our willing arms to help him to live.\" The following day Monseigneur Grandin sang Mass in Beaulieu's \"House of Prayer,\" and administered Holy Communion to him, and all the adult members of his family. He further administered Confirmation to several Indians of neighbouring tribes. The bishop erected\na large cross on a prominent position, and counselled Beaulieu to pray often at its foot for the Holy Father, Pius IX. \"I always pray for him,\" replied the old chieftain. He then recited aloud a prayer for the Pope and the Church, which he said Fathers Faraud and Eynard had taught him. \"I alone,\" he said, \"know that prayer, but I repeat it aloud that all the others may be able to join with me in saying it.\" Having given his blessing to Beaulieu and his family, and also to a large group of Indians, and having shaken hands with everybody, the bishop embarked again on the Salt River on his way further north, his companions being two Indians and a little boy, a grandson of Beaulieu's, who was to become his sacristan. After two days' sailing and rowing, during which they encountered very severe weather, and frequently got thoroughly drenched, they arrived at the Great Slave Lake. St. Joseph's Mission, to which they were going, was situated on a little island in that lake. The bishop writes to Monseigneur de Mazenod:\n\n\"On approaching the shores of the island, we saw a crowd of Indians led by Fathers Eynard and Gascon and Brother Kearney, awaiting our arrival. This is the Mission which I expected would be confided to me at the time when God was about to load me with graver responsibilities. I was deeply moved when I reflected on the sufferings and privations which those Fathers who were sent here in my stead have had since then to endure. Having warmly acknowledged\nthe affectionate greetings by which I was received on my arrival, I was conducted by the Fathers to their little oratory, a room scarcely nine square feet in dimension, which was screened off from a public room in which the Indians assembled for Holy Mass, and evening devotions on Sundays and Holidays, and for instructions on week-days. This little oratory, poor and narrow as it was, nevertheless contained as really as did the womb of Mary, Him whom the Heavens and the earth cannot contain. Could you visit this humble sanctuary in the wilderness, I am sure you would pray here with as much fervour as if you were in one of your magnificent churches of Marseilles. I found the whole furniture of the house to consist of a few trunks which served as sitting benches, five roughly made chairs and three tables. I could not find in the whole establishment a sheet of letter paper wherewith to continue my correspondence with your lordship. The Fathers are driven to such shifts for want of writing paper, as to be obliged to register births and marriages as concisely as possible, in order to economise the few scraps still at their disposal.\"\n\nHis lordship attributes this scarcity of paper, and of other essential requisites, to a disaster that occurred the previous year, when the greater portion of the supplies intended for those distant missions was swept away by the floods of a swollen river, which was being crossed at the time. This disaster happened under the eyes of Monseigneur Grandin, who nearly lost his own life in seeking to save supplies, so much needed by the hard working and isolated missionaries, for whom they were intended, and who would have to endure severe privations of many kinds, for a whole year, if deprived of them.\nThe two Fathers who were then attached to St. Joseph's Mission were seldom to be found both in residence there at the same time; one or the other was generally engaged in missionary work in behalf of some Indian tribe, sometimes at a distance of three or four hundred miles. Shortly before the bishop arrived at St. Joseph's, on the Great Slave Lake, Father Gascon came back from a prolonged visit to a tribe that was encamped far away in the interior of the desert. The place of their encampment was so difficult of access, that he could not use a sledge for the conveyance of his luggage and provisions. He was forced to carry, on his own shoulders, for hundreds of miles, a great portion of his effects; an Indian who accompanied him carried the remaining portion. On the 26th of July, the bishop left St. Joseph's Mission on the shores of the Great Slave Lake, for the Mission of the Sacred Heart of Mary on the Big Island. This mission had been established two years previously by Father Grollier. The Big Island lies at the head of the Mackenzie River, at the point where it issues from the Great Slave Lake. The bishop, accompanied by Brother Kearney, his little sacristan, and two Indians, reached that island on the 30th of July. In crossing the Great Slave Lake it was with difficulty they kept their canoe afloat, as the water was continually oozing in through its many leakages, placing their\nlives in continual peril during the whole of their voyage. The bishop spent a week of apostleship in the midst of the Indians of the Big Island, at the close of which he embarked on the Mackenzie for Fort Simpson. At that time he was occupied with the project of establishing, somewhere on the banks of the Mackenzie, a mission, which would be suitable as a place of rendezvous for the Indians, and which would serve as a central depot for collecting supplies for the outlying missions of the Mackenzie regions. On the first evening of his sailing from the Big Island, he and his little party drew ashore and encamped on a spot which, on further examination the next morning, seemed to be well adapted as a position for his projected establishment. After praying to God for light and guidance, he came to the resolution of founding a mission there, and of dedicating it to Divine Providence. He planted a large cross on a site on which he hoped to see afterwards a new church erected. His hopes were fully realised. The Mission of Providence, on the banks of the Mackenzie, is now one of the most flourishing of the Oblate missions in those far regions. Proceeding with his voyage, he arrived at Fort Simpson on the 10th of August. Here an extraordinary gathering of divers nationalities occurred at the time of the bishop's visit. The death-stillness which habitually reigns around those lonely posts of the Hudson Bay\nCompany, called \"Forts,\" was disturbed at Fort Simpson on that occasion by a jargon of voices and a babel-like confusion of tongues. The ten large barks that had conveyed the furs purchased from the Indians to the Great Portage la Loche, had then just returned to Fort Simpson laden with merchandise. Each bark was manned by a crew composed of different nationalities. The traders and their families, and a large number of the employ\u00e9s of the company, were also assembled there. The motley crowd was composed of English, Irish, Scotch, Canadians, Norwegians, Orcadians, Canadian half-breeds, and others. Among the Indians assembled there at that time were the Santeux, the Maskegons, the Crees, the Esclaves, the Dog-Ribs, the Montagnais, the Condeaux-Jaunes, the Peaux de Lievre, the Letanais, the Secanais, and some Esquimaux. Fathers Seguin and Gascon accompanied the fleet of boats from Portage la Loche. With their assistance the bishop was able to begin a mission in regular form, in behalf both of the Indians and of the white men then assembled in such unusual crowds at Fort Simpson. His lordship preached four times daily during the mission, twice in Montaignais and twice in French. He and Fathers Seguin and Gascon were almost continually employed during the intervals between the sermons, in giving private instructions to several Indians whom they were preparing\nfor the grace of Holy Baptism. Among those who presented themselves for Baptism was an old Indian woman, who belonged to an unknown tribe in Russian America. She had met Father Grollier somewhere, when he was on one of his missionary expeditions. He instructed her very carefully in the principal points of Christian knowledge; but owing to the violent opposition which was raised to her becoming a Christian, she was unable to present herself sooner for Baptism. This poor aged woman exhibited traits of heroism and constancy in embracing the Christian faith, worthy of the first confessors of Christianity. She was the first of her nation to embrace it.\n\nOn the 20th of August, the bishop left Fort Simpson for the Mission of St. Raphael, at Fort de Liard. From the Mackenzie he entered the river de Liard. This river rises in the Rocky Mountains, and flows with great rapidity. The bishop's canoe had to face the strong current, the progress was consequently very slow and difficult. For four days they advanced between banks that rose precipitously from the water's edge to a height of four or five hundred feet. Their lives were often exposed to grave peril during this journey, in consequence of the dangerous state of the sides of the over-hanging precipices. They frequently had hair-breadth escapes from the danger of being crushed to death beneath great\nmasses of falling earth and loose rocks, that came rushing down upon them, without any previous warning, from the sides of the steep declivities. The bishop saved his life on one occasion by leaping from one canoe to another, just in time to escape a huge loose boulder that fortunately he saw soon enough, to get out of its way, as it rolled down to the river. The bishop had scarcely escaped himself, when he perceived, to his horror, that Father Gascon and two little Indian boys who were ashore on the banks of the river gathering wild fruits, unconscious of danger, were standing under a great loose rock which threatened every moment to fall on them and crush them. The bishop, and all on board, cried out aloud to them to warn them of their danger, but the noise of the rushing current prevented their cries being heard. At last Father Gascon perceived the signs that were being made to him, happily in time to save himself and his little companions from the impending danger. On the evening of the 29th of August they reached Fort Liard. They found a great number of Indians assembled on their arrival, by whom they were very cordially welcomed, although many of them had never seen a priest before. The following day the bishop, aided by Father Gascon, commenced the exercises of a mission. After three days, Father Gascon set out for Fort Scalket, to visit the Indians on the banks of the\nriver Courant-Fort. These Indians had never been visited by a priest. They had expected a visit from Father Gascon the preceding autumn, but were disappointed. This year he was resolved to make amends for his forced absence from them the previous year, but unhappily he was foiled on this occasion also in his charitable endeavour to reach them. The river of the Courant-Fort, as its name indicates, is very dangerous. The stories told of the numbers who lost their lives amidst its rapids and eddies are very startling. Father Gascon, in order to escape the dangers of the river, exposed himself to other dangers scarcely less formidable. He undertook to scale a high mountain exceedingly difficult of ascent. For some days he pursued this attempt, endangering his life almost at every step. He often found himself at points from which it seemed equally hazardous either to advance or to retire. Far away beneath his feet, almost in a perpendicular line, ran madly on the treacherous waters of the dreaded river; one false step would precipitate him from rock to rock into its foaming depths. Above his head rose straight walls of rockwork, on whose frowning sides he could scarcely find room for his feet to rest, in his endeavour to extricate himself. At last he had to acknowledge himself conquered by the difficulties of his way, and had to renounce for that once, his cherished mis-\nsionary project. If ever God took intent for deed, as we know He does, He must have done so at that hour, when a devoted priest, going forth like the Good Shepherd into the wilderness in search of the lost sheep, was forced, by flood and mountain barrier, to stop upon his way, and give up for a while the object of his search. We may feel sure, however, that Father Gascon renewed again, and with success, his attempts to reach the tribe of the Mauvais Monde on the banks of the Courant-Fort.\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nAfter the departure of Father Gascon, the bishop, who now had only his little sacristan, Beaulieu's grandson, at his side, continued the labours of the mission by himself alone. His little sacristan rendered his lordship important services. At the approach of the hours for the exercises, he went into the woods and rang his bell to assemble the Indians. He served the bishop's Mass, and was useful in many other ways. On the 3rd of September, it was evident that something unusual was happening among the Indians. Upon enquiry the bishop discovered that their chieftain, who had been absent till then, had that day arrived in the camp. From the ceremonious solemnity observed by the Indians on that occasion, the bishop expected to see a sort of royal personage make his appearance. Great was his surprise when he saw issue forth a man, all in rags, more shabby and tattered in appearance than anyone else in his tribe. The bishop discovered that he dressed in that ragged way purposely, as he looked upon it as being beneath the\ndignity of a chieftain to care about fine clothes, and said that it was only silly young men that thought of such foolish trifles. The bishop, who had heard that this chieftain was a polygamist and had three wives, was afraid of the evil effect his arrival would produce in the camp. Great, however, was his lordship's consolation when the chieftain came to him to inform him that, wishing to become a Christian, he had sent away two of his wives, for he knew he could not be admitted to Baptism unless he did so. Many of the huntsmen who had accompanied him sought the bishop, to declare to him that they wished to follow the example of their chieftain, by renouncing polygamy and becoming Christians.\n\nOn the 12th of September, the bishop left the mission of St. Raphael, at Fort Liard, in his birch-bark canoe: one of the two Indians who had been till then accompanying him, took ill, the other deserted him. The bishop had to become oarsman himself for the rest of the voyage. His hardships during that voyage were very great; having rowed all day, he had when night approached to take his part in preparing the encampment, and in cooking the slender nightly repast. He returned to Fort Simpson en route for the mission of our Lady of Good Hope, which was situated nigh to the Fort of the same name. Icebergs began to make their appearance on the waters of the Mackenzie. One morning as the\nbishop's little party were putting ashore for breakfast, their frail canoe was struck by an iceberg, and the water began to rush in, in great quantity. Fortunately they were sufficiently near the banks of the river to escape with a fright and a thorough drenching. Their position, after the wreck of their canoe, was very embarrassing. They had a long voyage northwards into the Arctic circle before them; their supply of food was very limited; winter as it is only known in those dread climes was then setting fiercely in. They were alone on the desolate banks of the melancholy Mackenzie, in the midst of an uninhabited wilderness. Their little canoe lay a wreck at their feet. The time of suspense rolled heavily by, and nothing occurred to lessen the dreariness of their prospect. One day they were squatted around their lonely fire, and preparing in silence to partake of their mid-day meal; the broad Mackenzie was full in view, when suddenly a cry was raised, \"A sail in sight!\" Swiftly wind and current brought within hailing a large barque of the Hudson Bay Company, which was returning from the Great Bear Lake, laden with fish, on its way to Fort Good Hope. The bishop and his party were taken on board and treated with great kindness. On the evening of the 9th of October they were landed at their destination. His lordship was met by Fathers Grollier and Seguin, and the lay-brother\nKearney, and conducted to their humble community residence. The bishop was much affected by the sight of the impoverished state in which the Fathers were then living. Their house consisted of one room twenty-two feet in length by eighteen in width; this room served as kitchen, refectory, reception-room, and dormitory. Their beds did not occupy much space; they consisted of buffalo hides and rugs, which, during the day, were piled together in bundles, and at night were rolled out on the floor. They had no better sort of hospitality to offer the bishop than a share in their own privations, which he joyfully accepted. His lordship gives an inventory of their larder as he found it supplied on his arrival. The whole stock of provisions of the community, for the long winter which was about to set in, consisted of a moderate supply of dried meat and salt fish, twenty pounds of flour, the same quantity of pemmican, or dried buffalo flesh, a few pounds of tea and sugar for great festival days, and five or six pounds of rice. No bread or vegetables could be procured in those inhospitable regions. Flour and rice, and other articles of ordinary home consumption are, in these wild isolated regions, luxuries that can seldom be procured, owing to the enormous distances over which they have to be carried, and the imperfect mode of conveyance available. In the far northern latitude of the Fort of\nGood Hope, the sun sinks beneath the horizon early in December, and does not appear again till the beginning of February. Scarcity of candles was one of the privations which was pressing most severely on the little community at Good Hope at the time of the bishop's arrival. To save the few candles that still remained in their store, they pursued their studies and read the divine office by the light of their log fire. This want of means of lighting their poor hut was severely felt by them, at a time when sunlight was about to fail them for a period of more than two months. They were busily occupied on the bishop's arrival in putting their hut into repair, that it might stand better the storms of the winter which was at hand. The whole of the manual work had to be done by the Fathers themselves, aided by the good lay-brother Kearney. The bishop could not remain idle in sight of the fatiguing bodily labours of his self-denying priests. \"Not being skilled,\" he writes, \"in the mechanical arts, and wishing to share, in some way, in the physical labours of the community, I undertook the task of providing fuel from the woods, and of keeping the fires kindled. Every day I put on a large deer-skin blouse, which took the place of my episcopal rochette, and instead of my crozier I carried an axe in hand, when going forth to make the day's provision of fuel.\" The bishop gives the following graphic description\nof the straits to which the community at Fort Good Hope were put, in their endeavour to raise a domestic oratory adjoining their miserable hut:\n\n\"Father Seguin having no boards or planks at his disposal, erected a number of poles and spars, which I covered with old fishing nets, over which I pasted folds of printed calico and some sacred pictures. Within this humble oratory, the best that our poverty would allow us to erect, He who was born in a stable condescends to abide and to become the partaker of our privations.\"\n\nThe time for performing the annual retreat prescribed by the rules of the Oblates of Mary, was at hand. The little community of Oblates at the northern extremity of the world was to rival in fidelity to this important point of their holy rule, their more favoured brethren dwelling in the well-appointed houses of their society in France. The object of a spiritual retreat is to increase faith, and love, and devotedness in souls. If anywhere the full play of those great virtues is in an especial manner needed, surely it must be there where great labours have to be accomplished, and great privations have to be endured for God, and for one's neighbour, without any human recompense or consolation or hope whatsoever. In holiest and most devoted souls there may be winter-tides\u2014periods of mists and chills, and suspended growth, and inaction\u2014winter-tides that will not cease by themselves,\nand pass away without effort of ours, to give place to a coming spring of brightness and of life. Wise, then, is that foresight displayed by the founders of missionary societies, in supplying to their subjects who labour hard for the sanctification of others, such a powerful means of sanctifying themselves, as the appointed annual retreat presents. Monseigneur Grandin was happy to have the opportunity of joining his brother Oblates in their retreat, the exercises of which were directed by himself. When the members of that little community assembled in their poverty-stricken chapel in the lone wilderness, to invoke the Divine Spirit at the opening of their Retreat, we may feel sure that He who promised to be there wherever two or three were gathered together in His name, was not absent from their midst. By their labours the frontiers of the faith had been pushed forward to advanced lines, bordering on the north-western extremities of the earth. They now entered into retreat to prepare themselves for fresh combats and new triumphs.\n\nAt the time of the bishop's first visit to the mission of Good Hope, the tribes which frequented that post were as yet only partially brought under the influence of Christian ideas and dispositions. Their original lawlessness would sometimes unexpectedly re-appear in their conduct. During his stay in that place, the news of an atrocious crime, committed by\nsome Indian families, reached him. They had abandoned in the desert their aged and infirm relatives, leaving them to die of cold and hunger. Writing to Monseigneur de Mazenod of this occurrence, Dr. Grandin says:\n\n\"I have not met the guilty ones, but I have taken measures which, I trust, will prevent anything of the sort happening here again. I have threatened with the terrible judgments of God, all those who would abandon their aged parents. In our older missions we have not to deplore such crimes.\"\n\nThe bishop made arrangements to leave Fort Good Hope on the 8th of January. The Fathers divided their little stock of flour with his lordship. Had the good bishop been able to foresee what was going to happen, a few weeks after his departure, at Fort Good Hope and in the surrounding neighbourhood, he would not have consented, pressing though his own wants were, to accept the few pounds of flour, the half of the scanty supply of the community, given him by Father Grollier. Shortly after the bishop left, the horrors of famine broke out with great intensity in the regions of Fort Good Hope. Fishing and hunting failed, and all supplies ran short. The Indians in their fierce hunger devoured everything that could possibly be converted into food, even their very shoes, and the furs and skins that they were preparing to dispose of to the factors,\nHorrible to relate, instances then occurred of fathers devouring their own children. Father Grollier makes mention in a letter to Dr. Grandin, which the latter received at Fort Norman, of a poor mother in whom the instincts of parental love were stronger than they were in her cruel and selfish husband. This poor woman's eldest boy was devoured by his inhuman father. She had to flee to a hiding place in the desert with the rest of her children, to save them from a similar fate.\n\nThe bishop's highway in travelling from Fort Good Hope to Fort Norman, was to be the frozen bed of the Mackenzie. The frozen beds of rivers and lakes are almost the only roadways practicable in those regions for winter travelling. The actual distance that one has to traverse becomes enormously increased, by the fact of these frozen rivers having to be followed in all their windings.\n\nThe freezing of the great rivers of the north is an operation of nature which presents many grand and surprising phenomena. A long and hard battle takes place between the mighty and voluminous current and the fierce polar frost, before the latter finally conquers. Innumerable icebergs invade the river, keeping their heads defiantly over the waters as they move on rapidly with its swift current. Gradually they become stationary, and present all manner of huge fantastic shapes on the\nfrozen surface of the river's bed. Again the waters of the river, having been held in check for a time by the obstructions which the frost created, accumulate in great force, and at last sweep away, with terrific crash, the ice-dams which had been impeding their course. A vent being made in the rent ice, the liberated waters rush forth with a roaring sound like thunder. The frozen surface of the river is then flooded to a height of several feet. This surface water is assailed in its turn by the frost, and the great river becomes finally completely frozen over.\n\nDuring the struggle between frost and current, the surface of the river takes the appearance, which it retains, of a hilly country. Great hummocks or hills of ice will sometimes be found extending from bank to bank, blocking up the way. Sometimes the hummocks present sloping, sometimes precipitous sides, and travellers have not unfrequently to cut through them with ice-axe, or creep over them on hands and knees. The banks of the river, where least resistance is offered to the action of the frost, rise as walls of solid ice, sometimes to the height of fifteen feet. We mention these facts in order to give our readers an idea of the difficulties besetting the winter journeys of the missionary Fathers. We shall find the good Bishop Grandin encountering similar and still greater difficulties in the course of\nthat journey, which he resumes in the depth of an arctic winter.\n\nThe bishop and his little party set out from Fort Good Hope in the following order. An Indian advanced at the head of the party, with axe in hand, prepared to hew down any projecting pieces of ice that obstructed their way. The edge of the Mackenzie, near one of its banks, was chosen as their roadway, as the unevenness was not so great near the banks as in the centre of the river, where greater resistance was offered by the current to the frost. The bishop at a certain distance followed on foot. His lordship's task was to trample the snow and break such rough pieces of ice as lay on the track of the dogs that were drawing the sledge in his rear. The sledge contained the provisions for their journey and the bishop's baggage. Having pursued their dreary monotonous way from early morning till night approached, they halted to bivouac on the frozen bank. Whilst the Indians were collecting wood, his lordship was engaged in preparing the place of encampment, by removing the snow with his snow-shoes, which he used as a shovel. The cleared ground was then covered with brushwood, over which some buffalo hides were spread. He undertook the task of cooking their supper on the first night of their journey, as he hoped to make their repast somewhat more dainty than usual, by aid of the flour\nhe had received from Father Grollier. The Indians were contemplating with gusto the French culinary progress of the bishop, when the prospects of a good supper for the hungry party were literally dashed to the ground for that night, by a mound of loose earth rolling upon them, burying fire and cauldron with its savoury contents, under a mass of debris. Supperless, or almost so, they had to lay their weary limbs upon their cold bed, with no shelter over their heads in the open air, on a polar night in the beginning of January. Pemmican or dried fish is the staple food used on such journeys. Pemmican is dried buffalo flesh, prepared, not always by a very cleanly process, by the Indians. Its taste at first is very loathsome to Europeans, but hunger and habit give relish at last to this unsavoury food. The missionaries, for long periods at a time, have frequently no other sort of food to live upon, and they consider themselves fortunate if, when upon their journeys, the supply of it does not run short. For ten weary days the bishop kept his place, walking on the frozen Mackenzie at the head of his team of dogs. The hardships of this long march upon the ice was beginning to tell very severely upon the devoted prelate, and his strength was gradually being exhausted. On the evening of the tenth day's march, the party were approaching a very rugged and uneven portion of the frozen river. It was at\nthat point where the Bear River, coming down from the Great Bear Lake, joins the Mackenzie on its way northwards to the Arctic Ocean. At this point where the two great rivers meet, the struggle between frost and flood was fiercest and most protracted. Proofs of the severity of the contest lay scattered around in great abundance. The surface of the frozen river did not present there one smooth patch. It was broken up into all varieties of rugged shapes and forms. It was no longer possible for the poor dogs to draw their sledge; bravely they struggled, but their attempts were in vain. They howled piteously as sharp splinters of rough ice pierced their feet, wounding them severely. The sledge and the snow-shoes of the travellers were broken. The baggage and provisions lay scattered amidst piles of ice, and could scarcely be discerned in the gloom of advancing night. They cannot be abandoned, as without them the whole party would surely perish of hunger and cold. The Indians load their shoulders with the baggage and provisions, which they have succeeded in collecting together from the ice cavities into which they had fallen. In the meantime, the bishop has been wandering alone, in the darkness of the night, over the surface of the frozen river, which at that part was more than two miles in width, amidst huge hummocks, some of which he has to scale on hands and knees. He re-\nmains stationary for a while through exhaustion, but finding a deadly chilliness seizing upon him, he is compelled to keep himself in motion, in order to save his life. He advances in the gloom of the dismal night, which has now fallen upon the dreary scene. The ice under his feet begins to tremble strangely\u2014some convulsion is taking place, a roar and a rush of waters are heard! The ice has given way! The mighty flood has broken through it! To his horror he beholds a yawning gulf at his feet, out of which an angry torrent is madly rushing. The escaped waters quickly rise to a considerable height all around him on the frozen bed of the Mackenzie. He succeeds in gaining the summit of an iceberg. From iceberg to iceberg, with almost superhuman effort, he contrives to leap in his flight from the advancing flood. At last he succeeds in reaching the river's bank at a point where it was fortunately accessible, and thus, through God's protection, his life is saved.\n\nThe ruins of Old Fort Norman stood nigh to the spot upon which the bishop and his party landed. This was fortunate, for they were spared much of the labour of preparing their encampment by being able to take refuge for the night within the roofless log-walls of the old Fort. Remembering that it was the feast of the Holy Name of Jesus, the bishop, before lying down to his needed rest, recited by the\nlight of the camp fire the office of that beautiful festival. He had invoked that day the Sacred Name of Jesus in the hour of danger, and now he recites a devout *Te Deum* for the deliverance obtained by him through the efficacy of that name. Two days' journey separated him from the mission of St. Teresa, Fort Norman. The last day of this journey was particularly trying. He started on his way in the middle of the night, in order to make sure of his arrival at his destination that same day. It was the coldest day he had yet experienced. He suffered much from fluxion of the eyes. The outflow from his eyes became icicles upon his face, which caused him great torment. He arrived at Fort Norman on the 21st of January, and remained there till the 8th of the following March. During his stay at Fort Norman his time was occupied in giving instruction to the Indians of that locality, also in acting as school-master to their children, whom he taught to read and write. At Fort Norman he was joined by his little sacristan, Beaulieu's grandson, from whom he had been for some months separated. On the 8th of March he set out for Fort Simpson. He suffered very much during this journey. His feet were covered with blisters, which were caused by the fine snow penetrating his shoes, and then thawing, to his great discomfort. He was also threatened with the snow blindness, which he\nran the danger of incurring, owing to the intense reflection of the sun upon the snow-clad wilderness he had to traverse. That winter he walked over twelve hundred miles. From Fort Simpson he paid a return visit to St. Joseph's, on the great Slave Lake, and was cordially received by Father Eynard. They were not permitted long to enjoy one another's society. A letter came from an encampment of Indians at the extremity of the lake, who were attacked with some fatal epidemic, which necessitated Father Eynard's departure without delay. The following is a verbatim translation of the Indian's letter sent to Father Eynard. He had probably been taught by the Fathers to read and write:\n\n\"My Father, I wish to have a brave heart, but I find it very hard. My child is dead, my little boy whom you baptized. Everybody here is sick. It is very sad. Oh, Father, write to me. If we can see the priest our grief will be less. I have been a long time sick, and I am like one who has lost his reason. Send me some medicine. My children, my wife, my father, everybody here are all poor pitiable creatures. Speak to God for my child who is dead. On this earth it is God alone, and his priest, that can make the heart strong. I think of this, and I am glad. Send me your words, my Father, for in this world it is through your help alone I can live happy. Is it not sad that everybody here should be sick? I fear all will end badly, and there are many who are not yet baptized, who are going to die. If the chieftain sends a sledge for you, will you not come to us, my Father? Baptist, his word. This is for the priest.\"\nSuch an appeal could not be resisted. Father Eynard set out on a journey which was to last ten or twelve days, to visit the tribe in whose behalf Baptist had written to him. During his absence the bishop undertook his duties at St. Joseph's. On his return his face was much disfigured from frost bites. He suffered severely through the intense cold during his double journey, though the month of April was then drawing to its close. The following month of May was spent by the bishop at Fort Rae, where he had the happiness of baptizing 134 persons. A large number of others earnestly begged to be baptized, but he deferred complying with their wishes until he had further opportunity of testing their dispositions, and of instructing them better. The Mission of Providence, which the bishop had inaugurated in the manner we have already described, began to bear very abundant and consoling fruits. In 1863 we find his lordship residing there, his companions being his little sacristan, and two Indian boys whom he had picked up during one of his journeys, and whom he was then seeking to civilize and educate. Servants he had none. No price he could pay would induce any ordinary servant to follow him in his missionary journeys, and to partake of his privations. It would be idle to think of employing, as domestics, any of the Indians of the neighbouring tribes. They would be at home\nin an encampment, but in an ordinary residence they could render little service. Besides, their habits being so uncleanly, the bishop renounced all thought of engaging any of them for the domestic work of his little establishment at the mission of Providence. But this work had to be done\u2014washing, mending, shoe repairing, tailoring, were necessities even of that humble m\u00e9nage, and must be done by somebody. Who is to be that somebody? If any of our readers would be tempted to think that Monseigneur Grandin was lowering the episcopal dignity by undertaking himself those menial occupations, let him reflect on the example of St. Paul, who worked with his own hands, when necessity compelled him to do so. Monseigneur Grandin hesitated not, under necessity, to perform the humblest household work, not only for himself, but also for the poor children of whom he had taken charge.\n\nThe festival of Pentecost was approaching; that time had been fixed upon for opening a mission to certain tribes of the Mackenzie districts, for whom a rendezvous had been fixed for that date at Providence, on the banks of the Mackenzie. We will allow Monseigneur Grandin to give an account, in his own words, of the early trials and final success of the mission just spoken of:\n\n\"On the 23rd of May some families arrived. I opened a mission the following morning, the Feast of Pentecost. The\ngood work, alas! made at first but slow progress. The other Indians whom I expected had not arrived. It is true that, owing to the icebergs, the river was not navigable; nevertheless, it appeared to me that with a certain amount of good-will on their part, they could have managed to come. I waited till the end of May, and finding those whom I had been expecting were not coming, I resolved to go forth myself in search of the wandering sheep of my fold. I was grieved at being driven to this expedient, which after all might not succeed. After travelling several leagues I met a large body of Indians; they were on their way to the mission. They informed me that a still more numerous body were encamped at a short distance, within the arms of a neighbouring bay. They excused themselves for their delay in arriving at the place of the mission at the time that had been agreed upon, on the grounds of their being afraid of not being able to catch fish enough for their support in the neighbourhood of the mission. They promised me to lose no time in hastening forward to the place of appointed rendezvous. I then went forward to visit the more numerous gathering that were encamped by the river. In going along I addressed earnest prayers to God, begging of Him, through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin, to place upon my lips the very words most calculated to awaken those poor savages from their apathy. When I arrived at their encampment they received me with great demonstrations of joy, and offered a variety of excuses for their delay in going to the mission. I assembled them together, and commenced to sing with them one of our most stirring and devotional hymns. I then delivered a discourse to them, of which the following is a summary:\u2014'You say that you love me, why then did you delay in coming to meet me. I also love you, and because of my love for you I have come hither to dwell in your country. Ten years since I left my aged father, whose hair was as white as snow. I left him, although my leaving him nearly broke his heart, and it was also a sore grief to myself, for I\nfelt deeply the pang of separation from him and from my sorrowing friends, whom I greatly loved. But they were all consoled and gladdened at the good news which afterwards I gave them, of my labours among the tribes of Athabaska and of Ile \u00e0 la Crosse, who, I told them, listened to my words, and were leading a life that would conduct them to Heaven. Whilst with them I heard of your miserable condition, and I said I would leave them in order to come hither, to teach you how to save your souls and to go to Heaven. I came here also because you asked me yourselves to come; I have passed through great straits and sufferings on your account, as my poor hands, that are covered with chilblains and gashes caused by the terrible cold, will show you. The white men will soon come here to seek your furs; I shall then have an opportunity of sending a letter to my aged father about you. But what consolation can I give him in speaking of your conduct? You say you are ignorant, but why do you not come to me for instruction, when I am here only for the purpose of instructing you? You say I can do but little for you, because I am unable to make you presents of tobacco. But of what use will your tobacco be to you if, after smoking it, you lose your souls and go down to burn with wicked spirits, because you did not learn to know and love God? If you lose your souls, the blame will rest upon yourselves; I have done my duty towards you.' An aged Indian then came forward as the spokesman of the tribe, to make reply to my address. 'It is true, my Father,' he said, 'we have spoken words which were not good. But what can you expect of us poor ignorant men? We seldom see a priest, and we are badly instructed. But our hearts are not as bad as our words; we are accustomed to get tobacco from white men whenever we meet them. We were vexed and disappointed, and spoke evil of you, because you gave us none. But we will accompany you now, and listen to your words, and be obedient to you.' They kept their promise. From that day the mission became a great success.\"\nEarly in December, 1863, Monseigneur Grandin, accompanied by his little sacristan, young Beaulieu, set out upon a journey across the frozen surface of the Great Slave Lake. This lake might be called an inland sea, so vast are its dimensions. Its extreme length is 350 miles, with a proportionate width. They had for companions two young officers of the Hudson Bay Company, who had engaged the services of an Indian guide. Bishop Grandin was suffering from a wound he had received in the right foot from a splinter of sharp ice. He endeavoured to keep pace during the greater part of the day with his more active fellow-travellers, but as he was continually renewing the wound by striking his foot afresh against rough ice fragments, it became more difficult for him to walk. The young officers and their guide got far ahead of the bishop and his companion. His lordship and young Beaulieu followed carefully in the track left in the snow by the party in advance, and thus for the time escaped the danger of losing themselves in the wilderness of ice, through which they were journeying, without a guide or a land mark to direct them. As the bishop and the little boy were walking slowly at the head of their team of dogs, the sky became suddenly overcast, and a snow hurricane burst in all its fury at once upon them. Every particle of snow was lifted, by the violence of the storm, from the frozen bed of\nthe lake. The track which they had been pursuing was thus completely effaced; the snow-flakes which were falling heavily, mixing with the clouds of snow which were being raised by the fury of the tempest from the lake, completely darkened the air, and prevented them from seeing any object around them. To add to the horror of the scene, night set in. The cold of that night was intense enough to freeze mercury; it was $70^\\circ$ below freezing point. For a considerable while the bishop and his youthful companion wandered about, seeking in vain for an issue from the labyrinth of ice in which they were lost. They sought to peer into space in search of some object that would guide them to a place of safety, but to no purpose. If sometimes, amidst the fitful gusts of the tempest, the veil of darkness was lifted momentarily from the scene before them, they could perceive nothing but boundless plains of ice everywhere, from horizon to horizon. They listened for sound of human voice, and only heard the shrieks of the storm. They called aloud for help, but their cries remained unanswered. Further advance was useless, as they were only getting more completely bewildered as to the direction they ought to follow. By remaining stationary without fire or shelter on the frozen lake, they would be exposing themselves to the certain danger of being frozen to death. Therefore did they\nkeep themselves in motion, until sheer exhaustion, cold and hunger combined, forced them to stand still. The bishop felt then persuaded that his last hour, and that of his little companion, was at hand. He knelt down and prepared himself for death. He offered his life to God for the conversion of those poor pagans, whose salvation he was then seeking to promote. He heard the confession of the poor boy who had been his faithful associate in many of his most trying hardships, and gently but earnestly exhorted him to prepare to offer his young life to God. Having gone through this first duty, that of preparing for death, they lay down together upon the ice, leaning their heads upon their sledge, and resigned themselves into the hands of God. The poor dogs howled mournfully from cold and hunger. His lordship and the little boy remained stretched for some time upon the ice. The chilliness of death was gaining rapidly upon them. The bishop felt inspired to make one further struggle for life. He arose, with his companion, and commenced walking as rapidly as their exhausted state would permit, to restore circulation. A drowsiness seized upon the poor boy, which he found it impossible to shake off, even with the bishop's aid. The latter knew that if the poor youth was allowed to fall asleep upon the bare ice, that he would never awaken. Had not the storm swept the snow from the lake,\nthey could have made a bed for themselves in some snow-drift, and thus found some sort of rest and shelter. A kindly Providence at last came to their help, a snow-drift was unexpectedly discovered. The bishop quickly made a cavity in it large enough to receive himself and companion, and there they lay till morning. They suffered much in their snow bed during the hours they lay there, but their lives were saved. The next morning the bishop thought he could see land in the far distance, and he was not deceived. To the land they advanced slowly and painfully. Amidst the terrors and dangers of the preceding night, the bishop forgot all about his wounded foot, but now he is forced to advert to it by the increased torture it causes him. They gain the shore at last. With great difficulty they succeed in kindling a fire; hungry and exhausted they sat down by it. They had nothing to eat. Wistfully the poor dogs were looking up into their faces, as if craving for food, but they had nothing to give them. Fortunately they discovered amongst their effects a little package of tea. Their camp kettle was quickly filled with snow, and its simmering sound over the burning logs was the most acceptable music to their ears. \"The cup that cheers but does not inebriate\" never did better service than it rendered on that bleak December morning, by the frozen shores of the Great Slave Lake, to two lost wanderers, a holy\nbishop and his acolyte. Its warmth drove the death chill from their breasts, and its gentle stimulus helped them to endure more easily the pangs of hunger, from which they were suffering.\n\nLeaving them to partake of their spare comforts, let us betake ourselves to St. Joseph's mission, where the arrival of the bishop was expected on the previous day. We will allow Father Petitot to describe the alarm created by the news given by the bishop's fellow-travellers, of his being left behind by them on the lake.\n\n\"An Indian came from the Fort that evening to tell us that the two young officers, who had been expected, had arrived, and that the bishop and his companion not being able to keep pace with them, remained behind them on the lake. This news came upon us like a thunder-clap. I was appalled at the thought of his lordship being out upon the lake during such a night, whilst so frightful a storm was raging, and the cold so intense as to be capable of freezing mercury. I knew that the least deviation in the track left in the snow by the party in advance of him, might lead to his straying towards the middle of the lake, and thus to his certain death. I had that same evening just returned from a long and painful journey, and was much fatigued. But forgetting all my hardships, I set forth with two companions in search of the lost travellers. We kindled torches, fired shots, and went up and down in all directions, calling out their names at the highest pitch of our voices. But it was all to no purpose. After hours of useless search, we returned to our hut, wearied and disheartened. We looked now upon his lordship's escape as an impossibility, unless God worked a miracle in his behalf; for according to the opinion of the...\"\nmost experienced Indians, nobody could camp on a frozen lake, whilst a cold so intense as that mentioned prevailed, without forfeiting his life.\"\n\nThe next morning Father Petitot sent out another searching party to make a further attempt to find the bishop and rescue him and his companion, if they were still alive. Fortunately they passed near to the spot where his lordship and young Beaulieu had taken shelter. The meeting was a joyful surprise on both sides. Among the searching party were the father and uncle of young Beaulieu, a circumstance which must have enhanced, for the poor boy, his happy sense of release from the perils of the previous night. On the arrival of Monseigneur Grandin at St. Joseph's mission, Father Petitot was then saying Mass for his lordship, supposing him to be dead. But when the good priest saw the devoted prelate approaching the foot of the altar, to offer his prayer of adoration and thanksgiving, he was so overcome by his joyful emotion, that he wept abundantly, and with difficulty was able to proceed to the conclusion of the holy sacrifice.\n\nOn the 26th of December the bishop started from St. Joseph's on his way to the mission of Providence. His companions were his little sacristan, this youth's father, and another Indian. One of the Indians put himself forward as an experienced guide, and was accepted as such by the bishop, to his sub-\nsequent regret. They journeyed for four days. At the end of the fourth day they found that they had lost their way on the frozen lake. The whole of the fifth day was spent in wandering over the lake in search of the right route. In the evening they were as much at loss as ever concerning the direction they ought to follow. Their position became then very embarrassing. The whole party felt quite sad, and they began to enquire of one another how all that was to end. They had no more provisions for their dogs, and they had very little left for themselves.\n\nThe morning of New Year's day 1864, rose brightly. In the distance they saw a number of islets, some of which they thought they recognized. They were cheered by the prospect of a speedy delivery, and advanced joyfully towards the group of fair islets, whose snow-clad shores sparkled with dazzling brightness in the morning light. Alas! it was a mirage; presently it melted away, and left them in view of a melancholy expanse of frozen waters, studded with countless icebergs. One of the Indians examined the stock of provisions, and found they had only what was sufficient for two meals. He divided it into three portions, one portion for their supper that night, another for the breakfast of the little party the next morning, the third portion for their supper the following night. Young Beaulieu, remembering all he had suffered\na few weeks previously, during the night he had spent on the lake, tried to persuade his father, who, as we have said, was one of the party, to return with him to St. Joseph's. The bishop had made appointments with several Indian tribes, which he could not keep, unless his original plan of travel was followed. To alter it by going back to St. Joseph's would defeat many of his cherished missionary projects, and would prevent his meeting for a whole year some of the tribes that he had intended, during that missionary expedition, to evangelize. Yet the whole of his little party, having lost courage to proceed further, were determined to return to St. Joseph's. The return journey would occupy five days, and they had only enough of food for one meal left. Their dogs were also on the point of dying of hunger. In this dilemma it was resolved to kill one of the dogs, and to serve out his flesh to the other poor famishing brutes of the team, and also to reserve a portion of it for themselves; for death by hunger stared the whole party in the face. In this dilemma, the bishop felt that his only resource lay in God's providential succour. Withdrawing from his companions, he retired to a distance on the frozen lake. There he knelt in earnest prayer. He renewed there his religious vows as an Oblate of Mary, and prayed with confidence that God would enable himself and his companions to reach, that very\nevening, the point of their destination, the Fort of the Big Island. He felt an interior conviction that God had heard his prayer. He returned to his companions, who had commenced their journey back to St. Joseph's. He urged them to put more trust in God. He reminded them that it was the season when the church was about to celebrate the coming of the Holy Kings to Bethlehem, and that they might hope that He, whose star guided the wise men, would become Himself their guide. Whilst speaking thus to them, all of a sudden they came across human foot-prints, freshly marked upon the snow. They are saved. Quickly they changed their route, to follow the track so providentially discovered by them. That evening they reached the Fort of the Big Island. Our readers will be pleased, we are sure, to know, that the poor brute that was marked out for slaughter received his reprieve, and was allowed to continue his useful work in the team. The bishop was happily enabled to complete, in its entirety, the whole of the missionary programme he had fixed upon, before starting on that difficult expedition.\n\nThe next day, the bishop went to visit the chief of the tribe, who had been very attentive to the instructions given him by the missionaries. The chief expressed his gratitude for the kindness shown to his people, and promised to do all in his power to assist the bishop in his missionary labours. The bishop then proceeded to distribute the gifts among the people, and to give them instructions in the Catholic faith. He also visited the sick and the poor, and gave them comfort and encouragement. The bishop's visit was a great success, and the people showed their gratitude by presenting him with various gifts, including a valuable piece of cloth. The bishop accepted these gifts with thanks, and promised to use them for the benefit of the mission. He then returned to his fort, where he continued his missionary work, and prepared for another journey to the north.\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nThe Mission of Providence continued to grow and develop rapidly and solidly. Dr. Grandin decided on establishing there a community of Sisters of Charity. A convent had to be built. Father Grouard and the excellent Brother Alexis took upon themselves the chief labour of the construction. It was a two-storied house, the first of the sort that had ever, till then, been raised in any part of those vast and desolate regions. It excited the surprise of the Indians, and served as another landmark of civilization in their midst. While the bishop was still at Providence he received the sad news of the death of Father Grollier. This news reached him on the eve of his commencing his journey southwards, towards the well-established mission of St. Albert, where he is to fix his abode. Alluding to this occasion Monseigneur Grandin writes:\n\n\"I spent the night in weeping and praying, and in arranging my plans for the future. At four in the morning I commenced my journey. I felt a double sadness weighing upon me as I took my departure. I mourned over the...\"\npainful news of Father Grollier's death, and was grieved at bidding good bye to the members of the devoted community I was quitting.\"\n\nOn the arrival of Bishop Grandin at St. Albert's, he received the following letter from a Protestant gentleman:\n\n\"It was with the greatest pleasure I received your lordship's letter, on your return from your long sojourn in the north. There I witnessed with my own eyes, how gloriously you imitated the example of your illustrious prototype, St. Paul, labouring with your own hands; and, in season and out of season, preaching to pagans the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The noble self-abnegation, the calm and the admirable energy with which you bore up against difficulties, conquered obstacles, and endured sufferings of an exceptional nature, are beyond all praise. For my own part, although I have spent fifteen years in those savage regions, and have seen and experienced in my own person many of the vicissitudes of a life in the extreme north, nevertheless, I would not dare to face sufferings and privations so protracted, so multiplied, so continual as those which your lordship had to endure on the borders of the Mackenzie river. Your friends in the distance would indeed be surprised, could they have seen you, as I have done, in your 'palace,' constructed with some rough trunks of trees, piled upon one another to the height of six or seven feet, and lighted through small apertures covered with pieces of coarse parchment, which were its only windows\u2014its floor being the frozen ground\u2014its door consisting of planks hastily put together, through which the wind and the snow easily penetrated; whilst your lordship's daily food was of a kind which the menial servant in France would reject with disdain. Could your friends in Europe further be acquainted, as I am, with the hardships you had frequently to endure, in traversing immense regions in a\nstate bordering upon continual hunger, with no other companions but poor savages, who had not an idea or sentiment drawn from civilized life, they could not help shedding tears of tender compassion over a life of such suffering and privation. Your unwearied patience, and your dauntless courage, have excited the admiration of all the officers of the district. I have heard with sincere regret of the premature death of Father Grollier. I have ever found in him an agreeable companion, full of zeal for the discharge of his duties. Such have been all your missionaries with whom I have had relations. The esteem and affection which I entertain for some of these gentlemen, will remain among the happiest remembrances of my residence in this country.\"\n\nMonseigneur Grandin declared to the writer of these pages, that for a whole year at a time he had not the opportunity of tasting either bread, or meat, or vegetables of any kind. Fish, and that often of bad quality, quite decayed and rotten, was the only food which he and the poor savages he was evangelizing at the time, had to live upon.\n\nAn important change, in the meanwhile, had been accomplished in the diocese of St. Boniface. It was divided into three dioceses\u2014the northern division, consisting of the Athabasca, and the MacKenzie regions was placed under Bishop Faraud. Saskatchewan was assigned to Monseigneur Grandin. The Red River settlement remained under the pastoral rule of Monseigneur Tach\u00e9.\n\nAt St. Albert's, the place of residence of Monseigneur Grandin, we find the seeds of christianity and\ncivilization growing apace, under the judicious and fostering care of his lordship and the missionary Fathers under his jurisdiction. In a work entitled *Ocean to Ocean*, written by a Protestant clergyman, the Rev. G. Grant, of Halifax, who was Secretary to the Expedition of the Engineer-in-Chief of the Canadian and Pacific Railway, the following passage appears:\n\n\"Crossing the Sturgeon river, a hill rose before us crowned with the Cathedral Church of the Mission, the house of the Bishop, and the house of the Sisters of Charity; while up and down the river extended the little houses and farms of settlers. We called on Bishop Grandin, and found him at home, with six or seven of his clergy, who fortunately happened to be in from various missions. The bishop and his staff received us with hearty welcome, showed us round the church and schools, and introduced us to the sisters. The church represents an extraordinary amount of labour and ingenuity, when it is considered that there is not a saw-mill in the country, and that every plank had to be made with a hand-saw. The altar is a beautiful piece of wood-work in the early Norman style, executed as a labour of love by two of the Fathers. The sacristy behind was the original log church, and is still used for service in the winter. The St. Albert Mission was formed about nine years ago. It numbered nearly a thousand. Then came the small-pox that raged in every Indian camp, and wherever men were assembled, all up and down the Saskatchewan. Three hundred died at St. Albert's; men and women fled from their nearest and dearest. The priests and sisters toiled with that devotedness, that is a matter of course with them; nursed the sick, shrived the dying, and gathered many of the orphans into their house. The scourge passed away,\"\nbut the infant settlement had received a severe blow from which it is only beginning to recover. Many are the discouragements, material and moral, of the Fathers, in their labours, as they frankly confessed. Their congregation is migratory, spends half the year at home, and the other half on the plains. Their children are only sent to school when there is no buffalo to hunt, no pemmican to make, or no work of greater importance than education to set them to. The Sisters took us to their orphanage; they have twenty-four children in it, chiefly girls, two-thirds of the number half-breeds, the rest Blackfeet or Crees, who have been picked up in tents beside their dead parents, abandoned by the tribe when smitten by small-pox. The gentle christian courtesy, and lady-like manners of the Sisters at the mission, charmed us, while the knowledge of the devoted lives they lead, must impress with profound respect Protestant and Roman Catholic alike. Each one would have adorned a home of her own, but she had given up all for the sake of her Lord and His little ones. After being entertained by the bishop to an excellent supper, and hearing the orphans sing, we were obliged to hurry away in order to camp before dark.\"\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nHENRY GROLLIER, of whom mention has just been made, was the first Oblate of Mary Immaculate to make the sacrifice of his life to God in the diocese of St. Boniface. From the earliest stages of his ecclesiastical life, he manifested an ardent thirst to gain souls to God. During his novitiate, which he made at Notre Dame de l'Osier, in Dauphiny, he was often heard to exclaim: \"Da mihi animas\"\u2014\"Give me souls.\" He entered the Society of the Oblates of Mary, with the hope of being one day chosen for their Indian missions in North America. He completed his theological studies in the Seminary of Marseilles, where for three years he had the happiness of being near to the holy Founder of the Oblates of Mary, and of imbibing his spirit. He was ordained priest by Monseigneur de Mazenod, who selected him to be the companion of Monseigneur Tach\u00e9, on his return to St. Boniface, after his consecration. On Father Grollier's arrival at the Red River, he was appointed missionary in the distant region of Athabaska. Here his prodigious zeal soon\nbegan to manifest itself. His holy ambition was to evangelize tribes, to whom the tidings of salvation had not yet been communicated. He pushed his missionary expeditions far into the arctic circle. There he met tribes of Esquimaux and Blackfeet, and other tribes also, to whom he was the first to speak of God and of His Divine Son. He quickly mastered their languages, and brought his missionary influence to bear on their benighted souls. A blessing, like to that which fell on the preaching of the apostles on the day of Pentecost, seemed to accompany his labours. A few weeks spent by him in the midst of a pagan tribe, sufficed to prepare it for the blessing of Christianity.\n\nOne of the most difficult passions to master in savage breasts, is the spirit of revenge. Terrible are the outbreaks of that passion, especially when hostile tribes encounter one another in the solitude of the desert. Woe then to the weaker side. That solitary missionary, with his uplifted cross, had the marvellous power of holding back, again and again, armed warriors rushing to their revenge, and of causing rival and hostile tribes to cast down their weapons of war, and to embrace one another as brothers. In a letter to a brother missionary, dated from the banks of the Mackenzie, he writes thus:\n\n\"Last autumn I met, for the first time, at the Peel River, the tribes of the Loucheux and the Esquimaux. They had\nalready been at war with one another, and the thirst of vengeance was still fierce in their breasts. On the morning of the 14th of September, the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, I planted a cross in a prominent place, and invited the Indians of both camps to assemble around it. I then requested the chieftain of each tribe to come forward, and join their hands at the foot of the cross, in sign of their mutual reconciliation. My hands pressed theirs together upon the feet of the crucifix, and I made them promise to love one another for the future. Thus the cross became the bond of fraternal union between me, who was born on the shores of the Mediterranean, and these poor inhabitants of the desolate coasts of the Polar sea. I presented the chieftain of the Esquimaux with an image of Our Lord on the Cross, with these words written at the foot of it: 'All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.' And to the chieftain of the Loucheux I gave a picture of the Blessed Virgin, on which I wrote: 'Behold, from henceforth, all generations shall call me Blessed.' That day I had the happiness of baptizing my first neophyte from the great nation of the Esquimaux.\n\n\"I returned to Fort Good Hope before the Mackenzie became frozen. My little canoe was constructed of whale skin. During this voyage I had an opportunity of experiencing with what loving care Divine Providence watches over the lives of missionaries. Three days before we arrived at the Fort, we consumed our last morsel of food. The two Indians who conducted the canoe informed me that we had nothing more to eat. It was the eve of the Feast of the Holy Angels. In reciting Vespers, these words of the divine office struck me forcibly: 'He has given His Angels charge over thee.' I thought then within myself, that I was the servant of Him who once suffered hunger in the desert, and that I also should be succoured by the Holy Angels. My hope was not disappointed. The next morning we perceived traces of blood on the banks of the river. 'Behold!'\nI exclaimed, 'our breakfast.' It was so. Following those traces, we soon discovered two quarters of a rein-deer, which must have been killed on the previous day by some passing Indians, who, taking the portion they required, left the remainder to fall into our hands.\"\n\nFather Grollier established a mission at the northern extremity of the lake Athabaska, which he dedicated to Our Lady of the Seven Dolors. He founded a Mission at Fort Rae, which he dedicated to St. Michael, and also a mission for the Esclaves of the Great Island, which he dedicated to the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, and a mission at Fort Norman dedicated to St. Teresa.\n\nHe was the first who evangelized the tribe of the Peaux de Li\u00e8vre, a tribe which frequents Fort Good Hope. He dedicated that mission to Our Lady of Good Hope. Finally he advanced northwards as far as Peel's river, among the nations of the Loucheux and the Esquimaux; he dedicated that residence to the Holy Name of Mary. Here his physical power of advancing farther failed him. Whilst engaged in those wonderful missionary labours, the success and extent of which recall the days of St. Francis Xavier, he was suffering from chronic asthma, which was to carry him to an early grave.\n\nBeing a native of Montpellier, in the South of France, it was marvellous how he lived and worked as he did, amidst the terrible rigours of\ntwelve polar winters. When he felt his death-illness coming on, he was alone in the far northern wilderness, with his Indians whom he loved so dearly. Hundreds of miles separated him from his nearest brother-priest. On that occasion he thus wrote to Monseigneur Grandin:\n\n\"I feel that the hand of death is upon me; I hope however that I shall not die, without having an opportunity of making my confession; but if I cannot go to confession, I have a peaceful trust in the goodness of God, that He will show me mercy. I am now a useless being. I can no longer be counted among the active workmen in God's vineyard. Nevertheless, you must not be too anxious about me. I suffer, it is true, from asthma; but this malady, which is hereditary in my family, has not prevented many of my relatives living to a ripe old age. I think if I were at some post where I could get occasionally a little milk and a few potatoes, I should have a chance of recovering my health.\"\n\nIn a subsequent letter he renounced the thought of seeking for a milder climate, or a place where he could procure that nourishment, and those remedies and helps, which his prostrate condition demanded. He again writes to Monseigneur Grandin:\n\n\"I will not quit my present position, unless you positively command me to do so, for I desire nothing more ardently than to die at my post. I can still render some little services here; I know these poor savages, and they know me. It would grieve me very much to be obliged to forsake them.\"\n\nTo the great consolation of the dying young mis-\nsionary, his confr\u00e8re, Father Seguin, arrived in time, to cheer and to help him to sanctify his last days on earth. It had been arranged before his last illness commenced, that a large cross, forty feet in height, should be erected opposite the door of his hut. He wished the ceremony of blessing and erecting it to be performed by Father Seguin. He asked to be led to a window, from which he could witness the erection of the cross. When it was completed, he said to Father Seguin: \"My Father, now I die contented. I have seen the standard of my Saviour planted on the extremities of the earth. O yes! I am happy\u2014so happy! that I wept tears of joy during the whole ceremony.\"\n\nThe news of the approaching end of their apostle and their father caused grief and consternation in the camp of the Indians. They assembled in great crowds around the spot where he lay dying. Though he wished to be left quiet, he could not refuse to allow group after group to approach his bed-side, and receive his blessing and his last words of advice. At last Father Seguin had to give strict orders that no more visitors were to be admitted, to disturb him. Father Seguin having intimated to him that he purposed to have him buried on the spot where the projected new church was to be erected. \"No, no,\" he replied, \"bury me with the Indians, between the last two who died, with my face turned towards\nthe cross.\" During his agony, his eyes were often fixed on the image of St. Joseph dying in the arms of Jesus and Mary. The last time that Father Seguin approached his bed, Father Grollier said to him, with a smile: \"Now I see heaven, where I shall have the happiness soon to ascend.\" These were amongst his last words.\n\nThus died the first Oblate of Mary whose death took place in the far North West of America. He died in the greatest poverty, without doctor, without remedy of any sort; the luxury of a cup of milk, or of a few potatoes, could not be procured for him, during his long illness, in that desolate region. We may feel sure a bright crown awaited him in heaven, whose life was spent in such heroic and successful efforts to instruct others unto justice.\n\nShortly after Father Grollier's death, it was decided to create a new diocese in the regions of the Mackenzie. This happy necessity was due principally to the number of new missions which he had founded in that locality, some of which lay at a distance of a journey of six months from St. Boniface.\n\nFather Faraud, whose missionary labours would require a volume to enumerate, was, as we have already stated, named bishop of the new diocese.\n\nMajor Butler thus speaks in his work, *The Great*\nLone Land, of the Oblate Missionaries in Saskatchewan:\n\n\"A few miles north-west of Edmonton, a settlement composed exclusively of French half-breeds, is situated on the shores of a rather extensive lake which bears the name of Grand Lac. This settlement is presided over by a mission of French Roman Catholic clergymen of the order of Oblates, headed by a bishop of the same order and nationality. It is a curious contrast to find in this distant and strange land, men of culture and high mental excellence, devoting their lives to the task of civilizing the wild Indians of the forest and the prairie\u2014going far in advance of the settler, whose advent they have but too much cause to dread. I care not what may be the form of belief which the on-loeker may hold\u2014whether it be in unison or in antagonism with that faith preached by these men; but he is only a poor semblance of a man who can behold such a sight through the narrow glass of sectarian feeling, and see in it nothing but the self-interested labour of persons holding opinions foreign to his own. He who has travelled through the vast colonial empire of Britain\u2014that empire which covers one-third of the entire habitable surface of the globe, and probably half of the lone lands of the world\u2014must often have met with men dwelling in the midst of wild, savage peoples, whom they tended with a strange and mother-like devotion. If you asked who was this stranger who dwelt thus among wild men in these lone places, you were told he was the French missionary; and if you sought him in his lonely hut, you found ever the same surroundings, the same simple evidences of a faith which seemed more than human. I do not speak from hearsay or book-knowledge. I have myself witnessed the scenes I now try to recall. And it has ever been the same; East and West, far in advance of trader or merchant, of sailor or soldier, has gone this dark-haired, fragile man, whose earliest memories are thick with sunny scenes by bank...\"\nof Loire or vine-clad slope of Rhone or Garonne, and whose vision in this life, at least, is never destined to rest again upon these oft-remembered places. . . . To these French missionaries at Grand Lac I was the bearer of terrible tidings. I carried to them\u2014the story of Sedan, the overwhelming rush of armed Germany into the heart of France\u2014the closing of the high-schooled hordes of Teuton savagery around Paris; all that was hard home news to hear. Fate had leant heavily upon that little congregation; out of 900 souls more than 300 had perished of small-pox up to the date of my arrival, and others were still sick in the huts along the lake. Well might the bishop and his priests bow their heads in the midst of such manifold tribulations of death and disaster.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"During the days spent in the Mountain House, I enjoyed the society of the most enterprising and best informed missionary in the Indian countries\u2014M. Lacombe. This gentleman, a native of Lower Canada, has devoted himself for more than twenty years to the Blackfeet and Crees of the far West, sharing their sufferings, their hunts, their summer journeys, and their winter camps\u2014sharing even, unwillingly, their war forays and night assaults. The devotion which he has evinced towards these poor wild warriors has not been thrown away upon them, and P\u00e8re Lacombe is the only man who can pass and repass from Blackfoot camp to Cree camp with perfect impunity when these long-lasting enemies are at war.\"\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nTo St. Albert's one day came, to the surprise of the Fathers, a deputation from the war-like tribe of the Blackfeet, who up to that time had given but little hopes of their conversion to Christianity. The tribe had been smitten with the dread scourge of the Indian small-pox. The object of the deputation was to invite Father Lacombe, who, notwithstanding their being pagans, was well known to them, to accompany them to their camp. He had just then returned from a distant and very difficult mission among the Crees tribes. Although he was greatly fatigued, he set out at once on his visit to the plague-stricken tribe of the Blackfeet. Thus the foundation was laid of that marvellous influence he afterwards was to exercise over that warrior race. Before his return to St. Albert's, he had the happiness of baptizing four hundred persons of that tribe.\n\nThe following letter, written by him to the Superior-General, after a visit to the Crees tribe, will show how well he knew how to combine the\nfunctions of the spiritual with those of the temporal husbandman, and how to intermingle the sowing of the seed of the bread that perisheth, with that of the Heavenly bread that springeth up to life everlasting. He writes:\n\n\"At the end of May I went up the river Saskatchewan, until I reached the newly-founded mission of St. Paul. There, crowds of Indians were awaiting me. Their object was to make, under my direction, their first attempt in sowing barley and potatoes.\"\n\nThe good Father had, with great difficulty, conveyed to that spot, a plough and other farm implements, together with a supply of different sorts of seeds. He continues:\n\n\"In two hours after my arrival my plough was yoked, and all was in readiness to begin operations. I was the only white man present. Two Indians led the oxen, I handled the plough. You could not have helped smiling had you been there, in seeing at work the amateur ploughman, surrounded and followed by several hundred Indians, men, women and children, who stared with amazement as they beheld the ploughshare furrowing so easily and rapidly the surface of the ground. After a few days I succeeded in tilling a considerable surface. I then divided the tilled ground into little square patches, one of which I assigned to each family. I spent thus several weeks with my newly-trained agricultural labourers, many of whom were Christians, and several others were under instruction. At last we had to separate; the time for buffalo hunting, which is their only means of supporting themselves, and escaping starvation, had commenced. I was grieved to have to\nleave them, as they seemed so well disposed and so full of kind feeling for me. I promised to visit them again in the course of the summer.\"\n\nFather Lacombe having spent some months at St. Albert's, set out again to visit the Crees tribe. Finding that they had not returned to St. Paul's Mission, he went to seek them in the buffalo hunting grounds. They received him with great manifestations of joy. He then commenced a mission amongst them, the exercises of which he thus describes:\n\n\"In the morning, after my private devotions, I assembled the women in the middle of the camp. I taught them their prayers and several hymns, I afterwards gave them an instruction; they then returned to their occupations, and I proceeded to visit the sick; after which work of charity I visited those who were unwilling to come to the instructions, or in other words, who were unwilling to pray. I listened to the different objections they had to offer, and answered them. I afterwards had to act as Justice of the Peace, to arrange their differences and disputes with one another. About noon I rang my little bell to bring the children together. Their eagerness to come to my instructions consoled me very much. In a few moments I was surrounded by crowds of little Indians, who loved me as their father, and who joined with me in singing hymns with all the vigour of their lungs. After this exercise I withdrew into a neighbouring wood to enjoy a little quiet, and to have an opportunity of performing my private devotions. I then resumed my round of visits to those poor savages that I had failed to see in the morning. In the evening I brought the men together and preached to them; after which I entered into conversa-\ntion with them, and each one addressed whatever questions he pleased with reference to our holy religion, whilst leisurely smoking his 'calumet,' or long Indian pipe. On Sundays all assisted together at the Holy Mass, the Rosary, and other exercises of piety. It was thus that day after day was spent during the six weeks I remained there. In the meantime the crops ripened at St. Paul's, and the Indians, on their return from their hunting fields, were delighted with the success of their first agricultural enterprise, and encouraged to renew the experiment.\"\n\nFather Lacombe, in obedience to the wishes of Monseigneur Tach\u00e9, renewed his visit to the tribe of the Blackfeet. On the occasion of that visit, the life of this apostolic priest was exposed to imminent danger, from which the hand of God alone rescued him. We will allow him to tell his own story:\n\n\"In the camp of the Blackfeet I was lodged in the tent of the great chieftain of the tribe. His name was Natous, which signifies the Sun. The tribe was divided into three camps. The camp in which I was located was composed of forty-five lodges, in a second camp there were fifty, and in a third there were sixty lodges. I give you these details in order that you may be the better able to picture to yourself the frightful scene which I am now about to describe.\n\n\"On the day of my arrival, I earnestly urged the Blackfeet to unite the three camps into one, as a precaution against an attack, that might be made upon them, by some hostile tribe. My advice, however, was not followed. On the evening of the 4th of December, having finished the religious service for the men, night prayers having been said, and the usual hymns sung, each one withdrew to his own lodge for the night. I remained alone with the chieftain and his family in their lodge,\"\n\"I lay down on my humble couch to take the repose I needed. Alas! I had no idea that at that hour a host of enemies were lying in ambush all around us, concealed in the wood, who were only waiting for our fires to be extinguished to rush upon us in the darkness. They were about a thousand in all, and were composed of the Assiniboines, of the Sauteaux, and of the Crees, who had come from the borders of the Beaver River.\n\n\"We were all buried in profound sleep; suddenly Natous sprang from his bed, and in a lugubrious tone cried out\u2014'Assinan, Assinan\u2014the Crees, the Crees.' He had scarcely uttered these words, when a sudden discharge of musketry took place, and showers of balls pierced our lodges from every side. The lodge in which I was, being the chieftain's, was more conspicuous and exposed to the fire, than any other; but, I must say, that the attacking tribes were quite ignorant of the fact of my being in the camp of the Blackfeet at the time, for our Indians (even though pagans) would never dare to attack a camp, if they knew a priest to be in it.\n\n\"My beloved Father, I cannot tell you all I suffered that terrible night. I seized my cassock, and dressed quickly. I kissed my crucifix, and made an offering of my life to God. I then hung at my side the bag that contained the holy oils, in order to be prepared to give Extreme Unction to the dying. All the time, bullets were whizzing through the air. I advanced in front of the enemy's lines, hoping to be recognized; but my efforts to attract their attention were fruitless. The din and confusion that prevailed, prevented them noticing me. It would be hard to describe the horrors of that scene. The night was pitch dark; the lurid flashes of the musketry were the only lights visible. The war shouts of the contending tribes, and the rallying voices of their chieftains, mingled in frightful discord with the cries of despair of the wounded and the dying, with the wailing of women and the screams of terrified children, who knew\nnot whither to fly for safety. Added to these horrible noises were the loud neighing of the horses and the wild howlings of the dogs. To increase our misery, we had only a few men to defend us, as the greater number had gone to the hunting plains.\n\n\"If God had not, in an especial manner, protected us, not one of us would have escaped with his life. When I found that it was impossible to make known to the assailants the fact of my being present, and thereby stopping the carnage, I urged the chieftains of the Blackfeet courageously to defend their people, even though it might cost them their lives. For my own part, I hastened to attend to the wounded and the dying. As I passed near these poor fallen and bleeding Indians, they grasped at my cassock, or seized my hand in theirs, unwilling to lose their hold of me, crying out at the same time, 'Kimmo Kinnan, dgimo hekkat!' 'Have pity upon us! Pray for us!'\n\n\"The first victim whom I met was a young woman; she fell mortally wounded at my feet, at the moment she was leaving her lodge. I stooped down at once and asked her if she wished to die a Christian, to which she replied in the affirmative. By the flashes of the musketry I was, fortunately, able to see near me a vessel full of water, a portion of which I poured upon her head and baptized her. In a few moments after the enemy rushed into her lodge and mercilessly scalped her as she lay dying.\n\n\"Twenty-five lodges were in all destroyed. I lost everything with the exception of my breviary. In the meantime, the fighting men of the other camps of the Blackfeet hearing of the attack, came to our help. Thus reinforced, we repelled three attempts of the enemy to capture our camp. I awaited daybreak with impatience; I felt that dreadful night to be painfully long. The next morning I vested myself in surplice and stole, and holding in one hand a crucifix, and in the other a flag of truce, I advanced between the combatants. The Blackfeet ceased firing, but the Crees not\nseeing me, owing to a thick mist which hid me from them, continued still to discharge their weapons. Whilst I was vainly seeking to attract their notice, bullets were falling like hail around me. At last, a bullet, which most likely had rebounded from the ground, struck me, first on the shoulder and then on the forehead. I staggered under the shock, but did not fall. A cry was raised by the Blackfeet, 'You have wounded the Priest,' which, when the Crees heard, they immediately answered, 'We did not know the Priest was with you; as he is with you we will cease fighting.' Nearly one hundred fell that night killed and wounded.\n\n\"After the battle, the Blackfeet came in crowds to embrace and to thank me. They said there must be something more than human about me, as the bullets seemed to have no power of hurting me. Ah! perhaps God wished to make manifest to those poor pagans, His power and His goodness towards those who put their trust in Him, and to show them the fulfilment of those words of the Psalmist, 'His truth will compass thee with a shield. Thou shalt not be afraid of the terror of the night, or of the arrow that flieth in the day.'\n\n\"In the pillage of the camp I lost all I possessed, clothes, blankets, my horses\u2014everything. I had not wherewith to cover my head, or to protect myself from the intense cold of the season.\n\n\"The day following the battle, notwithstanding our being fatigued and worn out by the sufferings we had passed through, we were compelled to set out upon a journey of twenty miles to join another camp of the Blackfeet, with whom I remained for ten days. At the end of that time I prepared to return to the Fort of the Mountain. The task of reaching that point was not one of easy accomplishment. I was poorly clad, the cold was intense, and the snow was very deep. During the six days the journey lasted, I suffered in turn from hunger, cold, and fatigue. When I reached the Fort, Mr. Hardisty, the representative of the\nHudson Bay Company, and his family, came to meet me. This gentleman could not help shedding tears on witnessing my wretched and impoverished condition. He supplied me with clothes, and provided me with the best and most nutritious food he could procure. He treated me as kindly as if I were his own father. Under the cheering influence of a hospitality so kind and generous, I soon forgot the severe mental and bodily sufferings through which I had lately passed.\"\n\nA few months later on we find Father Lacombe rendering to a forlorn band of Indians, whom he met near the river Saskatchewan, services still more striking than those we have just spoken of, as having been rendered to himself. They belonged to the nation of the Blackfeet. They were the remnant of a tribe that had been overpowered by the superior numbers of a hostile band. They had been robbed of everything, and when he met them they had been without food for three days, and were almost naked. Some had been severely wounded, and their wounds were still undressed. Father Lacombe's compassionate heart was deeply moved at sight of all this misery, and he could not refrain from tears. He gave them all his provisions\u2014he washed and bound up their wounds\u2014he clad those that were most naked in his own warm clothing, reducing himself to a condition almost as wretched as that in which he found them. Moreover he lent them his two horses, and continued his journey on foot to St. Albert's.\nAfter such deeds of self-sacrificing charity in their behalf, we need not be surprised at the holy sway he exercised in their midst.\n\nOn a subsequent occasion, as he was journeying alone in the wilderness, he suddenly came upon a poor, aged, and dying Indian. He was a pagan. Father Lacombe's zeal, aided by Divine grace, succeeded in rescuing from infidelity the soul of this dying man. He remained with him till he died. Shortly before his death, he asked him: \"Do you love God?\" The dying Indian, fetching a deep sigh, exclaimed: \"Would that I had known Him sooner!\" What were those words but the echoes of those once spoken by St. Augustin: \"O Beauty, ever ancient and ever new, too late have I known Thee, too late have I loved Thee!\"\n\nThis latter circumstance was related to the writer of these pages, by Father Lacombe himself, whose acquaintance he had the happiness of making on the occasion of that devoted missionary's visit to Europe, after his residence of nearly a quarter of a century amidst the Red Indians of North America.\n\nOne of the chief difficulties experienced by the Oblate Missionaries among the Red Indian tribes, was the complete want of books of any sort to help in learning their languages. Father Lacombe directed his great literary capabilities to the remedying of this want. He composed a great dictionary and\ngrammar of the Crees language, which is spoken by several large tribes.\n\nFor twenty years he laboured at these works, having no materials to draw from but the sounds of the words as he heard them spoken in the Crees tribes.\n\nFather Lacombe, during his long missionary career amidst the tribes of British North America, had two leading objects ever before his mind; first, their spiritual regeneration, and secondly, their introduction into such habits of civilized life as they were capable of adopting. To each of these great objects he devoted himself with the zeal of an apostle. We have given some pages of his missionary life in the desert. These, we should say, were only fragments of a great circle of labours and privations, embracing a period exceeding a quarter of a century. We are glad to have the following independent testimony at hand, in support of our statements, relative to Father Lacombe's intelligent and energetic efforts in sowing the seeds of civilization among the Indian tribes which he evangelized.\n\nLord Milton and Dr. Cheadle, in their joint work *North West Passage by Land*, speak thus of Father Lacombe:\n\n\"We found a little colony of some twenty houses, built on the rising ground near a small lake and river. A substantial wooden bridge spanned the latter, the only structure...\"\nof the kind we had seen in the Hudson Bay territory. The priest's house was a pretty white building, with garden round it, and adjoining it the chapel, school, and nunnery. The worthy father, M. Lacombe, was standing in front of his dwelling as we came up, and we at once introduced ourselves.\n\n\"P\u00e8re Lacombe was an exceedingly intelligent man, and we found his society very agreeable. Although a French Canadian, he spoke English very fluently, and his knowledge of the Cree language was acknowledged by the half-breeds to be superior to their own. Gladly accepting his invitation to stay and dine, we followed him into his house, which contained only a single room, with a sleeping loft above. The furniture consisted of a small table and a couple of rough chairs, and the walls were adorned with coloured prints, amongst which were a portrait of his Holiness the Pope, and another of the Bishop of Red River. After a capital dinner we strolled round the settlement in company with our host. He showed us several very respectable farms, with rich corn-fields, large bands of horses, and herds of fat cattle. He had devoted himself to the work of improving the condition of his flock, had brought out, at great expense, ploughs and other farming implements for their use, and was at present completing a corn mill, to be worked by horse power. He had built a chapel, and established schools for the half-breed children. The substantial bridge we had crossed was the result of his exertions. Altogether this little settlement was the most flourishing community we had seen since leaving Red River. They have established stations at L'\u00cele \u00e0 la Crosse, St. Alban's, St. Ann's, and other places, far out in the wilds, undeterred by danger or hardship, and gathering half-breeds and Indians around them, have taught with considerable success the elements of civilization as well as of religion.\"\n\nThe Earl of Southesk, in his work, Saskatchewan\nand the Rocky Mountains, published in Edinburgh in 1875, speaks in the following terms of his visit to Father Lacombe, at St. Ann's, Manitou Lake:\n\nOn our arrival at St. Ann's, we proceeded to the mission, where we met with a most cordial reception. We had the pleasure of dining with P\u00e8res Lacombe and La Fraine, at the Roman Catholic mission house; agreeable men and perfect gentlemen. What an advantage Rome has in this respect. . . . She sends polished, highly educated men to supply her missions. On the pressing invitation of my kind host, I remained for the night at the mission house. Everything wonderfully neat and flourishing; the cows fat and fine\u2014the horses the same\u2014the dogs the same\u2014the very cats the same. A well arranged and well kept garden gay with many flowers, some of the commonest flowers of the woods brought to perfection by care and labour. The house beautifully clean, the meals served up as in a gentleman's dining room. Everything made use of and turned to account.\"\n\nA few years previously that spot was a howling wilderness, the Red man's hunting ground. Now it is the site of a model farm and of a model habitation. We use here the word model in its fullest and most practical sense. Father Lacombe intended that his house and farm should serve as a means of attraction to civilized life, for the tribes that traversed the surrounding woods and prairies. He wished that they should also serve as a model, to be copied by those Indians and half-breeds who, re-\nnouncing the nomad life, would choose to become settlers and cultivators of the soil. Unlike the desolate regions of the Mackenzie, Saskatchewan presents, in some districts, vast plains of extraordinary fertility which, by cultivation, might become one of the granaries of the world. Father Lacombe's hand was the first that guided a plough-share through the plains of Saskatchewan. Through his exertions was the first bridge constructed, and the first mill erected, in that vast district. But commerce and civilization are indebted to him for a work of greater magnitude than any yet named. He was the first to demonstrate the practicability of a roadway across the great desert lying between Saskatchewan and Fort Garry. He undertook to explore that then unknown region. He started with an escort of three or four Indians, from St. Ann's, Manitou Lake, and pursued his way for twelve hundred miles across countless rivers, and through swamps and forests, and boundless prairies, until he reached Fort Garry. His object in undertaking this journey was to find out a direct way for the forwarding of supplies to the missions of the distant north. The caravans of the Hudson Bay Company now follow in that route; but it should be remembered that it was the cart-wheels of the humble missionary that first left a track upon that great highway to the north.\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nThe example of Father Lacombe was to be followed, in many notable items, by his brother Oblate, the learned and devoted Father Petitot. To the labours of this Father we owe most important additions to the infant literature of British America, in the far north-west, as we shall see in its proper place.\n\nEarly in April, 1864, we find Father Petitot at Fort Rae, engaged in the work of evangelizing the tribe of the Dog-ribbed Indians. The Indians of this tribe had all, without exception, been admitted to the grace of Holy Baptism by the Oblate missionaries. Father Petitot derived great consolation from the faith and fervour exhibited by them during his stay among them. He hesitates not to compare their true Christian piety to that of the early Christians. He writes:\n\n\"I was deeply moved at the compunction they manifested in accusing themselves of very venial faults, and also by the simple, child-like fervour with which they addressed their prayers aloud to God. I never heard prayers more earnest...\"\nor touching, uttered by anybody. I had the happiness of preparing a young Indian for death shortly after my arrival. Before breathing his last, he made a sign to me with his hand to signify that God was calling him to heaven. In seeing this poor youth as he lay dying on the bare ground in a miserable tent, with the cold wind playing around him, I was filled with a sentiment of entire confidence in the Divine mercy in his regard. 'No,' I said, 'it is not possible that God will be a severe Judge for this poor savage. Those eyes that are now about to close, cannot open again without seeing heaven. He is now covered with rags, and plunged in deepest misery, but when from under the worn deer-skin roof of his miserable tent, he lifts his eyes to heaven, and calls God by the name of Father, will He come to him as an angry Judge? Will He treat him with that rigour that we civilized men deserve? Oh no, to that poor savage He will be all mercy.'\n\nOn the 6th of May, about the time when Father Petitot's mission to the Dog-ribbed Indians closed, he was visited at Fort Rae by a deputation from the tribe of the Trakwelotine, composed of the chief, Satle-Nakrasya, and eleven young Indians, none of whom, with the exception of the chief, were yet Christians. Their object was to induce Father Petitot to visit their tribe. Nakrasya addressed him in a long discourse, with the object of gaining his consent to the proposed visit to his tribe. Among other things, he said: \"Our old people are dying without baptism. None of the women or children of our tribe have been, as yet, washed in the water of God. Nobody has been married before church.\"\nFather Petitot did not require much further persuasion to induce him to comply with the request of the good chief, Nakrasya. It should be remarked, that some of the men of the Trakwelotine tribe had been instructed and baptized by missionaries, whom they met when selling their furs at certain posts of the company. It had come to Father Petitot's knowledge that some medicine-men, or sorcerers, knowing the desire of the Indians of that tribe to see a priest, pretended that they were priests, and drew many into their snares. Knowing this to be the case, Father Petitot felt that he ought not to lose any time in accepting the invitation which he had received.\n\nOn the 9th of May he commenced his journey, in company with the twelve Indians who had come to seek for him. On the fourth day after their departure provisions began to run short. That day Father Petitot received only a few ounces of dried meat. The next day his only food was a small piece of a candle. They pitched their tents that evening on the borders of the lake Kamitzse, which is situated about 64\u00b0 north latitude. They lay supperless that night on the cold ground beside the frozen lake. The next morning they resumed their journey without breaking their fast. \"Have patience,\" his guides said to him, \"before mid-day we shall have plenty of the flesh of the moose-deer to eat, for we\nshall meet before then with a large encampment of 'our tribe,' at the foot of yonder mountain.\" At the hour they named they reached the mountain to which they had pointed, but its base was silent and solitary, and no sign of living man could be found there. They, however, discovered signs that bespoke the presence nigh to them of the remains of a departed Indian. On a gentle slope of the mountain's base, which ran out into the lake, they saw a cross encircled by a palisade, within which was the grave of an Indian Christian. The fragments of a camp that had been hastily raised lay scattered around the spot. The Indians have a horror of remaining encamped nigh to any place where one of their tribe has been buried. The presence of the little cemetery accounted for the departure from their encampment of the tribe which Father Petitot and his Indian companions had been expecting to meet at the foot of the mountain spoken of.\n\nHungry, foot-sore, and exhausted, they sat on the shores of the lake, looking with prolonged and searching glance into the little bays that expanded on every side, to discover, if possible, some traces of the missing tribe. But their search was in vain. Their dogs were dying of hunger. For several days the poor brutes had nothing to live on but some morsels of burnt parchment. After a rest of a couple of hours they resumed their journey, without\nknowing what direction was best for them to take. They arrived at a long portage, through a thick wood, at the end of which they came in view of another lake, named Tarakatie. It was the twelfth important lake which Father Petitot discovered since he left Fort Rae. But no sign or sound of human life had become as yet visible or audible.\n\nAt last, as they were going to explore a distant bay in the last-named lake, the keen glance of the Indians discovered, in the snow, the footprints of a moose-deer. At a short distance in advance, human footprints also became visible. The Indians, at the same time, scented in the air the smoke of a near encampment. Immediately they commenced shouting with joy and firing shots in the air. Presently they were answered by a discharge of guns in the distance, and in a short time they found themselves in the midst of a crowd of Indians. Father Petitot was filled with liveliest sentiments of gratitude to God for this deliverance from the horrors of a death by hunger in the desert. He knelt and offered, on the spot, fervent prayers of thanksgiving, before entering into communication with the Indians whom he and his party had thus providentially met. The main body of the tribe were collected at a short distance, on a small island in the lake. On Father Petitot reaching the island, he was quickly surrounded by a wondering crowd, scarcely any of\nwhom had ever seen a white man till then. We shall allow him to describe, in his own words, the scene that followed the events we have been relating, and also to give us the narrative of his labours on that occasion:\n\n\"The whole population was collected on a little islet in the lake. Long files of Indians came down from the rocks. Little children were the first to gather around me. When I reached the little island I was literally besieged by the throng; everybody tried to shake hands with me. 'Marci, Marci,'\u2014welcome, welcome\u2014rang from every lip. I was deeply touched at such a reception. These poor savages had never seen a priest or a white man before. They examined me from head to foot, wondered at my beard and spectacles, but were chiefly attracted by my cross. I made a sign that I wished to speak to them, and immediately a corpulent old man, with long white hair, the great chieftain of the tribe, whose name was Sanaindi, ordered everybody to sit down. When they were seated, I said to them, 'Knowing that my children of the forest wished to see their Father, in order to receive from him the water of God, the blessed water of Baptism, and to become Christians, I hastened to come among them, not regarding the distance or the difficulties of my journey. But that having come, I expected to find on their part docility to my words, the complete cessation of all practices of Inkranse\u2014sorcery\u2014and fidelity to the commandments of God.' They answered by repeated cries of 'Tanan, Tanan,' to express their satisfaction with all I had said.\n\n\"Though many thought of gratifying their curiosity by scrutinizing my exterior person, nobody thought of satisfying the cravings of my hunger, which now had become insupportable. I was forced to speak of my extreme need of food to the old chieftain. He took the matter very coolly,\nand informed me that the whole tribe, even the children, were then two days without food themselves, but that they expected that the young men, who had gone to fish and hunt, would return the next day with plenty of provisions for everybody. This discouraging answer only whetted my appetite the more. I had tasted nothing since I had eaten a piece of candle two days previously.\n\n\"Having spoken with me for about two hours, they thought themselves of the necessity of preparing their encampment. I had met them on their march as they were coming to meet me. Presently they were all astir getting ready to go to the place of encampment. Each one went to his own sledge and yoked his dogs. The little children were placed in empty cauldrons or sacks, which were firmly tied to the sledges. The old men and women, and the children able to walk, as well as the able-bodied men, put on their great snow shoes, and the whole tribe set out in marching order. It was the first time I had witnessed a like spectacle, and it had a special charm for me. Far as the eye could reach along the frozen lake, stretched out a seemingly endless line of sledges and dogs. The women advanced, bearing heavy burdens on their shoulders, the men carried gaily their muskets and tambours, and at either side of this singular procession the children and the young men bounded along joyously, some guiding the sledges, others amusing themselves in using their bows and arrows, which they always carried with them. I had to do like the rest, and put on my snow shoes and yoke my sledge. Having reached the place of encampment, everybody set about raising his own hut. I sat wearied and forgotten in their midst. I was too much fatigued to construct my hut. At last a chief-tain perceived my embarrassment, and gave orders to two young men to raise a hut for me, which was constructed of sufficient size to serve also as a chapel. That same day I opened the exercises of the mission, and baptized two Indians who were on the point of death. That evening I broke my\nlong fast by eating a morsel of a beaver's tail and a few shreds of dry fish. The next day we had an abundance of food in the camp, owing to the passage of large herds of deer on their way to the sea shore.\n\n\"On the Feast of Pentecost I sang High Mass, which was preceded by a sermon in Montaignais. After the Mass I baptized sixty children in three different batches. At the end of the ceremony I suffered from complete extinction of voice, being exhausted by the fasting, and by the several discourses I had to deliver. The following days I baptized ninety-seven children, in all 157. This important duty accomplished, I gave myself up entirely to the instruction of adults. For this object I brought them together in groups of fifteen at a time, by ringing a little bell, and got them to repeat several times the answers of the little catechism, in their own language, together with the Lord's prayer and the Hail Mary. Such was their desire to become instructed in the truths of our holy religion, that day and night I used to hear them repeat over to themselves the instructions which I had given them. At the end of fifteen days the greater number of these poor Indians were as well instructed in the chief truths of the Christian religion as many Christians living in older missions. I judged them to be sufficiently instructed to receive holy Baptism, which they earnestly asked for, and of which they showed themselves worthy by their good conduct. I had to hear the confessions of this multitude, and to pass several days seated in my poor tent, into which the rain and snow entered, with my feet in wet mud and my limbs half frozen. But my sufferings seemed to cost me nothing, I felt so happy in labouring for the good of these poor people.\"\n\nFather Petitot thought it prudent not to celebrate the holy sacrifice of the Mass in presence of the whole camp, but solely in presence of those who\nwere already sufficiently instructed to be able to assist at it with proper reverence. This provoked the jealousy of those who were not permitted to be present at Mass. In the camp there were four sorcerers\u2014medicine-men\u2014who availed themselves of the irritation thus caused to raise a storm of opposition to Father Petitot amongst a certain portion of the tribe. They succeeded in assembling the majority of the tribe on a hill overhanging their camp. There they erected a Chosineh, or Sorcery Lodge, within which they were permitted to renew the practice of jugglery, which the tribes had promised to renounce on the arrival of Father Petitot.\n\nHe says:\n\n\"Being informed of these facts by one of my neophytes, I hurried to the spot where the sorcerers had assembled the multitude. There I found all the infidel sorcerers squatted on their heels, swaying their bodies wildly to and fro like idiots. On seeing me they appeared to be disconcerted, and half-afraid to continue their proceedings. Nevertheless they did not give up their wild ridiculous chant, until, striking my hands together, I commanded silence, and ordered them to disperse immediately. All the Indians prepared to obey me, when suddenly the most fanatical of the sorcerers sprang forward, with a countenance purple with rage, and darting upon me glances flaming with anger, cried out, as one possessed with an evil spirit, 'Who are you, to come here to trouble us? You do not see God, as you acknowledge yourself, but I speak to Him face to face. You render no service to us, for you refuse to baptize us. Go your way and leave us.' I answered, 'I take you at your word, I will go away to...\"\nmorrow, but I will leave you in the hands of God, whom no one insults unpunished.' I then withdrew from the assembly. The crowd, terrified by these few words, quickly dispersed, leaving the four sorcerers alone. I had not been long in my tent, when I was visited by great numbers, who came to express their regret at what had happened. The three chieftains of the tribe came to me, one after another, to urge me not to leave them, and to assure me that everybody disavowed the words spoken to me by the chief sorcerer Ekwi-takfwe.\"\n\nSpring-time had now set in. The warm rays of the sun began sensibly to affect the solidity of the ice upon the lakes. Further delay in their position would be full of danger to all the tribe. The camp was quickly broken up, and everybody, including Father Petitot, set out upon the march over the still frozen lake. Though a safe footing was afforded to the travellers over the chief portion of the vast frozen surfaces they had to traverse, yet there was an unusual rising and sinking of the ice on which they trod, which was unpleasantly suggestive of imminent danger, and caused them to hasten their pace towards their journey's end. Sledges could not be used in consequence of the dangerous state of the ice. Father Petitot had to carry all his effects upon his shoulders, over dangerous lakes and across rugged mountains. At last they reached the lake, by whose shores the tribe had, the previous year, at the approach of winter, stowed away their\ncanoes, which they now came in search of. It was there Father Petitot brought his mission to the tribe of the Trakwelotine to a close, by the erection of a large cross, twenty feet in height, which the Indians themselves had constructed. With difficulty the devoted missionary withdrew himself from the embraces of these poor Indians, who wept loudly at his departure, and begged of him not to fail to return to them the following year.\n\nAs Father Petitot's zeal oftentimes led him into the midst of tribes that were not only indifferent, but also hostile to Christianity, his life was frequently exposed to very grave dangers. On one occasion, when approaching a great rapid on the Mackenzie River, the crew of his bark, who were twenty-one in number, and all pagans of the Peaux de Li\u00e8vre tribe, formed a conspiracy to murder him. They resolved to throw him into the rapid. They were not aware that he understood their language, they consequently spoke freely to one another of their design. Their superstitious dispositions had been worked upon by certain sorcerers, who made them believe that all their maladies and other misfortunes arose from the presence of the priests. They resolved to kill, first Father Petitot, and afterwards Father Seguin and brother Kearney. Father Petitot writes:\n\n\"I was acquainted with their plot, when I saw them pro-\nparing to lay hands upon me. Before they had time to do so, I openly declared to them that I was fully aware of what they were about, and that they might, if they thought fit, take my life, as under such circumstances I was not afraid to die, and that I would willingly offer up the sacrifice of myself in their behalf. 'Act now,' I said, 'if you think proper, I will not defend myself.' This sudden display of energy on my part quite disconcerted them. They were profuse in their denials of any evil intentions, and in protestations of respect towards me. But they said to one another, 'It is now more than ever necessary that he should die, for he knows our secret. To save our lives from the white men we must kill him.' It is needless to say I did not close my eyes that night. Our bark was left to follow the current, with one steersman to guide it. Four were told off to watch for an opportunity of killing me. All were not equally cruel; some manifested pity for me, but they were too afraid of the others, to make much show of their goodwill. One, however, had the courage to say, 'Your project makes me sick, my head aches in thinking of it. I will have nothing to do with it.'\n\n\"I prayed during the whole night, and begged of God, through the intercession of our Blessed Lady, to prevent so great a crime being accomplished. I counted my Rosary beads all the while. At the same time I prepared myself, as well as I could, for death, and felt joyful\u2014oh yes, very joyful at the prospect of dying a martyr's death. Alas! I was not worthy of it. My would-be murderers put off the execution of their plan until they should find me asleep. Their courage to strike me failed them, as they saw I was awake. A gentle word or a smile on my part sufficed again and again, during the night, to hold them back, when they were about to lift their hands against me.\n\n\"The day rose, and then they resolved to cast me overboard into the next rapid. They had already arranged about the division of my clothes and effects. Their courage\nagain failed them, and I arrived unharmed at the sanctuary of our Lady of Good Hope, my Protectress.\"\n\nFather Petitot was, in September, 1872, at Good Hope. At the request of Monseigneur Clut, he translated the Catechism and the Prayer Manual into the Peaux de Li\u00e8vre language. A young Indian of that tribe, who was then a Catechumen, named Camillus, rendered him great assistance as a catechist. Other young Indians emulated the example of Camillus, and eagerly sought to become well instructed themselves, in order to be able to instruct others.\n\nAt the end of November, Father Petitot undertook a long journey to the north east of Fort Good Hope. His only companion was a little Indian boy named Tadigale, fourteen years of age. He walked 900 miles during that journey, in his great snow shoes. He visited on his way several camps of the Peaux de Li\u00e8vre Indians. He traversed, whilst on that missionary expedition, 160 frozen lakes, and crossed over thirteen great rivers. He approached the barren grounds that border the Polar Sea, and arrived close to the banks of the Anderson River, which falls into the Bay of Liverpool.\n\nOn the fifth day after his departure from Fort Good Hope, he and his little companion were crossing a large frozen lake, surrounded by immense barren steppes. As they passed under the\nbrow of a high promontory, they suddenly found themselves confronted by a pack of seven white wolves, of immense size. These monsters, who were raging with hunger, howled fiercely, and formed themselves into a semi-circle around the travellers, as if to cut off their chance of escape. They then made three bounds forward towards their intended victims. Father Petitot and his companion had no weapon of defence ready at hand, everything was tightly packed up on the sledge. To undo the baggage and secure a pair of hatchets was Father Petitot's immediate object. He and his companion retained their self-possession, and kept their eyes steadily and boldly fixed upon the ravenous monsters, which still held back, but yet seemed ready to make the final spring upon their prey. Coolly and quickly Father Petitot undid his well-laced baggage, and secured the hatchets, and then put his sledge in order for a sudden advance. The dogs, which at first had taken the wolves for deer, were going to rush upon them, now discovering their mistake, sought to take flight, and had to be held firmly by the Indian boy, to be prevented from doing so. The sledge being in readiness, Father Petitot and his companion mounted it. Free reins were given to the dogs, and the frail equipage shot with the rapidity of an arrow straight through the group of wolves, who opened a passage for it, four standing\non one side and three on the other. They received some sharp cuts of Father Petitot's whip as he passed unharmed in their midst. Their horrible howling, no doubt caused by regret at the escape of their intended prey, continued to be heard for a considerable distance.\n\nA great portion of the vast regions traversed by Father Petitot, during that journey, had never been trodden by foot of a white man before. It was with ineffable feelings of devotion and thankfulness that he offered, for the first time, the Holy Sacrifice of Our Lord's Body and Blood, amidst those lonely steppes that touched the northern frontiers of the earth, and proclaimed the Name of Jesus to races that had never heard that august name pronounced till then.\n\nWe are happy here to be able to state, on the authority of Father Petitot, that the four Indians who had been told off to murder him, had become penitent of their crime. For two years he kept them under probation, during which time he frequently instructed and exhorted them. They repeatedly expressed their regret and horror at the crime they had agreed to commit, and their determination for the future to lead a Christian life, and to give themselves, without reserve, to the service of God. At the close of their period of probation, Father Petitot admitted them to Holy Baptism. He states, that\nduring the journey last named, he received hospitality for three days in the hut of one of these poor men.\n\nIn 1874 Father Petitot arrived in France, the object of his return to Europe being to make arrangements for the publishing of his great Dictionaries of the Deni and Esquimaux languages. His arrival in Paris was the occasion of a very laudatory article in the Journal Officiel, from which we quote the following extracts:\n\n\"The northern regions of America, especially those districts that lie between Hudson Bay and the former possessions of Russia in America, were hitherto little known to geographical science. This deficiency has now been supplied by Father Petitot, a French Missionary of the Society of the Oblates of Mary, who has executed, with his own hand, a map of the basin of the Mackenzie River, and of the Great Slave Lake, and the Great Bear Lake. This map, which is on a large scale, has been presented by its author to the Geographical Society of Paris, and is now one of the most precious treasures of the archives of that institution.\n\n\"The Geographical Society cannot fail to encourage the zeal of those missionaries who turn to such profitable account, for the interests of science, those moments of leisure left to them by the works of their apostleship. Through their means we obtain a knowledge of divers remote countries, which we could not acquire through any other channel.\"\n\nThe Secretary of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Savante, Monsieur Blanchard, introduces thus the name of Father\nPetitot in the report which he read at the annual meeting of that Society in 1874:\n\n\"Our committee is always ready to recognise the services rendered to science by the explorers of distant lands; therefore it does not hesitate at once to acknowledge the deep interest it takes in the widely extended travels, learned researches and observations of a missionary of the Arctic regions of America. Father Petitot passed thirteen years among the Indians who live in the regions bordering the shores of the Arctic ocean. Ten times he has travelled through the long valley of the Mackenzie, from Fort Good Hope to the Great Slave Lake; seven times he has visited the Great Bear Lake and the surrounding arid steppes. He traversed on foot the distance between the lower Mackenzie and Fort Simpson. Through the defiles of the Rocky Mountains he reached the north of Alaska. He journeyed through regions that have no name in geography to the lake of the Esquimaux, and thence to the Arctic ocean. During the time that he spent in the company of wild savage Indians, he carried on to completion great literary undertakings. To him is our society indebted for his meteorological observations, for his notes upon the manners and characters of the peoples he visited, and for an essay on the geological constitution of the countries extending from the 54th degree of latitude to the frozen ocean.\"\n\nShortly after the arrival of Father Petitot in Paris, he received an invitation from a former college confr\u00e8re, Father Boudre, the Superior of the Oblates at Nancy, to visit that city. This circumstance, as we shall see, became the providential means of furnishing him with an opportunity of rendering an important public service to the cause of religion and\ntrue science. At the time of his visit to Nancy, the beautiful capital of Lorraine was astir making preparations for a Congress of Savans that was then about to assemble in that city. The object of the Congress was to discuss the history and ethnography of the indigenous races of America, of the period before the arrival in the new world of Christopher Columbus. The Congress was of an international character. It was held in the Salle des Cerfs of the Ducal Palace, and was presided over by the Baron Guerrier Dumast. A great number of learned men from different countries were present. Father Petitot took his place modestly in the midst of the crowd that occupied the centre of the great hall, but on his presence becoming known to some leading members of the Congress, he was politely invited to occupy a place on the platform. Several speakers addressed the Congress, either to set forth their own theories, or to read papers entrusted to them by absent members. As the proceedings progressed, it became painfully evident to Father Petitot that the leading object of the greater number of those who had spoken, or who had sent in papers, was to throw discredit upon Revelation and Bible History. This they sought to do by attempting to prove that the indigenous races of America were of American origin solely, and were not of Asiatic origin, and consequently were not descended from Adam, but were\nautochthons of the American continent. At last a Monsieur Rosny, professor of the Japanese language, put himself forward as the champion of this infidel theory. He based his arguments on the authority of Voltaire. He attempted to show that the tribes of North America were a race apart, that had no brotherhood of origin with any other portion of the human family, being autochthons of America. He continued at considerable length to advocate these false views. At the conclusion of his discourse, cries were raised by certain persons in the assembly, demanding that the Congress should decide the question at once, in a sense favourable to M. Rosny's views, and thus openly declare itself against the Christian doctrine of the unity of origin of the human race. The Catholics present, who formed the majority of the assembly, were indignant at finding themselves lured into a false position, under the name of science. It was evident to them that in the heart of the Congress, a conspiracy of freethinkers and infidels were actively at work. Father Grouard, who had remained in the centre of the hall when Father Petitot took his place on the platform, thus describes his own impressions on the occasion:\u2014\n\n\"Assuredly, I said to myself, we are in the midst of a gathering of freethinkers, who have come here with their weapons of assault well prepared to give battle to Catholic...\"\ndoctrine. They had the tracing of the programme, and the selecting of the ground of combat, and nobody has come hither prepared to engage in contest with them.\"\n\nWhen Father Grouard was turning over these discouraging thoughts in his mind, he forgot the presence of his colleague, Father Petitot. The latter, when he heard the fundamental principles of Christianity openly assailed on that occasion, especially as the assault was given on a ground with which he had reason to be familiar, felt it to be his duty openly to confute the aggressions made in his presence, upon religion and true science. Advancing to the front of the platform, he asked to be allowed to speak. The favour being granted, he then said: \"I beg of the assembly not to conclude rashly, and without any real proof, that the American tribes were autochthons. I did not come here today prepared to enter upon this discussion; but give me until tomorrow, and I will return, with your permission, armed with the proofs of those truths which I am willing to defend.\"\n\nM. Rosny turned pale with excitement at meeting, unexpectedly, when he thought he had secured his victory, an adversary whom he instinctively felt he had too much reason to dread. \"The Father,\" he exclaimed, \"wishes for war, therefore let there be war.\"\n\nOn Father Petitot presenting himself the next\nday before the assembly, he was received with loud applause by the vast crowd that had collected within the great Ducal hall. Public sympathy had, in the meantime, been gained to him, when it became known that he had spent thirteen years amongst those tribes whose history and ethnography formed a main feature in the discussion which was being carried on, and that he possessed their languages so thoroughly, as to be able to compose Grammars and Dictionaries of them. During two days, for considerable periods at a time, Father Petitot held the assembly spell-bound by his simple, convincing, and learned oratory. He drew, from his vast experience and intimate knowledge of the tribes of North America, proofs which established to demonstration their Asiatic origin. He showed clearly how their language, their customs, their traditions, their religious observances, their war instruments, proved their relationship to the nations of the East.\n\nA perfect ovation awaited Father Petitot's final discourse at the Congress. The President of the Assembly, who had been no party to the manoeuvres of the freethinkers, highly praised the science and talent that were united in the person of the humble missionary. And some other leading members of the Congress, who seemed at first partly inclined to side with the freethinkers, came forward, when Father Petitot ceased speaking, to disavow all sym-\npathy with the unbelieving party in the assembly, and to make open declaration of their Christian faith and sentiments.\n\nThe plans cleverly laid by the Voltarian party at the Congress, were thus completely disconcerted, and the cause of true faith and true science nobly vindicated.\n\nThe attractions of his native country, the charms of home life in a land like France, the private and public esteem, of which he received such marked proofs since his return to that country\u2014all failed to wean Father Petitot's affections from the sphere of duties, which obedience and choice had assigned to him amongst the red men of the Polar regions. The object which brought him to Europe being accomplished, he returned to his post.\n\nIn his last communication, dated the 1st January, 1878, he gives an interesting account of his labours at Fort Macpherson, among the Esquimaux. \"They follow my instructions,\" he says, \"most attentively, and literally besiege me day and night. Their former prejudices with regard to the priest have passed away, and now they manifest a confidence towards me which they would not have ventured formerly to do.\" He speaks in this communication of the frightful sufferings, from want of food, of the Indians of the Mackenzie and Great Bear Lake districts, during the winter of 1877. The deer, from some\ncause, disappeared from the woods, and no trace of them could be discovered. Gluttons and wolves, black, white and grey, came forth in great numbers from the steppes and forests, and prowled about day and night, attacking, without any fear, men and dogs in their ravenous hunger.\n\nLeaving things in this sad condition at Good Hope, Father Petitot expected to find matters better at Fort Norman. After ten days' journeying on foot, he found that Fort forsaken by the company's agents. They had all left at the beginning of winter, owing to the supply of food having run short there. They spent that season on the borders of the Great Bear Lake, living on what fish they could catch in the lake. \"I was reduced to the state of a skeleton,\" writes Father Petitot, \"when I reached Fort Norman. I suffered also from inflammation of my chest and throat, and a painful abscess on my lower lip.\" Great was his disappointment when he found the Fort abandoned. His stock of provisions was exhausted, and nothing was to be had at Fort Norman, where he expected to find an abundant supply for all his wants. Fortunately an agent of the company arrived at the Fort to spend a day on some temporary mission. He kindly gave Father Petitot a portion of his own rations, otherwise the latter might have perished of hunger on that trying occasion.\nWhile Father Petitot was at Fort Norman, a band of Indians, very few of whom were Christians, came from the Rocky Mountains in search of new hunting fields, and to escape the famine which was threatening their own districts. A young man of this tribe was accompanied by his two sisters and a little boy, his nephew. The oldest of these children was under nine years of age. They were cruelly abandoned on the lonely steppes by their inhuman relatives, and their little bodies were found frozen shortly afterwards, with marks of intense suffering in their emaciated faces. This news afflicted the good Father very much, but he was consoled to learn that these children had been baptized.\n\nWe bring Father Petitot's labours down to a recent date, to show that at this hour the hardships and sufferings of the Oblate Missionaries, in the bleak regions of the Mackenzie, demand still the exercise of heroic zeal and devotedness.\n\nFather Grouard, who had been Father Petitot's companion in coming to Europe, utilized the period of his stay in France, which, owing to an extinction of voice from which he was suffering, was prolonged for a year and six months, by applying himself to learn some mechanical arts which would be of use to him afterwards in his missions. He applied himself especially to the learning of printing, of which art he became a perfect master. His knowledge of\nthis important branch of the useful arts will serve him afterwards as a powerful means of promoting the civilization of the tribes that he will have to evangelize. Shortly after Father Petitot took his departure, Father Grouard also left France for his distant missions by the banks of the Mackenzie.\n\nIn seeking to promote the spread of civilization among the Indian tribes which they evangelize, the Oblate Missionaries are but acting in accordance with the letter and the spirit of the instructions given them by Monseigneur de Mazenod, and inserted by him in their code of rules. From this code of printed instructions for Fathers employed in pagan countries, we extract the following passages:\n\n\"It should not be considered as something foreign to the spirit of our ministry, to labour in forming the nomad tribes of the woods and prairies to habits of civilized life. On the contrary, the members of our society should look upon the civilization of those tribes as a powerful adjunct to their missionary work, and as a means of rendering their ministry more fruitful of solid good. Therefore they will use all their influence to withdraw such tribes from their nomad life, and to induce them to choose some place of settlement, there to build fixed residences, and to become tillers of the soil, or to devote themselves to some other industry of civilized life. Superiors of our society should seek to develope in young subjects destined to be employed in our foreign missions, such personal special aptitudes as each one may possess, which afterwards might be available in promoting some branch of civilization in those pagan...\"\nlands, in which they would have to exercise their ministry. Superiors should select also lay-brothers who are skilled in the mechanical arts to become the auxiliaries of the Fathers in the work of instructing and civilizing the wandering tribes of those parts. A good school, in which solid religious instruction and secular education will be imparted, should be established in every mission. The missionaries should endeavour to promote not only the spiritual, but also the temporal well-being of the tribes. They should foster peace and charity between tribe and tribe, and between all members of the same tribe. They should endeavour to form them to habits of thrift and industry, and to a prudent laying by of savings for future wants. They should never become themselves the chiefs of tribes. They will not interfere with the freedom of each tribe to choose its own chief, further than by encouraging and advising them to give their suffrages to a worthy candidate, who would be likely to govern according to the laws of religion and justice, and to promote the temporal welfare of the tribe.\"\n\nThis extract will suffice to make manifest the wonderful foresight and large-minded zeal of Monseigneur de Mazenod, by whose hand these regulations were drawn up.\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nThe great question which all travellers to the wild North West of America have, before they start upon their difficult and perilous journey, carefully to consider, is that which concerns the food supply. Many precious lives have been forfeited, owing to oversight upon this point. One of the chief sources of anxiety on the part of the Superiors of the Missionaries of the Mackenzie districts, is the difficulty of keeping the Fathers and Brothers under their charge supplied with the common necessaries of existence. Many of the most needed requisites of life have to be conveyed over distances of two and sometimes three thousand miles, through dense forests and roadless prairies, or amidst the rapids and dangerous reefs of mighty rivers.\n\nEarly in the summer of 1870, Monseigneur Clut, the coadjutor bishop of Monseigneur Faraud, undertook the charitable but trying task of conveying to the far north the annual supplies destined for the different missionary posts of the Mackenzie districts,\nand also for the community of the Sisters of Charity and their orphans, at Providence.\n\nWe insert the narrative of this charitable expedition, not because it contains anything very exceptional in the way of missionary hardship or adventure, but because it will furnish our readers with the means of forming a proper estimate of the difficulties under which the necessary food supplies are provided for the distant missions of which we are treating.\n\nOn the 5th of May, Monseigneur Clut left Montreal; accompanied by Fathers Roure, Ladet, and Lecorre, and by Brothers Regnier and Pourtier, and on the 6th started from St. Cloud, on a journey of six days in the wild and boundless prairie. After twenty-five days travelling, they reached St. Boniface, where they were hospitably entertained by Monseigneur Tach\u00e9. On the 22nd of June they took their departure from St. Boniface, and re-entered the wilderness. Fifty-one days of prairie travelling lay still before them ere they could reach the banks of the first great river, on whose waters they were to embark. In the stead of the frail sledge drawn by four dogs, the usual accompaniment and requisite of missionary journeys, a caravan of several heavily-laden waggons, drawn by oxen, and conducted by half-breeds, constituted their travelling equipage. Bishop Clut felt deeply\nthe responsibility which was attached to the task he had undertaken. He had before his mind the wants of those hard-working missionaries, of those devoted nuns, and of their orphans, to whom he was conveying supplies. He felt at the time their lives to be as it were in his hands. If through any want of foresight on his part, some considerable portion of these most-needed supplies were to perish, or some serious delays were to occur in their transport, he would consider himself greatly culpable. The brief summer of the Red River regions set in with fierce heats, bringing with it deluging rains and clouds of mosquitoes, that were to be the tormentors of the travellers by day and night. Salt provisions, without any variety, were their only food, and they had no other drink to appease their thirst during their journey, but muddy or brackish water. But what caused most annoyance to the good bishop was the apathy and laziness of the half-breeds, who were conducting the oxen. Serious difficulties were ahead, which could be surmounted only by the journey being expeditiously performed; certain rivers which they had to embark upon were navigable only at special times. If these were not availed of, a whole year's delay might occur in the transport of articles of heavy bulk. The apprehension of some such delay was constantly harassing the mind of the devoted prelate. At last they arrived at Fort Carlton.\nBeyond this point the hired half-breeds were unwilling to proceed. The bishop had to engage other conductors, and to purchase oxen and waggons at exorbitant prices, otherwise he would have had to leave all that he possessed upon the way, and thus deprive the poor missions of the north of their needed annual supplies.\n\nOn the 8th of August the waters of the beautiful Lake la Biche were seen in the distance. The flourishing missionary post of Notre Dame des Victoires stands upon its shores. This is the ordinary residence of Monseigneur Faraud, Vicar-Apostolic of the Mackenzie district. This zealous prelate was overjoyed at the arrival of Monseigneur Clut, his coadjutor. He examined carefully the well-chosen stock of supplies, which the latter was conveying northwards, and approved highly of the judgment and forethought with which they had been selected. Some few days were spent by Monseigneur Clut and his travelling companions, in the society of Bishop Faraud and the Oblate Missionaries of Lake la Biche. Though tempted strongly to protract his delay, and partake of the rest he and his party so much needed, in a spot that had so many attractions for him, yet he determined to push forward upon his journey without further tarrying. He did not forget that he had eight hundred miles still before him, and that he was entering upon the most dan-\ngerous and difficult part of his journey. Oxen and waggons are now left behind. A barque is purchased, and a captain and a crew of rowers are, after much trouble, engaged. Fathers Collignon and Ladet remain at Notre Dame des Victoires, but in their stead a Sister of Charity and a little orphan girl, who are on their way to their community at Providence, join Monseigneur Clut's travelling party. On the 25th of August they embark on Lake la Biche.\n\nFor two days their voyage proceeded under very favourable circumstances. On the 27th they entered the River of Marshes, when, to their dismay, they discovered that, owing to the subsiding of the waters, there was not depth enough in the river for the floating of their barge. To lighten the barge all had to disembark. Brother Pourtier had a narrow escape of losing his life by drowning on that occasion. Whilst helping the crew in hauling the barge up against the rapids, he being up to his waist in the river, his foot slipped, and he was carried away for some distance by the strong current. Fortunately timely help was at hand, and he was saved. With a willing and courageous crew, many of the difficulties of their voyage would have been easily overcome, but unfortunately a bad and cowardly spirit animated the crew they had engaged. After the first hindrance they met in the river, they de-\nclared their unwillingness to proceed any further. At last, after much parleying, a compromise was effected. The whole travelling party, including the Sister of Charity and the little orphan, her companion, had to disembark and pursue their journey on foot, on the banks of the river. Moreover, the Fathers and Brothers, and also the Bishop, agreed to give their help to the crew in drawing the barge up the rapids. The journey on foot by the river's banks imposed many hardships on the bishop and his party. It told very severely on the poor Sister of Charity and the little orphan. Precipitous heights had to be scaled; marshy ground, into which the travellers sometimes sank knee deep, had to be passed over. They had to work their way for long distances through tall wet grass, or through clusters of brambles and briars that scratched their hands and faces, and tore their clothes. Sometimes huge piles of fallen trees completely obstructed their way, and progress could only be effected by the vigorous use of the axe. In the meantime, the barge was slowly moving forward over the shallow bed of the sunken river. Frequently cries for help came from the timid and unmanly crew. In rendering the required assistance, the bishop and his companions had sometimes to spend whole days immersed to the middle in the cold water of the river, and labouring as common boatmen at the task of hauling the barge.\nup the lesser rapids, and of lifting it over the shallows.\n\nThe water was so low in certain places that the cargo had to be divided into four parts, and four separate journeys had to be made to the point where the river became navigable. On the 4th of September one of the boatmen deserted. The rest wished to follow his example. They consented to remain only on condition that their demand for much higher pay was granted. Already their wages were exorbitantly high. Fearing to find himself and his party abandoned, and left to perish in the great wilderness, he had to agree to their terms.\n\nOn the 7th of September they arrived in sight of the great rapid. As it rose in view, the crew grew pale with terror; real dangers stared them in the face. Though the current came dashing down the inclined ledges of the rapid, the water was so shallow that the bed of the river could be seen bristling with rocks and huge sharp pointed stones. Here the cowardly crew carried out at last their threat, and forsook the bishop and his party. What a position for his lordship to find himself in. How is he and his companions to extricate themselves from the horrors of perishing in the wilderness? What is to become of the precious freight of the disabled barque? Are those supplies which he, with such difficulty had collected, and which in face of such\ngreat hardships he has succeeded in conveying thus far, to be abandoned? Is disappointment to be the lot of those hard-worked communities in the far north, who are awaiting the arrival of these supplies? To add to the bishop's embarrassment, the poor Sister of Charity fell seriously ill. Alas! notwithstanding her heroic spirit, which bore her up amidst untold hardships, her delicate frame at last gave way under a succession of trials and fatigues, which were almost too much for the most robust of the travelling party. After much deliberation, and having taken the opinion of his travelling companions, the bishop came to the resolution of leaving Father Rourc and a lay brother in charge of the barque and its precious cargo, and of pushing forward himself, with the rest of his party, to the point of junction between the rivers La Biche and Athabaska, where a small post of the Hudson Bay Company had then been lately established, and where he hoped to be able to obtain help. A tent was erected on the bank for the invalid Sister and the little orphan girl. Monseigneur Clut and his companions took five days' provisions with them on their journey, which was to be performed on foot, and which was likely to be accompanied by severe hardships. Painfully they advanced during their first day's march, sometimes over sharp cutting stones, sometimes knee-deep in mud, now amidst dense bram-\nbles, and now on the brink of precipices, or on the flanks of rocks and steep declivities. Towards sunset all were exhausted with fatigue, and their feet were bruised and bleeding. They were thinking of preparing their encampment for the night, sad with the thought of having another such day of toil and fatigue before them, for the journey of the morrow, when they perceived the smoke of some Indian camp on the opposite bank, curling in the air. Shots were quickly discharged, and answered by similar signals. Presently a canoe shot through the water, and some Montagnais Christians landed. When they discovered who the bishop was, they invited his lordship and his party to their camp. The great \"Chief of Prayer\" was received, on his arrival, with extraordinary demonstrations of joy. Hearing of the straits to which his lordship and his party were reduced, these excellent Christians placed, on the following day, two canoes at their disposal. This timely aid was most providential, as Monseigneur Clut and his companions were so exhausted by the fatigues of the previous day, that they were incapable of renewing their march, and probably would have broken down on their way, if the generous succour named had not been afforded them by the good Montagnais.\n\nThe post of the Hudson Bay Company, which they had been seeking to reach, was at last arrived\nat. The Bishop expected to meet there Mr. MacMurray, the chief-officer of the company in that district, who had already rendered many important services to the missionary Fathers, and who he felt would not refuse to come to his aid in his then critical position. But to his disappointment he found, on reaching the Fort, that Mr. MacMurray had not arrived there. Having waited for three days for that gentleman's arrival, he resolved to go forward to the Great Portage, with the prospect of meeting him there.\n\nAccompanied by Brother Pourtier, and a half-breed named Bertand, he set out for the Great Portage in a small canoe which he had equipped for the occasion. Five days' travelling brought him to the Great Portage, which was twelve miles long, and which he crossed on foot. In the absence of Mr. MacMurray, his representative (Mr. Mackensie) generously granted to Monseigneur Clut the assistance he required. A boat, crew, and guide were placed at his disposal. The snow had already begun to fall. This sign of the approach of winter was a warning to him that he should lose no time in seeking to complete his journey. He had still to traverse the Great Slave Lake, and to enter the Mackenzie before the ice took hold of lake or river. If he should fail to do so, then all his labours up to now would count for nothing, and he would find\nhimself unable to supply the missions of the north with the supplies intended for them.\n\nBut this was not, at that time, the sole cause of his painful solicitude. He could not forget the little encampment of his fellow travellers, which he had left more than a fortnight previously on the solitary banks of the Athabaska. How had it fared with them since his departure? What was then the condition of the poor invalid Sister of Charity? Must they not feel apprehensive and despondent at being left so long in their dreary solitude, without any news from him? Such were the questions which he then anxiously turned over in his mind. He resolved to shorten their period of suspense by returning to them by the readiest means of transport. Judging that he would arrive more quickly in his canoe than he could do by waiting for the luggage boat, he adopted the resolution of starting at once in the former, accompanied by Brother Pourtier. This resolution nearly cost him and Brother Pourtier their lives. The canoe was approaching a most dangerous rapid. Brother Pourtier, who was rowing with the bishop, got bewildered and pulled some false strokes. The bishop saw the danger, and called aloud to his companion to row in an opposite direction. The latter either did not hear the warning given him, owing to the roaring and hissing of the waters, or had become confused\nand lost his presence of mind. He continued still to row in the same fatal direction; one false stroke more would have hurled the canoe and its occupants over the edge of the rapid, into the roaring abyss beneath. \"Row as you see me row,\" cried out the bishop, with almost super-human effort. This time, fortunately, the warning was understood and acted upon, just soon enough to avoid a fatal issue.\n\nOn the 1st of October, after an absence of nearly four weeks, the bishop returned to the campment, where he found the companions of his travels despairing of ever seeing him any more. The joy he experienced in meeting them again was tempered by the sight of the sad condition to which the invalid Sister was reduced. Her reason had given way temporarily under the accumulation of her sufferings; she was then in high delirium. Her little orphan attendant was in tears at her side. Father Roure had to watch her night and day for weeks, aided by the good lay-brother. The howling wilderness was all around them, and no other help was at hand. On the bishop's arrival, Father Roure himself was lying prostrate, worn out and harassed by his fatigues and anxieties in keeping watch over the poor delirious Sister.\n\nThe journey had to be resumed under these dispiriting circumstances. The poor invalid had to be borne on a litter over the long Portage, which\nthey had to traverse to reach the place of embarkation.\n\nOn Sunday, the 9th of October, they arrived at the Mission of the Nativity, which is situated on the shores of the Lake Athabaska. Monseigneur Clut had laboured in that mission for many years, and was greatly revered and loved by the Indian tribes that frequented that post. It being Sunday, a great crowd of Indians, seven hundred and more, were assembled for Mass. When it was announced that Monseigneur Clut was approaching, they went forward in a body, with great demonstrations of joy, to meet him. Fathers Eynard and Laity were in charge of that mission. The unexpected visit of a brother Oblate, in the revered person of his lordship, was a joyful surprise to them. Those meetings of dear friends in the wilderness have a charm about them, that those accustomed to home life can scarcely appreciate. When brother missionaries thus meet, they have much to say to one another\u2014consolations to impart and to receive, counsels to ask and to communicate. Time speeds quickly on such occasions, and the day of separation seems to come too soon. But duty bids each one go his way to his own appointed work, and the voice of duty has to be obeyed, for it is the voice of God.\n\nMonseigneur Clut judged it would be imprudent to expose the invalid to the hardships of a longer\njourney. He came to the conclusion of leaving her and her orphan companion at the Mission of the Nativity, under the care of the Fathers of that mission. In the meantime she had quite recovered her reason, and understood how much she was indebted to the devoted care of the good bishop and his companions. Her expressions of gratitude were very touching and sincere.\n\nOn the 18th of October they entered the Great Slave Lake. They had not advanced far upon the waters of that inland sea, when the weather became very boisterous, and they were driven twice upon a sand bank. It was only after supreme and repeated efforts that they were able to extricate themselves. After a considerable amount of tacking and rowing, they succeeded in reaching Elk-deer Island, on which the thriving mission of St. Joseph is situated. There they met Father Gascon, with whom they stayed for two days. Father Roure had rallied but very slightly from his recent severe illness, and the bishop did not consider him to be in a fit state to encounter the rigours of the remainder of the journey. He consequently, to his great regret, felt himself compelled to leave the invalid Father at St. Joseph's. This was a wise resolution, for now the chief hardships of their difficult expedition were to commence. The first storm-notes of coming winter are ringing over the desolate shores of the Great\nSlave Lake. The leaden skies are about to discharge a snow deluge over lake and land. The sharp air begins to bite keenly, as if a viper's tongue were in its every breath. The frost-king is soon to claim all nature as his domain, and to establish his rule everywhere. It is at such a season that Bishop Clut launches his frail boat anew on the waters of the Great Slave Lake. It may be asked, why chose he a barque so frail? The answer is brief and ready at hand\u2014no other would answer to carry and to be carried. It is not only through waves on lake or river that the voyageur's boat has to advance, but also through woods and over hills on dry land. Unable to mount or descend the rapid, it has to be carried empty over the Portage. Hence the need of light portable boats for such journeys as we have been describing. But such boats, it must be acknowledged, are ill-suited to weather the storm on lakes, some of which occupy a larger area than the Irish Sea.\n\nMonseigneur Clut and his party resumed their voyage on the 21st of October. A great fall of snow took place on that day, but the wind was favourable, and they were able to reach the embouchure of the Ox River before night set in. There they landed and encamped for the night. Early the next morning they set sail, but they had not gone far from the shore, when a furious gale suddenly\nsprang up. Snow fell in thick abundance during the gale, darkening the air, and nearly blinding them. Huge waves went over the barque, which threatened every moment to go to the bottom. From head to foot all were drenched with half frozen water. It was evident to them that their boat could not hold out much longer against the fury of such a storm. If there was a harbour nigh into which they could run for shelter, then there might be some chance of escape for them; on the contrary, they knew that their route was interspersed with many sunken rocks and hidden shoals, against some one of which their boat might, at any moment, run foul and sink. When all human hope of being able to save themselves seemed to be upon the point of vanishing, they suddenly sighted a little bay where the water was shallow, and where they would have a chance of saving their lives, even though their barque were to go to pieces. Into this bay Monseigneur Clut ordered the boat to be run. The crew, barque, and cargo were thus saved for that time.\n\nWhen they had reached the shore, the guide and the crew presented themselves in a body to the bishop, to declare to him that their voyage for that year had come to an end. \"We can advance no further,\" they exclaimed, \"the lake is already frozen. We shall be caught in the ice if we venture\nagain to set sail.\" The bishop thought it useless then to reason further with them. That night sleep came slowly to his eyes as he lay upon the snow-clad shores of the Great Slave Lake. The dread of being frozen up for the winter in that desolate spot was upon him.\n\nThe morning of the 22nd rose, and to his dismay he saw vast sheets of ice, spreading far and wide over the surface of the lake. The wind had fallen, but the cold was intense. He renewed his entreaties to the crew to proceed on their voyage; one of them openly deserted him, the others were preparing to follow the deserter's example, but the bishop's influence still held them back.\n\nThe morning of the 23rd opened with still more dreary prospects. The storm had risen to almost its first violence, and the ice had become thicker on the lake. One day's more delay will render it impossible, even for the most resolute and daring men, which the present crew were certainly not, to work a passage through these thickening fields of ice. At present it might be done, but not an hour should be lost.\n\nThe 23rd was a Sunday. The bishop raised a temporary altar on the shore, and celebrated Mass. During the holy sacrifice, he prayed earnestly that God would bless him with a favourable issue to his journey. After the Mass the storm sensibly abated,\nand the courage of the crew revived. The guide proposed to him to launch the boat anew, to which proposal the bishop gladly consented. The launching of the boat, under the present circumstances, offered extraordinary difficulties. It had to be trailed for a considerable distance to the water's edge, over the surface of the ice, which was not yet sufficiently solid to bear the strain thus put upon it. To encourage the crew who were losing heart, the bishop, Father Lecorre, and Brother Pourtier, took part in the launching of the boat, and afterwards in conveying to it the cargo, portion by portion. Several immersions took place by the breaking of the ice, during this tedious operation. The water being shallow, no danger was incurred, but everybody commenced the voyage in wet half-frozen clothes. A favourable breeze sprang up on their leaving the shore, which bore them in the direction of the mouth of Hay River, which they reached that night. There they found a mission house and chapel which Father Gascon had erected the previous year. Father Gascon was then absent, but they were able to lodge in the house that night. The following morning new difficulties awaited the good bishop. The crew, finding themselves in good quarters, were unwilling to quit them, and to expose themselves to the risks and hardships of a prolonged voyage. The bishop implored, exhorted, promised\nthem increase of pay, but all in vain. He declared that if any real danger presented itself, that he would at once order the boat back to shore. The next day a favourable wind broke up the newly-formed ice which had collected around the boat; this gave new courage to the crew, and they pushed off again upon the lake. They had a good run that morning, and about noon they reached a spot called Pointe de Roches, where they drew ashore for dinner. Suddenly, before they embarked again, the wind changed, and began to blow strongly from an unfavourable quarter. They took to their oars, and got a short distance from the shore, when the violence of the wind compelled them to return to Pointe de Roches. On the evening of the 25th a calm ensued, of which the bishop and his party took advantage. They had already made considerable way, when the guide suddenly cried out, with terrified looks, that the lake was completely frozen over, and that it would be impossible to advance any further. Moreover, he said, that if they stayed much longer out upon the lake, the sides of the boat would be stove in under the pressure of the ice. All demanded to return to Pointe de Roches. The bishop consented at once to this request of the crew, for now he perceived that they were threatened by a real and formidable danger. That night was spent by the devoted prelate in sad conjecture as to how\nhis long and harassing journey was to terminate. Was he to become frost-bound on the lake? Was he to fail in the object of his charitable mission? Was he to be deprived of the consolation of bearing food and raiment to his brethren, and to the sisterhood, and their orphans, in the mission of Providence? In God was now his only trust. The prayer of that night was heard. A partial thaw took place during the night, which enabled the crew to float the boat the next morning. For the third time they quitted Pointe de Roches. By hard pulling they reached the Ile des Marais, where the Great Slave Lake discharges its waters into the bed of the mighty Mackenzie. One hour later would have been too late to pass from the lake to the river, for a furious gale had sprung up in the meantime, which, if they had been overtaken by it whilst still on the lake, would have retarded them so much that the ice would have had time to encircle them, and thus to bar their further progress.\n\nOn the evening of the 26th of October, they commenced to descend the Mackenzie, in the midst of great floating icebergs. As night was falling fast, they wished to approach the land to bivouac till the following morning, being anxious to escape the horrors of a night spent on the river, in the midst of dangerous masses of floating ice, and enveloped in a darkness which was frightfully intensified by clouds\nof drifting snow. But they were prevented landing by the ice at the sides of the river. They were forced therefore to pass the night on the river, and the wind, which blew a hurricane, came from the north, and was right in their teeth. Though the current of the river which they were following was very strong and rapid, yet they were making but little way, owing to the wind which was against them. Twice they succeeded in lashing the boat to a floating iceberg, in the hope that it would tow them along with it. A partial success followed each such attempt, but the iceberg, in each instance, broke away from them very soon. They had to ply their oars vigorously during that night, to keep the boat from running upon the sharp-edged masses of ice that jutted out from either bank. If they ran upon any of these, the boat would surely founder, and all would perish.\n\nOn the morning of the 27th, at ten o'clock, a cry of joy burst from the lips of all\u2014the mission of Providence was sighted. There it lay before them, the goal of their six months' journeying. They had left Montreal in the first days of May, and they now arrive in the last days of October. The good bishop's labour of love is accomplished. He has succeeded, in face of countless difficulties, and at peril oftentimes of his life, in conveying supplies to the beleaguered Soldiers of the Cross, shut up within\nthe ice fastnesses of the wild north. The news of his arrival creates at the mission a joy, the more sensibly felt, because of its being so little expected. All hopes of seeing him there that year had faded away, and the expectation of the arrival of the much needed supplies had also subsided.\n\nThe following day his lordship celebrated a Pontifical High Mass of thanksgiving, at which the Missionaries, the Sisters of Charity, and their orphans, devoutly and gratefully assisted.\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nWe group together in this chapter certain isolated facts, which we have collected from the letters of the Oblate Missionaries, and to which we give the title of \"Missionary Fragments.\"\n\nLouis Daz\u00e9 is a name that will remain long embalmed in the memory of the Oblate missionaries of Saskatchewan, and of the districts of the Mackenzie. He was not an Oblate of Mary, but he was their devoted servant, who sought no recompense for his services beyond his food and raiment. A Canadian by birth, and a carpenter by trade, for twenty long years he devoted himself to the voluntarily undertaken task of aiding, in every way within the scope of his capabilities, the great work of the Oblate missions to the heathens of the wild north. His motives in thus acting were dictated by piety and zeal. By sharing, in his own way, in the labours of the missionaries, he looked forward to the happiness of partaking of their heavenly recompense. His was of a joyous, affectionate nature, and often did his gentle and winning cheerfulness beguile the tediousness of\nthe lonely encampment in the wilderness, when he acted as guide and companion to some missionary Father. At the end of October, 1873, he accompanied Father Scollen, a young Irish Oblate Priest, to a mission which he was to give to a tribe of Blackfeet. The place where the mission was to be given lay at a distance of twenty-five days' journey from St. Albert's. About the end of November the supply of food began to run short among the Indians assembled to take part in the mission, and it became necessary to send out a body of hunters to the chase of the buffalo. The horses belonging to the Fathers at St. Albert's, of which Louis Daz\u00e9 had charge, were also dispatched to the hunting grounds, which lay at a distance of some eighty miles from the place of the mission. On the day following that of their arrival there, they were fortunate enough to meet a numerous herd of buffaloes. In the evening, on the assembling of the hunters at the place which had been fixed on for their encampment, it was discovered that several of the horses were missing. In the afternoon of that day a violent snow tempest had unexpectedly broken out, which marred considerably the progress of the chase. The horses were lost during the snow storm. When Louis Daz\u00e9 discovered that some of the horses could not be found, he resolved to go, without delay, in search of them. They had been entrusted to his charge, and he was\ndetermined that none of them should be lost through any omission of duty on his part. The storm continued still to rage and to gain in fury; the fresh snow was deepening on the ground, and defacing every track and land mark. An Assiniboine, before turning in to his camp bed for the night, made an attempt to collect the horses together, but he had succeeded in finding only five or six, when he had to beat a hasty retreat, back to his tent, before the terrific violence of the blinding storm of snow. The trusty Canadian asked if all the horses had been found, and on receiving a negative reply, he went out at once himself in search of the missing ones. \"It is useless for you,\" cried out the Assiniboine, \"to go in search of the horses; you will not find them, and certain death awaits you if you stray from the tent.\" Louis Daz\u00e9 was a man without fear, when he felt he had a duty to fulfil. During the score of years which he had spent in those regions, he had in his travels been exposed to dangers and difficulties of every sort, out of all of which, through his energy and skill, aided by God's blessing, he succeeded in escaping. Now he feels compelled, by a sense of duty, to expose himself anew to risk and peril, to fulfil what he believes to be an obligation. The next morning when the Indians awoke they found themselves half dead with cold, and covered with four feet of fresh snow which had fallen during\nthe night. They looked around for Louis Daz\u00e9, but he was nowhere to be found. They set out in search of him, and traversed the surrounding prairie in all directions for fourteen days, seeking to find him, but it was all in vain. At last they returned to the mission. When they broke the afflicting news to Father Scollen, the grief of this good Father was indescribable. He loved Louis Daz\u00e9 very much, and was inconsolable at his loss. He resolved to go forth himself the following morning in search of the poor Canadian\u2019s remains. The next day, as he was about departing on his mournful expedition, an Indian came to him in haste to say that the body of Louis Daz\u00e9 had been found on the banks of the river du Coude, at a distance of four days\u2019 journey from the camp, and that he had conveyed it thence on his sledge.\n\nLouis Daz\u00e9 was a man full of faith and fervour. It was his custom to approach the Sacraments every fortnight. He had received Holy Communion a few days before he left the camp to which he was never to return. When his body was discovered, he had his hands crossed upon his breast holding his scapular. On his cheek were frozen tears, we may presume they were tears of contrition and of love. He must have been some six or seven days wandering without food. And what gave an additional feature of sadness to the manner of his death was, that five\nminutes' further walking would have conducted him to the brow of a hill, at the foot of which a tribe of friendly Indians were encamped at the time, from whom he would have received all the help and assistance he required. But his earthly mission was accomplished, and the hour had come for the faithful servant to be called home to his reward.\n\nThe sheltering of the orphan is one of the good works which true charity ever most generously seeks to promote. The waifs and strays of the Red Indian wilderness could not be overlooked in the zeal of the missionaries of that region.\n\nAt St. Albert's we find an orphanage springing up under the fostering care and active surveillance of the Fathers of that mission. The history of some of those poor little mites of humanity, to whom the doors of the new orphanage were first opened, is sad and touching in the extreme. One little orphan of the Blackfeet tribe was found abandoned in the prairie, and lying on the dead body of his mother, who had died of small-pox. Another little boy, who was under six years of age, tells thus in substance his own story:\n\n\"Our camp, which was composed of six lodges, was far away in the prairie. All in the camp were attacked by small-pox and died. My father was the last who died. I was left alone, and was very much afraid. I remained by myself in the camp for several days, and lived upon dried\nfish, but the smell from the dead bodies was making me sick; I could stop there no longer. I closed the door of the lodge, and put branches of trees against it to prevent the dogs and the wolves devouring the body of my father. I took with me some dried fish and departed. I found a horse on the way, which, by standing on the trunk of a fallen tree, I was able to mount. I travelled on for many days, not knowing where I was going. At night I used to tie my horse to a tree, and sleep on the ground myself. The wild dogs continued to follow me, and I dreaded very much that they would eat me up. They discovered where I had concealed my fish at night, and devoured it all. I also lost my horse. I wandered about for several days and had nothing to eat, nor had I anything to drink, for all the water was frozen. I suffered also very much from the cold, for I could not kindle a fire. At last two Indians found me, and brought me to the Father who was in the prairie, and he led me hither.\"\n\nThese simple and touching stories will suffice to show from what depths of misery the orphans of St. Albert's were rescued, scarcely one of whom had not been a great sufferer in some way, before being received under the sheltering roof of that institution.\n\nFather Fourmond makes mention of a half-breed Indian, Paul Fayans, and of his wife, who were both devout Christians. God was about to call the latter to Himself; but it would seem that in His divine goodness He chose to prepare the mind of the poor humble and pious Indian for the sacrifice He was going to demand of him, by favouring him with\na holy vision, of which Paul thus speaks to Father Fourmond:\n\n\"My Father, last night in my sleep it seemed to me that I beheld Heaven open. Oh! how grand and beautiful it was. What beautiful lodges! What beautiful trees! What beautiful angels! I then beheld an immense train of light, of all the colours of the rainbow, descend to the earth. Near to the spot where it touched the ground sat a woman with veiled face. At that moment a voice spoke to me from on high, saying, 'She whom thou beholdest will soon ascend by this pathway of light into the glory of the Great Spirit.'\"\n\nA few days after, Paul's wife, one of the best and holiest women in the colony, took ill, and after twelve days of excruciating sufferings, which she bore with admirable patience, died the death of the saints. Shortly after her death, Paul, holding in his arms his little child of six months, met Father Fourmond, and said to him:\n\n\"Ah, my Father, God is very good. He had given me the best of wives, I was not worthy to possess her. He has called her from me to His own bright paradise. I thank Him with my whole heart, and I thank Him further for having prepared me for this trial, by showing me beforehand what was going to happen.\"\n\nAnother instance of the same kind presented itself shortly after. A little boy of eight or nine years of age, the son of the chief of the tribe, Luison Montagnais, said one day in serious tones to his father:\n\n\"My father, the path by which I soon shall have to\ntravel has been shown to me. It leads to the beautiful house of the Great Spirit. He who pointed out this bright path to me, said, however, that if I chose I could still remain with you.\u201d\n\nLuison was a man of strong faith and tender piety. His eyes filled with tears in hearing such words spoken by his child. He answered him thus:\n\n\u201cMy dear child, you know that I love you, and that I would wish you to remain with me; but still, I would prefer your going to the beautiful house of the Great Spirit. I will not be an obstacle to your happiness. Follow then the bright path which was shown to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut father, I have something more to say to you,\u201d said the pious child, \u201cI am not to be the first to depart from life. The path by which I have to travel is very short, I shall soon get to the end; but my mother will have to travel by a longer way. It is she who will have to go first. I shall follow her after some days, and then we shall meet again. In proof of what I now say to you, I will recite my prayers in French; you know I have never said them in that language. He who showed me the path has taught me.\u201d\n\nThe child then said his prayers aloud in correct French, and everything happened as he had predicted. His mother\u2019s death first took place, and in the course of a few days he followed her to the grave and to Heaven.\n\nBefore speaking further of Father Fourmond and of his missionary labours, we shall present our readers with an extract which refers to him, from the published letters of Mr. James Trow, who is a\nmember of the Canadian government, and chairman of the Immigration and Colonization Committee. These letters were reprinted by order of the Government of the Dominion of Canada:\n\n\"About noon we entered the settlement of St. Laurent. We drove from house to house for information respecting the crossing, but to our astonishment the settlement was deserted, and the doors and windows were locked or nailed up. After many unsuccessful attempts along the numerous trails, at last we arrived at the mission, and found Father Fourmond at home\u2014'monarch of all he surveyed.' This gentleman was alone\u2014the only male inhabitant that could be found for miles. Fathers, mothers, sons and daughters, absolutely all, excepting a few old women and small children, were away to the plains with their horses, cattle and dogs, hunting the buffalo and preparing their winter supplies. The younger members of the family take charge of the stock, the fathers and eldest sons chase and kill the buffalo, the mothers and daughters prepare the pemmican and dried meat, and tan and cure the robes. . . . I produced my credentials\u2014a letter of introduction from His Grace Archbishop Tach\u00e9\u2014to Father Fourmond, who very kindly invited myself and party to dinner. Letting out our animals, we took a stroll through the church property, while the reverend Father prepared the dinner, for he was a man of all work. Father Fourmond is a devoted Christian minister, his very appearance would convince the most sceptical that he was sincere and devoted to his charge. The influence of Roman Catholic priests over the half-breeds and natives is great. Their intellectual attainments, and devotion to the spiritual welfare of their flock, command respect; while it is plain that they spend their lives for other than this world's goods. After dinner we were shown into the library, where we noticed a good collection of books in several languages,\nchiefly works on theology. The chapel is erected on the summit of the river bank, overlooking the residences of his parishioners for miles on both sides. In front of the church, on a raised platform or triangle, is hung a large bell, which can be distinctly heard for miles. Near the church we found an enclosed burying ground. Down in the dingle north of the house, in a sheltered nook, we saw a beautiful spring boiling up. Along the northern boundary there is a deep cut ravine, the work of ages of the little crystal stream, that flows through on its way to unite with the waters of the Saskatchewan.\"\n\nFather Fourmond had been the Principal of a large and flourishing college in France, before he joined the Society of the Oblates of Mary. Having contributed to the forming of the vocation of several of the students of his college for that society, he himself finally entered its ranks, with the object in view of being allowed to labour in the Indian missions of North America. His desire was complied with. At the period about which we write, he was engaged in the quiet and congenial work of Professor to the young Oblate students who were around him at St. Laurent. At the same time, he laboured with devoted zeal among the half-breeds and the Indians in that locality. At that time the dreaded scourge of Indian tribes, the small-pox, was raging at St. Albert's mission. One-third of the little colony were dying or dead. Two of the Fathers were lying prostrate there, one suffering from small-pox, and the other worn out by his incessant labours.\namong the sick and dying. The time had arrived, and was already far advanced, for the Indians to go to the Great Prairie. They were threatened, by remaining much longer at St. Albert's, with the horrors of famine, in addition to those of the plague. On the other hand, it was but too probable that they would be pursued to their hunting plains by the terrible epidemic, and that thus many would be exposed to die in the vast wilderness, far away from priest and altar, deprived of the consolations of religion. It was at last decided that they should set out for the Great Prairie at once, provided that a priest accompanied them, and consented to remain with them during their expedition. Father Fourmond willingly accepted to become their spiritual conductor in the great desert, and their companion in all their sufferings. In his heart he offered his life to God on that occasion. A day's travelling brought them to the Fort of the Prairie. The first victim of the small-pox was struck down and expired, after a brief illness, on the threshold of the Fort. Two days passed before the fatal stroke fell upon any other member of the tribe. On the third day of their journey, a poor Indian and his little boy expired of the malady. Over their graves Father Fourmond raised a large cross, at the foot of which he assembled the whole tribe, to pray to God for pardon for their sins, and to promise,\nwith united voice, to love and serve Him for the future.\n\nThe dreadful malady continued to add to the number of its victims. At first twenty\u2014then forty\u2014sixty\u2014a hundred lay smitten at the same time. At last two-thirds of the whole tribe were attacked. Father Fourmond had to act the nurse, the physician, the undertaker to bury the dead, as well as his own proper part, that of the devoted priest. He was the only white man amongst that terrified multitude, and all were applying to him for counsel and succour. Alas! in the midst of their terrible visitation, they were forced to keep up a wandering life. To remain stationary would lead to the death of all by hunger. They had to follow the receding herds of buffaloes or deer from one hunting ground to another. How describe the frightful increase of sufferings entailed by the frequent removals of the sick and dying? The living and hale were scarcely numerous enough to bury the dead, and to help in carrying, from one place of encampment to another, the prostrate crowd of the plague-stricken. Sad and silent as a funeral procession, was the slow march through the desert of the remnant of that great warrior tribe, pursued by an invisible foe which they could not shake off or escape from. Vain was craft or courage\u2014vain was youth or strength. They continued to fall as quickly as if they were upon a\nbattle field. The living and strong of early morning were counted among the dying or dead at midday. The rude carts in which the sick were being conveyed, were crowded to excess. Christian sympathy, and the kindness of fathers and brothers existed on the part of the conductors of those melancholy teams; and all that could be done for the plague-smitten was done, but impossibilities could not be overcome. On the rude carts, laden with the sick, had to roll over immense and roadless prairies. Sometimes the wheels sank with a sudden jerk into a deep rut or foxes' lair\u2014sometimes they struck against the hidden stump of some fallen tree, and then the cart, with its helpless and moaning occupants, was precipitated into some dismal swamp.\n\nThe arrival at the place of encampment was accompanied with new discomforts. In lodges not more than nine feet in diameter, were grouped four or five, and sometimes as many as ten, victims of small-pox in each. They lay upon old buffalo hides, or upon the bare ground. A fire in the centre, whilst communicating some heat, filled the wretched tent with smoke and stench. Sixty of these lodges were occupied with small-pox patients. Into each one Father Fourmond had to creep on hands and knees to administer the Sacraments to the dying. Cautiously had he to grope in the dark, lest he should inadvertently set his clothes on fire, or by\nfriction cause new sufferings or abrasions to the plague-stricken. They lay before him scarcely recognisable as human beings, but his strong faith recognised, under this hideous covering of decaying and putrid flesh, immortal souls for which Jesus Christ had died, and for which the bright crown of glory was being prepared in Heaven. Amidst their groans of pain, rose also to his ears their sighs of true repentance, and their prayers for pardon. This consoled and gladdened him very much. \"My Father,\" did many of them say to him, \"it is for my sins that God has punished me thus. I have many times offended the Great Spirit, He does not punish me as much as I deserve. In my blindness I did not know what sin was. I thank the Great Spirit and Holy Mary for giving me the knowledge I now have of the evil of sin.\"\n\nFather Fourmond assures us that he never heard from the lips of those poor patients one solitary murmur against the adorable hand that smote them. On the contrary, their general language, amidst their frightful sufferings and the throes of death, breathed the most perfect resignation to the Divine will.\n\nThe trials of that afflicted tribe have not yet reached their climax. The morning of the 9th of September was to usher in a new and terrible disaster. That day a parching and violent wind swept\nover the camp. In the far horizon volumes of smoke were seen to rise from the ground and to cloud the air, shutting out the view of the sun. The smoke coil began rapidly to extend and to advance, in circuit shape, towards the camp. To the eyes of all the terrible truth was visible that the prairie was on fire. The chief, Luison Montagnais, seeing the danger, ran up his standard on the flag-staff over his tent. This was the signal for the assembling at once of his council. The council met hurriedly, and concluded unanimously that the Great Spirit alone could save them, so imminent was the danger.\n\nFather Fourmond was at this time administering the Sacraments to some of the dying victims of the small-pox, and was not aware of the gravity of the peril by which the camp was being threatened. A messenger was sent to beg of him to assemble at once the whole tribe in prayer, to implore the Great Spirit that He, in His mercy, would rescue them from their peril. Father Fourmond's bell was rung to call the dispersed tribe together before his tent. The invitation was promptly obeyed, and all who were able to move came at once to the place appointed for the public prayer. Father Fourmond urged them to place their full confidence in God, to repent of their sins, and to join fervently in the prayers he was about to recite. The Rosary and other prayers were then fervently offered up by all.\nHe then advised them to return, each to his own lodge, at once, and do what he could to save his family, and especially the sick.\n\nIt was then mid-day, the clouds of smoke were becoming denser at every moment, and the circuit of the flames, like a huge fiery serpent, was stealthily enfolding them in its deadly embrace. The air, which was thickly mixed with ashes, was becoming too hot to breathe. Flight was impossible, for the progress of the fire had cut off all avenues of retreat. One last attempt at saving their lives was adopted, though it seemed a hopeless one. A circle was formed of carts and waggons, within which all hastened to take refuge. Thither each family sought to convey the sick and the dying of their lodge. Lamentable were the cries of those poor invalids, whose relatives were either dead or had abandoned them, and who were left to their fate in their isolated lodges. Father Fourmond seemed to multiply himself in passing rapidly from lodge to lodge, to rescue the sick from the approaching flames. \"Save me! Father, save me!\" was the cry which reached him repeatedly from poor abandoned invalids.\n\nMany of the lodges were already in flames, the fire was gaining with frightful rapidity on the circle, within which were crowded the whole tribe, men, women, and children. The strong, the sick, and the dying were grouped there, together with such frag-\nments of their goods as they were able to carry with them from their burning lodges. Will the slender barricade they have raised prove sufficient to stay the progress of the sea of fire which is approaching them from every side? Will it not itself be quickly turned into flames, and serve only to feed the fire which it was raised to check?\n\nFather Fourmond was still afraid that some poor helpless sick person had not yet been removed out of the track of the fire. He attempted one further search, but was driven back by the hissing flames and stifling smoke. \"Save yourself, Father,\" cried out a friendly voice, \"you expose yourself to be burnt alive, fly quickly to the circle, the sick are all there.\" Father Fourmond returned to the circle; the heat had become intolerable; the day had been turned into a darkness deep as that of midnight by the dense smoke. To avoid suffocation, all put their faces to the ground, to facilitate thus the act of breathing. Everybody felt that his last hour had come. \"I offered then to God,\" writes Father Fourmond, \"the sacrifice of my life, and the lives of my poor Indians, and recommended my soul and theirs to Him. I could hear those lying near me saying, 'Pray for us, Father, pray for us.'\"\n\nThe flames have reached the outward circle, their red glare is falling luridly on every object within it\u2014one moment's further freedom for the advancing\nfire, and the inner circle, with all its occupants, their poor chattels and their domestic animals, will become one huge furnace. But a hand stronger than that of man, the same hand which holds the ocean's waves in check, held back the waves of that fiery torrent, at the moment when it was about completing its devastating work, by the destruction of hundreds of lives.\n\nIn the twinkling of an eye all danger ceases, the fire, of itself, unaccountably dies out\u2014the darkness melts, and the bright face of the day reveals itself. One cry of thanksgiving, inaugurated by Father Fourmond, goes up from the rescued multitude to God. Upon enquiry it was found there was only one who fell a victim to the flames, and he was the only one who had refused to join in the public prayers to implore God's protection, offered by Father Fourmond, as we have already stated.\n\nThe plague-stricken tribe had to resume its sorrowful march through the wilderness, under circumstances still sadder than those which marked its previous wanderings. It was no longer through the high grass of the prairie that it had to advance, but through ashes and cinders, which were sometimes raised in clouds by the wind, and dashed in their faces, blackening everything, and almost impeding their further progress. At times, when all prospect of being able to prolong their existence in those fire-\nwasted regions seemed to disappear, the kindly hand of God's Providence would conduct them to some oasis in the wilderness which had not been touched by the flames. There they would pitch their camp, and seek temporary repose for themselves, relief from the fatigues of their painful journey for the sick, and fodder and rest for their poor wearied horses. The frightful epidemic still continued to pursue them, and to demand its daily victims.\n\nThe physical strength of Father Fourmond now began to fail him; he was becoming unequal to the task of ministering any longer to the sick and dying. Hundreds of miles separated him from his confr\u00e8res. He needed all his faith and trust in God to sustain him under the succession of appalling and heart-rending scenes which he had been witnessing, and through which he had been passing.\n\nBut a happy surprise was awaiting him. One day he was accompanying the funeral of a poor Indian, the latest victim of the terrible epidemic, when he was overtaken by a body of horsemen, who were escorting no less a personage than Monseigneur Grandin, his kind-hearted and zealous bishop, who had come personally to the help of the devoted missionary. His lordship having heard of the labours and sufferings of Father Fourmond, and of the series of visitations which had overtaken the afflicted tribe with which he was journeying through the desert,\nresolved to hasten at once himself in person, to the good priest's relief. Father Fourmond describes in these words his meeting with the bishop:\n\n\"I cast myself at his feet to ask his lordship's blessing; in giving it he embraced me warmly, whilst his tears fell abundantly on me. What a happy moment! What a consolation was then granted to me in the sorrowful position in which I found myself, alone, in the midst of that interminable and fire-wasted plain\u2014surrounded daily by the dead and the dying. The recollection of this joyful meeting will never fade from my mind. His lordship minutely informed himself of the state of our poor sick Indians, and I on my part made enquiries relative to the incidents of the recent missionary expeditions of the good bishop, especially of his long and toilsome journey to Lake Caribou. Whilst thus conversing we arrived in view of our camp. Paul, my Indian sacristan, rang his great bell to assemble the tribe from their different lodges, to meet their chief pastor. The summons was quickly obeyed, and all who had strength enough to quit their lodges, came to meet their beloved bishop, who appeared as an Angel of Consolation in their midst. His lordship was deeply moved at the sight of all those poor heads, bent to receive his blessing, and of all those careworn faces on which great sorrows and privations had left their deep impress.\"\n\nThe good bishop went from lodge to lodge, to administer confirmation to the dying, and to encourage and console all the afflicted ones who came in his path. One evening, at a late hour, he entered a lodge, where he found a father and a mother, and an only son, all lying smitten by small-pox, without anyone to attend to them. The devoted prelate vol-\nunteered to become for that night, himself, their nurse and attendant; at the same time he acted as their spiritual father, and laboured zealously to prepare each of these poor dying ones for a happy death.\n\nHis lordship's duties compelled him to quit this scene of devotedness earlier than he wished. He left Father Fourmond sorrowful at his departure, but consoled and edified by his words and example. The miseries of the afflicted tribe now reached their climax. Winter was setting in, and they had made no provision for its rigorous privations. Hunger and death by starvation in the wilderness were staring them in the face. All were in rags and in bare feet. Their stock of ammunition on which they had depended for procuring food by the chase, was exhausted. With the crowds of sick and dying encumbering them, they were unable to push forward through the immense solitude that separated them from the nearest point where they could get shelter and relief. Such was their condition when Divine Providence came mercifully to their help. One day a large and heavily-laden waggon was seen to approach their camp. It was conducted by two strangers, one of whom asked to be led to Father Fourmond's tent. He was the bearer of a letter from Mr. Christie, a superior officer and member of the Hudson Bay Company, who was stationed at the Fort of the Prairie.\nThis excellent and charitable man informed Father Fourmond, that hearing of the privations and sufferings which he and the tribe he was accompanying were enduring, he resolved to come to their help by forwarding a supply of the articles he thought they most needed. Great was the joy of Father Fourmond in distributing the contents of the well-laden waggon through the lodges of the tribe. Amongst the articles thus charitably expedited were large packages of tea and barrels of sugar, and other requisites and delicacies for the sick, besides a plentiful supply of ammunition for their huntsmen.\n\nAlluding to this event Father Fourmond writes:\n\n\"Once again in my life have I been made to feel what a source of true happiness it is to make others happy, by coming at a timely moment to the relief of the suffering poor. Ah! if the rich of this world knew of the true and solid joys which are to be found in dispensing the gifts of charity, they would be induced to contribute of their goods so abundantly to the poor, that the question of the pauperism of the day would soon be decided.\"\n\nSuccoured by this providential help, the wandering tribe was able to continue its march through the desert, until at last, under Father Fourmond's guidance, it reached St. Albert's mission.\n\nWhilst amidst the forests and prairies, and along the wild shores of the great lakes, lying eastward of the Rocky Mountains, the sons of De Mazenod were engaged in fulfilling the missionary ends of\ntheir vocation. On the western slopes of these great mountain ranges, several bands of Oblate missionaries were similarly occupied. Almost contemporaneously with the origin of the missions in the Red River and Mackenzie districts, other missionary fields extending westward from the Rocky Mountains to the shores of the Pacific Ocean, were confided to the zeal of the Society of the Oblates of Mary. Such was the recognized influence which the Oblate missionaries had acquired over the Indian tribes inhabiting those regions, that we find in May 1864, the newly-appointed Governor of British Columbia appealing to the Fathers to co-operate with him in celebrating the Queen's birthday at New Westminster, by assembling in that place the tribes under their spiritual jurisdiction on the 24th of that month. We will allow Father Gendr\u00e8, to whom the Governor's application was first made, to describe in his own words this remarkable assemblage of Indians:\n\n\"Having received the Governor's message, I saw that no time was to be lost in forwarding his invitation to the tribes that were encamped at a distance, in order to secure their presence on the appointed day in New Westminster. I despatched a chief to all the camps that were within a radius of a hundred miles. In less than a week's time notice was given to all who could come. Our mission of St. Mary's was fixed as the place of rendezvous. The man fitted to take the lead on that occasion, and to organize those scattered bands into one disciplined army, Father Fouquet, was\nabsent. He was then on the shores of Isle Charlotte. But here Providence came kindly to our help. One night he arrived unexpectedly, and notwithstanding his fatigue, put himself at once at the head of the movement. The 22nd of May was for us a day of much embarrassment and anxiety. It was no easy matter to manoeuvre some three thousand savages, and to marshal them all in good order, to embark on the Frazer, and to arrange so as to have all their canoes keep well together on the river, until their arrival at New Westminster. Father Fouquet went before us to Westminster, leaving the conducting of the numerous expedition in my hands. On the morning of the 23rd I gave the signal for departure, and all launched their canoes on the waters of the Frazer. We paddled down the river until we arrived within a few miles of New Westminster. There we encamped for the night on the borders of a great forest. The following morning, at an early hour, everybody was on foot, and at the appointed signal all knelt in prayer. It was a touching sight to behold that adoring multitude of Indians. Religion, how sublime and beautiful thou art! How thou ennoblest these poor children of the forest, now rallied around thy immortal standard! The arrival of Father Grandidier at the head of five hundred Indians added to our numbers and to our joy. Father Fouquet also re-appeared upon the scene. Under his orders some seven hundred canoes are launched on the Frazer; sixty banners are unfurled, on which is emblazoned the Cross\u2014the sign of redemption. The oarsmen's song is intoned by our Indian pupils of St. Mary's, and taken up by three thousand five hundred voices. The hills and forests gave back melodiously the echoes of this multitude of manly voices. They disembarked at a short distance from the residence of the Governor. His Excellency came in great state to meet them, accompanied by some of his principal officers. Addresses were presented by three of the leading chieftains in their own language, which was interpreted to the Governor by Father Fouquet, who also\nwas the interpreter of his Excellency's reply. A hospitable repast, furnished by his Excellency, happily terminated the festival.\"\n\nThe happy ascendancy over the savage tribes of British Columbia acquired by the Oblate missionaries, of which the event just narrated affords a striking illustration, was gained by twenty years of self-sacrificing labours in their midst.\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nFather D'Herbomez, who was for many years Superior of the Oregon Missions, received episcopal consecration on the 9th of October, 1864. He was the first Vicar-Apostolic of British Columbia. The ceremony took place in the Church of Victoria, Vancouver's Island. His character as bishop did not alter the order of his labours as the devoted missionary. We will ask our readers to accompany his lordship, with us, on one of his episcopal and missionary journeys.\n\nIn the interior of British Columbia resided several tribes which had been visited twenty-five years previously by Bishop Demers, and shortly afterwards by Father Nobili, a Jesuit Father, who spent some months with them. In the long interval of twenty-two years which had elapsed since the departure of Father Nobili, they received no visit from a priest. The chief of one of those tribes met Father MacGuckin at Quesnell. He was overjoyed at the happiness of meeting a priest. He requested him earnestly to visit his tribe, and to accompany him-\nself on his return to his camp. Father MacGuckin referred the good chief's request to the bishop. His lordship promised that one of the Fathers, and probably himself, would visit the tribe the following year. In fulfilment of his promise, Dr. D'Herbomez left New Westminster on the 18th of April, 1868, to visit the tribe of the Porteurs, and other tribes of the interior of British Columbia. His companion on that occasion was the devoted and zealous Father MacGuckin, who is one of the most indefatigable and successful missionaries of British Columbia. His lordship was also accompanied by Charles, a Canadian half-breed, and by Sam, a young savage from Fort Alexander. These two latter were to act as guides and hunters. The whole of the first day's journey was performed in civilized country. They travelled from New Westminster by steamer up the Frazer to Yale, a little town situated at the foot of the Mountains of the Cascades. The rest of their journey had to be continued in canoes, on horseback, or on foot. After a ride of 250 miles, they put up for the night at Boston Bar. Here they were visited by great crowds of Indians, who had been informed beforehand of the bishop's approach, and who came to welcome him, to listen to his instructions, and to prepare themselves to receive the Sacraments at his hands. The news spread from tribe to tribe that the bishop was on his way. This\nled to his being met at different points of rendezvous by numerous bands of Indians, to instruct and exhort whom the bishop had to break his journey in many places.\n\nAfter travelling in this slow way for fifteen days, he reached St. Joseph's Mission on William's Lake, which mission was then in charge of Father MacGuckin. He continued his journey thence to Quesnell, which is a little town on the right bank of the Frazer, situated 350 miles from its embouchure. Till now they had followed the great highway of Caribou. Henceforward they will have to travel through a savage wilderness, through woods and marshes, and across many great rivers. Having left Quesnell, they journeyed on for some time until they reached a point where they had to cross the Frazer. The current of the river was very strong and rapid at that point. The horses swam across. Having no canoe at their disposal, the bishop and his party were for some time puzzled as to the means of getting across themselves. At last they discovered the hollow trunk of a huge fallen tree, which they succeeded in launching. Having deposited all their baggage and provisions in the hollow of the floating trunk, they cautiously took their own berths within the same narrow space, and then pushed off from the bank. With improvised oars they managed to prevent their unwieldy barque from being swept\ndown the river by the strong current, and they finally gained the opposite side, not however without getting a thorough wetting, for they were half immersed in water the whole way.\n\nHaving crossed the river they got again on horseback and rode for ten miles, until night compelled them to break their journey. They bivouaced in a plain called the Beaver's Prairie, where they were plagued during the night by a swarm of mosquitoes that prevented them closing their eyes. During the next two days they travelled through a great solitude, without meeting a single human being. Again was their progress intercepted by a giant river, whose wide waters crossed their way. Here they were not so fortunate as to meet with a friendly old tree, the hollow of whose fallen trunk would serve them as an improvised canoe, as had already happened. The instinct and experience of Sam and Charles, the Indian and the half-breed, came to their aid in this dilemma. A raft was skilfully constructed by the two hunters, on which the whole party, with their chattels, embarked. The opposite bank was not gained without considerable risk and effort. For a time they were borne helplessly along by the strong and rapid current. They had some moments of terrible anxiety, during which escape appeared to be almost impossible. Their frail raft was whirled round as a straw in the circling eddies of the rush-\ning river. They felt at each moment as if it were about to be wrenched to pieces by the strain put on it amidst the battling waters of the angry flood. If it struck against any protruding object it would surely go asunder. Swiftly as the floating bubbles on the river's breast, were they being swept onward by the mad torrent, without seeing any means of checking their descent, or of gaining either bank of the river. At last a chance of escape offers itself in the distance. A great tree stretches out a friendly branch from the side of the river, which they wish to reach. Will the current bear them near enough to it to lay hold of it and save themselves? Will the branch be found, as they approach it, bent down sufficiently low towards the surface of the river for a man to reach it? Such are the questions that flash in the instant across their minds. The eyes of the Indian and of the Canadian are fixed upon the drooping branch of the great tree. All their skill and agility are needed to enable them to seize it as they are being swept rapidly under it by the torrent. With quick and combined movement, Sam the Indian, and Charles the half-breed seize the projecting branch, and the bishop and his party are saved.\n\nThe first duty of the whole party is to give thanks to God for escaping from so great a peril. This being done, they renew their journey through the wilderness.\nThe following day they had to cross another great river. They found much difficulty in doing so, but they had not to encounter the same degree of peril as they had to face on the previous day. At last they reached the head of the lake Alka. Here they met some Indians who had come from George's Fort. These they promised to re-visit on their return, for their stock of provisions was running short, and they were forced to hasten forward, lest they should be overtaken by starvation in the desert. Their journey now lay through woodlands, which were interspersed with countless lakes. Monseigneur D'Herbomez was overcome at this point of his journey by sickness and fatigue. After some period of such repose as he could take on a bed in the open air, he rallied, and was able to resume his journey, which he continued until he arrived at Stony-Creek. Here he found a great tribe awaiting him. It was the first time the majority of them had seen a priest. The bishop and Father MacGuckin devoted themselves at once, with heroic generosity, to the arduous work of evangelizing this tribe. All in the tribe, with three or four exceptions, came forward to renounce, as they said, their bad hearts, to promise against intoxicating drinks, to give up the practice of sorcery, to lead pure moral lives, and to observe in all things the commandments of God. Notwithstanding those good resolutions, in making\nwhich they were quite sincere, there was one virtue of which they were yet sadly deficient\u2014it was that of generosity. Sordid selfishness seemed to be engrafted in their nature. This is one of the special traits of character of the Indians of British Columbia. The bishop was quite prepared for their asking payment from him for the services they rendered him during his stay among them, and also for the use of their canoes; but he was resolved, for their own good, not to comply with such demands. He felt he would be doing them a service by getting them into the practice of contributing, by their willing gifts and gratuitous labours, to the support of religion. He felt that by awakening a spirit of generous disinterestedness on their part, he would also stir up in their breasts the best instincts of the man and of the Christian. \"What!\" he replied to one of their demands, \"I have come a distance of 500 miles and more to visit you, for the purpose of instructing you and of helping you to save your souls, and you wish to treat me as you treat those white men who come here to gain money. If you act in this way, I will look upon you as the least worthy and most ignoble of savages.\" This discourse had its intended effect upon them, and thenceforward they willingly lent his lordship their gratuitous services, and the free use of their canoes.\n\nFrom Stony Creek he continued his journey to\nFort Frazer, where large bodies of Indians were impatiently awaiting his arrival. On his way thither he met with a dangerous accident. An ill-constructed bridge over which he was passing gave way under his horse's feet. He was precipitated into a deep slough, where he lay under his horse for a considerable time before he could be extricated. Having advanced for some miles from the spot where he met with this accident, he and his party found themselves enveloped in volumes of drifting smoke, with which were intermingled large quantities of flying sparks. Hissing and crackling sounds reached their ears, and the air was becoming too hot for them to breathe with ease. A turn in their way brought them in view of one of the grandest spectacles which the eye of the travellers could gaze upon\u2014a forest on fire. The flames ran up into the summits of the highest trees, and spread out in wreaths of fire amidst their branches. Huge secular trees that had braved the shock of centuries lay in ashes before them, or rose as flaming pyramids, lighting the skies with their lofty glare. The birds of the forest, driven by the flames from their shelter, circled over the heads of the travellers with rapid swoop, each uttering its own cry or chant of terror. The wild beasts of the woods prowled upon those spots from which the flames had receded, having done their work, or which they had not yet reached. The\ntravellers were too weary and too anxious to arrive at the goal of their journey, and the field of their holy labours, to spend time in contemplating this scene. On they hastened, diverging from the path which the fire was treading, just sufficiently to escape danger, or inconvenience from its proximity.\n\nAn abundant harvest of souls awaited their labours at Fort Frazer. Having completed their mission there, they set out on their way to Lake Stuart, to reach which they had to repass Stony Creek. On getting to this last-named place they heard that a young Indian, whom Father MacGuckin had baptized a few weeks previously, was then dying. To visit this young man they had to go far into the woods and change their plan of travelling. Before finally leaving Stony Creek, they had the happiness of reconciling to God all those, with one exception, whom they had failed to convert at the time of their first visit. At Lake Stuart they were received with great enthusiasm by an immense gathering of Indians. As nearly a quarter of a century had elapsed since the last visit of a priest to these poor savages, very heavy missionary work lay in store for the bishop and his companion\u2014Father MacGuckin. Great abuses had to be corrected\u2014superstitions eradicated\u2014polygamy done away with, and the whole tribe had to be well instructed in Christian doctrine. Having terminated their labours at Lake\nStuart, they proceeded thence to visit the extensive tribe of the Babines, who inhabited a district which lay at a distance of 170 miles further north. The Indians of this tribe are naturally cruel and warlike, but they are possessed of a good deal of intelligence and energy of character. The bishop was much pleased with the quickness with which they committed to memory the words of the catechism, and with the intelligence they displayed in acquiring a knowledge of its meaning.\n\nAfter a missionary expedition which lasted for five months, Monseigneur D'Herbomez returned to New Westminster, very much exhausted, but greatly consoled by the success with which God had crowned his labours.\n\nBishop D'Herbomez embodied in an able letter addressed to the Minister of Public Works, wise suggestions as to the line of action which he felt the Government ought to adopt in dealing with the Indian races of British Columbia. That important document finds a place among the State Papers of the Canadian Dominion. We gladly transfer it to our pages:\n\n\"LETTER FROM HIS LORDSHIP THE BISHOP OF MILETOPOLIS AND VICAR APOSTOLIC OF BRITISH COLUMBIA.\n\n\"To the HONORABLE H. L. LANGEVIN,\n\n\"Minister of Public Works, Ottawa.\n\n\"SIR,\u2014Your visit to this distant land has shown us what a lively interest the Federal Government takes in the Pro-\nvince of British Columbia, which, though the last annexed to the Dominion of Canada, will not, we hope, be the least productive of good results.\n\n\"You came to this Province to fulfil an honorable and important mission, and with that object in view you were pleased to see for yourself, and to examine everything attentively in order to acquire a better knowledge of individuals, and to obtain correct ideas as to the country.\n\n\"I believe that I shall meet your wishes and perform a duty, by submitting to you my humble opinion as to the most advantageous system to be adopted by the Federal Government in its relations with the Indians of this Province. I shall then address you on the subject of certain projects, which have doubtless not failed to attract the attention of the Federal Government.\n\n\"With regard to the system which might be adopted by the Government in connection with the Aborigines, opinion is divided; some persons speak of compelling the Indians of this Province, to collect on certain general reserves which would be set apart for them ad hoc; if I do not mistake, that is the system which the Americans have adopted in their dealings with the Indians who inhabit the territory bordering upon this Province.\n\n\"I am astonished, Sir, that those who know, or who have been in a position to know the deplorable consequences of such a system, can be desirous of seeing it adopted and carried into operation in British Columbia. It appears to me that experience has sufficiently proved: 1st. That if it is difficult to compel wandering tribes, who live in tents, to leave the land of their ancestors, to reside upon distant reserves, it is almost impossible to induce Indians who live in permanent villages to consent to leave their houses, their fields, and their burying places, to which they are as attached as to life itself. 2nd. That to endeavour to compel these Indians, against their will, to leave the land of their birth would be, at the least, imprudent and impolitic; such a sys-\ntem might entail misfortune upon the settlers as well upon the Indians; who can say that the latter, considering themselves molested, would not seek to avenge themselves, as has already occurred in the case of the Americans? It is true that the Indians would inevitably ultimately succumb, they being the weaker, but it is no less true that a war with them would entail an immense expenditure upon the Federal Government, and would retard for years the progress of this Province.\n\n\"It is an historical fact that the system adopted by the Americans in their relations with the Indians has cost them millions of dollars, and has been productive of barely a single good result. Who does not know that after the frightful wars which cost so much blood and so much money, the Americans were compelled, at least in the adjoining territory, to conform to the wishes of the Indians, and leave them upon the land which they had demanded? I take pleasure in believing, Sir, that the Federal Government would be unwilling to imitate our Yankeo neighbours and to take as their rule the law of the strongest, a law which in our day is but too much in vogue; I am satisfied that it will prefer to adopt a system which will prove more favourable, less costly and less productive of inconvenience, and which will at the same time have the advantage of securing for the Government the confidence of the Indians, and in that way ensuring for it powerful auxiliaries in case of war. To attain this most desirable end, it would be sufficient, it appears to me:\u2014\n\n1st. That the Federal Government should set apart in each Indian village, a reserve of land proportionate to the number of the inhabitants. 2nd. That a treaty should be made with the Indians for the extinction, at the earliest possible period, of their titles to their lands. 3rd. That the sum of money to be allowed to the Indians by the Government, should be applied to supplying them, annually, either with agricultural implements and others such as axes, large saws, planes, &c., or with clothing and blankets as they may require and select.\"\n\"If fears are entertained that certain Indians who still follow the old customs of savage life, would abuse such gifts, we are in a position to assert that a large majority of those who are under our influence, far from making a bad use of them, would derive the greatest advantages from them. The progress which a large number of them have already made in civilization, left as they were, so to speak, to themselves, proves what might be expected from them if the Government came to their assistance and took their interests to heart.\n\n\"It is the intention of the Federal Government, I believe, to appoint agents, whose special duty it will be to attend to the interests of the Aborigines. As an immense majority of the Christian Indians profess the Catholic faith, would it not be expedient that the local superintendent with whom they will have to communicate, should be a Catholic, a similar advantage being granted to the Protestant? The Federal Government will, I trust, be pleased to take into consideration the wish expressed by about 20,000 Indians, who are either Catholics or uninstructed, to have a Catholic superintendent with whom they may treat respecting their affairs. You will readily observe, Sir, that by complying with their earnest desire, a way will be found for acquiring their entire confidence.\n\n\"It is also, without doubt, the intention of the Federal Government to take some steps for the education of the Aborigines.\n\n\"On this subject I may here be allowed to remark that, for the present, day-schools for the Indians would entail great expense without producing satisfactory results. The fact is that the Indians have been in contact with the whites for too short a time to enable them to understand or appreciate the advantages of purely elementary education. Besides, being compelled to go upon hunting and fishing expeditions to provide food and sustenance for their families, they have not yet entirely abandoned their slightly nomadic way of life, so that it is difficult, not to say impossible, to exact\nfrom each child that regular attendance at a day-school which is necessary to enable him to derive real benefit from it. The parents also are not disposed to send their children to the schools, and the children are too fond of liberty not to prefer accompanying their parents on their hunting and fishing expeditions to attending to receive instruction. The American Government have established day-schools for the Indians in the adjacent territory, and not one of them has proved a success. Experience has shown that the schools which are best adapted to the wants of the Indians and to their way of life, are industrial and agricultural schools, where the children are lodged, boarded and clothed, and at which they spend several years in acquiring regular habits of order and discipline, and a taste and liking for work, while they receive elementary instruction at the same time. It is a school or establishment of this description that we have founded at St. Marie, in the mission district of St. Charles. This mission district includes the civil district of New Westminster, a part of the civil district of Yale, and a part of that of Lillooet. This establishment, which receives Indian children from the above-mentioned civil districts is divided into two departments, one of which, for boys, is under the management of two Sisters of St. Anne. Very satisfactory results have been obtained, but our means being very much restricted, we are able to receive but a limited number of pupils. If the Federal Government would grant us assistance, as we trust it will, and as we humbly request, we should be able to receive a larger number of children. It is also our intention, if the Government can extend aid to us, to found an establishment similar to that at St. Marie, in each of our own mission districts, that is to say, in the district of the Immaculate Conception, Okanagan Lake, which comprises the civil districts of Okanagan and Kootenay, and a part of that of Yale-Lytton; in the district of St. Joseph, William's Lake, which comprises a part of the civil district of Lillooet and that of Cariboo; in the district of N. D., de Bonne Esperance\n(Stuart's Lake), which comprises the numerous civil districts of the north-east; and in the district of St. Michael, which comprises the Kakouals (Fort Rupert District).\n\n\"I have the honor to be, Sir,\n\n\"Your very humble and obedient servant,\n\n\"A. LOUIS, O.M.I,\n\n\"Bishop of Miletopolis, Vicar Apostolic of British Columbia.\n\n\"NEW WESTMINSTER,\n\n\"29th September, 1871.\"\n\nA letter of Father Durieu* to his Superior, deserves to be quoted:\n\n\"A fortnight after my arrival in New Westminster, I was sent for a month to evangelize the great tribe of the Skeromish. It was for me a month of unspeakable consolations. Their bearing in my regard reminded me of the days of the apostles. Four hundred Indians accompanied me from village to village during ten days. Nature did not show herself always equally propitious. On certain days we had to advance under a ceaseless downpour of rain\u2014at other times we had to cut our way through virgin forests, where it was difficult even for the wild beasts to penetrate, for the ground was thickly strewn with fallen trees, and covered with brushwood. Often we had to travel over considerable tracts of marshy ground knee-deep in mud. One day I met a Government agent who had been sent to explore that part of British Columbia. He was surprised to meet a priest in a spot which he thought scarcely fit for wild beasts to inhabit. He shook hands warmly with me, saying, 'I am very much struck by your devotedness; some super-human motive must have led you to embrace a life of such hardship. If ever I do make choice of a religion, I feel I could not do better than select that one which enables you joyfully to support\n\n* Now Coadjutor Bishop of British Columbia.\nall the sacrifices you have to endure, for the instructing and the civilizing of these disgusting savages.'\n\n\"Ah! he did not know how Jesus Christ pierces the heart of His priest with the sword of charity and zeal. If He who was God refused not to give His life for us, shall we shrink, poor sinners that we are, from enduring some few privations in co-operating with Him in saving souls that are so dear to Him? In the poor savage we behold a brother whom we lead to the knowledge of our common Father. In hearing the words of our Gospel message, he awakens as if from a deep sleep, and cries out, 'I will arise and I will go to my Father.' All at once he renounces the evil ways he had inherited from his forefathers, and feels stirring within his breast the desire of Heaven. This holy readiness on the part of these poor people whom we evangelize touches me profoundly. All have embraced the practices of our holy religion. They have learnt to pray, and every day each village witnesses its inhabitants assembling for morning and night prayers in the principal cabin. On Sundays, besides the morning and night prayers, the Rosary is recited, in common, in the middle of the day. All willingly take the temperance pledge. In thirteen villages only three persons refused to receive the light of faith; these were three sorcerers. On the 13th of January, having finished a course of spiritual exercises, I heard of two poor pagans who resided at a distant village who were in danger of death, and who wished to be baptized. The way leading to their huts was very difficult and dangerous; several savages volunteered to accompany me. I chose six of the most robust. We embarked in our canoe on the Frazer. It required all the skill and vigour of the little crew to make way through the great blocks of ice that were being carried down the river impetuously by the strong and rapid current. We arrived at a point where two branches of the river meet. Here, frequently, huge blocks of ice struck against one another with terrible violence, driven into collision by the force of the\ncontending currents. To our horror we found ourselves being caught between two great masses of ice, floating swiftly, advancing from opposite directions, and threatening to crush our canoe in the instant into fragments. 'O Father, pray for us,' cried out the terrified Indians. At that moment two of the crew sprang upon the advancing ice, and succeeded in raising the canoe sufficiently out of the water to save it from being crushed between the icebergs. On that occasion we escaped what seemed, at one moment, to be a certain death. If our frozen lips could scarcely articulate words of thanks to God and to our Immaculate Mother, our hearts glowed with warm sentiments of devout thankfulness. Quitting our little bark, we took all our effects upon our shoulders, and continued our way on foot, through brushwood and deep snow. At one point we could only advance by trusting ourselves to the treacherous ice on the river; five, including myself, passed over safely; the sixth, who carried on his shoulders the portable altar and its appurtenances, felt the ice breaking under him; the seventh, who came to his aid, had time to rescue the case containing the altar, and succeeded in pushing it, without injury, over the ice, but he sank himself, with his companion, into the dark and foaming abyss. Being the last that had passed before the breaking of the ice, I returned to render what help I could to the poor men in the water, but they cried out to me: 'Do not approach nearer, the ice will break under you\u2014go back, go back quickly\u2014it is better that we should perish than you.' Happily one of their comrades succeeded in casting them a line, and thus rescued them. Scarcely were they out of the water, when their wet clothes froze upon them; and to add to our trials it was impossible for us to kindle a fire. How long that night appeared to me with those poor young Indians at my side, scarcely able to drag themselves along. 'Courage, my sons,' I said to them, 'think of God and of Mary your Mother.' At length we succeeded in kindling a fire, but this only increased their sufferings. For two hours the torture\nthey endured drew involuntary tears from their eyes and moans from their lips. I then expressed to them how grieved I was at their sufferings, but they made answer: 'It was for the Great Chief on high, and to conduct the Black Robe, the representative of Jesus Christ, that we gladly suffered all we had to undergo in this journey.' I arrived in time to baptize the two dying Indians. That night their souls took flight to the regions of the Blessed.\"\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nFather Chirouze, the missionary of the tribes that inhabit the districts bordering on Puget Sound, and whom the writer is happy to claim as a former fellow-novice, was one of the first Oblate Missionaries who reached the Oregon regions. The greater portion of his missionary domain was American territory.\n\nIn the letters of Father Chirouze to his Superior, he speaks of several striking manifestations of divine grace in the lives of many of the poor Indians whom he was engaged in evangelizing, some of which we are now about to place before our readers. In a letter to Monseigneur de Mazenod, he speaks of the conversion of a famous sorcerer, one who, for several years, had been offering violent opposition to the introduction of Christianity to the pagan tribes over which he had influence.\n\n\"A pagan chieftain, a bitter persecutor of Christians, was killed in a drunken brawl on the same day that he had appointed for the assassination of a Catholic chieftain. His friends, in their superstitious fanaticism, attributed his death to sorcery, and fixed the blame upon Siacasout, the sor-\ncerer or medicine-man, whom we have just spoken of, and whom they resolved to kill. The aged Siacasout, to save his life, cast himself on the protection of the Fathers of the mission. 'O Priests,' he exclaimed as he entered the mission-house, 'you who forbid the shedding of blood, have pity on me! I am accused falsely, and they wish to put me to death. Speak in my behalf and my life will be saved. If you hear my petition, I will for the future listen to your instructions to please the Great Chief on high, and to save my soul.' We spoke in his favour, and no one dared to lay hands upon him. He kept his word, and on the Feast of the Assumption we had the consolation of witnessing him renouncing publicly, in presence of eight hundred savages, his profession as a sorcerer, and all the foolish and wicked superstitions of his satanic art. In performing this solemn act, his attitude and words were so touching and pathetic, that many of those present were moved to tender tears of joy. Among other utterances of a similar contrite nature, he exclaimed, 'In crime have my hairs grown grey upon this earth, but they will return to their original hue in that bright land beyond the sky, where the aged bloom into youth again. Cost what it may, I am resolved to tear out from my heart the shackles of Satan. The God who pardons me will help me. I will devote to Him the remainder of my life, and He will receive my soul at my last breath.' Before he was converted he was called 'Siaca-sout,' which signifies one powerful in sorcery, but after his conversion he wished to be called 'Toukhapt,' that is, the true penitent. He renounced all his former wicked companions, burnt his books of sorcery, and the instruments of his unholy art. He became as humble as he formerly had been proud and haughty.\"\n\nFather Cherouze in a later communication writes thus:\n\n\"The spirit of charity has banished from the breasts of\nthose Indians the homicidal spirit of hatred and revenge, of which they were formerly possessed. Our Indian Christians know how to forgive their enemies, and to pray for them. A few days since an unhappy Christian, who had relapsed into paganism, in which he persevered for seven years, was on the point of death. His name was Peter. He had contracted a debt with an excellent Catholic named Leo, which he was unable to pay. Leo, who was more anxious about the soul of Peter than he was about the recovery of the debt, hastened to the bedside of the dying man, to urge him to repentance. Taking him by the hand, he said, 'Peter, my friend, you are going to die; take pity, I beseech you, upon your soul, and don\u2019t give it to the demon. If you fail in going to heaven, how terrible will your torments be for ever. Last springtide you attempted to assassinate me, but I will forgive you if you return to God. And lest you should be troubled by remembering what you owe me, I wish you to know that I bestow upon you the sum due to me by you. I implore of you not to die without making your confession.' Peter\u2019s heart was touched by those words, and he begged of Leo to call a priest to him at once. The latter hastened to the mission, and said to me, with an air of holy triumph, 'My Father, come quickly, Peter is dying, and he wishes to make his confession. He is moved to tears, and repents bitterly of all his wicked deeds.' I set out immediately to visit the dying man. Having reached his bedside, I found he had forgotten all his prayers except the 'Hail Mary,' which he recited every day. He made his confession with great compunction. Having prepared him for death, I withdrew. When I came to visit him the next day I found him dead, and Leo kneeling at his side, reciting the Rosary for the repose of his soul.\"\n\nFather Chirouze further makes mention of an Indian named Jacques, and of his nephew Felix. Both had become Christians, but Jacques had the misfor-\ntune of relapsing into his former unbelief, and of abandoning himself to a criminal life. Felix, on the contrary, persevered in the profession and practice of the Catholic faith. Grace worked wonders in his young soul. Extraordinary virtues appeared in his life shortly after his baptism. He was continually praying for his uncle. The earthly pilgrimage of this holy Indian youth was soon to terminate. A rapid consumption brought him to his death-bed. Short though his career had been, he had already drawn to himself the holy affection of loving and devout hearts, that now grieved at their approaching loss. Father Chirouze was constantly at his bedside during his last hours. \"My Father,\" said Felix to him after he had made his general confession, \"I feel now that all my sins are forgiven. Oh how happy I am. How good God is in giving me this assurance, that He has pardoned me. I shall not go down into the great fire, but I shall see Him who created me. I shall see my loving brother and my Saviour Jesus who died on the cross for me. I shall see my tender mother, the best of mothers, Mary, and my chiefs and protectors, the Angels. O Great Chief on high!\" he exclaimed as he was receiving extreme unction, \"pardon my eyes, pardon my ears, pardon all the members of my body for the sins committed by them. Mary, mother of poor savages, intercede for me! Angels of God protect me from the fiery spirits that wish\nto devour me!\" Felix died on the Feast of the Guardian Angels, the 2nd of October. Father Chirouze, who had assisted him at his death-bed, followed him to his grave. Jacques, the pervert, accompanied the funeral of his holy nephew.\n\nWe will allow Father Chirouze, in his own words, to describe what followed on that occasion:\n\n\"When pronouncing the last words of the prayers of the church over his grave, the tears which I had suppressed with difficulty, up to that moment, fell from my eyes, and God was good enough to cause this circumstance to become a source of edification to the crowd of Indians who were assembled around the grave. They were moved to tears themselves, in seeing a white man, a priest, weeping over the grave of a poor savage of their own tribe. Till then, Jacques the pervert, uncle of Felix, looked on stolidly\u2014but this was too much for his indifference longer to bear. He also wept, and wept more copiously and louder than the others. Grace touched his heart at the same moment. A voice seemed to say within his breast, 'It is true then, that there is a heaven, and it is true that there is a hell, and that we have souls that will never die. Till now I doubted it, to-day I believe it, for see, how the priest loves good savages, and weeps at their death. A man that weeps thus cannot tell me a lie. There is a hell, and I have been going there, fool that I was. I will change my course. I will go the Black Robe, he will help me to escape the precipice and to save my soul.' Jacques was faithful to his good resolution. That evening he came with tears to make his confession. His family who had fallen away, also returned to God with him. He is now one of the most fervent of our Christians, and delights in every good work.\"\n\nThe prayers of Felix were heard.\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nThe abuse of spirituous liquors, which works such havoc in civilized society, became the chief scourge of the Indian tribes of British Columbia, shortly after their first coming into contact with American traders. Tribe after tribe disappeared under the withering influence of this abuse. The checks and safeguards which exist among civilized men, to arrest the progress of this evil, had no place among the poor savages, who became exposed to its influence. Helplessly they fell its victims when once exposed to its occasions. In their mad frenzy, when under the influence of strong drinks, they committed horrible deeds, and perpetrated wholesale murders among themselves, and among the white population with whom they happened to be in contact. The American Government had to adopt high-handed measures to prevent their traders selling strong spirits to the Indians. But the religious influences which the missionary Fathers brought to bear upon the tribes which were under their guidance, were far more efficacious in uprooting the evil of intemper-\nance from their midst, than any state laws could be. Nearly all the Catholic Indians of British Columbia are total abstainers.\n\nFather Chirouze mentions a notable incident which serves to show how determined is the opposition of the Catholic tribes under his care, to the introduction amongst them of intoxicating drinks. He says:\n\n\"We are happy to be able to bear testimony to the fidelity with which our Catholics keep their temperance pledge. They hold whisky, and the American traders who sell it to them, in abhorrence. Last spring, a schooner laden with a cargo of whisky, approached the coast near the village of Madisson, where the Etakmurs were encamped. It remained for several days at anchor before the village. During that time several attempts were made by the traders on board to sell their whisky to the Indians. Some pagans purchased it and got drunk. The Catholic Indians, fearing the influence of bad example, requested the master of the vessel to withdraw from their shores. He refused to comply with this request. The chieftains of the tribe, in virtue of the authority they held in such cases from the American Government, took the whisky vendors prisoners, emptied the contents of the whisky barrels into the sea, and set the ship on fire. They afterwards conducted their prisoners before the police authorities, who condemned them to three months imprisonment and to the payment of a heavy fine.\"\n\nThe reverence of those tribes for the priest is very marked; and sometimes, as Father Chirouze tells us, it takes an extravagant form of displaying itself. He says:\n\n\"One day, Judith, who was a fervent convert, genuflected\nbefore me after I had said Mass. On my asking her why she did so, 'Father,' said she, 'you have just celebrated Mass. You have received Jesus Christ; He is now within your breast, and it is before Him I genuflect. Are you not a Sherk-siam-lasdegwad, that is, one who is the bearer of his God.' Thus she spoke, without knowing that St. Cyril had used the same expression in his own language. I explained to her that she should not adore the Holy Eucharist where our Lord was not sacramentally present.\"\n\nFather Chirouze mentions another most remarkable instance of the religious fidelity with which the Indians, who were under his care, adhere to their temperance promise:\n\n\"A young Indian, named Victor, was returning home from fishing, when he was met on the shore by a band of whisky smugglers. They were strangers in the locality. Their object at that time was to land some barrels of whisky on the opposite coast of a broad and dangerous bay that then lay before them, of the navigation of which they were ignorant. The weather was threatening, and the day was closing upon them, but they were bent upon gaining the opposite shore that evening. They could see the smoke wreaths of Indian lodges which were not far inland from the sea, rising in the air, and they judged that a large encampment lay there. If they waited till the morrow the camp might then be broken up, and thus they might be deprived of a chance of selling their smuggled liquor. It was blowing then a strong gale, and the sea had an angry look. Experience told them that it would be imprudent to venture to cross such a bay in such weather, without a pilot. They were in this perplexity when Victor's canoe shot in sight. On his coming ashore they approached him, with the request that he would consent to pilot their barque across the bay. The quick glance\nof Vietor detected the presence of the whisky barrels on the deck of the little barque of the smugglers. He was a good Catholic, and a pledged and faithful teetotaler. In his mind it appeared to him, that were he to consent to become the pilot of the smugglers' barque, he would be co-operating in all the evil that would result from the success of the unholy enterprise in which they were engaged. He refused to comply with their request. They then made him offers of large reward, still he refused. Enraged at his resistance, they seized upon his person, flung him into their boat and set sail, fancying that once they had him fully in their power, that he would not refuse his co-operation in helping them to gain the opposite shore. But still he remained passive. They struck him then violently with their oars until his blood flowed abundantly over the deck, but he remained firm as a rock in his resolution, and determined to die rather than do what he believed to be wrong. The storm all the time was gaining in fury, and the smugglers lost all control over their boat, and abandoned themselves to wild despair. But God's anger was soon to manifest itself in their regard. A huge trunk of a fallen tree, which had been carried down to the sea by the torrent of some great river, made its appearance amidst the waves. Its course seems pointed towards the drifting barque\u2014it comes rushing down upon it with terrific force. It has struck it\u2014the barque and its cargo are sunk. The smugglers are seen for a moment struggling vainly in the surf of the angry sea, before they disappear for ever. The floating tree having become an instrument of divine vengeance, becomes the instrument of a loving Providence in saving the life of Victor. Gently it approaches him, until he succeeds in raising himself upon it, and swiftly as his own canoe it bears him to the shore. This scene was witnessed from the camp of the Indians; they could render no help at the time of the shipwreck. With open arms they received Victor, and they carried him in triumph to one of their lodges. 'I endeavoured to save them,' said Victor, alluding\nto the unhappy men who had perished, 'but they disappeared so quickly I had not the time to do so.'\"\n\nFather Chirouze thus describes the circumstances which led to the establishment of his industrial school, which has proved a wonderful success, and one of the chief means of civilizing the district of which he had the charge:\n\n\"Father Durieu and myself had five or six little Indian boys under our care, to whom we taught their prayers and the elements of the Christian doctrine, to prepare them to receive Baptism. They became attached to us, and spent more of their time at our house than at their own home. We perceived that their conduct presented a very favourable contrast to that of their companions, who spent their whole time in the camp. By degrees their numbers continued to increase considerably, until the success of the undertaking attracted the attention of the American Government, which took it under its protection, and contributed an annual sum for its support. This sum, however, was insufficient to meet the increasing wants of the rising institution, and private charity had to supplement largely the grant of the American Government.\"\n\nInstead of allowing the little Indian boys to return for their holidays to the camp, he, accompanied by Brother Macstay, led them forth upon his missionary excursions in the summer season. He writes:\n\n\"We visited the Lamys and two other tribes who assembled for the exercises of the mission. In the course of two months we visited eight tribes. My little pupils on those occasions, by their example and edifying conversations, ac-\naccomplished much good among the Indians. Sometimes they acted as true apostles. I met lately a youth named Celestin, who, when a boy, was in the service of one of our Fathers. He was then leading a virtuous life; but since then he fell into grave disorders, and gave up entirely the practice of his religion. In early youth he and one of my older pupils were companions. This pupil set his heart on converting to a good life his former companion, Celestin. He prayed fervently in his behalf, and God heard his prayer. One day, after I had said Mass, and given an instruction in the chieftain's lodge, Celestin came to me with tears in his eyes, and kneeling before me in presence of the congregation, he said aloud, 'My Father, I have done wrong to the Great Chief on high; I have refused to obey his orders, and I have neglected your instructions. I followed the advice and example of wicked associates, who were leading me towards the great fire. I grieve now for my conduct, and from this day I wish to live as a true penitent. God has sent here to me a true friend, like an Angel from Heaven, to draw me from the abyss into which I have fallen. I am determined to follow his advice, no matter what it may cost me.' Celestin was sincere. He approached most humbly the sacrament of penance, contracted a Christian marriage, and became an apostle in his tribe.\n\n\"In another tribe, when all had gone to confession, a little boy about eight years of age came to ask me to visit his mother, who was sick, and who wished to make her confession; with which request I at once complied. When I had finished the poor woman's confession, and was about to go away, the candid child said to me, 'My Father, I also wish to wash my soul, for I love my mother, and I desire to follow her to heaven.' He knelt and devoutly made his confession. He did not wish to leave the prayers imposed on him for his penance long unsaid. He went immediately after his confession to a clump of trees, where he thought nobody saw him, but God. There he knelt, and stretching\nout his little arms in the form of a cross, he lifted his eyes to heaven and prayed like a saint. He struck his breast several times with great compunction, and wiping the tears from his eyes, he approached me. I witnessed all, and was deeply touched by what I saw. I wished very much to number him among my pupils. I asked him if he would not desire to come with me. He answered, 'My Father, I am longing to go with you, but who would take care of my poor mother if I were to leave her. She is very poor, and I have no brothers or sisters. My father was killed by wicked men. It is I who have to make the fire, and fetch water, and prepare the food.' I had not the courage to renew my invitation, but I must acknowledge I was much affected on the occasion. Thanks to the good Brother Macstay, our children and myself completed our long expedition without any mishap. All have returned home in good health, ready to resume, with new spirit, their labours and studies.\"\n\nWe give the following extracts from the second Annual Report presented by Father Chirouze to the American Government. Twenty-six little Indian boys had been received that year into his infant institution.\n\n\"Every day our children learn the catechism, which they translate into their own language, and they seem fairly to seize the meaning of its words. Some have made considerable progress in reading and writing. A certain number have mastered the first rules of arithmetic, and have acquired some knowledge of history and geography. As they complain that they do not always understand what they read in English, I have undertaken to compose a dictionary of Snohomish and English, and of English and Snohomish, for their use.\n\n\"Music is not neglected in our programme; our little In-\ndians delight in it, and it is a pleasure to hear them all sing together. Their ages vary from seven to fifteen. They are generally feeble in constitution when they first come to us, and they do not, as a rule, become strong and healthy until they have been with us for a considerable time. Children and parents apply to me in their sickness for advice and remedies. During the past three months I have myself vaccinated four hundred Indians.\n\n\"Feeling certain that the majority, if not all, of those poor boys will have to depend, in after life, upon manual labour as their means of support, I endeavour, in an especial manner, to train them up to industrious habits and a love of labour, and in particular of agricultural pursuits. The chief portion of our time is consequently given to manual works. They make their own clothes, and in turn everybody has to take his place in the kitchen to learn to cook. I have to take part myself in all their employments, to teach them how to work, and also to exercise a constant supervision over them. I hope soon to establish a similar institution for little Indian girls, which will be conducted by Sisters of Charity.\"\n\nIt will be gratifying to our readers, we are sure, to be supplied with information concerning the fruits of Father Chirouze's efforts to civilize the youthful population of the Snohomish tribes. At a date seven years later than that of the correspondence we have quoted from, we find Father Chirouze giving the following gratifying information, in a letter dated Tulalip, November 24th, 1872:\n\n\"Many of the young Indians who spent seven or eight years in our school at Tulalip, have found virtuous wives among the young Indian girls brought up at the school of the Sisters of Charity. There are now several civilized In-\ndian families here, who edify the whites and their fellow Indians by their good conduct and industrious habits. Among them are to be found farmers, carpenters, and shoemakers. They have altogether abandoned the roving life, and inhabit good houses, which they have built, and which they know how to keep clean and tidy. It is a pleasure to those who visit them to see how much they resemble a civilized population. Many of their children now take the places of their fathers and mothers on the benches of the two schools. These children are amiable and intelligent, and more easily instructed than others. They have been accustomed to say their morning and evening prayers with their parents, and they have learnt early to love Jesus and Mary. Besides those who were school children, there are a great number of other young people who do honour to the mission and to the reserve. They have built good houses at Tulalip, where they live happily sheltered from the temptations and occasions of sin to which they were formerly exposed.\"\n\nWe quote the following passages from a work bearing the title, *Vancouver Island and British Columbia*, written by Matthew Macfie, Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. We believe we are right in stating that the author is a Scotch Presbyterian Clergyman. This gentleman visited the district evangelized by Father Chirouze, and thus states his views and impressions of what he witnessed there:\n\n\"It should be mentioned, however, that in districts as yet comparatively uncontaminated by the evil example of pioneer whites, and favoured with the blessings of moral and religious instruction, gratifying results are visible, especially among the younger portion of the tribes. In South Saanich, a\nlocality with which I am acquainted, where a Roman Catholic priest is stationed, the morals of the natives have hitherto been in a tolerably satisfactory condition. But as that district is now becoming populated with whites, it were too much to hope that the Indians there should form, permanently, an exception to other native villages trenched upon by civilization. A farmer in that neighbourhood, in expressing to me his confidence in their honesty, remarked that 'one couldn't pay them to steal.' When near the village, one day, I met some of the people, and by the assistance of what limited stock of Chinook* I could command, endeavoured to ascertain whether they had any distinct idea of moral obligation. I began by saying, 'Nika pretre pe wauca copa King George men Sockally Tyhee. Mika Kumtux okook?' 'I am a minister, and teach white men about God; do you understand this?' A woman who was present thinking I was a priest, at once made the sign of the cross on her breast, and replied, 'Nowitka: Sokally Tyhee Siya:' pointing above with her hand. 'La pretre yauca nika wawa Kl\u00f3sh.' 'Yes, God is in heaven. The priest tells me what is good.' An old man volunteered the remark, 'Kl\u00f3sh tum tum nika. Wake Kl\u00f3sh Kapswalla\u2014wake Kl\u00f3sh Mamalush\u2014wake Kl\u00f3sh Pire Chuck.' 'I have a good heart. It is wrong to steal, or fight, or drink whisky.'\n\n\"Arriving at Cowitchin one summer evening, about eight o'clock, in a canoe, after a long day's paddling, I heard the sound of chanting proceeding from the native church, which was erected and supplied with altar furniture, chiefly, if not entirely, at the expense of the Indians. It was a log structure, about 50 feet by 20, and on a high situation. At some distance from it, in front, a huge wooden Latin cross stood in the ground, that sacred emblem being usually found in connection with Catholic mission stations. On entering\n\n* The jargon which forms the chief medium of intercourse between the colonists and the natives,\nthe church I observed a fr\u00e8re engaged in teaching some Indian lads hymns used in devotional exercises, which they sang with taste and vigour. On retiring they were careful to sign themselves with the cross. I visited the priest, who lived in a humble shanty adjoining the church, and I could not fail to be struck at the exemplary self-forgetfulness he manifested in his arduous work. He had lived there for some years before white men settled in the locality; and notwithstanding the utter absence of comforts, and even scantiness of necessaries that marked his lot, he seemed cheerful and contented. There was no disposition shown by him to put a brighter face on the results of his efforts than facts would justify. Indeed, for whatever favourable report I received, I was indebted to disinterested witnesses of his labours. I learned that on Sundays hundreds of natives attended religious service; that monogamy was generally enforced by him with success; and that in many other respects the morals of the people were correct. One case was told me of illicit whisky-dealers, who, attempting to land alcohol from their sloops, were driven off and their casks rolled into the sea. I fear we should look in vain for a display of similar zeal for the cause of morality and temperance in a white community of the same extent.\n\n\"In regard to the sign of the cross, to which so much importance is attached in the ceremonies of the Roman Catholic Church, the bishop of that faith in the diocese of Vancouver Island related to me a touching incident. When that right reverend Father first administered Christian ordinances to the Indians at the mouth of the Frazer, they were at variance with the Nanaimo tribe. 'The man of prayer,' as they termed the bishop, had occasion, about the time referred to, to visit the latter place in his episcopal tour after leaving the Frazer. Those from whom he had recently parted felt so edified by his counsels that they determined, at all hazards, to attempt following him. From some cause, however, they missed him; and as their canoes approached\nNanaimo, to their dismay they beheld their foes ranged on the beach, prepared to fire upon them. For some time they kept at a safe distance, and held a council among themselves. The conclusion arrived at by them was as interesting as it was pacific. They argued that if the enemy were faithful to the instructions of 'the man of prayer' they would understand the sign of the cross, return it, and allow them to land in peace. They accordingly stood up and crossed themselves, at which signal the muskets of the Nanaimo men were laid aside, and a cordial welcome extended by them to their Christian brethren. It was stated to me on trustworthy authority, that in consequence of Bishop Hills, of the English Church, when travelling in British Columbia, forbidding the Indians this mode of salutation, he was subjected to some disappointment and mortification. During one of his visits to that colony they mistook him for a Roman Catholic priest\u2014the only description of missionary they had known up to that period\u2014and adopted the sign of Christian freemasonry which has been alluded to. Mothers brought their infants to be baptized by him. But on discovering the Protestant bishop's opposition to their accustomed religious forms, they declined to receive the virtue of his episcopal manipulations, and withdrew from him as a dangerous heretic!\n\n\"I was much interested in being shown by Bishop de Mers a rude symbolic Bible, devised by himself for the use of the Indian disciples of the Roman Catholic order.\"\n\nThe following incident, which Father Chirouze mentions in a letter to Monseigneur de Mazenod, will show to what shifts this good Father was sometimes driven, in order to provide himself with suitable priestly attire, during one of his missionary expeditions among the wild Indians of British Columbia. We will allow him, in his own playful\nway, to tell the story of his difficulties in providing himself with a new cassock, to supply the place of a very old one which was no longer wearable:\n\n\"My cassock was worn to tatters, and I was forced by necessity to seek out some means of providing myself with a new one. This was no easy task in a country without cloth merchants or tailors. Having no cloth of any kind at hand, and nobody but myself to make the cassock, even if I had the proper material to use in its construction, I was forced to adopt an expedient of an unusual kind. I found I had a supernumerary blanket. This I resolved to convert into material for my own cassock. I succeeded, not in the most artistic manner, I confess, in cutting it out into something of a cassock shape, but to add to my difficulties I had neither needle nor thread at my disposal. Fortunately I had a strong pin and some slender twine, and by such helps I was enabled to connect the different portions of the cassock firmly enough together. Finding that it had not the proper clerical hue, I resolved to dye it, and I used some of the wild berries that were growing in the woods, for that purpose. But instead of dying it black they dyed it purple, and I found myself unexpectedly clad as a bishop. The next day I had an immersion in the lake, and the dye being washed out, I found myself vested in a white cassock like the Pope.\"\n\nIn the correspondence of Father Fouquet, we find the following incident related, which we quote as a testimony to the extraordinary influence which Father Chirouze exercised over the minds and affections of the Indians of British Columbia. Acting in obedience to orders received from their Superiors, Fathers Chirouze and Fouquet set out upon an ex-\npedition to visit the tribes that inhabited the northern parts of British Columbia. After a sail of three days, they arrived, when night had fallen, close to the shore on the borders of which the tribe of the Penelakrest Indians were encamped. They then learnt from their guide that the chieftain of that tribe had been massacred, a week previous, by some pagan Indians of one of the northern tribes. As a consequence of this fatal assault upon their chieftain, the whole tribe was on the alert, prepared for a fresh attack from the same hostile quarter. Though Father Chirouze and his little party were certain of the near presence of a large body of Indians, yet all was silent as the grave; no stir was heard, and no sign was visible to indicate that anybody was nigh. All the while the little boat and its crew were being narrowly watched from the camp. The approaching party were taken for enemies, and preparations were made to fire upon them as soon as they landed. All doubt as to the presence of an encampment was removed from the mind of Father Chirouze and his companions, by the barking of dogs, which they heard coming from the spot where they supposed the camp to be. They were on the point of stepping ashore\u2014one moment more, and a volley would have been discharged upon them. Instinctively Father Fouquet felt the danger, and cried \"Chirouze, Chirouze,\" a name\nwhich he knew was loved by the Indians. Presently he heard a friendly voice answering in words of joyful recognition. Without further delay the poor Indians cast down their muskets and rushed into the water, in their eagerness to meet and welcome the Fathers. They were loud in their expressions of delight at not having fired upon them.\n\n\"My finger was on the trigger, my Father,\" said a fine young Indian to Father Fouquet, \"when I heard you cry out 'Chirouze, Chirouze.'\"\n\nIn a later communication, Father Fouquet relates the circumstances of his journey to visit the Seeshelt tribe, and the part he had to take in the election of a new chieftain to that tribe. He travelled in the canoe of a brother of the late chieftain, whom he discovered to be a candidate for the vacant chieftainship. He was a good Christian and a kind-hearted Indian, but there was, nevertheless, a dash of ambition in his character, which made him covet very much the post of chieftain over his tribe.\n\nA rival candidate was in the field in the person of his nephew, the son of the deceased chieftain. Father Fouquet found opinions almost evenly balanced between uncle and nephew; the latter seemed, however, to be the more popular of the two. Both parties were willing that Father Fouquet should act as umpire, but he saw strong reasons for refusing to exercise this office. Yet the longer the settling of\nthe question was delayed, the greater would be the opportunity afforded for the kindling of bad passions, and the creating perhaps of permanent disunion and animosity among different members of the tribe. Already hot words were being interchanged, and several indications were visible that an internecine strife of a dangerous character was brewing between the opposite parties. The morning of the election came. Mass was said, at which everybody in the tribe assisted; special prayers in which all joined were recited by Father Fouquet, to implore the light and guidance of the Holy Spirit for the deciding of the important question with which all were then pre-occupied. Several hours passed without any final determination being come to, and Father Fouquet was apprehensive of the worst results following from the struggle for power between uncle and nephew. At last, help for the wise and pacific adjustment of the case came from an unexpected quarter. In the midst of the dispute the wife of the senior candidate, the brother of the late chieftain, came forward and addressed an earnest and well-reasoned discourse to her husband, to urge him to renounce his claims to the chieftainship in favour of his nephew, that harmony and peace might thus be established in the tribe. Her words were applauded by the multitude, and had the desired effect upon her husband. Like another Judith, this\npoor Indian squaw became the salvation of her people. It is needless to say that she was a sincere and pious Christian.\n\nFather Fouquet installed the new chieftain with much solemnity. At his bidding, all the Indians of the tribe promised fealty to the newly-elected chieftain, and the latter lifting his hand to heaven, in a loud voice declared that he would be always faithful to the trust reposed in him, and that he would ever walk in the path of justice and truth.\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nFollowing in the missionary footsteps of Father Fouquet, we find ourselves in presence of an immense assemblage of Indians, composed of different tribes. The Temperance banner floating in the air proclaims the special character of the great gathering. The usual devotional exercises being performed, forty-seven chieftains, accompanied by crowds of Indians of their respective tribes, come forward to renew the pledge of total abstinence, which they have been faithfully observing hitherto. The great majority of the Catholic Indians of British Columbia are total abstainers. About this time the Oblate Missionaries in that country found themselves called upon to discharge an extraordinary ministry of Christian charity. Several tribes of Indians were expelled from California, in consequence of the prevalence of small-pox among them. They took refuge in British Columbia. Their arrival, carrying with them as they did the seeds of contagion, was likely to become the cause of the spreading of the terrible malady, of which they were\nthe bearers, among the tribes of British Columbia. The Oblate Missionaries, who were ever on the alert to preserve the tribes under their charge from dangers to body as well as to soul, undertook personally the work of vaccinating the whole multitude of the Indians under their care. There was no one else to perform this work of charity in their behalf but the Fathers. Monseigneur D'Herbomez states that in one year, fifteen thousand Indians were vaccinated by them. By this timely exercise of charitable skill and devotedness, the progress of the small-pox among the tribes was checked, and multitudes of lives no doubt saved.\n\nFather Lejacq, an associate of Fathers Chirouze and Fouquet, makes mention, in his correspondence with his Superiors, of several striking missionary incidents, from which we select the following for insertion in our pages.\n\nA child of a minor chieftain of the tribe of the Babines fell seriously ill. A sorcerer, who had long resisted all efforts made for his conversion, sought the father of the sick child, to obtain the latter's sanction to his performing certain incantations of his art over the little invalid. The chieftain refused at first to give his consent to the sorcerer's proposal, alleging his unwillingness to act against the prohibition of the priests and bishop. The sorcerer was greatly irritated at this refusal; he scornfully\nlaughed at the fears of the chieftain to act in opposition to the instructions of the missionaries. He further denounced Christianity in scoffing terms. He at the same time assured the father of the child that the life of the latter could be saved only by the process of incantation which he, the sorcerer, proposed. The misled chieftain yielded at last the consent demanded of him. The wretched sorcerer, being allowed to have his own way, decked himself out with the quills of owls and eagles, and besmeared himself with red paint, which was mixed up with the down of wild ducks. He then commenced to dance around the sick child's bed, to utter wild yells, invoking the demon, and to work his body into horrible contortions. He then flung himself heavily to the ground. For a considerable time he remained perfectly motionless. This circumstance excited no special attention on the part of the beholders, as they looked upon it as being one of the rites of his art. At last somebody attempted to raise him up. It was then found that he had been dead already for some hours. Meeting his death under such circumstances, and whilst in the very act of invoking the demon, was regarded by those who witnessed it, and heard of it, as a visible judgment of God. The death of the chieftain's child followed quickly that of the sorcerer. These two events taken together had a very salutary effect in\nopening the eyes of many duped and deluded Indians to the wickedness and folly of sorcery. With the aid of such examples, Father Lejacq felt little difficulty in persuading that portion of the great Babine tribe, with which he was then in communication, to renounce from their hearts all practices of sorcery. Shortly after these occurrences he set out for Rocher-D\u00e9boul\u00e9, the head-quarters of the Babines. He was received with lively demonstrations of welcome by all the Indians who were then in the village. The great chieftain Telusa was absent, but his nephew Koularnet, who represented his uncle in his absence, gave hospitality, in the chieftain's lodge, to Father Lejacq. One day, shortly after the arrival of the Father, two young stalwart Indians of the pagan tribe of the Naaskas entered the village of the Babines, and hurried with rapid strides to the lodge of the great chieftain. Their faces were painted, and their hair, which was clustered in high tufts upon their heads, was ornamented with eagle plumes. On entering the lodge, they placed their guns beside them on the ground, and squatting on their heels, they remained silent for some moments according to savage etiquette. They then unfolded in the following terms the object of their mission. \"We come,\" they said, \"as delegates from our nation, to know whether it is to be peace or war between your tribe and ours. We wish to learn\nwhat your dispositions are in our regard. Three hundred of our warriors, who are ready for battle, are encamped at a distance of a day's march. They have sent us to say, that if you wish to trade with us our merchandize is ready, but that if you wish to fight us our guns are also ready.\" Koularnet, on the part of his uncle, the great chieftain, answered, \"Telusa is absent, but I hold his place, and in his name say to you that we wish for peace, and have no desire to quarrel with you. It is true we have some deaths to avenge, but the priest has spoken to us. You behold him here now at my side; we wish to follow his instructions, and bury all our animosities in forgetfulness, and become new men. We are willing to trade with you, and are ready to purchase your furs.\"\n\nThe delegates of the Naaskas then made presents to Koularnet, and the latter regaled them with a hospitable repast. They then took their departure. After the lapse of a few days, the Naaskas were seen to approach the village of the Babines in great numbers. They were hospitably received and entertained by the latter. The following day, at the invitation of Father Lejacq, the Indians of both tribes assembled to listen to a discourse from him. He spoke earnestly and at considerable length on the blessings of peace and Christian charity. Several marks of approbation on the part of his numerous hearers\naccompanied his words. After some days had elapsed, Telusa and a large body of the Babines returned to the village. Kialar, the great chieftain of the Naaskas, had also arrived. A solemn council of peace was inaugurated the next day. On one side were ranged Telusa and his minor chieftains; opposite to him stood Kialar and the chief leaders of the Naaskas. The crowds of both tribes were grouped behind their respective leaders. Father Lejacq opened the proceedings of the council by an inaugural discourse. The chieftains followed with fitting speeches.\n\nThe whole proceedings were conducted with calm dignity and order. One discordant voice only disturbed the harmony that reigned on the occasion. From the midst of the crowd a young man cried out, \"My brother has been assassinated by the Naaskas; when I shall have killed a Naaska on his tomb, I will sign the treaty of peace.\" After this occurrence a certain tumult prevailed for a time in the assembly. At last the young man yielding to the prevailing desire for peace, and to the exhortation of Father Lejacq, entered into better disposition, and declared his willingness to agree to the terms of the reconciliation which was being established between the two tribes. Father Lejacq drew up the treaty of peace, to which the chieftains put their signature by making a cross opposite their names,\nwhich were written by Father Lejacq. The following three days were spent by Father Lejacq in the charitable work of vaccinating all the Indians assembled at Rocher-D\u00e9boul\u00e9, pagans as well as Christians. The day of Father Lejacq\u2019s departure from Rocher-D\u00e9boul\u00e9 had now arrived. Though he started on his journey at the early hour of three in the morning, everybody was on foot to bid him adieu. All manifested unaffected grief at his departure, and begged of him to name an early day for his visiting them again.\n\nEarly in July we find Father Lejacq engaged in missionary work, surrounded by several camps of Indians. The news arrived that a great abundance of salmon had appeared in the river. For ten years the salmon fishing, on which these people mainly depend for food, had been a failure. A deputation from the different camps waited upon Father Lejacq to know how he wished them to act on the occasion. \u201cWe desire very much to catch the salmon, but we desire still more to listen to your instructions. If you will consent to accompany us to the fishing, we promise to attend to your instructions in the intervals of our work; but if you prefer to remain here, we will stay with you and think no more about the salmon.\u201d Father Lejacq was touched to tears by this display of self-sacrificing eagerness of these poor Indians to become instructed in the knowledge of\nGod, and of the means of serving and loving Him. \"To-morrow,\" said Father Lejacq, in reply to their enquiry, \"we will all go to the fishing. There you will catch your salmon, and I will speak to you of God.\"\n\nThere is no truth which the faithful missionary has greater need of keeping constantly before his mind, than the importance of labouring, not only for the multitude, but also for the *one* individual soul. He should be prepared, when the occasion demands it, to put forth all the resources of his zeal, to employ all the powers of his mind, to go to the full extent of all his capabilities of enduring the fatigues of long journeyings\u2014the sufferings of long fastings\u2014to brave dangers, and to face death itself, when one soul has to be saved; yea, even as though it were the salvation of ten thousand that had to be accomplished by him. The Saviour of the world, to gain one soul, undertook a long journey, which He pursued until He sank wearied and exhausted by Jacob's Well. All this He endured for the sake of that one soul that was to come to Him from out of Samaria. In working for multitudes, true zeal no doubt rejoices at the abundance of the harvest that falls beneath the sickle, but self-love may also find its gratification in working successfully for the many. If the *one* soul for which it fell to the missionary's lot to labour was that of a prince, or other grandee\nof the earth, or of some possessor of great wealth or great influence, then again self-love might find an inlet into the heart, even as though the multitude were being laboured for. But when the missionary is called by duty to go in search of a perishing soul in a far wilderness, whither no applauding eye can follow him but that of God; when it is the soul of some poor dying Indian, whose distant lodge can be reached only at peril of life or limb that claims his aid, oh! then a chance is given him of doing a work of pure zeal, without any alloy or earthly admixture of motive.\n\nWe have been forcibly struck ourselves, whilst making the researches necessary for the compilation of the present volume, by the frequent instances we have discovered of Oblate Missionaries exposing themselves cheerfully to extreme hardships and long fasts and journeys, with the knowledge beforehand that their ministry could possibly be of benefit to not more than a very limited number of souls; perhaps to not more than one soul only. We introduce these remarks, *\u00e0 propos* of a work of charitable zeal which Father Lejacq was called upon to perform when on his journey from Stellatishonie lack-water Creek. When approaching the place in his canoe, he perceived that signals were being made to him by three persons from one of the banks of the river. He found on enquiry that they wished\nhim to visit a sick Indian woman, who lay dying in a forest which they pointed out to him in the far distance. Having moored his canoe to the shore, he departed, taking with him one of the men who had accosted him, to act as his guide. They started at nine in the morning, and travelled for the greater part of the day up a steep mountain side. From the account given him of the state of the dying woman, he felt he should not lose any time in seeking to reach her; he consequently walked, or rather climbed, up the almost perpendicular flank of the high mountain, with as much quickness as the difficulties of his way would permit. The summit of the mountain was covered with a thick pine forest, which, to their dismay, they found to be on fire. Right in front stood out the blazing mountain, presenting a wide stretching barrier of flame, which effectually checked their further progress in a direct line. On either flank huge smoke clouds were massed. Advancing into the cloud of smoke, they found themselves buried in thick gloom. The guide lost his way for hours; they groped about in the darkness at the great risk of their lives, as many dangerous precipices were lying around them. At last they emerged from the smoke cloud, to discover that they had gone far out of their way. In the meantime, the dying young Indian woman was waiting anxiously for the arrival of the Black Robe. At\neleven at night Father Lejacq entered her hut. He found her in admirable dispositions. He instructed and baptised her. After her baptism, lifting her eyes to Heaven, she exclaimed, \"Now I die contented, for my soul has been washed and made white.\" In the happiness of contemplating such a death scene, the heart of the missionary speedily forgot the fatigues of the journey he had to perform to reach the place of its accomplishment.\n\nFather Lejacq, writing to Monseigneur D'Herbomez, speaks in the following terms of the Indians of the districts evangelized by him:\n\n\"These savages are divided into four distinct tribes\u2014the Porteurs\u2014the Babines\u2014the Holsofens\u2014and the Sikkenes. The country of the Porteurs embraces the Basin of the Frazer and its tributaries; the district of the Babines occupies the shores of Lake Babine and its environs; that of the Holsofens includes the Basin of the Skeena and of its tributaries; the regions occupied by the Sikkenes includes the Basin of the Peace River and its tributaries. Until these latter years, the officials of the Hudson Bay Company were the only white men known to these savages; but since the discovery of the mines in the Peace River districts, they have been brought into contact with the miners. This intercourse did not tend to benefit them, but they came much better out of the ordeal than I expected. I can safely say that, speaking in general, all the savages of the mission are well disposed, and have a real desire to become good Christians. The use of intoxicating drinks, gambling, jugglery, and other evil habits to which they had been addicted, have disappeared as it were by enchantment, under the influence of the preaching of the missionaries. Twelve camps have\nerected chapels which have been solemnly blessed by the priest. Three other chapels are being constructed. When these are completed, then every camp will have its own chapel. Our Indians are faithful in saying their morning and night prayers in common, wherever they may happen to find themselves. When they happen to be near one of their little churches, morning and evening the bell is rung for all to assemble in prayer. All the white men that have held intercourse with them, with whom I have come into contact, have been loud in the praise of those poor savages. And what seemed to strike these white men most, was their strict honesty. They not only avoid stealing, but if they happen to find any stray article lost or left behind by a miner, they run after him and hand it to him.\"\n\nThese lines were penned seven years ago. Let us hope that the continued intercourse with the white races of America, and of the British Isles, has not since then caused the Christian spirit of these poor Indians to deteriorate.\n\nFrom Father Marchall's report, dated 15th January, 1872, we glean the following items. On the 27th of the previous December he arrived, after a stormy voyage, on the coast of the district inhabited by the Shishel Indians. A loud detonation greeted his approach to the shore. Presently gleaming flashes lit up the lower slopes of the great mountains that stood in the background, and the echoes of discharge after discharge of musketry repeated themselves many times amidst the hills, whilst the arrival of the priest was being signalled from camp to camp. The effect was simple and sublime. But it was not\nthe exterior beauty and grandeur of the spectacle that riveted the attention of the devoted missionary as he left his canoe, and turned his steps towards the village of the Shishels. He was absorbed, as he tells us, in admiration of the religious sentiment which prompted such a display of affectionate reverence, on the part of the great tribe of the Shishels, towards the priest of God. As soon as he landed, he was surrounded by a large multitude of Indians. Everybody tried to shake hands with him and receive his blessing, but he had to withdraw very quickly from these demonstrations of respectful welcome. Duty called him to the death-bed of an aged woman, who was awaiting the blessing of the Black Robe, to depart in peace. The religion of the Shishels did not consist of outward display merely. Father Marchall bears testimony to their deep piety and sincere love of God. He was struck by their tender devotion to Jesus Christ in the Holy Eucharist. He found the practice existing among them of making daily spiritual visits to the Blessed Sacrament. This they sought to accomplish by forming the intention of adoring Jesus Christ in the Holy Eucharist, in the nearest church where the Blessed Sacrament was reserved, which was that of New Westminster. Owing to the long intervals occurring between the visits of the priest, they could not enjoy the privilege of having the Blessed Sacrament re-\nserved in their camp chapel. Their pious ingenuity, however, suggested to them the above means of practising devotion to the Holy Eucharist.\n\nMonseigneur D'Herbomez had instituted a system of public penances for public sins; for instance, for violating the temperance pledge, getting drunk, or giving great scandal in any way. These penances were willingly accepted by the culprits, and had a very salutary deterring effect in preventing them from yielding to the sudden impulse of evil passion. They very often came of their own accord publicly to acknowledge their transgression, and to ask for a proportionate penance. A certain Indian, who shortly before the arrival of Father Marchall, had allowed himself to be carried away by an outburst of angry passion, under the influence of which he addressed some insulting words to another Indian, came publicly forward in the presence of the Father, to acknowledge his fault. Casting himself on his knees, he said in a loud voice before all present, \"Henceforward I will watch better over my conduct; I will battle against my pride; I will be more humble, and I will never offend my God again.\" Another who had committed a serious offence, came forward before several persons to ask a penance from Father Marchall. He first knelt down and prayed silently for some moments; he then stood up and said to those around him, \"Let no one be surprised\nor troubled at the heavy penance I am to receive, I richly merit it; I unite my humiliation and sufferings with those of Jesus Christ on the Cross, and I accept without a murmur the penance which is to be imposed on me.\"\n\nAn American Protestant came one day to Father Marchall, to request that he might be received into the Catholic Church. On the Father's questioning him as to the motives which led him to make such a request, he informed him that his wife was an Indian of the Shishel tribe, and a devout Catholic. \"Frequently,\" he said, \"when she knelt to say her morning or night prayers, she used to ask me earnestly to join with her in her devotions. At last I had to acknowledge to her that I was quite ignorant of any form of prayer, as I had never been taught or learnt any. 'What!' she exclaimed in surprise at such an explanation on my part, 'you a white man! you who read the language of books, not to know how to speak to God! you to have no knowledge of the Great Chieftain who dwells on high!' These reproaches I felt were but too well merited, and they caused me seriously to reflect upon my state, and led me to the resolution of becoming a Catholic.\"\n\nWhilst following the exercises of the mission which Father Marchall was then engaged in giving, his resolution was strengthened by witnessing the\nedifying lives of those savages by whom he was surrounded, and who were also attending the mission.\n\nFather Marchall also mentions another instance which will give us a further glimpse of the heroic character of the faith of the devout women of the Shishel tribe. A young woman of that tribe was asked in marriage by a white man, who acknowledged to her that he was not a Christian. She replied that it was needless for him ever to expect to obtain her consent to be wedded to one who was outside of the fold of Christianity, and that it would be too great a source of grief for her to think of being separated eternally in the next life from one whom she loved tenderly on earth. Struck by this noble language on the part of a poor savage, the young man, her suitor, felt that the faith that had inspired her with such sentiments, must be true and divine. After further serious reflection, he resolved to embrace that faith. Father Marchall concludes his account of the conversion of this young man with the following particulars: \"I baptized him conditionally, and received him into the Church. That day he declared to me was the happiest in his life. He wrote to me, shortly after, a letter full of the best sentiments. He rejoiced in the happiness of being a Catholic, and asked me to send him some books which would afford him further instruction, and help to confirm him in his good resolutions.\"\nThis conversion was quite providential. In a few weeks after this young man had been received into the church, he took seriously ill, and died in the first fervour, peace, and holiness of his Catholicity.\n\nWhilst some of the Oblate Missionaries in British Columbia were labouring in abundant harvest fields, where fruits of holiness were ripening to perfection, amongst tribes already thoroughly christianized, elsewhere the missionary ground was being broken with difficulty and under many discouragements. There were tribes that had been thrown by their position into early contact with the worst types of white men, Americans and Europeans. Before the teachings of the priest could reach them, they were already poisoned in mind and heart by a foreign paganism more detestable in the eyes of God than their own.\n\nThe letters written by the Fathers who are engaged in missionary work among those latter tribes, form a painful contrast with those from which we have been hitherto quoting in our notice of the missions of British Columbia. The true apostolic spirit, whilst it suggests suavity of utterance and gentleness of bearing as the ordinary accompaniments of the intercourse between pastor and flock, suggests also at certain times a holy anger in which there is no sin when the hardened of heart have to be aroused and awakened to full consciousness. We\nfind the same Fathers who with one class of Indians had recourse only to words of kindly exhortation, employing the severest terms which their sacred character would permit them to use, in denouncing vices to which certain half-pagan tribes were addicted. A particular tribe, which seemed irretrievably abandoned to the worst forms of intemperance, was visited by Father Fouquet. He set before them in vivid language the heinousness of their sin, and addressed to them telling reproaches that startled them into a sense of shame of their conduct. He finally succeeded in moving them to a true spirit of repentance. At the close of his discourse, all the chieftains of the tribe retired to hold council together. They then came forward to declare to the Father, in the name of their tribe, that they would thenceforward renounce the use of intoxicating drinks. They also requested him to use his influence to put a stop to the trade in such drinks, which a neighbouring pagan tribe was illicitly carrying on, and which was a great source of temptation to themselves. The Father had the consolation of learning, after a considerable time had elapsed, that the good resolutions and promises they had made were being faithfully observed by the tribe in question.\n\nIn January, 1853, the writer was on a visit at Marseilles to Monseigneur de Mazenod who related to him the following incident, which the holy\nFounder said had been communicated to himself in a letter which he had then lately received from British Columbia.\n\nAn Oblate Missionary, Father Pandosy, undertook a journey through a great desert, accompanied by three Indians. The object of his journey was to procure, at a distant post, a supply of altar wine for the Holy Mass. The little party were on their return journey, when they were overtaken by a terrific snow storm. They were traversing a vast and gloomy forest at the time, and were still three days' journey distant from their home. Father Pandosy depended entirely on his companions, who acted as his guides, to be able to pursue his way back to his residence. The storm continuing to increase in fury, they resolved to bivouac on the spot where they then were, until the following morning. The next day, when Father Pandosy rose from his snow bed, the storm had lost little of its violence. On looking around, to his dismay he found himself abandoned by his guides. They had fled during the night, leaving him to his fate. Certain death seemed at the moment to stare him in the face. The snow which had fallen during the storm had obliterated every trace of a pathway, and there was nothing to indicate to him the direction he should follow to gain his home. Even if the snow had not fallen, he would still have deemed it to be\nalmost impossible for him to find his way without a guide. In these straits he had recourse to prayer. At that time there was much question of the definition of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception. Father Pandosy, remembering that he was an Oblate of Mary Immaculate, felt that, as such, he had a claim as Her own son upon Mary conceived without sin. He then knelt down and made an act of lively faith in the mystery of the Immaculate Conception. He concluded his prayer with these words: \"O Mary, Mother of God, as a proof of the truth of thy Immaculate Conception, deliver me from my present danger.\" Having a fine melodious voice, he then sang out in the forest the hymn, \"Ave maris stella,\" after which he prayed a little longer. He then rose up with the conviction that his prayer had been heard: It was so. To his admiration of God's goodness, and of the powerful intercession of the Blessed Virgin, he saw lying at his feet a pathway through the snow, where none existed when he knelt down to pray. It was there clearly marked out at his feet, as though some invisible hand had swept the deep snow carefully from its surface. That saving pathway failed him not for the three days of his journey through forest and prairie, up hill and down valley, until it conducted him to the known precincts of his home. He arrived safely at his destination, bearing on his willing shoulders the\nhamper of altar wine, of which he had gone in search.\n\nCuriously enough, when we were in the act of penning these lines, an old book fell into our hands which had been purchased lately by a friend at a book stall in Holborn, in which we find related by an English officer, in a letter written over a hundred years ago, a circumstance fully in keeping with the incident of which we have just spoken. The title of the book from which we are about to quote, is: \"Travels Through the Interior Parts of America; in a Series of Letters, by an Officer. Printed by William Lane, in Leadenhall Street, in A.D. 1789.\" The dedication of the book, which is addressed by permission to the Earl of Harrington, is signed Thomas Anburey, the name of the author of the work. The tone and diction of the passage we are about to quote, show that the writer was not a Catholic, and that he had but little sympathy with Catholic teachings or practices.\n\n. . . . . . \"Montreal, 16th November, 1776.\n\n\"During my stay at Trois Rivieres, there came down from the Illinois, several Indians of that nation, with an interpreter. . . . Among the group I observed one who had hanging round his neck the image of the holy Virgin, with our Saviour in her arms, which I thought very singular, as he was of a nation esteemed extremely ferocious in their manner, and whom the French Missionaries could not convert; but upon my enquiring of the interpreter if he knew the reason, he gave me the following account: 'In,\nsome skirmish, when the Illinois were at war with the Canadians, this image had fallen into their hands, amongst other plunder. Sometime afterwards a missionary, of which the French had great numbers travelling through the interior parts of Canada, to cultivate friendship, and establish their religion among the Indians, by chance met this person, and observing the image, was very much astonished; the manner in which he took notice of it excited the curiosity of the poor savage, to know what it represented, when the missionary, who no doubt was pleased to have such an opportunity of displaying his religion, told him that it represented the Mother of his God, and that the Child she held in her arms represented God himself, who had made himself man for the salvation of the human species, and explaining to him the mystery of the Incarnation, assuring him that in all dangers the Christians addressed themselves to this holy Mother, who seldom failed to extricate them. The Indian listened with the utmost attention to this discourse, and went away. Being out a hunting, soon after this, just as he had discharged his piece at a deer, one of the Outagami Indians, whose nation was at variance with the Illinois, and who was lying in ambush, presented his piece at his head. In this situation he recollected what had been told him about the Mother of God, and invoked her protection. The Outagami endeavoured to discharge his piece, but missed; he cocked a second time, and the same thing happened five times successively. In the interim the Illinois had loaded his piece, and presented it to the Outagami, who chose rather to surrender than be shot. From that time the Illinois would never stir from his village without his safeguard. There can remain little doubt but this circumstance was the means of his conversion to Christianity and the Romish religion, for he has certainly embraced that persuasion, as I followed him to the great church, where, upon his entrance, after crossing himself with the holy water, he fell upon his knees, and seemed to worship with as much devotion as the most devout of the Canadians.\"\nFrom this narrative we learn that God made use of the holy image of the Blessed Virgin and her Son for the instruction of the Illinois, that this poor savage, in a moment of great danger to his life, invoked her protection, and that his prayer was heard, and his life wonderfully preserved. Again, that through wearing the image of the Blessed Virgin and her Divine Child, and invoking her aid, he obtained the gift of faith, and became a devout Christian. The Illinois and the officer entered the great church of Montreal at the same time; the first fell upon his knees and worshipped, the latter stood erect and made his comments. By which of the two was God more glorified then? By which of the two is He being more glorified now, after a century and more has elapsed since then?\n\nBefore quitting British Columbia, we revisit en passant the fine town of New Westminster. We find an active work progressing there, of which the zealous Father Horris is the main-spring. The action of his self-multiplying zeal is felt in church, schools, convent, hospital, and prisons. A few miles outside New Westminster is the flourishing establishment of St. Mary's, which is a church especially set apart for the Indians. A large agricultural school is attached to this church. The devoted Brother Allen, aided by Brother Patrick, conduct a well-organized collegiate school in New Westminster.\nReturning eastward upon our journey in spirit, which happily requires neither canoe, nor sledge, nor horse, nor steam-car to traverse distances, we leave the Rocky Mountains in our rear, and shape our swift course to a spot often mentioned already in these pages, Ile \u00e0 la Crosse. We arrive on the Feast of Corpus Christi. An Indian procession of the Blessed Sacrament is being organized. Three triumphal arches are erected at appointed distances, under which the Eucharistic King is to be borne in solemn state. The tents and lodges of the Cree and Montagnais tribes stretch out into the far distance. Several large banners are floating in the air. The procession issues forth from the beautiful and ample church. It is composed of Indians and half-breeds. Men, women, and children all fall into rank, and move along reverently and devoutly, chanting the praises of the Blessed Sacrament. Their costumes are not such as meet the eye in the grand processions of European Catholic lands. There is a strange admixture of articles of attire on the shoulders of that moving crowd. The skins of wild animals, of the wolf, and bear, and badger, intermingle with patches woven in the looms of Yorkshire, and with shreds of the calicoes of Manchester. But look into their faces! There you behold worship. Through the dusky lines of those unaffected countenances you may see issuing forth, in luminous\nevidence, rays of that living Eucharistic faith which burns and shines within their breasts. These simple children of woods and prairies are at this hour, by such display of Eucharistic belief and fervour, making compensation, under the eyes of God, for the checks and restraints raised, alas! in certain Catholic lands to such manifestations, as theirs, of Blessed Sacrament worship. As the ocean when encroached upon along one line of coast-way loses thereby nothing of its vastness, for it forms other beds for its displaced waters on the opposite shores, so with the ocean-tide of Eucharist worship; if in one place it is forced to recede before artificial barriers raised by the hand of man, to other coasts it hastens to pile up its undiminished waters upon higher shore lines. Thus the public chants of the Eucharistic homage, when hushed by human agency in one land, break forth elsewhere as the voice of many waters rising before the throne of the Sacramental King\u2014the Lamb that was slain and is alive.\n\nSuch reflections we are forced to make as we assist, in spirit, with the Crees and Montaignais Indians in the procession of the Blessed Sacrament, on the Feast of Corpus Christi, 1876. The procession advanced over paths that were strewn with flowers, dropped by fingers of tiny Indian youths and maidens, along the shores of the beautiful lake that washes the mission grounds. It passes through\nthe Indian camp. At the door of many a tent knelt some aged, infirm and home-ridden worshipper, to receive the passing blessing of Him who still goes about doing good. At last the procession reached the level summit of a little hillock, which commanded an extended view of the Great Prairie, and where an \"Altar of Repose\" was erected, from which Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament was given to the kneeling multitude. Father Leggeard, who officiated on that occasion, could conceal with difficulty, as he tells us, his deep emotion as he contemplated the scene before him, and gazed upon that adoring crowd of fervent worshippers\u2014poor children of the forest\u2014and upon that vast prairie, extending into boundless space, and upon the mission church and house, casting their shadows across the calm waters of the great lake; and as he listened to holy hymns which were being sung to the praise of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament, over plains that had resounded erst-while with wild beasts' howl, or with wild warrior's war-whoop; or with croaking chant of sorcerer, \"May God,\" he exclaimed, \"be ever thanked for this change, and for having employed our humble society of missionaries in teaching those poor savages to serve and love Him!\"\n\nBefore we quit the diocese of Monseigneur Grandin on our return journey, we would call attention to a circumstance which proves the esteem in which\nthat devoted prelate is held by the public authorities of the Canadian Dominion. The circumstance to which we allude is, that the Government have given the name of \"Grandin\" to a large district in Saskatchewan, near Fort Carlton, out of respect for the venerable bishop who bears that name, and in testimony of the great services rendered by him to society in those parts, during his long years of missionary and episcopal labours there.\n\nWe now ask our readers to accompany us to Winnipeg, the capital of Manitoba. We should remind them that in 1870 the Red River regions were erected into a Province of the Canadian Dominion, and received the title of Manitoba. Winnipeg stands at the confluence of the Red River and Assiniboine River, and promises to become, at no distant date, a large and prosperous city. Here we meet again Father Lacombe, who, in the interim has completed his great literary work, the first Dictionary and Grammar of the Cree language ever composed. We find him at the head of a community of Oblate Missionaries. Four missionary outposts depend upon the centre establishment at Winnipeg\u2014St. Charles's, which is ten miles from Winnipeg\u2014St. Laurent's, which is situated on the borders of Lake Manitoba\u2014St. Florent's, which is on the Lake Qu'Appele\u2014and a missionary station which is located near a spot where important works in connection with the Great Pacific Railway are in\nprogress. The regions encircling Winnipeg, and those stretching from that point far away to the west, are capable, by cultivation, of becoming highly productive. Certain favoured spots in those regions open to the eye vistas of some of nature's loveliest and grandest scenery, though three-fourths of the north-west territory will ever remain as we described it, barren and desolate.\n\nOn the morning of September the 29th, 1877, there was an unusual stir in the streets of Winnipeg. The new city was in holiday garb. The Governor-General of Canada, Lord Dufferin, and Lady Dufferin, were being feted on that day in Winnipeg, on the occasion of their visit to that city. From the statesman-like, witty, and eloquent speech delivered on that occasion by Lord Dufferin, we purpose to make some extracts. They will serve to corroborate what we have already stated concerning the fertility of certain regions of Manitoba, and the great beauty of some localities there, and concerning also the vast distances that have to be traversed by those whom duty, as in the case of missionaries, obliges to penetrate into the interior, or to pass from limit to limit of that scarcely-known and almost boundless wilderness. Lord Dufferin describes a traveller coming from the Lake of the Woods on his way to Winnipeg. He says:\n\n\"For the last eighty miles of his voyage he will continue\nhis journey through a succession of land-locked channels, the beauty of whose scenery, while it resembles, certainly excels the far-famed Thousand Islands of the St. Lawrence. From this lacustrian paradise of sylvan beauty we are able at once to transfer our friend to the Winnipeg, a river whose existence, in the very heart of the continent, is in itself one of nature's most extraordinary miracles, so beautiful and varied are its rocky banks; its tufted islands, so broad, so deep, so fervid is the volume of its waters, the extent of their lake-like expansions, and the tremendous power of their rapids. At last let us suppose we have landed our traveller at the town of Winnipeg, the half-way house of the continent, the capital of the Prairie Province, and I trust the future 'umbilicus' of the Dominion.\n\n\"Having had so much of water, having now reached the home of the buffalo, like the extenuated Falstaff, he naturally 'babbles of green fields,' and careers in imagination over the primeval grasses of the prairie. Not at all. Escorted by Mr. Mayor and his town council, we take him down to your quay and ask him which he will ascend first, the Red River or the Assiniboine, the one five hundred miles long, the other four hundred and eighty, which so happily mingle their waters within your city limits. After having given him a preliminary canter up these respective rivers, we take him off to Lake Winnipeg, an inland sea three hundred miles long and upwards of sixty broad, during the navigation of which, for many a weary hour, he will find himself out of sight of land, and probably a good deal more sea-sick than ever he was on the Atlantic. At the northwest angle of Lake Winnipeg he hits upon the mouth of the Saskatchewan, the gateway and high road to the north-west, and the starting point to another fifteen hundred miles of navigable water, flowing nearly due east between its alluvial banks. Having now reached the Rocky Mountains, our 'ancient mariner,' for by this time he will be quite entitled to such an appellation, knowing that water cannot run up hill, feels\ncertain that his aquatic experiences are concluded. He was never more mistaken. We immediately launch him upon the Athabasca and Mackenzie rivers, and start him on a longer trip than any he has yet undertaken, the navigation of the Mackenzie alone exceeding two thousand five hundred miles. If he survives this last experience, we wind up his peregrinations by a concluding voyage of one thousand four hundred miles down the Frazer; or if he prefers it, the Thompson River to Victoria, in Vancouver, whence, having previously provided him with a return ticket for that purpose, he will probably prefer getting home via the Canadian Pacific. Now in this enumeration, those who are acquainted with the country are aware, for the sake of brevity, I have omitted thousands of miles of other lakes and rivers, which water various regions of the north-west, the Qu'Appelle River, the Belly River, Lake Manitoba, Lake Winnipegosis, Shoal Lake, &c., &c., along whose interminable banks I might have dragged, and finally exterminated, our way-worn guest.\n\n\"But in contemplating the vistas thus opened to our imagination, we must not forget that there ensues a corresponding expansion of our obligations. For instance, unless great care is taken, we shall find as we move westwards, that the exigencies of civilization may clash injuriously with the prejudices and traditional habits of our Indian fellow-subjects. Against this contingency it will be our most urgent and imperative duty to take timely precautions, by enabling the red man, not by any undue pressure, or hasty or ill-considered interferences, but by precept, example, and suasion, by gifts of cattle and other encouragements, to exchange the precarious life of a hunter for that of a pastoral, and eventually that of an agricultural people.\"\n\nFor a quarter of a century before Lord Dufferin gave this admirable counsel, the Oblate Missionaries\nin the far north were engaged in carrying out the rules prescribed to them by their Founder, to be followed in the work of civilizing the Indian tribes among whom they were to labour. Upon these points there is a remarkable identity of view between the instructions given by Monseigneur de Mazenod to his missionaries, and the wise counsels addressed to his hearers by the Governor-General of Canada, on the occasion of his first visit to the capital of Manitoba.\n\nBefore Lord Dufferin\u2019s arrival at Winnipeg, he had already visited the town of St. Boniface, where he was received by Archbishop Tach\u00e9. In replying to the address presented to him by the Archbishop, Lord Dufferin spoke highly of the civilizing zeal of the Catholic clergy of Canada, and made special reference to the labours of the missionaries of the Red River. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is no country where the success of Catholic missionaries, in promoting the interests of civilization, has been more remarkable, or has struck deeper roots into the soil than here in Manitoba.\u201d He further spoke of his happiness at meeting Archbishop Tach\u00e9, for whom, he said, he entertained a lively friendship and a profound esteem, amidst the scenes of his Grace\u2019s long and extraordinary labours.\n\nAbout the same time, on the banks of the St. Lawrence, at the Indian town of Canghnawaga, the\ngreat tribe of the Iriquois were assembled, accompanied by Father Burtin, to meet the Apostolic Delegate, the Bishop of Ardagh. Father Antoine, Provincial of the Oblates of Canada, who for nine years had exercised an Apostleship among that tribe, acted as interpreter on that interesting occasion. We may judge of the important work which is being carried on in the Oblate Churches of St. Pierre at Montreal, and St. Sauveur at Quebec, by the statement of one item. The average of the annual Communions in the former church is 75,000, and in the latter it is 85,000.\n\nThe Oblate Fathers at Lowell lately opened one of the finest churches in the United States.\n\nWe close our present volume with these lines, hoping, with God's blessing, to have an opportunity at some future day of publishing further accounts of the missionary labours of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate in other distant lands, and also in places nearer home. But the main drift of our future volume will be to complete our sketches of the life of the holy Founder, Monseigneur de Mazenod.\n\nEND OF VOL.
