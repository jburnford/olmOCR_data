I advised him to check with the Agency Superintendent in regards to their application and to be sure to receive affidavits which I understand have been given into the keeping of Mr. Meek at Whitehorse. However Mr. Meek will be answering your letter and you'll have the latest information from him.\n\nAlthough your letter is addressed to Mr. Meek I shall also advise Principal Stanger to compile his quarterly returns as your letter suggests.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHGC/PAL\nSuperintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nReference your letter of 20th instant, file 904-10 (E6) and Carcross Residential School.

Clark, Stikine Agency, as these three boys belonged to the Stikine Agency.\n\nMr. Clark now advises me that he forwarded Applications for Admission to you on October second, per your instructions of September 11th. Also forwarded was statement of George James, father of the three boys, and witnessed by Matthew Watson, Commissioner for Taking Oaths and affidavits in the Yukon Territory, to the effect that he, George James, wished to send his children to the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nI have forwarded copy of your letter to the Principal Carcross Residential School, as per your instructions.\n\nc.c.

She formerly attended Carcross Residential School, but was transferred to Whitehorse as her father was working here.\n\nHowever, the mother, Martha Silas was admitted to the Charles Cassell Hospital in January 1951 with far advanced pulmonary tuberculosis, Dr. Falconer has recently reported \"she has far advanced disease and the outcome is still in doubt\". In the meantime Davis Silas, who has the reputation of being a steady and reliable worker, has obtained permanent employment at the Carcross Residential School.\n\nAs is only natural, he wishes to be near his children, especially since his wife's hospitalization. I attach a written request signed by David Silas asking that Christina and Pearl Silas be transferred to the Carcross School. Both Rev. Lee and Rev. Stanger are agreeable to the move though neither like transferring children in mid-term. I have interviewed David Silas who is very sincere in his desire to have his children with him at Carcross Residential School. I hesitate to recommend the transfer from an educational point of view, but from the purely humane angle I would suggest the two children be allowed to be with their father - particularly in view of the mother's condition.\n\nc.c.

When David Silas, the father of Christina, was employed at Whitehorse he requested that his daughter be transferred from Carcross Residential School to Whitehorse. He signed an Application for Admission form, and after the summer holidays he placed her in the Whitehorse school. Though somewhat delayed this Application for Admission form was submitted to you with my letter of December 15th.\n\nIn the meantime David Silas has obtained permanent employment at Carcross. He now wishes his daughter transferred from Whitehorse school to Carcross Residential School. As the child has been attending Whitehorse School since the beginning of the term I presumed she should be officially admitted to the School, then, with your approval, discharged. The father is then willing to sign another Application for Admission to the Carcross Residential School.\n\nI trust the above explanation clarifies the case.\n\n(R.J.

Citizenship & Immigration, OTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing herewith an application received from Supt. Meek of the Yukon Agency with regard to the admission of Kenneth Johnson native of the Atlin-Teslin Band to the Carcross Residential School, together with a statement signed by the father of the child to this effect.\n\nKenneth Johnson attended the Mission School at Whitehorse, Y.T. during the latter part of the 1951 academic year and wishes his son to attend the Carcross School for further studies.\n\nMay favourable consideration be granted in this instance?\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nEnc.\nFebruary 11, 1952\n\nMr. R.J. Meek,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.,\n\nI have an application submitted by Superintendent Clark for Kenneth Johnson, whose father wishes him to be admitted to the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nThe application form indicates that the religious denomination is Roman Catholic and that the boy attended the Whitehorse Mission School for four months. We have checked the Returns for the Whitehorse school and fail to find any indication that we are paying for his stay at this school. It is presumed, therefore, that he attended school on a day school basis.\n\nWe are not clear why he should now be admitted to the Carcross Residential School. Furthermore, even if there was a necessity for admitting him to the Carcross school his admission could not be approved due to the fact that he is a Roman Catholic. He could be admitted to the Lower Post school provided the need for institutional care exists.\n\nIt is noted that his name is entered on the Carcross Return. In view of the fact that his admission to this school has not been approved his name will be deleted from future Returns and no grant will be allowed.\n\nPlease advise the Principal in this regard. In the meantime, this pupil should be taken out of the Carcross school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Citizenship & Immigration, OTTAWA.\n\nFurther to your letter of November 2nd 1951 regarding the admission of Paddy, Jimmy & Albert James of the Atlin-Tealin Band to the Carcross Indian Residential School, the following is reported.\n\nIn order to definitely establish that the father George James expressed his sincere wishes that his children be enrolled at the Carcross School the reply to your letter was held in abeyance until the writer completed a winter inspection of the Carcross area during the month of December last.\n\nIt was learned that Mr. Matthew Watson who witnessed the signing of this parent's signature was a Commissioner for Oaths in and for the Yukon Territory and that he did fully explain the meaning of the affidavit to the parent before taking the oath that it was his wish to have the children enrolled at the Carcross School.\n\nIt is understood, that before the Lower Post Residential School was completed, James intended to send his children to this school when it was completed. However in recent months he had a dispute with Father Engel, O.M.I., of the Atlin Mission and as a result decided emphatically to send his children to the Carcross School rather than Lower Post. There is no doubt in the opinion of this office that James' declaration was understood by him and that it is now his wish to send the children to the Carcross School.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, may their admission to this school be approved?\n\nF.

C.T.

David's trapline is located some 25 miles up the Little Salmon River, and 45 miles from Carmacks. Whenever the family is in Carmacks - possibly between two and four months during the summer time - the children attend the Carmacks Day School.\n\nGarry Jimmy Sam, son of Jack Sam, 032, Selkirk Band, who has a trapline some 40 miles up from Selkirk on the Pelly River, and approximately 80 miles from Carmacks. This family usually spends the summer in and about Carmacks and during this time the children attend Carmacks Indian Day School.\n\nThe maximum yearly schooling the above children receive would be about four months, the average would be somewhat less, possibly about three months. It is felt that more adequate schooling can be given at a residential school and I would recommend their admittance to Carcross Residential School.\n\n(R.J.

Indian Agency,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.,\n\nWith reference to your letter of March 22nd regarding the admission of Kenneth Johnson to the Carcross Indian Residential School, we have carefully reviewed the correspondence on this case and the Department's ruling is that in view of the fact that his religious denomination is Roman Catholic his admission to the Carcross Indian Residential School is denied.\n\nThis case is similar to the James children, whose admission to the Carcross school has been denied for the next academic year by our official letter of February 29th signed by the Director. The Department is paying the grant for them for this year because they were already at the school when a decision on their admission was made. However, in the case of Kenneth Johnson he must not be placed in the Carcross school or any other school without securing the necessary authority.\n\nIf the parents are interested in placing Kenneth Johnson in a residential school, the Department will consider an application for his admission to the Lower Post school, but under no circumstances must he be placed in the Carcross school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nReference letter February 23, 1952, File 940-10 (E6), the parents of Kenneth Johnson live at Bennett, B.C.

During the summer holidays Charlie Louis was taken by Carcross School car to Mayo where he stayed with friends.\n\nWhen the Carcross School bus came to pick up the various pupils from that area at the end of August, Charlie Louis was sick in hospital. Miss Hellaby, Indian Day School teacher now writes that Charlie is out of hospital and should be at Carcross School as he has no one to care for him. When Charlie was first sent to the school his fare was paid from Departmental funds. He is 14 years old, and requires institutional care.\n\nI have advised Miss Hellaby that he would be considered a welfare problem and I would arrange for transportation to Carcross School.

It would be appreciated if you would return this document to the Principal instructing him to indicate opposite the child's name the date this pupil returned to school if he returned late and the period of absence due to truancy if the pupil was absent after returning to school September 1st.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEncl:\nMFT/HM\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nReference your letter of 10th instant, your file 940-10 (E6), and Charlie Louis, 017, Mayo Band.\n\nThis boy has been a grant-earning pupil at the Carcross School since February 12th, 1947, and appears on all Carcross Quarterly Returns since that time.

Eddie Boss, 152, age 15, Grade 6, Carcross Residential School, is shown in attendance for 62 days, during summer vacation, in accordance with instructions issued by the Department.\n\nAround the end of the summer vacation, Eddie Boss was employed by S. Veerman, rancher and farmer near Carcross. Due to a critical shortage of suitable labour, Mr. Veerman has requested Rev. C.T.

The examination covers a period of one year dating from October 1st, 1935, to September 30th, 1936.\n\nThis school is situated in the Yukon territory and, on account of its isolated position, has always been very expensive to operate.\n\nThe total Per Capita Grant earned for the year amounted to $9,280.00 and refunds of $329.39 were received from the Department.\n\nThe expenditures amounted to $14,671.85, which is $600.00 above last year. Like all small schools, the salaries are nearly 50% of the grant and it is very hard to make a reduction in staff and still maintain the required standard of efficiency.\n\nAn examination of the vouchers shows that, although all supplies are purchased by the Commission in Winnipeg at the same price as other schools, the freight amounts to the cost of the product.\n\nVouchers were examined and compared to synoptic entries and postings of monthly totals were checked to ledger.\n\nThe farming operations show only three acres under cultivation, which is used as a garden. The livestock consist of seven head of cattle and 3 horses. Practically all feed must be shipped in, out of an expense of $2,094.69 for the farm. $1,255.84 was paid in freight. As the cattle are maintained for a supply of milk, I suggested that canned or powdered milk might be more economical and the Secretary is considering making a change.\n\nThe cost of operation shows the cost per child as $351.79 with $231.25 being allowed by the grant. The cost of clothing at $15.15 per child per year is very normal, but the food cost is $94.37, which includes all freight charges.\n\nL. W.

As the cattle are maintained for a supply of milk, I suggested that canned or powdered milk might be more economical and the Secretary is considering making a change.\n\nThe cost of operation shows the cost per child as $351.79 with $231.25 being allowed by the grant. The cost of clothing at $15.15 per child per year is very normal, but the food cost is $94.37, which includes all freight charges.\n\nL. W.

The statements are self-explanatory.\n\nThere was an operating deficit of $8,245.96 for 1943, which was an increase of $2,319.37 over 1942. This school was in operation during only six months of 1942, and received the per capita grant for that period only. I have prepared Statement #A to show the revenue and expenditure for the term of operation. In the six-month period there was an operating deficit of $4,297.90.\n\nThe food raised and consumed at the school was estimated at $825.00, while the clothing supplied by the Dorcas Society was valued at $1,646.78.\n\nThe cost of operation per pupil per year (based on the six-month period) works out at $721.307, which is an increase of $275.097. The cost of operation has always been high, due to the low pupilage and the location of the school. In this period the average attendance dropped from 30.51 to 19.51, and accounts for a large part of the increase in operating costs.\n\nThe principal's report for 1942 shows the acreage belonging to the school as 160 acres, of which 3 acres are being cultivated for garden purposes. The livestock consisted of 2 horses, 4 cows, 5 pigs, and 40 poultry.\n\nW.R.

The expenditures amounted to $10,894.65, leaving a deficit of $6,979.48.\n\nIf a basis of revenue and expenditure concerning only the year 1944 is used, the deficit works out at $6,923.80.\n\nClothing supplied by the Dorcas Society was given an estimated value of $54.84, and food raised and consumed at the school was estimated at $455.00.\n\nOffice and Special included insurance premiums of $450.00, and during this year repairs were made to the principal's residence.\n\nOperating Costs\n\nDue to the fact that this school was in operation during only 4 months of 1944, I have not attempted to arrive at costs per pupil.\n\nStaff (Statement #2).\n\nA list of staff as at December 31st, 1944, was obtained from the salary pay-lists.\n\n1945\n\nRevenue and Expenditure (Statement #1A).\n\nThe per capita grant earned for 1945 as obtained from the Commission records amounted to $12,202.59, and other revenue $12,347.86. The expenditures totalled $21,719.21, leaving a deficit of $9,371.35.\n\nIf revenue and expenditure concerning the year 1945 only, is used as a basis, the deficit would be $10,435.62.\n\nBuilding costs include repairs to the staff residence.\n\nClothing supplied by the Dorcas Society was estimated in value at $1,543.61, and the value of food raised and consumed at the school was estimated at $247.59.\n\nOperating Costs (Statement #2A).\n\nThe cost of clothing per pupil per year was $22.031, and the cost of food was $158.563.\n\nThe cost of operation per pupil per year was $465.956, based on an average pupilage of 46.5.\n\nStaff (Statement #2A).........\nStaff (Statement #2A).\n\nA list of staff members as at December 31, 1945, was obtained from staff pay-lists.\n\nGeneral\n\nThis school is, because of its location, a very expensive one to operate. In addition the school has just gone through a period of re-organization caused by the necessity of rebuilding after a fire.\n\nW. R. Butchart,\nAuditor.\nOttawa, December 4, 1946.\n\nW.R.

VOLUME .........................\nDiocese of Yukon,\nCanada\n\n129 Isabella St.,\nToronto, Ontario, Canada.\nMarch 26, 1931.\n\nMr. W.W.Cory,\nDeputy Minister of the Interior, Ottawa.\n\nDear Mr. Cory,\n\nFollowing up our conversation of last week, and at your suggestion, I wish to bring before your Department, the needs of a class of children living in isolated parts of Yukon Territory.\n\nIn different places throughout the country, children are growing up without any educational facilities. They are mostly of mixed parentage\u2014 their fathers being and mothers natives.\n\nLast Summer we opened up a small hostel in Dawson for four or five children at the parents' request, under Miss E.J.Hartel, a lady of much experience in educational work. Two of these children are from Rupert House, one from the Pelly River, and one from the district.\n\nThese children attend the Public School in Dawson and are given home training under good surroundings in the hostel. There are at least twenty or thirty children of this kind, who ought to be attending school even now and others will attend next year.\n\nThese children will remain for the most part residents of the country, and will have a great influence on the Indians. They will also, under the present regulations, have all the rights and liberties of the white men. If educated and given a fair opportunity, they are the most valuable citizens the country has. In their hands more than in the hands of others, rests the future of this great Frontier Land. They are, in most cases, Pioneers, and have settled in outlying districts.\n\nSome of the parents will be able to do a great deal for the education of the children, but others will need assistance.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6481, file 941-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nST PAUL'S HOSTEL.\n\nDawson.\n\nSt. Paul's Hostel, Dawson, has recently been opened and will be in charge of Miss E. J. Naftel. The object of this institution is to provide a home for children other than Indians and Eskimos, who live in isolated places or where circumstances prevent them from getting an education. The children will be under the direct supervision of the Superintendent and will attend the public school, besides receiving domestic and other training in the Home. Before admission each must be medically examined and pronounced as healthy. The rates will be as follows: $25. per month for each child, $22.50 per month for each of two or more children from one family. A small reduction will be made for the round year. Parents or guardians will pay travelling expenses and provide clothing. Children will require a small amount of pocket money and also for school books. In case of illness children will be taken care of as far as possible in the Home. If medical attention or hospital treatment are found necessary, the parents will be expected to pay the cost of such. All children are accepted on an equal footing and the rates are placed at a low figure to be within the reach of parents of moderate means. The cost of upkeep will amount to much more than the charges made and parents and other friends are invited to do what they can to help, and thus ensure the continuation of the institution.\nDiocese of Yukon,\nCanada,\n129 Isabella St.,\nToronto, Mar. 26, 1921.\n\nSir James Lougheed,\nMinister of the Interior, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir James:\n\nAfter discussing with you the question of education of half-breed children in Yukon last week, I conferred with Mr. Duncan Scott, and he asked me also to talk the matter over with Mr. Cory.\n\nI am now sending Mr. Cory a statement bringing the whole matter before the Department. A copy of this I enclose herewith.\n\nI sincerely hope that something of a practical character may be done without undue delay. In a few weeks I start back for Yukon, and I should like to know by that time what practical steps could be taken in the matter.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nIsaac O.\n\nYukon.\nDiocese of Yukon,\n\nCanada,\n\n129 Isabella St.,\nToronto, March 26th, 1921.\n\nW. W. Cory,\nDeputy Minister of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Cory,-\n\nI enclose herewith a statement regarding the question of the education of half breed children in Yukon, and am forwarding Sir James Loughheed a copy of this.\n\nI hope that something may be decided within the next couple of weeks, before I start back for Yukon. I have been thinking over the question of utilizing Government House. You mentioned it was always a difficult building to heat. It was probably not economical with only half a dozen people in it. I have been wondering if it would not be considered economical with twenty or thirty or more people in it. The large verandah would be ideal for sleeping quarters especially during the warm months.\n\nI shall be glad if you will do what you can to keep this matter to the forefront till something definite is settled.\n\nI remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nIsaac O. Yukon.\n11th April, 1921.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,-\n\nI am sending you herewith copies of two communications from Bishop Stringer relative to the establishment of St. Paul's Hostel at Dawson to provide a home for half breed children who live in isolated parts of the Territory, or where circumstances prevent them from obtaining an education.\n\nIt is explained that the children are to reside in the Hostel and attend the public schools; that a charge of $25.00 a month is to be made for each child; that the cost will be about $40.00 a month per child; that with twenty or thirty occupants it will cost about $8,000.00 per annum to maintain the hostel; that the parents will contribute about $2,500.00; and that it will be necessary to make up the balance of $5,500.00 in some other way. Bishop Stringer asks, therefore:\n\n(1) That the Department defray the cost of building, amounting to about $10,000.00 and give a per capita grant;\n\n(2) that the institution be placed in charge of the Department of Indian Affairs, or some other Department of the Government;\n\n(3) that the building known as the Commissioner's residence be utilized for this purpose.\n\nThe grant to the Local Council of the Yukon Territory has been reduced during the current fiscal year from $90,000.00 to $45,000.00, from which D. C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6481, file 941-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\ngrant all payments for educational purposes must be made. An effort is also being made to reduce the expenditures of the Department of Indian Affairs in connection with the Indian Board School at Carcross. The amount which has been placed in the estimates for the current fiscal year would not be sufficient to meet the additional expenditure suggested by Bishop Stringer.\n\nNo information has been submitted to show the number of children in the Yukon Territory who would come within the class referred to by Bishop Stringer. It would appear that before any definite provision is made for the education of the children who would benefit from this arrangement, some statement should be submitted as to the number and the likelihood of their taking advantage of the educational facilities provided.\n\nThe Commissioner's residence at Dawson is a Government building and is therefore in charge of the Department of Public Works.\n\nI have discussed this with the Minister and he has requested that the papers be referred to you as he is of the opinion that the matter is one coming within the purview of your Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Minister.\nMay 2, 1921.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Sir James Lougheed,\n\nI beg to inclose herewith file containing some correspondence from Rt.Rev.Bishop Stringer, Dawson, Y.T., and a letter from Mr.Cory, with reference to a proposal to establish a hostel for half-breed children at Dawson.\n\nI have discussed this matter with Mr.Cory. The policy which governs our treatment of half-breed children is as follows:\u2014 The Department only considers itself responsible for the education of half-breeds who are not in treaty, who live the Indian mode of life on reserves. Other half-breeds, non-resident on reserves, are considered ordinary citizens of the province in which they reside, and the obligation for their education rests upon the province. In the Yukon Territory, if we were to follow that policy, the class of half-breeds which Bishop Stringer wishes to educate would not come within the jurisdiction of this Department, but I recognize that the conditions there are peculiar, and I am, therefore, willing to undertake the responsibility that may attend the scheme if adopted. I agree with Mr.Cory that at present the scheme is somewhat indefinite, and we should have the information amplified. I understand that the Bishop has not yet left for the Yukon, and he might be communicated with in Toronto.\nIt seems to me that the scheme might be supported, as it is in the public interest, and I have no objection to assuming the responsibility of whatever administration is necessary, if you concur, and would authorize a provision of about $5,000 in the estimates, if our present vote for Indian education proves insufficient to meet the expenditure this year.\n\nIn corresponding with Bishop Stringer, I was not intending to give him a final answer with reference to his scheme, which, as I have said before, is somewhat indefinite.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\nOttawa, 29th April, 1921.\n\n552490\n\nDuncan Scott, Esq.,\nSupt.

This building is situated on the\nnorth side of the police grounds, and has not been in use for\nsome time.\n\nThere would be no difficulty I think, in keeping\nthe children to the north side of the grounds, as there is a fence\nenclosing the grounds in front of the building. The size of the\nbuilding is about 65 x 35 feet with an upstairs, and is sheeted\nwith iron inside and outside. It was said to be cold, and would\nprobably need a new heating plant and a few other improvements,\nbut I think it could be put into shape, and would meet our needs.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Duncan C.\nScott, who has been conferring with the Minister of the Interior\nand Mr. Cory with a view to assisting in this difficult problem\nof providing a proper education for children of parents living in\nisolated places in different parts of Yukon, a number of whom are\ngrowing up without school facilities.\n\nI shall be glad if you will kindly confer with Mr.\nDuncan C. Scott, who will be able to give you further information\nif required. I shall be grateful for a reply as soon as convenient,\nas the time is short, and some arrangement must be made as soon\nas possible.\n\nHoping to have a favorable reply,\nI remain, Yours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6481, file 941-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDiocese of Yukon,\nCanada\n\nDawson, Yukon,\nJuly 22nd, 1921.\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI beg to acknowledge yours of May 4th and also yours of June 23rd in which you ask for further information regarding the question of the education of half-breed children.\n\nI have recently had a meeting of the Committee of men and women in Dawson to discuss the problem.\n\nThere are two questions confronting us at present, which are depending on each other, namely, the number of children who are likely to apply, and the providing of suitable accommodation for them.\n\nIt is very difficult to learn in advance, the number of children who would be available. The parents of the children who should attend school, seem to find it inconvenient to decide in advance, so that any estimate, must be a very rough and uncertain one. About a dozen children that I know of, will in all probability, present themselves for admission, when school opens about the middle of August. At the same time, it is quite possible that several more may put in an appearance at the last moment this Autumn. Some children live in very remote places, where communication is very uncertain.\n\nThe other practical side of the question is the providing of accommodation in such a way that the need will be met without unnecessary expense, no matter how few or how many children may apply.\n\nWe are now in possession of a log building which will accommodate one half dozen children and perhaps two of a staff.\n\nThree members of the committee and I looked over a building belonging to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, formerly known as the Canteen and Sergeants Mess and Recreation Room, standing on the River Front on the North side of the Police grounds, and we came to the conclusion that this is the most suitable building in Dawson, if it could be put into shape.\nIn order to see if it would be available, I am writing to the Commissioner of Police, asking for the use of this building. The walls, floor and roof seem to be in good condition, but the heating plant was unsatisfactory, as I understand the police gave it up because it was so cold. It is about 62 x 35 feet, two story, and is divided into two parts by a partition upstairs and down.\n\nOne thing that commended itself to me is the possibility of arranging it, so that a part can be used, if the number of children do not justify the use of the whole building. I imagine the heating could be arranged to allow this alternative.\n\nIt is difficult to get an estimate of the cost of putting the building into shape, but this should not be prohibitive; the chief cost would be a suitable heating plant, arranging of the plumbing and sewerage system. The main sewer drain is close to the building.\n\nIf the Police Department would give the use of this building, it would have to be put into shape and furnished. I would suggest that this should be done at the expense of the Government, and also that a per capita grant should be given, much the same as in the case of the Carcross Indian Boarding School.\n\nThe proposal is to give the children a home where they can get proper home training, and that they should attend the Public School in Dawson. This has been the arrangement with the five children kept in the Home this last year, and it seemed to work very satisfactorily.\n\nThe average per capita grant would probably be higher than in the case of the Carcross Indian Boarding School, because of the smaller number of children to begin with.\n\nIn addition I think I should mention that the per capita grant given to the Carcross Indian Boarding School, is sufficient to cover only about one half of the cost.\n\nSome of the parents would be able to pay a certain amount towards the expenses, and we are asking them to give Twenty Five Dollars per month when possible. At the same time, it seems wise not to refuse any suitable child, and we must count on many bad debts. A careful calculation shows that with twenty children, it would cost about Forty Dollars per month for each child, to pay expenses.\n\nI have tried to give frankly as much information as possible. I know the Minister of the Interior does not want to enter into any undertaking without knowing something of the cost. You will realize that I have also to meet the same difficulty. But here is a task to be met, and I am willing to do all in my power to meet it. After the financial part is guaranteed, it will require constant care and attention, which I am prepared to give. Dealing with the parents is not an easy task\u2014then the procuring of\nsuitable workers to run the Institution is always an anxiety and worry, and this I shall endeavor to undertake.\n\nThe whole project is not an easy matter at the best, but I would urge the Government to give the necessary financial and moral support in order that the class of children referred to, living in isolation, may get a chance in life, and receive a reasonable amount of education, under healthy surroundings, in order that they may have an opportunity of becoming useful and intelligent citizens.\n\nIf thought desirable, perhaps the Interior Department might appoint some one, living in Dawson, such as the Commissioner, or the Head of the Police, or Mr. John Black, to confer with me, regarding ways and means, and make a report to the Department.\n\nIf the time should appear to be too short, to put the building referred to above, into shape before Winter, a suggestion has been made that we should, for the coming Winter, use the present building for the girls, and procure another building for the boys, or vice versa. This would be more inconvenient and more costly perhaps, but if necessary it could be arranged, and the time is passing rapidly.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nIsaac O.

From this, it would appear that His Lordship has proceeded with the scheme. The immediate expenditure involved is $5,000.00 for fitting up a building, exclusive of the heating plant; this building His Lordship apparently hopes to obtain from the R.C.M.P., and he asks this Department to communicate with the Commissioner with this object in view.\n\nA per capita grant will have to be provided, but no definite amount is fixed. We pay at the boarding school at Carcross a per capita grant of $240.00, which, however, His Lordship says is insufficient, but, taking this as a basis, the grant for, say, 25 pupils, would be $6,000.00, a total of $11,000.00 at the least.\n\nThere is no provision in our Estimates for this expenditure. The only available source is the Vote for Indian Education. The demands on this appropriation are many and heavy, and I anticipate that we will have to exercise the strictest economy to meet our actual obligations.\n\nUnder these circumstances, I should be glad to be advised as to what reply should be sent to His Lordship's telegram.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nDAWSON YT AUG 23\n\nDUNCAN SCOTT.\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER INDIAN DEPT OTTAWA ONT.\n\nHEARTILEY ENDORSE BISHOP STRINGERS REQUEST GRANT AND ALLOWANCE HALF BREED CHILDREN.\n\nALFRED THOMPSON.\n\n510 PM 7/6\nSir,\n\nIn connection with the application of Bishop Stringer for certain Police Buildings at Dawson for isolated children in the Yukon, I have the honour to submit hereunder for your information copy of a telegram received from the Officer Commanding, Dawson, this morning:\n\n\"Dawson YT Aug.30-21.\n\nCommr.

Scott,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nThe letter from your Department dated Aug. 19th last regarding the education of Half-breed and other isolated children in Yukon, did not reach me till after I came to Eastern Canada.\n\nIn the meantime, it was necessary to make further arrangements to meet the pressing need for the winter. On further consultation with Supt. Tucker of the R.C.M.P., I found that the use of the Barracks Building or Sergeant's Mess, for which we had applied, could be granted by the R.C.M.P. Police only on condition that we should be prepared to evacuate at once if the building were required any time by the police or other Government Department.\n\nThere seemed to be other difficulties in the way, and we had to decide at once as the children were arriving in Dawson and winter was coming on.\n\nThe committee were called together and after full consideration we decided to use the building we had occupied the previous year and to build an addition to it. Some nineteen children arrived before the close of navigation, and as it was necessary to make preparations without any delay we erected a log addition about equal to the size of the original building. This is being used at the present time.\n\nI now wish to reply to your suggestion that I should give definite figures with regard to the cost in order that a specific amount may be asked for at the estimates at the next session of Parliament. We have to put additional work on the building next Summer in order to make it complete.\n\nI am willing to defray the cost of the building if the Government will give a suitable annual grant towards the running expenses of the Institution.\n\nWe have calculated for this current year, it will cost in addition to what the parents are able to pay, about Four Thousand Dollars. This is calculated partly on last year's experience and partly upon our experience of running the Carcross Indian Boarding School.\n\nI wish therefore, to ask Parliament for the sum of $4,000, for the annual upkeep for the year 1921-22 and $1,000, towards the expense of the year 1920-1921 or a total of $5,000, for these two years.\nThe Institution has now been in existence for one and a half years, and I have had to face all the costs single-handed.\n\nIt has filled a long felt need. The money, if given, will be well spent, and would be looked on as creditable to the Government. If you think it advisable I could come to Ottawa any time and explain the project to the Minister of the Interior, to whom the proposal would be new, and to further discuss the question with you and with others.\n\nI am anxious to have a definite decision on the matter as soon as possible. The Institution is going ahead and doing good work, but the financial upkeep is giving me considerable anxiety, and it would be a shame to have to close up the work now.\n\nFor many years, this question of the education of children living in isolated places mostly half-breeds, has been considered, and this plan seemed the only solution. By means of this Institution many children will be given a chance to become good and useful citizens instead of a menace to the country.\n\nTrusting that this request may be granted,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6481, file 941-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, February 9, 1922.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Peget:\n\nThe Deputy Minister has given instructions to have placed in the Supplementary Estimates for the current year an item of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) to defray part of the expenses of a residential school in Dawson, Yukon, which has lately come under the auspices of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6481, file 941-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, February 10, 1922.\n\nDear Bishop Stringer:\n\nI am in receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 31st ultimo, concerning the education of half-breed and other isolated children in the Yukon. I have noted that the committee in charge of the residential school at Dawson has erected an additional log building, to care for the children who presented themselves for schooling before the winter set in. You have asked that Parliament provide $1,000.00 and $4,000.00 towards the expenses of this institution for the fiscal years 1920-21 and 1921-22, respectively; and that the Department of Indian Affairs arrange to have voted, yearly, some assistance to the school.\n\nIn reply I beg to state to Your Lordship that I have given this matter favourable consideration, and that I have caused to be placed in the Supplementary Estimates for this current year the sum of $5,000.00 towards the expenses of the last and current fiscal years. I trust Parliament will grant these funds. In future a per capita grant might be allowed: the amount voted each year to be determined by the earnings of the school.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs would be grateful if you would intimate the name under which this school is to be operated. It has been designated \"The St. Paul's Hostel\" in an earlier communication. There is an institution in Southern Alberta, known as \"The St. Paul's Boarding School\", and I beg to suggest to Your Lordship that the name \"Dawson Boarding School\" might assist in aligning the work with this Department's activities.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt.

General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nI wish to acknowledge your communication of Feb. 10th in which you kindly state that you propose to place in the estimates for St. Paul's Hostel, Dawson, the sum of $1000. for the year 1920-21 and $4000. for the year 1921-22.\n\nSince I wrote you last I have received from my financial Secretary Mr. A. Coldrick, Dawson, a statement of expenditure up to Dec. 31st, 1921 which shows that the cost of running the Institution is greater than I had anticipated. The average cost for the four months Sept. 1st to Dec. 31st 1921 including salaries, provisions, fuel, light etc., was about $980, a month. This is the first estimate we have been able to make with the increased number of children, namely nineteen.\n\nThe average for ten months of the year probably will be a little higher than this. For two months in the Summer, some of the children will be able to go to their homes, but the majority come from a distance, and will have to be kept in Dawson throughout the Summer; also some unforeseen expenses generally crop up. The cost for the whole year may be estimated at $11,000, with the present number of nineteen children. Of this amount we hope to collect from the parents about $1,800, which will leave a balance of $9,200, to be made up. I find also that we shall require $1,500, instead of $1,000, to clear off the deficit of 1920-21.\n\nI wish therefore, to ask you to add $800, for the year 1920-21 and $2,500, for the year 1921-22 respectively or a total of $8,000, for the two fiscal years instead of $5,000, which I requested in my letter of Jan. 31st.\n\nI am sorry my former estimate was so much out, but it was more or less guess work till I received the statement for the four last months for 1921 as shown above, and this reached me only a few days ago. I had hoped to get this information from Dawson before writing my last letter to you, but felt that I should delay no longer lest it should be too late.\nWill you please let me know if you think it would help any for me to go to Ottawa, and present the matter to the new Minister of the Interior, or to any of the other officials. I am most anxious that the above increased grants should be made as soon as I shall have to procure a considerable amount, to make ends meet.\n\nI am undertaking, without any cost to the Department, to provide a building, and have already erected an addition at considerable cost.\n\nThe Institution is filling a great need. All reports indicate that the children already show a wonderful improvement, and the work is considered by the people of Yukon generally, as most helpful and praiseworthy.\n\nWith reference to the name of the school to which you refer, the title 'St. Paul's Hostel, Dawson' has been used now for a year and a half, and has become identified in Yukon with the Institution. It seems quite satisfactory, and would be difficult to change locally. Of course if you think it necessary to change the name officially, it would not make much difference I suppose even if locally the old name continued to be used. I hope, however, you will be able to allow the name 'St. Paul's Hostel, Dawson' to stand.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6481, file 941-1, part 1)\nOttawa, March 10, 1922.\n\nDear Bishop Stringer:\n\nI am in receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 2nd instant, concerning the St. Paul's Hostel at Dawson. I have noted that the cost of operating the institution has been heavier than you were aware at the time of your earlier communication.\n\nIn reply to your request for a further $3,000 to assist in financing the present and past fiscal years, I beg to state that it will be extremely difficult to arrange to have the amount voted as the Supplementary Estimates for the current year are closed. The financial condition of the country is such that the Treasury Board are making every effort to curtail expenditure, but I hope that Parliament will pass on the item of $5,000 that I have caused to be included in the Supplementary Estimates for the expenses already incurred at the school in Dawson.\n\nI have not had an opportunity of discussing with the Honourable the Superintendent General the special claims of this institution, and I have no doubt that he will be glad to see you at some convenient time. Possibly you will need to visit Ottawa on general business before long and, if you will intimate to me when you are to be in town, I will endeavour to arrange for an interview with Mr. Stewart.\n\nWith reference to the name of the school, in the light of Your Lordship's explanation the institution will be officially known to the Department as the \"St. Paul's Hostel\".\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt.

O. Stringer, D.D., has brought to the attention of the Department the necessity of educational facilities for halfbreed children at Dawson, Yukon.\n\nIn the estimates for the fiscal year 1922-1923, the Department has provided a grant for 30 pupils at $220.00 per capita.\n\nThis institution at Dawson will be known as the St. Paul's Hostel and the returns showing the attendance, etc., should be forwarded in the usual way at the end of each quarter.\n\nIt will not be necessary to forward application forms or certificates of health for the pupils admitted but, as stated above, the usual quarterly returns should be forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nSuperintendent,\nDawson, Yukon.\nOTTAWA, April 27th, 1922,\n\nRight Rev. Sir,\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 25th instant, enclosing a statement showing the receipts and expenditure for the year ending December 31, 1921, in connection with the Carcross Indian Boarding School, for which I thank you.\n\nThe amount of the per capita earnings of this school for the quarter ending December 31st, last, was $2042.40, and was calculated on an average attendance of 34.0 pupils, as shown by the return received.\n\nThe return for the quarter ending March 31st, last, has not yet been received, but we have forwarded a cheque for $1500 as an advance on the grant for that quarter to the General Treasurer of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada. The balance due will be forwarded when the return is received.\n\nThe item of $5,000, which was included in the supplementary estimates to cover the expenses already incurred in connection with St. Paul's Hostel, Dawson, has not yet been passed by Parliament. As soon as this item is passed, Your Lordship will be advised.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour Lordship's obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt. Rev. I.

I have visited it several times during the winter (not in an official capacity) and I may say that it is being conducted on excellent lines and is filling a long felt want. The pupils attend the public school here.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, May 30, 1922.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Scott:\n\nIn the Supplementary Estimates for 1921-22 an item of $5,000 was included for the purpose of paying part of the current expenses of the St. Paul's Hostel, Dawson City, (Miss E.

Stringer, D.D., Bishop of the Yukon, 446 Jarvis St., Toronto, Ont.\n\nFor the current and future fiscal years we are voting the per capita grant for 30 pupils at $220 per annum plus bonus at present.\n\nThe School Branch would like instructions concerning the type of voucher necessary for the payment of the $5,000 already voted.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nJune 1, 1922.\n\nDear Bishop Stringer,\n\nI have been successful in having voted an amount of $5,000 for the purpose of assisting you with the expenses of the St. Paul's Hostel, Dawson City, during the years 1920-21 and 1921-22.\n\nQuarterly returns the same as are forwarded by the Carcross Boarding School showing the names of the children and the days they attended each quarter should be prepared by the Principal and forwarded, and the per capita grant could then be paid on the average attendance as shown by these returns. If the per capita grant due, as shown by the average attendance, is not sufficient to earn the $5,000 provided, accounts should be forwarded, properly certified, showing other expenditure made under your authority sufficient to bring the total amount of the per capita earnings and other expenditure up to the above named amount. I will be pleased if Your Lordship will arrange to have these returns and vouchers forwarded at an early date.\n\nI may further add that for the current fiscal year we are voting the per capita grant for 30 children at $220 per annum, plus bonus of $20 per capita.\n\nIn future, the Principal should prepare and forward returns showing the attendances, etc., on forms the same as are used in the preparation of the Carcross Boarding School returns. These returns should be forwarded through the office of the Indian Superintendent, at Dawson City. It will not, however, be necessary to forward applications and certificates of health for the children admitted to the St. Paul's Hostel as is required in the case of the Indian children admitted to the Carcross Boarding School.\n\nAs soon as returns and vouchers satisfactory to the Auditor General are received, payment towards the current expenses up to the end of the fiscal year 1921-22 to the amount of $5,000 will be made.\n\nIf you intend visiting Ottawa in the near future, I will be pleased to see you in this connection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt.

This institution will need all the help possible from every available source, because of the high cost of living in Dawson, and it will be a great help if you are able to assist in this way.

Naftel, the Superintendent during that period. This includes the two fiscal years 1920-21 and 1921-22, as requested by you. Also according to your suggestion, I am enclosing a statement showing expenditure from Sept. 1920 to March 31st 1922, amounting to $5,768.09.\n\nThis does not include building and some other expenses connected with the Institution, but just the actual current expenses during the period stated.\n\nI trust that you will now be able to forward me a Draft for $5,000 towards meeting these expenses as promised in your letters of June 1st and August 2nd last. Will you please send the cheque to the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Vancouver, to be deposited to the credit of No. S915 in the name of Right Reverend I.O. Stringer, Bishop of Yukon, also sending me notice that this has been done. I can then draw on it to repay funds which have had to be advanced from other sources to meet expenses.\nIn future will you please have the Quarterly per capita grant sent directly to me at Dawson. The Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, has not been able to take over St. Paul's Hostel, Dawson, as they have done in the case of the Carcross Indian Boarding School, so that the St. Paul's Hostel, Dawson, remains directly under the supervision of the Diocese. It would save delay and also any Bank Discount by sending the grants directly to me at Dawson.\n\nTrusting that the above will be satisfactory, and thanking you for your kind consideration.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nI. O. Stringer\n\nBishop of Yukon.\nDiocese of Yukon,\nCanada\n\nDawson, Yukon,\n575618 Nov. 4th, 1922.\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nI wish to thank you most heartily for your kind interest in the work of St. Paul's Hostel, Dawson, and for the substantial help you were able to procure through your Department. The results of your active interest will make it possible to continue on with the work.\n\nIt will, I am sure, be a satisfaction to you to know that the Hostel is meeting a real need, and that so far, the results have been most satisfactory. At present there are twenty-two children in the Hostel, all of whom seem to be doing very well. They attend the Dawson Public School, and take their stand beside the other children with considerable credit. These boys and girls are now given a chance in life, and there is no reason why they should not prove to be good citizens instead of a menace to society, which they were likely to become if left to themselves. It is a work that seems well worth while. The children are happy and healthy and there is a wonderful difference in their demeanor since coming into the Hostel.\n\nMr. and Mrs. C.F.

I am pleased to learn that this Department is able to help you in such a worth-while activity.\n\nI have directed that an Order in Council be prepared, which will affiliate the St. Paul's Hostel with the Indian residential schools. This will give us the necessary authority to make not only the initial payment of $5000 but all future grants on a per capita basis.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt. Rev. T. O. Stringer, D.D.,\nBishop of Yukon,\nDawson, Yukon.\nOttawa, Dec. 11, 1922.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Moffat:\n\nIn April, 1921, the then Honourable Superintendent General requested the Department of the Interior to refer to us certain correspondence from the Rt. Rev. Bishop Stringer, relative to the St. Paul's Hostel at Dawson, Yukon. His Lordship requested government assistance for a hostel for the education of half-breed children and, as the Department of Indian Affairs had the necessary machinery for making a per capita grant to such an institution, it was decided that the St. Paul's Hostel should come under this Department, if any.\n\nConstitute and orphan half-breeds are admitted to the St. Paul's Hostel. As this Department has considered itself responsible only for the education of non-treaty half-breeds who live the Indian mode of life on reserves, it is thought advisable to secure an Order in Council permitting us to make an initial grant of $5000 to Bishop Stringer.\n\nThe Bishop established the boarding school and in the Supplementary Estimates for 1921-22 for Indian Education, an item of $5000 was allowed to defray initial expenses. In the Main Estimates for this fiscal year $6600 was provided as per capita grant.\n\nIf we secure an Order in Council giving permission to pay a grant of $5000 to this institution, the future payments of per capita grant will be unquestioned. Accounts certified by the Bishop have been presented showing that the expenditure from September 1920 to March 31, 1922 has been $6112.73. $2327.64 has been collected from parents and guardians of the children in residence, leaving a total net expenditure of $5785.09.\n\nK.T.F.\nOttawa, December 28, 1922.\n\nHis Excellency\n\nThe Governor General in Council,\n\nThe undersigned begs to report that in the Main Estimates for this fiscal year $500.00 was provided as per capita grant for the St. Paul's Hostel at Dawson, Yukon. This institution is conducted for the benefit of destitute and orphan half-breeds and forms part of the educational system of the Department. It was established two and a half years ago by the Right Reverend Bishop Stringer, Anglican Bishop of the Yukon.\n\nAccounts, certified by the Bishop, have been presented, showing that the expenditure from September 1920 to March 31, 1922 has been $8117.73. $8327.64 has been collected from parents and guardians of the children in residence, leaving a total net expenditure of $5705.09.\n\nThe undersigned would therefore recommend that the amount of $500.00 be paid from the grant above mentioned, being provided for in the Vote for Indian Education, No. 262.\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 28th December, 1922, from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, submitting that in the main estimates for the current fiscal year $6600 was provided as per capita grant for the St. Paul's Hostel at Dawson, Yukon. This institution is conducted for the benefit of destitute and orphan half-breeds and forms part of the educational system of the Department of Indian Affairs. It was established two and one-half years ago by the Right Reverend Bishop Stringer, Anglican Bishop of the Yukon.\n\nThe Minister states that accounts, certified by Bishop Stringer, have been presented, showing that the expenditure from September 1920 to March 31, 1922 has been $112.73. $2327.64 has been collected from parents and guardians of the children in residence, leaving a total net expenditure of $5785.09.\n\nThe Minister therefore recommends that the amount of $5000 be paid from the grant above mentioned, being provided for in the vote for Indian Education No.282.\n\nThe Committee concur in the foregoing recommendation and submit the same for approval.\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Superintendent GENERAL OF INDIAN AFFAIRS.\nOttawa, Jan. 15, 1923.\n\nDear Bishop Stringer:\n\nIt gives me much pleasure to inform Your Lordship that the necessary authority for the affiliation of the St. Paul's Hostel with Indian residential schools has been obtained, and I am directing that a cheque for $5,000.00 be forwarded to the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Vancouver. This money will be credited to Account No. 3-915, and will be drawn in favour of Your Lordship.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. I. O.

I wish to thank you for this and for all your kindly interest in the Institution. The financial help given by your Department is a great boon indeed. Without it we would not be able to carry on.\n\nThere are twenty one children in residence at the Hostel and all seem well and happy. They have made good progress at school, and take their places with credit beside the other school children. Two of the Hostel children came out at the top of their classes, and others stand well up. The children themselves also seem to appreciate the privileges they enjoy.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Johnson are an ideal couple to have in charge of the institution. Everything runs smoothly and the discipline is good. The children consequently receive good home training, and it is quite a common thing to hear people say how well behaved they are both in and out of school.\n\nWe are now considering the question of an addition to the building, as the accommodation is inadequate, and we also expect some additional pupils next Fall.\n\nAgain thanking you for your practical interest in this work, I remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6481, file 941-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith the quarterly returns of the number of pupils in residence at St Paul's Hostel Dawson for the quarter ending March 31st, 1923.\n\nThe Hostel has been visited several times during the quarter. The pupils were found to be in good health, well cared for and being served with good plain wholesome meals well cooked. Sleeping accommodation is somewhat cramped but this will be improved during the summer by an addition to the building.\n\nSince Mr C.F. and Mrs Johnson have taken over the charge of this institution there has been marked improvement in the general appearance and conduct of the pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D.

The forms enclosed in your letter have been sent to the Superintendent with instructions regarding filling them up properly and completely.\n\nThe Department's policy in regard to the pupils holidays was also fully explained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D.

You will note that your Department materially assists us in the operation of this School and we wish again to thank you, not only on our own behalf but also on behalf of the parents of the children and the boys and girls themselves.\n\nWith every good wish and many thanks,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Yukon.\nOttawa, April 15, 1933.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th ultimo, enclosing copy of the annual financial statement of St. Paul's Hostel, Dawson, Yukon, for the year ended December 31, 1932.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

C.F. Johnson, Principal of St. Paul's Hostel, at Dawson, since 1922, died in the Hospital here on May 14th last. He had undergone an operation a week previously and while at first we had thought he would recover our hopes were not realised.\n\nIt has not been easy to find a successor to the late Mr. Johnson. I have however appointed to that position for one year the Rev. L.G. Chappell, who for the last year has been in charge of our Mission at Moosehide and has done very good work there. If the work at the Hostel progresses favorably I hope to make Mr. Chappell's appointment a permanent one. I trust that this appointment will meet with your approval.\n\nTo fill the vacancy thus created at Moosehide I have appointed the Rev. Alex. Anderson, B.A., L.Th.. Mr Anderson has been in the Diocese of Yukon for a year, having been temporarily in charge of the Church in Dawson during the absence of the Rector on furlough. Mr. Anderson is a graduate of the University of Saskatchewan. I trust that you will be able to appoint him as teacher of the Day School at Moosehide for the term beginning September 1st next.\n\nMr. Stewart Jenkins, B.A., a graduate of the University of Manitoba is teaching the day school at Champagne this summer, and the Rev. A.R. Parsons formerly the teacher at Selkirk is teaching at Teslin and I trust that these appointments will meet with your approval.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBishop of Yukon\nOttawa, August 9, 1935.\n\nRight Rev. Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th ultimo, I beg to say that the appointment of Rev. Alex. Anderson as teacher of the Mooshide Indian Day School from September 1st, next, is approved.

From a financial point of view 1938 shows a considerable improvement over the previous year. Several factors helped to achieve this result. An increase in the enrolment, brought an increase in the grant from your Department, mild weather in both the early and closing months of the year enabled us to decrease our fuel consumption considerably, these two items alone amounted to $1000.00.\n\nMay I again express to you my appreciation of your support of the work of this Institution, for without your support it would be impossible for us to carry on.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBishop of Yukon\nDiocese of Yukon\nCanada\n\nDawson, Y.T.\n9th August 1939.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFor many years past Mr. Arthur Coldrick has been the Financial Secretary of the Diocese of Yukon.

No doubt it is all available from your own files but you may not have it in summarized form.\n\nI have not had an opportunity of inspecting the residential school at Carcross, nor do I know much of the results which are being achieved by it. My general observation of the work done in such institutions in the north, however, is that they do little to equip the Indians for the type of life which he must of necessity live in this country. Whether they make the Indians dissatisfied with the way of life to which he must almost inevitably return. However I realize that this is a controversial question and the schools appear to be conducted in accordance with departmental policy.\n\nThe Hostel which is maintained by the Anglican Church at Dawson is for half-breed children. I do not think there are any full blood Indian inmates. The children in residence attend the local school. I note that it has been suggested that the school at Carcross might be closed and a consolidation effected with the Hostel at Dawson, making use of the old residence of the Commissioner, for accommodation.\n\nBishop Geddes has not been in the Territory since my arrival so I have had no opportunity of discussing this suggestion with him. However it appears to me that the idea is open to many objections, perhaps the chief being that the cost of maintenance of an institution at Dawson would be much higher than at Carcross because of higher freight rates on supplies, the increase in cost of fuel, etc. There is not sufficient adjoining ground available to grow potatoes or other root crops to assist in maintenance or to train the native children in agricultural pursuits. Moreover the building itself is most unsuitable and the remodelling, which would be necessary before it could be so used, would be very expensive.\n\nIt may be that a lengthier experience will result in qualification of some of the views herein expressed, but in the meantime you have my present reactions to your letter. You will appreciate that I have written quite frankly in this connection and also as regards the more personal matters which are the subject of separate correspondence.\n\nJ. E. Gibben,\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6481, file 941-1, part 1)\nDear Mr. Jeckell,\n\nRe - Maintenance of Half-Breed Children at St. Paul's Hostel, Dawson, Y.T.\n\nI have your letter of the 16th ultimo and appreciate the difficulties. However, the Indian Affairs Branch maintains that it cannot accept responsibility for continuing the maintenance of half-breed children in the Yukon Territory and at the same time disclaim similar responsibility elsewhere. It is felt by the Director of that branch that the payments made to St. Paul's Hostel may be questioned at any time and so the Indian Affairs Branch insists that the branch be relieved of that responsibility.\n\nUnder the circumstances, St. Paul's Hostel will have to look to the Territorial Government for any payments after the end of the present fiscal year. You might discuss the subject with the members of the Territorial Council and let me know the result so that it may be reported to Treasury Board at the time the supplementary grant to the Yukon Council is being decided upon.\n\nThe Department appreciates the fact that this is not an easy matter to work out quickly and the Deputy Minister has directed that inasmuch as the grant to the school is included in the estimates of the Indian Affairs Branch for the fiscal year 1942-43, it will not be necessary to make any change at the present time. However, it is desired that the whole thing be straightened out between now and the time when the estimates for the fiscal year 1943-44 are prepared.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. A. Jeckell, Esq.,\nController, Yukon Territory,\nDawson,\nY.T.\n\nR.A. Gibson,\nDirector.\nOttawa, July 6, 1942,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of March 19, 1942, addressed to Mr. G. A. Jeckell, Controller of the Yukon Territory, copy of which was forwarded for my information.\n\nWhen preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1943-44, it is not our intention to provide any funds for the operation of the St. Paul's Hostel at Dawson.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\n\nR. A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands, Parks & Forests Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 7, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nI have your note of the 6th instant, your file 166-2-1, and observe that you are not including anything in the estimates for the fiscal year 1943-44 for the operation of St. Paul's Hostel at Dawson.\n\nDirector.\nDiocese of Yukon\nCanada\n\nI know it will be argued that these children are half-breeds and not Indians, but surely the fact that they are part Indian does give the Indian Department the right to be interested in their welfare. Then too by decreeing that a half-breed should have the status of a white man does not absolve the Government from all responsibility of aiding him to fit himself to take his place in the community as a white man.\n\nI believe that there is no other institution in Canada exactly similar to St. Paul's Hostel. It had its origin in an effort to meet a somewhat unique situation that was created as a result of the impact of a large white population, predominantly male, upon a comparatively small Indian population, at the time of the Klondike Gold Rush and in the years immediately succeeding.\n\nYour branch has since the inception of St Paul's Hostel provided us with a per capita grant and each year a supply of medicines. All the other expenses of the Institution; the building, its equipment and maintenance, the clothing and food for the children, have been provided by the Church. We are grateful for the interest your Branch has shewn in these children who come from the remote and isolated parts of the Yukon, and for what you have done to assist them to become worthwhile citizens of Canada. And I beg of you to continue the good work that you have been doing and not deprive us of your grant for without we shall have to close our doors.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. George Black, Member of Parliament for the Yukon.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Yukon\nDiocese of Yukon\nCanada\n\nDawson, Yukon,\nJan. 27, 1943.\n\nDr. H.W. McGill,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSome time ago I received a communication from the Director of the Lands, Parks, & Forests Branch of the Department of Mines and Resources in which he stated that you had informed him that you would not be paying the customary per capita grant to St. Paul's Hostel after the end of March 1943. I have as yet received no intimation from your Branch that you were contemplating such a course and I am wondering if it is true that at the end of March next our life line is to be cut and we are to be forced to close the doors of St. Paul's Hostel. For without Government assistance we could not hope to continue operations.\n\nFor more than twenty years now your Branch has been rendering financial assistance each year to this institution and we have been carrying on a work that I feel confident is of real benefit to the whole of the Yukon. The work has now just reached the stage where we are beginning to see real results in our efforts to fit the children who come to us to take their full share in the development of the life of our country. In June last one of our girls completed the requirements for University Matriculation, and is now at the Royal Columbian Hospital in New Westminster, B.C., training to be a nurse. Another girl who finished her schooling a few years ago and who, since then, has held a subordinate position on our staff here, is at the present time filling, very acceptably, a position on the staff of the Indian Residential School at Alert Bay. One of our boys who reached the age of 16 in June last, has since leaving school been filling the position of Messenger and junior operator at the local Radiotelegraph Station operated by the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals. The Officer in Charge of the Station speaks in the highest terms of his work. I think it is quite safe to say that not one of these three would be making the contribution to the welfare of our country that they are making today, had it not been for St. Paul's Hostel. I had hoped that as the years went by, an increasing number of our children would be finding useful vocations in the life of the country, and thereby rewarding the Government and the Church for the expense incurred in giving them this opportunity. Must all our hopes be in vain and all the efforts of the past years go for nought just as they appeared to be reaching the stage where they are beginning to bear fruit.\nOttawa, February 3, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Grant to St. Paul's Hostel, Yukon.\n\nI am sending forward herewith copy of a letter received from the Right Reverend W. A. Geddes, D.D., Bishop of the Yukon. I am enclosing also copy of a circular letter dated December 10, 1937, addressed to inspectors, Indian agents and principals of residential schools.\n\nYou are doubtless aware that this Branch has been paying per capita grant for the maintenance of the St. Paul's Hostel, Yukon, during the last 20 years. This grant has been paid at the rate of $250.00 per pupil on an enrolment of 30 pupils.\n\nIn view of the fact that no provision is made in the estimates of this Branch for the education of pupils other than Indian pupils, our legal right to make this grant to the St. Paul's Hostel has been questioned from time to time. The grant was first made in the year 1925, at a time when a limited number of half-breed children were admitted to Indian residential schools. These half-breed children were admitted by the authority of a ruling made by the Minister of the Interior and dated October 18, 1899. The Minister's justification for the ruling at that time was expressed in a statement to the effect \"that the North West Government cannot provide for the education of non-annuitants upon reserves; and if we exclude them from our schools they will practically be debarred from all means of education\". There is nothing on file to indicate that the legality of this particular regulation was ever reviewed by the Law Officers of the Crown, nor is there anything to suggest that its legality was disputed at any time throughout the years. It is difficult, however, for the officials of this Branch to\nconvince themselves that we can legally make a grant from year to year for the maintenance of the St. Paul's Hostel and for the education of half-breed children enrolled at that institution, while at the same time refusing the enrolment of equally deserving half-breed pupils at our residential schools throughout the Dominion.\n\nNo provision has been made in the 1943-44 estimates for the payment of per capita grant to the St. Paul's Hostel and the Director of the Lands, Parks and Forests Branch was so notified in a letter dated July 6, 1942. It was my understanding at that time that the responsibility for the payment of this annual grant would be assumed by the Territorial Government of the Yukon.\n\nMr. George Black, M. P., has discussed with me the subject matter of Bishop Geddes' letter. Mr. Black is naturally disturbed at what appears to be the withdrawal of the Government from the support of this institution. I promised Mr. Black that I would carefully review the correspondence on file in respect to the matter and send forward a memorandum for your information.\n\nEncl. 2\n\nDirector.\n\nRAH\nOttawa, February 3, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

I have reminded him also that it was my understanding that the responsibility for the payment of this grant would be assumed in the future either by the Lands, Parks and Forests Branch or by the Territorial Government of the Yukon. It is my understanding that it is your intention to discuss this matter personally with either the Minister or the Deputy Minister at an early date. It is scarcely necessary to add that, should you require additional information in respect to this grant, we shall be glad to secure such information for you at any time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\n\nGeorge Black, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 19, 1943.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nBishop Geddes, who visited Ottawa on the 16th, 17th, and 18th of this month, discussed very fully with the officials of the Welfare and Training Service and with myself the existing educational facilities for Indian children in the Yukon and additions or extensions that might be made to these facilities in the immediate future.\n\nIn view of the fact that this Branch is no longer assuming responsibility for the payment of an annual grant to the St. Paul's Hostel, the proposal first made by the Director of Lands, Parks and Forests, that a number of teen age Indian girls might be given a certain amount of training in the hostel in house-keeping and elementary domestic science, was fully discussed with the Bishop. We can see no objection to this course of training for Indian girls. The age of such girls, however, should not exceed 16 and they should be admitted to the hostel only after medical examination and with the usual departmental approval. We do not think that the number of these girls at any stated period of time should exceed 10.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. J.E. Gibben,\nIndian Agent,\nDawson, Yukon\n\nDirector.\nDawson Y.T.\nMarch 9th, 1943.\n\nI note your remarks with regard to the placing of a limited number of Indian girls in St. Paul's Hostel.

Gibben,\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, March 16, 1943.\n\nDear Mr. Black,\n\nIn the absence of the Minister I wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant in which you suggest that an item be placed in the Supplementary Estimates to grant a sum of $7,500 to St. Paul's Hostel at Dawson, Y.T.\n\nI do not think I can do better than send you copies of letters which were written to Mr. Jeckell and Mr. Gibben following the discussion we had with Bishop Geddes. Just as soon as the matter has been considered by these two officials and their views are received, Mr. Crerar will be glad to discuss it further with you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.J.F.

February 10th, 1940.\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nMy Dear Dr. McGill,\n\nI have wanted for sometime to write you regarding the erection of an Indian Residential School for the Catholic Indians of Teslin Lake and district. If I did not do so before, it was solely because I wanted to mention the matter first to the Hon. Mr. Creaser. Knowing how busy he is and in view of the late dissolution of the House, I have come to the conclusion that it is preferable that I should place this request before you immediately, rather than wait for his return from the West.\n\nThis district comes under the jurisdiction of His Excellency Bishop Coudeur. In his letter to me on this subject he states that this school would admirably serve the interests of Indians of the Teslin Lake Region, who are all very nomadic. It would also take care of the Indians of Lower Post, McDame, Dease Lake, Atlin, Carcross, Lansing Creek, etc.\n\nAccording to figures which he has submitted, the number of Catholic Indians who would benefit by this school is 549, as per the following list:\n\nCensus of Catholic Indians of Northern British Columbia and the Yukon Territory who could benefit by a Residential School located at Teslin -\n\n1.- In the Yukon Territory:\n\nLower Post and Frances Lake, 120 (approx)\nTeslin Lake .................. 60\nCarcross .................... 15\nMayo ....................... 15\nScattered in various places 20\n330 230\n\n2.- In the Telegraph Creek District:\n\nTelegraph Creek and Surr.... 184\nMcDame ..................... 64\nAtlin and Telcequaha ........ 71\n319 319\n\nTOTAL of Catholic Indians of the North who could benefit by a Residential School located at Teslin.......................... 549\n\nN.B.- Several Hundred Indians in same Districts fall also under our care either as pagans or as abandoned by the Russian Church to which they formerly belonged.........\nDr. H. W. McGill,\n\nHis Excellency further points out that there is no Indian Residential School for the Catholic Indian population of the Yukon district although there are two for non-Catholic Indians.\n\nHoping that you will favorably consider this request, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nGeneral Superintendent.\nOttawa, February 15, 1940.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of February 10, in which you submit, for departmental consideration, the claims for the establishment of an Indian residential school in the Teslin Lake district, received by you from the Right Reverend J. L. Coudert.\n\nYou are probably aware that the construction of certain Indian day and residential schools was carefully reviewed and considered at the time the 1940-41 estimates were prepared. It was decided, however, in view of war conditions, that our building program for this year, with the exception of one or two day schools, should be abandoned. It does not appear at all likely, therefore, that we shall be able to secure the funds necessary for the rebuilding of either the Albany R. C. or the Carcross C. E. schools.\n\nThe Department was informed a week or two ago of the destruction of the Ahousaht residential school, by fire. This is only one of a number of schools that have been destroyed by fire in recent years. In view of this serious loss and inconvenience to the Department and to the Churches concerned, I am convinced that all residential schools built in the future should be of fireproof construction throughout. I am equally convinced that it will be almost impossible to secure the funds necessary to construct such buildings. The number of residential schools that should be built and the type of construction is, of course, a matter of government policy. However, it does seem to me economically unsound to insist upon\n\nReverend J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nGeneral Superintendent,\nCatholic Oblate Missions,\n612 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nthe multiplication of residential schools while we have not at our disposal now, nor have we had at any time in recent years, the funds necessary to keep the buildings already in operation in a reasonable state of repair. For example, there are a number of Indian residential schools at this date that are hauling the water required to meet the needs of the institution a considerable distance. Further, there are a great many schools that are still urgently in need of paint, additional buildings for vocational instruction, etc.\n\nI have been wondering, therefore, if it would not be advisable for the Churches to make a careful survey of Indian educational needs as these are likely to arise in the future and to work out a program that might be considered practicable by the Government, in view of the prevailing economic conditions.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that I should be glad to discuss this matter with you personally, during one of your visits to the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nCATHOLIC MISSIONS OF THE YUKON AND PRINCE RUPERT\n\nOblate Fathers\nWhite Horse, Yukon Terr.\n\nMarch 2nd, 1941\n\nTo Mr. Harper Reed, Indian Agent\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to our conversation of a few days ago in Atlin regarding the Orphan, Destitute and T.B. Indian Children belonging to the R.C. Church in the Stikin Agency as well as in the Yukon, I would suggest that the Department of Indian Affairs build a combination Boarding School and Preventorium capable of accommodating some 50 or 60 children and located at a convenient point on the frontier of the Yukon and British Columbia.\n\nOur Church would welcome such a move and would be willing to assist the Department by providing an adequate staff of nursing and teaching sisters for the work; I understand that a suitable piece of land belonging to the Government could be found at Tagish where the barracks of the Mounted Police used to be located in the days of the Klondike rush; there is, at such a point, an abundance of game and fish, and some natural meadows where fodder could be easily obtained for a few heads of cattle. The altitude is ideal for the treatment of Tuberculosis, and the climate dry and salubrious; Tagish being only some 12 miles from Carcross can easily be reached either overland or by boat.\n\nI firmly count on your cooperation to get the Department interested in an enterprise which would mean so much for the welfare of many Indian Children of the Stikin Agency and the Yukon.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.L. Coudert O.M.I.\nCoadj.of the Yukon & P.R.\nTagish Lake, Y.T. (site old N.W.M.P. Detachment) North end.\n\nTransportation:- On (a little off however) the main Summer Boat Service to the Atlin Lake District. Winters - frozen lake travel to Atlin - but Spring and Fall periods of no travel. Freight rates rather high. Transport of children from the Cassiar District would be by Air. Very accessible from all Yukon points, only. This site will be on the proposed new roadway from Carcross to Atlin. Is now on the Dom. Govt Wires Line.\n\nLiving:- Fish supply in Lake very good. Little or no meat locally but cattle could be stocked; also honeses etc. Wood fuel would have to be cut on Lake and hauled in. Oil burning plant could be installed, but costs more. Climate ideal - high and dry, suitable for Nomadic Indians. Water supply - Lake frozen over in winters. Good vegetation possible.\n\nMedicals- Doctors are stationed at both Whitehorse, and Atlin, at which places there are Indian Wards attached to the Hospitals. Phone connections each way.\n\nConstruction:- In the long run, lumber from the outside would be more beneficial - costs however would be heavy. Filling that, house logs etc could be hauled in from the Lake - but large trees are scattered. Outside material would come up over the White Pass Route-from Skagway, and then floated down the Lake from Carcross.-railhead.\n\nHis Lordship was promised that a report on this matter would be submitted to the Department, but that it must be borne in mind; a serious War was in progress, and that all expenses were curtailed.\n\nHowever, were such an enterprise entertained, there is little doubt that some control of our vexed T.B. situation could be maintained; and as it is utterly impossible to segregate known cases within the Nomadic Cassiar, under present wild conditions, it is evident that some time in the future some sort of a Preventorium will have to be considered. Also it is mentioned that such an establishment, if ever considered would be able to bring our nomadic children up-to-date, in the least possible time; with correct education- to withstand the on-coming civilisation of the Western North Country. In this case, of course, the present Seasonal Day Schools could be discarded.\n\nAll of which, Sir, is respectfully submitted as promised His Lordship -Bishop Coudert. O.M.I.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nRe:- Suggested R.C. Boarding School & Preventorium. TAGISH LAKE. Y.T.\n\nBishop Coudert, O.M.I., at an interview in Atlin, B.C., on February 18th last, brought up the above subject for consideration. He stated that it was high time that some serious effort should be made to stop the ravages of T.B. infection amongst the R.C. Nomadic Children, and the R.C. Missions within the Stikine Agency, and also some parts of the Yukon. Enclosed is submitted a letter received from His Lordship. This suggestion was given polite attention; but it had to be admitted that such an institution was very necessary, as we were utterly unable to carry out prevention methods in the wild Interior, at present.\n\nA discussion took place on the matter of Location, and three places were considered:- Firstly Watson Lake, near Liard Po at the back end of the Cassiar. It was mentioned that as a New Air Port was being constructed there, such a school might be served \"by air\" from most points, and by River from the Westward. However the remoteness of the location, taken with the cost of freight, etc, proved such a point useless.\n\nA site on the Stikine River, 16 miles below the town of Telegraph was next taken up, favoured by the Indian Agent, but not so much by His Lordship. The following data is submitted on this site:-\n\nTransportation:- Summer River Boat from Wrangell S.E. Alaska. Winter -Old car trail to Telegraph Creek-useable, but Dog-teams can be used. Freight rates to here very reasonable. Easy access to any from Cassiar Interior.\n\nLiving :- Unending supply of Salmon-fair supply Moose & Goat meat etc. Fuel Wood unlimited. Good side stream possible for Hydro Electric use. Ample grounds-river benches with Bull Pine. Fairly dry belt, but with occasional cold river winds. Wintering of horses possible.\n\nMedical :- A Doctor is resident at Telegraph Creek, and Phon connection can be established. As there is no Hospital operating in Telegraph Creek, and the Townsite being crowded, it might be possible to establish a White Ward on this site also.\n\nConstruction :- Freight on imported lumber would not be excessive - Failing that house logs etc can be obtained on the site. Very fine tested sand and clay, for Brick making, is also on the benches, near by. Sun all winter long, and very good gardens possible.\n\nThe site favoured by His Lordship, was that of the Old N.W. M. Police Barracks at the north end of Tagish Lake Y.T. He considered that as it was in the Yukon, it would be more under Ottawa control, and at the same time serve both the Yukon and British Columbia. It was mentioned that the Church of England had an Industrial School at Carcross, just 25 miles, by lake, distant. The following data is submitted on the Tagish Lake site.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6482, file 942-1, part 1)\nOttawa,\nApril 28, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant with reference to your interview with Bishop Coudert, O.M.I., with regard to the establishment of a boarding school and preventorium at Tagish Lake.\n\nSeveral Indian residential schools have been destroyed by fire within the last two or three years but it has been found impossible to secure funds for rebuilding them. It is most unlikely that any Indian residential schools will be constructed for the duration of the war and consequently you should advise Bishop Coudert that no consideration can be given, at the present time, to his proposals regarding Tagish Lake.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Harper Reed,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nExtract from Father Flourde's letter of March 26, 1942.\n\nHis Excellency Bishop Coudert, the Co-Adjutor of the Prince Rupert Diocese, wrote me, on November 27th last, a lengthy letter regarding the needs of the Catholic Indians in the Yukon Territory. Unfortunately the letter has just reached me and it is only today that I am able to call your attention to its contents. I can think of no better method of doing so than by quoting the Bishop's letter itself:\n\n\"Re Catholic Boarding School for the Catholic Indians of Northern B.C. and the Yukon. The former Indian Agent of Telegraph Creek has recognized the necessity of such a school and has written to that effect to the Department on April 14th of this year; we have now a dozen Indian children from the North in our School of Lejac; those children have been sent to Lejac partly at our own expense and partly at the expense of the Department; owing to the exorbitant price of transportation to Lejac and to the isolation of those children from their parents and tribe, the present arrangement is very unsatisfactory; a school of some fifty or sixty children in the North, at Tagish Lake or elsewhere, would be filled overnight; I insist, therefore, that the Government give due consideration to our very legitimate request.\"\n\nCould you please let me know as soon as possible what can be done to meet the wishes of His Excellency.\nOttawa,\nApril 8, 1942.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI desire to refer to that portion of your letter of the 26th ultimo in which His Excellency Bishop Coudert presses a claim for the erection of a new residential school in the northern part of British Columbia.\n\nSeveral Indian residential schools have been destroyed by fire within the last few years, but it has been found impossible to secure funds for rebuilding them. At the present time the Government's building programme is limited to buildings required for war purposes. Under these circumstances you will realize that it is not possible for me to even consider Bishop Coudert's request for a new residential school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nOttawa University,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 28, 1943.\n\nMemorandum for file:\n\nThe Rt. Rev. I. Coudert, Bishop in charge of the Prince Rupert Diocese, and Father Plourde, called this afternoon and discussed with me generally the situation among the Indians in northern British Columbia and the Yukon Territory. They brought up three particular matters:\n\n1. the appointment of a nurse with headquarters either at Whitehorse or Teslin.\n\n2. the establishment of a residential school at Teslin.\n\n3. the establishment of a hospital at Watson Lake.\n\nIn reference to the appointment of a nurse, I told them that the matter had recently been brought to our attention and that I knew that Doctor Moore had already been employing Nurse S\u00e9audoin on several occasions, and that we could not make her appointment a year-round one until we had obtained the approval of the Commission and Treasury Board to the creation of the positions. I promised that the matter would be given consideration.\n\nBishop Coudert discussed at some length the need for a residential school at Teslin. I asked him the number of children that would be served if it were established there. I went over the populations with him and he gave me the following figures. The following reserves are those which could be served by the school. The figures, according to the 1939 census, are as follows. The figures in brackets are those which Bishop Coudert now says are Roman Catholics.\nAs to the establishment of a hospital at Watson Lake, Bishop Goudert stated that he could easily arrange to have a group of Nursing Sisters establish a hospital there and would be prepared to pay all expenses in connection with it if we would authorize its establishment and agree to use it for all our sick Indians in that district.\n\nI told both the Bishop and Father Plourde that I would have the matter thoroughly explored by the Indian Affairs Branch and would discuss it with the Minister on his return.\n\nC.W.J.\nChief Executive Assistant.\n| Location          | Total Population | Protestants | R.C. |\n|-------------------|------------------|-------------|------|\n| Big Lake          | 36               | 36          | -    |\n| Big Salmon        | 62               | -           | 62   |\n| Carcross          | 110              | 110         | (25) |\n| Carmacks          | 55               | 55          | (2)  |\n| Francis Lake      | 46 (pagans 46)   | -           | (20) |\n| Lansing Creek     | 12               | -           | 12   |\n| Pelly Banks       | 79               | 79          | (?)  |\n| Snag              | 14               | -           | 14   |\n| Teslin Lake       | 163              | 107         | (86) |\n| Whitehorse        | 112              | 112         | (20) |\n| **TOTAL Yukon Indians** | **589**         | **449**     | **144** |\n\n**Stikine Agency, B.C.**\n\n| Location          | Total Population | Protestants | R.C. |\n|-------------------|------------------|-------------|------|\n| Atlin             | 76               | 5           | 71   |\n| Casca (MacDames)  | 76               | -           | 76   |\n| Liard             | 96               | -           | 96   |\n| **Total**         | **248**          | **5**       | **243** |\n\nBishop Goudert stated that there were approximately 620 Indians of Catholic faith at the above Reserves and that according to his estimates there were 60 children in Yukon of school age (between 7 and 16 years) and 52 in British Columbia. He represented that if a school were constructed at Teslin Lake with the advent of the Alaska Highway it would be a simple matter to allow the children to return to their parents during the summer holidays. At present any children who are receiving residential school training from these areas very seldom see their parents, once they are enrolled, until they are let out of the school.\nMemorandum to:\n\nDr. H.W. McGill\n\nPlease note the attached copy of a memorandum which briefly summarizes a somewhat lengthy discussion I had with the Rt. Rev. I. Coudert and Father Plourde.\n\nThe Bishop proposes to discuss the matter further with the Minister on his return. It might be well to have Mr. Howy and Doctor Moore consider whether the establishment of a school and hospital at the places mentioned would serve the various groups of Indians to which Bishop Coudert referred.\n\n(Sgd) C.W. Jackson\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nOttawa, November 1, 1943.\nExtract from letter dated February 22, 1944, received from Bishop J.L. Coudert, O.M.I., P.O. Box 95, Whitehorse, Y.T.\n\nI am taking occasion of this communication to urge again the officials of the Indian Department to take into serious consideration our oft repeated request that something be done early in Northern British Columbia and the Yukon about the erection of a Catholic Boarding School and Preventorium for the destitute and orphan Indian children of that area whose number is daily increasing owing to the high mortality rate of the parents.\n\nI wish to call the attention of the officials of the Department that according to our files, the question of a boarding school in the extreme Northern portion of British Columbia or along the boundary line of the Yukon was taken up by our Church officials with the Department of Indian Affairs as early as August, 1925. I am sending copies of said files to Father Plourde for reference.\n\nI sincerely hope to see such an important question finally settled along the lines suggested by our missionaries before the present generation becomes altogether extinct.\n\nYou may admire our patience and perseverance over these twenty years of begging and knocking at the door of the Government for the sake of its most derelict wards; but, for our part, I must admit that we feel rather scandalized at the attitude of indifference, not to say of utter callousness, assumed by the responsible officials of the Government in regard to the treatment of those entrusted to their care.\nMr. R. A. Hoey, Acting Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Indian Residential School at Teslin\n\nI beg to call your attention to the fact that for the past few years I have time and again, directly and through Father O. Plourde, pointed out to the various Officials of the Branch the necessity of having a Catholic Residential School at Teslin, Y.T., for the children of Catholic Indians of the Yukon and Northern B.C. whose life is essentially nomadic, and especially for the benefit of orphan and underprivileged Indian children.\n\nAllow me to insist again on the urgency of a solution to be given to this request on the part of the Branch in view of the following data:\n\nA. My Diocese or Vicariate Apostolic, covering the whole of the Yukon, and the Northern portion of B.C. located along the Alaska Highway and known as the Telegraph Creek, and Fort Nelson and the Atlin Districts, has a Catholic Indian population of well over 900 Indians, viz:\n\n- In the Yukon Agency ............... approx. 300\n- In the Ft. Simpson Agency .......... 135\n- Ft. Nelson Slaves ................. 90\n- Ft. Nelson Sekanals ............... 45\n- In the Stikine Agency .............. 470\n- Total: 905\n\nB. We have in the diocese Five Seasonal Day Schools in which approximately 75 children attend school, viz:\n- In the Yukon: Teslin and Burwash Landing\n- In the Stikine Agency: Klappan, Dease Lake and Lower Post\n- In the Fort Simpson Agency (Fort Nelson district): none\n\nC. - The two nearest Boarding Schools are:\n- In Lejac, Central B.C., located at least 1000 miles from the nearest Indian Band of my diocese.\n- In Fort Providence, N.W.T., located at least 500 miles from the nearest Indian Band, viz: that of Fort Nelson.\n\nN.B.-Those two Boarding Schools are 2100 miles apart from each other by the nearest means of communication.\n\nWe have no children in the Boarding School of Fort Providence on account of the difficulties of communication.\n\nWe have 27 Orphan or Destitute children in the Lejac School, sent for an indefinite period of time by the authority of Agent Sampson, following the epidemics which have worked havoc among the Indians of the Stikine Agency these past few years. Therefore, altogether, hardly 102 Catholic Indian Children of my diocese have an opportunity of attending any school.\nD. I must, moreover, call your attention to a strange situation arising in Carcross, where, owing to the presence of an Anglican Boarding School in the vicinity, five of our Catholic Indian Children have been induced to attend the Anglican School, because there were no school facilities of any kind for them within hundreds of miles. The enclosed letter from the parents of some of those children shows to the evidence how reluctant the parents were to have their children admitted to such a school, against their own conscience. I hope that said children have been duly registered as Catholics on the school roll, and I would request the Branch to make a thorough investigation into the matter.\n\nThe other Catholic families of Carcross have begged me time and again to petition the Government for a boarding school of their own faith in the Yukon, being reluctant to have their children sent over 1000 miles away from them to Lejac for their education. Meanwhile, they prefer to see their children deprived of schooling rather than have them enrolled in the local Anglican Boarding School.\n\nE. Therefore, the Catholic Indians of the following Bands have no Catholic school facilities of any kind in my diocese, viz:\n\nIn the Yukon Agency: Carcross\nCarmacks\nCoffee Creek\nLanding Creek\nSnag\nWhitehorse\n\nIn Fort Simpson Agency: Fort Nelson Slaves\nFort Nelson Sekannais\n\nIn the Stikine Agency: Atlin\nCariboo Hide\nShealey\n\nIn conclusion, I beg the Indian Branch to allow us without delay to open up a Catholic Boarding School for the Indian Children of my diocese at Teslin. Teslin is the most central place of my diocese for such a school; the most distant points of my diocese where Catholic Indians are to be found are less than 500 miles from Teslin, such as Fort Nelson in the extreme East, Telegraph Creek in the extreme South, Snag in the extreme West, and Mayo in the extreme North.\n\nTeslin is conveniently located on the Alaska Highway and easy of access at any time of the year; it has a modern airport, a Post Office and two local stores.\n\nMoreover, we have in Teslin a well established mission, with two residing missionaries, a large residence for our staff, a modern building for class rooms and a spacious church. It is located on the lake shore where an abundant supply of good water can easily be obtained; it is a good country for fish and meat, and we have plenty of room for the erection of the Boarding School on the mission property which comprises some 4 acres of land, already cleared for the purpose.\n\nI beg, therefore, the Indian Branch to ask for an appropriation of at least $30,000.00 as an outright grant in order to help us to erect without any further delay the urgently needed Institution for the education of our Catholic Indian Children, especially for those among them who are orphans, destitute or otherwise absolutely unable to attend any other school.\n\nYours sincerely in Christ,\n\nJ. L. COUDERT, O.M.I.,\nVICAR APOSTOLIC OF WHITEHORSE.\nCarcross February 3rd 1845\n\nThis is to certify that I, Martha Johnson and Billy Johnson my husband, are sending our children Grace and Catherine to the Anglican school at Carcross, because there is no catholic school here. We are catholic and we would like to send our children to a catholic school.\n\nWitnesses:\n\nLillian Johnson\nFather Bobillier O.M.I.\n\nSignature:\nMartha Johnson before me:\n\nM.B. \u2014 Bill Hale has also 3 of his children at the Anglican School\nTo His Excellency Most Reverend J.L.Coudert, O.M.I.\nVicar Apostolic of Whitehorse\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\n\nYour Excellency,\n\nUpon my last trip to Carcross, in November, I found it really strange to discover that five of our Catholic Indian children were attending the Anglican Indian Boarding School of Carcross, Y.T. I saw immediately the parents of the two families, asking them why they were sending their children to an Anglican school. The answer was that they were forced to do so because there was no Catholic Boarding School in the Yukon and they could not afford nor wanted to send their children for five or seven years to the Catholic Boarding School of Lejac, B.C., on account of the too great distance that would separate them for so long from their children.\n\nHere is the list of the five children going to the Anglican Boarding School of Carcross, Y.T.:\n\n1-Gracie Johnson, born June 20, 1932, from Billy Johnson and Martha Sam\n2-Catherine \" March 17, 1937, \"\n3-Oldest son of Bill Hall and Sophie Hamon\n4-Teddy Hall born March 24, 1937, from Bill Hall and Sophie Hamon\n5-Isabella Hall \" Sept. 12, 1935, \"\n\nI enclose a list of all the Catholic children who are of school age at Carcross and Atlin, B.C. and who should go to a Catholic Boarding School, which should be built up as soon as possible in the Yukon, for all the Catholic children of the district.\nCatholic Indian children of school age from Carcross, Y.T.:\n\n1-Norman Scotty, born July 22, 1932, from Jimmy Scotty and Lucy Atlin\n2-Frank Scotty, Aug. 25, 1933,\n3-Harry Scotty, May 2, 1936,\n4-Willie James, Sept. 11, 1937,\n5-Paul James,\n\nCatholic Indian children of school age from Atlin, B.C.:\n\n1-John Williams, born July 3, 1930, from Stephen Williams and Elizabeth Williams\n2-Mary Williams, March 7, 1933,\n3-Anna Williams, Sept. 16, 1935,\n4-Fanny Williams, May 8, 1930,\n5-Suzie Johnson, Nov. 16, 1931,\n6-Grace Johnson, March 15, 1935,\n7-Mary Johnson, June 29, 1937,\n\nI want to call your attention on the matter, your Excellency, because the parents of the children asked me already several times why we did not have a Catholic Boarding School just like the Anglican Boarding School of Carcross for the Protestant children. They insist on having their children properly educated, because of the very fact that they never had a chance to be educated properly themselves and they do not want the same thing happen to their children. Surely enough the Government is responsible for the lack of education of the Indians of the Yukon and the northern part of British Columbia.\n\nI remain, your Excellency, devotedly yours in Christ,\n\nRev. Father Charles Hamel, O.M.I.\nCatholic Mission\nAtlin\nB.C.\n\nP.S. - The 12 children mentioned above do not include the 5 children sent to the Anglican school at Carcross - nor the children of Atlin who are in Anglican School.\nOttawa, 16th August, 1945.\n\nDear Bishop Coudert:\n\nMr. Hoey has requested me to reply to your letter regarding a proposed Indian Residential School at Teslin. No previous reply was sent to your letter due to the fact we were awaiting a report from Dr. Falconer who recently visited the district in which you are particularly interested.\n\nI again discussed the contents of your letter with Mr. Hoey this morning and he requested me to communicate with you and advise you that at the present time consideration is being given to the adjusting of agencies, provision of agency buildings and hospitalization. The question of the best plan to follow in order to provide additional educational facilities is also receiving attention.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRt. Rev.

Hoey,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Indian Residential School at Teslin.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have been asked by His Excellency Bishop J. Coderre, O.M.I. of White Horse Y.T., to formally present to your Department his request for a Residential School to be located to Teslin. In support to his plea, I beg to submit the following facts:\n\na) His Diocese or Vicariate covers the whole of the Yukon and the Northern portion of B.C. located along the Alaska Highway and known as the Telegraph Creek, fort Nelson and the Atlin Districts, has a Catholic population of well over 900 Indians as follows:\n\nIn the Yukon Agency........305\nIn the Ft. Simpson Agency..135\nIn the Stikine Agency......470\nTotal:.....................910\n\nb) There are, at the present time, in the above territory five seasonal Day Schools in which approximately 75 children receive instruction, viz:\n\nIn the Yukon: Teslin and Burwash Landing\nIn the Stikine Agency: Klappan, Dease Lake and Lower Post.\n\nc) The two nearest Residential Schools are at Lejac, Central B.C., which is at least one thousand miles from the nearest Indian Band of his Diocese, and at Grouard, Alta, located, at least, five hundred miles also from the nearest Indian Band,\n\n2...\nviz: that of Fort Nelson. I would add that these two Residential Schools are 1000 miles apart from each other by the nearest means of communication.\n\nThere are at the present time in this Vicariate, 43 children attending the two Residential Schools mentioned above; 27 are registered in the Lejac school and 16 at that of Grouard. I understand that all these children are orphans or belong to families who cannot take care of them. They were derelicts in the vast Yukon and Northern B.C. Areas and something had to be done to prevent them from dying of starvation or of being a social worry to the white population of his diocese. But their presence in those two schools is not a desirable thing for these children as they are too far away from the surroundings in which they expect to spend their lives after leaving school. Besides, transportation costs are so high that they cannot come back to the Reserve for vacation where they would at least have the chance to spend a couple of months with relatives or friends.\n\nFurthermore, these orphans and derelict children attending those two schools are not the only children in this Diocese which need to be looked after and placed in a residential school. There are still others who should be placed in such institutions and which it is a duty of the Bishop to so place them.\n\nI have given Teslin as the proper place for the erection of this school because it is conveniently located on the Alaska Highway, easy of access at any time of the year; it has a modern airport, Post Office and several local stores. It is also the most central place of the Diocese for such an institution. The most distant points where Catholic Indians are to be found are less than 500 miles from Teslin, such for instance as Fort Nelson in the extreme East, Telegraph Creek in the extreme South, Snag in the extreme West, and Mayo in the extreme North.\n\nMoreover, we have in Teslin a well established mission, with two residing missionaries, a large residence for our staff, a modern building for class rooms and a spacious church. It is located on the lake shore where there is an abundant supply of water. The country abounds in fish and meat. We have plenty of room for the erection of the Boarding School on the mission property which comprises more than four acres of land already cleared for the purpose. My present purpose would be to erect a building large enough to house about 50 pupils and the staff of sisters in charge of the school. The mission Church or Chapel would serve as a school Chapel, the priests' residence would house the staff and the school building would provide the class rooms. I think that in this way we can accommodate the number of children asked for and who are so worthy of a home on account of their poverty and deriliction.\n\n3.....\nIn granting this request of Bishop Coudert, I might point out that the Department would not be put to any special expenditure in the payment of grants as 43 of the children who would be received into this school are already attending such institutions. The only special expenses that the Department would have to make would be in the form of grant in money to help him in erecting this school. This would be all the more desirable as lumber is now costing from $105.00 to $125.00 per 1000 feet and cement is worth $4.65 per bag. With costs of material as high, it stands to reason that the Bishop is right in expecting some contribution from your Department for the erection of this building.\n\nHoping that you will give this matter your serious consideration and thanking you for the support which you will give it, I remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.O.

O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nLaurier Avenue East,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Indian Residential School at Teslin.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have been asked by His Excellency Bishop J. Coderre, O.M.I., of White Horse, Y.T., to formally present to your Department his request for a Residential School to be located at Teslin. In support to his plea, I beg to submit the following facts:\n\n(a) His Diocese or Vicariate covers the whole of the Yukon and the Northern portion of B.C. located along the Alaska Highway and known as the Telegraph Creek, Fort Nelson and the Atlin Districts, has a Catholic population of well over 900 Indians as follows:\n\n- In the Yukon Agency.............. 305\n- In the Ft. Simpson Agency....... 135\n- In the Stikine Agency.......... 470\n- Total:.......................... 910\n\n(b) There are, at the present time, in the above territory five seasonal Day Schools in which approximately 75 children receive instruction, viz:\n\n- In the Yukon: Teslin and Burwash Landing\n- In the Stikine Agency: Klappan, Dease Lake and Lower Post.\n\n(c) The two nearest Residential Schools are at Lejac, Central B.C., which is at least one thousand miles from the nearest Indian Band of his Diocese, and at Grouard, Alta., located, at least, five hundred miles also from the nearest Indian Band, Viz: that of Fort Nelson! I would add that these two Residential Schools are 1000 miles apart from each other by the nearest means of communication.\n\nThere are at the present time in this Vicariate, 43 children attending the two Residential Schools mentioned above; 27 are registered in the Lejac school and 16 at that of Grouard. I understand that all these children are orphans or belong to families who cannot take care of them. They were derelicts in the vast Yukon and Northern B.C. Areas and something had to be done to prevent them from dying of starvation or of being a social worry to the white population of his diocese. But their presence in those two schools is not a desirable thing for these children as they are too far away from the surroundings in which they expect to spend their lives after leaving school. Besides, transportation costs are so high that they cannot come back to the Reserve for vacation where they would at least have the chance to spend a couple of months with relatives or friends.\n\nFurthermore, these orphans and derelict children attending those two schools are not the only children in this Diocese which need to be looked after and placed in a residential school. There are still others who should be placed in such institutions and which it is a duty of the Bishop to so place them.\n\nI have given Teslin as the proper place for the erection of this school because it is conveniently located on the Alaska Highway,\n\n.....of access.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6482, file 942-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nof access at any time of the year; it has a modern airport, Post Office and several local stores. It is also the most central place of the Diocese for such an institution. The most distant points where Catholic Indians are to be found are less than 500 miles from Teslin, such for instance as Fort Nelson in the extreme East, Telegraph Creek in the extreme South, Snag in the extreme West, and Mayo in the extreme North.\n\nMoreover, we have in Teslin a well established mission, with two residing missionaries, a large residence for our staff, a modern building for class rooms and a spacious church. It is located on the lake shore where there is an abundant supply of water. The country abounds in fish and meat. We have plenty of room for the erection of the Boarding School on the mission property which comprises more than four acres of land already cleared for the purpose. My present purpose would be to erect a building large enough to house about 50 pupils and the staff of sisters in charge of the school. The mission Church or Chapel would serve as a school Chapel, the priests' residence would house the staff and the school building would provide the class rooms. I think that in this way we can accommodate the number of children asked for and who are so worthy of a home on account of their poverty and dereliction.\n\nIn granting this request of Bishop Coudert, I might point out that the Department would not be put to any special expenditure in the payment of grants as 43 of the children who would be received into this school are already attending such institutions. The only special expenses that the Department would have to make would be in the form of grant in money to help him in erecting this school. This would be all the more desirable as lumber is now costing from $105.00 to $125.00 per 1000 feet and cement is worth $4.65 per bag. With costs of material as high, it stands to reason that the Bishop is right in expecting some contribution from your Department for the erection of this building.\n\nHoping that you will give this matter your serious consideration and thanking you for the support which you will give it, I remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(Sgd.)

A good and abundant water supply could be obtained from the nearby river; large natural meadows could provide good fodder for several heads of cattle; easy fishing could be carried on at the mouth of Morley River, close to the Institution; and the soil would be more apt to be used for gardening farming than at Teslin Village proper.\n\nTherefore, before giving a final approbation to the project, think it would be wise for the Department to investigate thoroughly this matter of the best location. I understand that Father Plourde intends to pay a visit shortly; no doubt you will be aware of his departure from Ottawa; may I suggest that you leave all the necessary instructions with him to obtain about Morley Bay all the added informations you may wish to have.\n\nYours sincerely in Christ\n\nJ.L.Coudert O.M.I., Bishop of Rhodiapolis\nVicar Apostolic of Whitehorse\nOttawa, 13th December, 1945.\n\nDear Bishop Coudert:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant with further reference to your recommendation that a Residential School be established at Teslin Lake, Y.T.

According to the testimonies of Mrs. Billy Johnson and Mr. Bill Hall, all their children would have been baptized in the Catholic Church, but I was unable to trace the records previous to my time.\n\nHoping that the above information will prove valuable to the Officials of the Branch and convince them of the urgency of our request for an Indian Boarding School in or near Teslin,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely\n\nJ.E.

Teslin Lake\n\nThe following points were raised by Bishop Coudert and Father Plourde with Mr. Hoey and myself at a meeting held in my office on October 25, 1946:\n\nA. The Bishop has selected a tentative site for the school and pointed out the following factors as advantages in favour of his location:\n\n(1) It is 1/2 mile to the north of the Airport at Teslin Lake.\n\n(2) Abundant water should be available from nearby streams.\n\n(3) The Alaska Highway goes right by this site.\n\n(4) It is 1\u00bd miles from the Indian village at Teslin.\n\n(5) There is a bus along the highway either two or three times a week, depending upon the season of the year.\n\n(6) It is 110 miles south of Whitehorse and 450 miles north of Fort Nelson, thus placing it in a strategic position for the admission of pupils from the entire area of his Diocese.\n\n(7) An area estimated at 640 acres would be required and this should be readily obtainable at this site.\n\n(8) There is plenty of wood available for fuel purposes.\n\nB. The following decisions were reached:\n\n(1) That a start be made towards the establishment of a residential school in this area.\n(2) That a survey be made as soon as weather conditions in the Spring permit by Mr. Clark and Mr. McKinnon (It was later suggested by the Director that the Bishop nominate a Brother of the Oblate Order who had considerable building experience in the North to assist these two in the survey.)\n\n(3) That the Crown Assets Allocation Committee and the War Assets Corporation be approached to ascertain the availability of surplus building materials and Army Camps along the Alaska Highway in the general area of this site.\n\n(4) That a start be made on this school even on a small scale of some 30 or 40 students.\n\n(5) That the North West Territories Bureau be approached to ascertain the availability of the required acreage in the vicinity of Teslin.\n\nC. The Bishop had previously interviewed Mr. Jackson and it is understood that he concurs in the general proposal for the establishment of a residential school in the Bishop's Diocese and that the Welfare and Training Service is required to work out the necessary details for the fulfillment of the above proposals.\n\nBernard F.

Lucy Ward's illegitimate and neglected children of Atlin, B.C.\n2. Dick Beans' legitimate but neglected children of Whitehorse, Y.T.\n\nIn both cases the parents have proved seriously negligent in the moral upbringing of their children.\n\nFollowing the recent conversation I had both with Mr. Kinleyside and with Mr. Hoey, I understand that the Department does not seem to have any objection to having said children admitted into the Pius Xth Boarding School for Native Children, located in Skagway, Alaska, under the very efficient care of Rev. Father Gallant and the Sisters of St. Ann; it is an independent Institution, conveniently located within 110 miles from Atlin or from Whitehorse with easy access through the White Pass Railways\u2014I have already discussed this matter with Father Gallant last September, and received from him the assurance that our children would be welcome into his school for $300.00 Canadian Dollars a year.\n\nPending the time the proposed boarding school may be ready for operation in Teslin, I think that the above solution would prove far more satisfactory both to the Department and to the interested parties than having the children sent out either to Lejac or to Grouard, more than a thousand miles away from their country and people.\n\nHoping, therefore, that the Branch will see its way clear to act according to the way suggested above until the proposed school in Teslin be in operation, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBishop J.L.

Box 95,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\n\nPP/MGD\nAIR MAIL\n\nEX'D.\n\nA.\n\nOttawa, December 2, 1947.\n\nMr. R.J. Meek, Indian Agent,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\n\nWe are in receipt of a letter from His Excellency Bishop Coudert stating that the following Catholic Indian children require care:\n\n1. Lucy Ward's illegitimate and neglected children of Atlin, B.C.\n\n2. Dick Beans' legitimate but neglected children of Whitehorse, Y.T.\n\nWe would appreciate having a report from you regarding these children and at the same time you might let me know if it would be possible to have them placed with an Indian family who would give them proper care. If so, you might let me know what expenditure would be involved if our suggestion was carried out.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nReference complaint of Bishop Coudert, Whitehorse, contained in your letter of 2nd ultimo, file 166-15-1 (VT 1) concerning Lucy Ward's Children, Atlin, B.C. This settlement being in the Stikine Agency, I communicated the complaint to Indian Agent R.H.S. Sampson.\n\nSecond complaint of Bishop Coudert concerned neglected children of Dick Bean Charlie, Whitehorse, Y.T. Mr. and Mrs. Dick Bean Charlie are notorious characters here, both being alcoholics of the poorest types, though Dick has the reputation of being one of the best hunters in the area when sober.\n\nAfter consultation with the N.C.O. 1/c R.C.M.P. here, it was decided that a joint charge of Failing to Provide the Necessaries of Life to Minor Children (Sec. 242, subsec. 3 (b) C.C.C.), be laid, the R.C.M.P. prosecuting. This was subsequently done and on December 17th were tried before Magistrate J.A. Simons. Witnesses for prosecution included Dr. F.B. Roth, Miss M. Hackett P.H.N., and the undersigned. Accused were found guilty as charged and entered into Recognizance for Suspended Sentence as per Sec. 1081 C.C.C.\n\nA difficult situation arose in connection with the care of the children. Mr. and Mrs. Charlie are members of the Church of England, some of the children are baptized Roman Catholic though without the consent of the father, and the children regularly attend the Mission Day School of Rev. H.I. Lee. It was agreed amongst all interested parties including attending ministers that the father be asked his wish as to his children. He stated he wished them to continue living at the Rev. Lee's school, where they are now being well looked after. This was agreed to by the presiding magistrate.\n\nMargaret Charlie, age 12, Jackie age 10, Nancy age 9 attend Whitehorse Indian Day School and are maintained by Rev. Lee. Rose age 3 lives with her brothers and sisters at the school but does not attend classes. Annie age 18 months is presently\na patient at the Whitehorse General Hospital and enquiries are now being made for a suitable foster home - a rather difficult task owing to the poor reputation the Charlies have with the other Indians.\n\nTerms of Recognizance state that Mr. and Mrs. Dick Bean Charlie are on probation for the term of one year; the inference being that the children will be returned to their parents at the end of that time if in the best interests of all concerned.\n\nIn the meantime four children are being maintained by Rev. Lee. In the ordinary course of events it might have been possible to place these neglected children with foster parents at moderate expense. I would therefor suggest that Rev. Lee be compensated for actual expense of maintaining the four above mentioned Charley children. I might add that a nephew of the Charlies, Donald Miller age 6 is also being now maintained at the Whitehorse Indian School, though the Charlies draw Family Allowance in his support; he being an orphan.\n\nMay I please be advised as to what reimbursement Rev. Lee should be granted for the four children he is maintaining.\n\nR.J. Meek\n\n(R.J.

Emery, Crown Lands Agent on October 16th. Therefore, your officials should shortly receive notification concerning this application from Mr. Emery.\n\nMr. Walcott, D.L.S., who recently surveyed the new Indian Reserve at Teslin advised Mr. Meek of the correct procedure. During the staking of this land, Mr. Meek was accompanied and assisted by the chief axeman of Mr. Walcott's survey party.\n\nThe number three and number four posts of the Indian School Reserve are equivalent to the number one and two posts of Indian Reserve as recently surveyed by Mr. Walcott.\nIt would be appreciated if you would accept Mr. Meek's application as superseding the sketch sent over in my letter of October 23rd. Mr. Meek's description is felt to be more accurate than the one provided you at that time.\n\nDirector.\n\nR.A.

Most of the steel is in position and the forms for the walls are well advanced.\n\nThe apparatus for well-drilling was on the job today and got down over ten feet at a point in the southeast corner of the boiler room.\n\nI assume that we are timing the arrival of the interior furnishings and equipment so that readiness for use will not be retarded by the failure of suppliers. I recall that stoves for last year's day schools were a long time getting out of the factory.\n\nI gathered that the construction people are clearing an area 100 ft. in depth around the building. That will not be sufficient for playground activities.\n\nThe teacher of the local day school hazarded a guess that \"about half a dozen\" of her Indian pupils might transfer to the Indian school. She has not, however, a very clear idea as to which of her present pupils are on the register of Indians.\n\nCopy to Indian Commissioner for British Columbia.\n\nC.W.

Gooderham, Esq., Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nReference to your letter, file 143-6-3 of the 3rd instant, in connection with the possible acquisition of a number of Army buildings now being disposed of along the Alaska Highway by War Assets Corporation.\n\nI have inspected a number of Camps between mileposts 56 and 300 and have found that the one at Milepost 147 is the only one wholly suitable to the needs of the Indians of this Agency.\n\nIt consists of one Butler Hut 48' x 20'; one large Garage and Repair Shop built of native lumber; three huts 120' x 20' with meat cooler and pantry and two National Prefabricated Huts 48' x 20'. Milepost 147, also known as Beaton River, has been the site of an Indian Camp for several generations back and Indians continue to make use of it as it is in the center of a good hunting and trapping territory. It is also a junction of the Beaton and Halfway Rivers Indian trails and several Indian families of the Hudson Hope Band are in continuous residence there. For this reason I would recommend that the following buildings of this Camp be acquired:\n\nOne Butler Metal Hut,\nOne Garage and Repair Shop,\nThree huts 120' x 20' w/meat cooler and pantry,\nAll the outbuildings therefor.\n\nThe two National Prefabricated Huts have been excluded because they are unsuitable to Indians, also because the District Sales Branch of War Assets Corporation have made previous commitments towards their disposal.\n\nI will add that the Department has already moved towards the acquisition of these buildings and wish you to refer to the latter dated March 8th last, file 21-143, written by Mr. J. E. Morris of Welfare Division, advising that an application had been made to the Chairman of the Crown Assets Committee requesting that these buildings be turned over to us when no longer required.\n\nBesides the above, I have visited the following Camps, inspecting each building:\n\nMilepost 143: Okes Construction Co's Camp.- Eighteen buildings, six of which are large panel type huts and two buildings, 80 feet long or more, of native lumber. The remainder are smaller buildings, most of them of the panel-type. I list this camp as an alternative to the one of Milepost 147 hereabove mentioned in the event that the latter could not be obtained.\nMilepost 136: M.H. & K.C.B. - Fifteen buildings, of which four are National Prefabricated Huts, one log Recreation Hall, five large buildings of lumber. The remainder are smaller buildings of frame construction. Disadvantageous location due to absence of water in the vicinity. Purchase not recommended.\n\nMilepost 209: Art. Bolier's Camp. - Nineteen buildings and six outbuildings, all of native lumber. Indian trail to headwaters of the Muskwa River at Mile 210.7, a campsite for roving Indians. There appears to be no object in acquiring this camp as it would not be possible to make use of it before three or four years at the earliest.\n\nOther camps visited were at Mileposts 56, 60, 92, 97, 101, 117, 118, 176, 191, 224, 229, Vogt's Saw Mill and 271. They have been found to be so situated as to be useless for the Department's purposes in this Agency.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nM.J.

Receipt is acknowledged of your October 29th letter wherein you make known your Department's interest in buildings along the Alaskan Highway.\n\n2. All buildings declared surplus in this Area are being handled directly by either Whitehorse or Calgary, and it is suggested therefore, that you make your requirements known to Mr. O.O.

Our aim in obtaining these buildings is, as you know,\nto use the materials in them for the proposed Residential\nSchool to be constructed at Teslin Lake.\n\nI have today received an answer from the Crown\nAssets Allocation Committee, which reads in part as follows:-\n\n\"Please be advised that this Committee has already\nrecorded the requirements of your Department for allocation\nof all Camps along the Alaska Highway and Haines Road, in\naccordance with a request from your Acting Deputy Minister,\ndated August 24th, 1946. This Committee has received no\nfurther reports of surplus covering any of these Camps since\nrecording your request but if, as and when further reports of\nsurplus are received, your request will receive due consider-\nation.\"\n\nIt is now my intention to approach the Royal\nCanadian Engineers with a view to finding out if they are about\nto declare any other buildings along the highway surplus to their requirements.\n\nFor your information I might add that the Crown Assets Allocation Committee is that part of the War Assets Corporation which deals with transfers of property from the Department of National Defence to the various other government departments. When materials are obtained from the Crown Assets Allocation Committee, there is no charge made for them as the transaction is carried out by a Crown transfer. However, if we have not declared our intention to the Crown Assets Allocation Committee, the buildings are then passed over to the War Assets Corporation, which will sell them to the various bidders. For the sake of speed in this respect I am sending a copy of this communication directly to Mr. Indian Agent Calibois.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, November 8, 1946.\n\nMr. R. J. Meek, Indian Agent,\nWhitehorse, Yukon Territory.\n\nProposed Residential School\nat Teslin Lake, Yukon Territory.\n\nThe Department is considering the erection\nof a residential school near Teslin Lake, Yukon Territory.\nDuring his recent visit to Ottawa, Bishop Coudert discussed\nthis matter fully with the Director and other officials of\nthe Department.\n\nIt is hoped to start on this project on\na small scale. Therefore we have been making enquiries as\nto the availability of construction materials from the old\narmy and contractors' camps along the Alaska Highway. It is\nour intention to use this material in the construction of a\nsmall residential school. Then, when building materials are\nmore readily available, it is hoped to construct a larger\nschool plant.\n\nThis matter has been discussed with Colonel\nMedland of the Head Office of the Department, and he advises\nthat Mr. F. H. Jackson, of the Department of Mines and Re-\nsources at Whitehorse, is wholly acquainted with the avail-\nability of the army camps along the highway. Therefore it\nwould be appreciated if you could see him and ascertain the\navailability of camps in the neighbourhood of Teslin, which\ncould be moved for our purpose.\n\nOriginally Mr. Indian Agent Galibois had\n\n..... inspected\ninspected certain of these camps on the southern part of the highway in his agency. We have now taken over the camp at Mile 232 and have established there the Prophet River Indian Day School. It is possible that he may know of some buildings in the area of Teslin, which could be used for our purposes. Therefore a copy of this letter is being sent to him.\n\nBernard F.

Neary's letter of September 24th, copy of which you sent me, did not state this fact and as a consequence I kept my inspection of Camp buildings within the boundaries of this Agency. If it is desired that I make an inspection trip, I will make it, but I wish to point out that the buildings required are in the vicinity of the Whitehorse Agency whereas I am about 800 miles away from it, and could not very well undertake that long trip in my truck unless three of the tires were replaced.\n\nHowever as it is apparent that speed is desirable I have written to Mr. Cowan of War Assets Corporation, Whitehorse, Y.T., asking him to send me a list of the various camps available, so that in the event of receiving further instructions from you, I will have on hand some information in the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nE.J.

I enclose a copy of his letter of November 7 with regard to this matter. It would seem that this camp at Johnson's Crossing is well worth investigating. It might even be possible to establish a small residential school there without moving the buildings at all.\n\nI have also visited the officials of the Bureau of Northwest Territories and Yukon Affairs concerning the possibility of establishing the school at Teslin Lake, as mentioned in my letter of November 8. In the event that the Johnson's Crossing camp is unsuitable, then we will have to consider moving other buildings to this site, previously selected by Bishop Coudert. The Bishop was present with me during this discussion and has pointed out the exact spot where he proposes to locate the school. I therefore enclose for your information a copy of a map which I have obtained and upon which I have marked in pencil the rough area in which we are at present interested. However, Bishop Coudert is returning to the North and will probably be discussing this entire situation with you.\n\nEncl.\n\nBernard F.

It is stated that this well is not very productive and that a sum of $50,000.00 would be necessary to develop a proper water system for any large institution. One of the officials also brought to my attention the possibility of obtaining water from Hornit Lake which is, I understand, to the north of the property in which you are interested.\n\nTherefore I would like to draw your attention to the very great care that will have to be taken to thoroughly survey the water situation at Teslin before definitely deciding the site for the school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Box 95, Whitehorse, Yukon.\n\nCOPY SENT TO INDIAN AGENT MEKK\nColonel Bernard Neery  \nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa\n\nRe: Building Material along the Alaska Highway for proposed School at Teslin, Y.T.\n\nDear Mr. Neery:\n\nI found your letter of Nov. 21 at my headquarters here a few days ago, and contacted immediately the Acting Indian Agent, Mr. Meek. I also contacted Agent Galibois of Fort Saint John, and visited the Airport Commanding Officer, on my way through Teslin.\n\nAs a result of those various inquiries, here are some practical suggestions.\n\n1. Location of the proposed School. - Neither Morley Bay nor Johnson Crossing appear to be a suitable location for the School, as being too far away from any settlement, badly exposed to the wind, and lacking water supply facilities.\n\nThe best location is the one I indicated to the Branch, viz., immediately west of the Airport area, on both sides of the creek, and on both sides of the Highway, from the foot of the Mountain Range to the Lake shore. That particular location will not be interfering in any way with the airport.\n\n2. The surrounding camps located along the Highway do not have any longer a single building which could be used as such for our purpose; the best buildings have already been sold, or moved or appropriated by other concerns within sixty miles of the area.\n\nThere is, however, plenty of building material still available under the form of abandoned smaller buildings, or warehouses or repair shops. If such buildings were torn apart and dismantled, a good amount of building material could be obtained from them, and moved by trucks to the proper location.\n\n3. The Commanding Officer at the Teslin Airport is of the opinion that their actual Electric Power at the Airport is far too big for the present demands of the Airport, and is of the opinion that the surplus electric power of the Airport would be amply sufficient to look after the needs of the school.\n\n4. The Airport has also its own water supply directly from the\nlake shore, and such a supply could be extended to the proposed school, though personally I think that we could just as easily and more securely obtain our water from the shore line lying in front of the school property. The creek running through the property freezes solid at times during severe winters, but probably water could be also obtained from it along its banks through siphon. At any rate such a creek would be most beneficial for irrigation purposes during the summer.\n\nAs a result of the above informations, I would suggest:\n\n1.-That the Branch make definite arrangements with the Lands, Parks and Forests Branch for the setting apart of the above mentioned Land; and that a Survey of the same be arranged without delay with the Surveyor General for the earliest part of next Summer.\n\n2.-That the Branch already make plans for the kind of buildings to be erected, so that the local Agent may know exactly the kind of building material will be required.\n\nN.B.-Most of the frame material could still be obtained locally, if action is taken promptly.\n\n3.-That the Branch contact the R.C.A.F. in Ottawa regarding the extension of their electric power, or even their water power, from the Teslin Airport to the proposed School.\n\nI had a tough trip along the Highway; on the first day we broke two cars, the Indian Agency's car and the Mission Car; we found Prophet School well started and doing well. I had to travel from Watson Lake to Whitehorse in a car without heater and the windows open, with a temperature of -46\u00b0. So the Yukon is still the Yukon.\n\nThanking you for your marked interest in our work,\n\nI am\n\nYours devotedly in Christ\n\nJ.L. Coudert O.M.I.Vic.Ap.of Whitehorse\nProposed Residential School at Teslin, Yukon Territory.\n\nRe your letters on the subject of Nov. 8th and Nov. 20th, file 166-15-1 (W.T.). On Nov. 20th, in company with F.H.R. Jackson, Lands Parks and Forests Branch, I proceeded to Teslin, stopping off enroute at Johnson's Crossing. This camp is situated on a very high bank above the river, and no water is available. This fact, coupled with several other factors renders Johnson's Crossing as unsuitable for school purposes.\n\nOne large building was noted which would be suitable for salvaging much material. We continued along the Alaska Highway down to Watson Lake, Y.T., some 300 miles eastward. Johnson's Crossing is the closest camp to Teslin, and from our observations of the other camps, contains the best building material.\n\nIt was understood the R.C.A.F. had received the buildings at Johnson's Crossing from the Army, and Wing Commander Buchan, O.C. Whitehorse Airport was interviewed, but in recent months the Department of Transport had acquired the greater number of buildings at the Crossing.\n\nLeslie Keith, Sr. Asst. Airway Engineer, Whitehorse was next seen, and at my request he submitted a request to his superior H.P. Keith, Dist. Airway Engineer, Edmonton, Alta., at the same time not holding much hope for our acquiring the building. I have now been verbally informed that his department looks favorably upon the idea of turning over a large Mess Hall at Johnson's Crossing for use as a school at Teslin. I am not in receipt of official word at this writing.\n\nToday I have interviewed Bishop Goudert who has recently returned from Ottawa. It is his opinion, shared by myself and F.H.R. Jackson, that a point of land about three miles from Teslin Village, and not far from the western end of the R.C.A.F. runway of Teslin Airport, would be the best place for the proposed school. There is a fair-sized creek, open ground for the school site, and lake frontage. It has advantages over all other proposed sites.\nHaving seen practically every abandoned Army camp between Whitehorse and Watson Lake, it appears that many of the camps are wholly unsuited for salvage purposes. A great deal of pilfering has gone on since the abandonment of the camps, and too much faith cannot be put on the inventories of camps.\n\nI have an inventory of an abandoned camp, mile 937, and another for abandoned camp at mile 946.6. Mr. Jackson advises that both of these camps are on the opposite side of Whitehorse from Teslin. It would mean hauling salvaged lumber some 60 or 70 miles. We did not therefore examine these camps. However in view of present conditions, I shall take up the matter further with Mr. Jackson as it may be found more economical to haul suitable lumber the greater distance than to use unsuited material.\n\nI shall inform Bishop Goudert of any further developments in this connection.\n\nR.J. Meek\n\n(R.J. Meek)\nActing Indian Agent.\nMajor Clarke,\n\nWould you please review this file carefully. It is quite likely that you will be going in to this proposed school site to do a survey next spring.\n\nThere is a good map on my wall showing the area.\n\nPS Please discuss with me Dec 23rd.\nWhitehorse, Y.T.,\nJanuary 28, 1947.\n\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA,\nOntario.\n\nProposed Residential School\nat Teslin, Yukon Territory.\n\nFurther to my letter of 12th ultimo re the above. A few days ago the Canadian Army abandoned their road camp at Teslin, and moved to another location. Certain buildings were to be declared surplus.\n\nImmediately upon receipt of this information, I applied for buildings suitable for material to be used for the proposed residential school at Teslin. Today I signed for two buildings at Teslin Road Maintenance Camp, as described hereunder:\n\n1. Building No. 8, Mess Hall and School House, 20' x 120', wings 30' x 50', 4' x 6' and 3' x 6', frame construction, sheathing in poor condition, electrical and partitions intact, no plumbing fixtures, general condition fair.\n\n2. Building No. 15, quarters, CCC construction, 16' x 20'.\n\nAt the first opportunity I shall proceed to Teslin to inspect these buildings for their suitability as material. Bishop Coady is being informed of the above.\n\nR.J. Meek,\nActing Indian Agent.\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nResidential School, Teslin\n\nFurther to my letter of 28th ultimo re buildings turned over by Canadian Army for use as salvage for Indian Residential School at Teslin, Y.T. The Canadian Army Headquarters here recently requested me to relinquish building No. 8, as same was to continue in use by the Army.\n\nIn its stead I was offered, and recently signed for, the following buildings, situated at Teslin, Y.T.:\n\nBuilding No. 5, 20' x 48', frame construction, condition fair.\nBuilding No. 6, same as above.\nBuilding No. 16, 20' x 60', storage, frame construction, fair.\nBuilding No. 19, 20' x 48', frame construction, poor condition.\nBuilding No. 20, same as above.\nBuilding No. 21, same as above.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch continue in possession of Building No. 15, CCC construction, 16' x 20'.\n\nThe above for your information.\n\n(R.J.

Box 95,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\n\nDear Bishop Coudert:\n\nI have been following up the helpful suggestions you made in your letter of December 13th, and I am glad to be able to tell you that we have settled, at least tentatively, some questions relating to the Tealin building project.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Meek has quite recently obtained for our use some nearby buildings. It is not expected that they will be usable as school buildings but the lumber from them will be useful to the contractor or, alternatively, they may afford temporary housing for the workers on the project.\n\nThe location which you now suggest is regarded favourably, but there is some question as to how much frontage on the highway we shall be permitted to occupy. We should, as soon as possible, select all land to be occupied and arrange for a survey to be made. In this connection the factors of fuel, water for all purposes, and suitable arable land enter into our calculations.\n\nThe continued availability of drinking water and electric power from R.C.A.F. sources has still to be determined in the light of developments affecting the Defence Forces.\n\nI have asked Mr. Indian Agent Meek to indicate\nthe earliest appropriate date when our Educational Surveys Officer (Mr. Clark) may proceed to Teslin for consultation with you and the officials concerned.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nFebruary 20, 1947.\n\nR. J. Meek, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\n\nResidential School - Teslin\n\nReceipt of your letters of 28th January and 16th February is gratefully acknowledged.\n\nI shall be glad if you will let me have copies of the official receipts in connection with the buildings for which you have signed as we are required to take action through the Crown Assets Allocation Committee to confirm title.\n\nI am glad to note that there is apparent agreement as to the location of the school, but there is likely to be some question of how much frontage on the highway we shall be allowed to occupy. This question and other factors are mentioned in a letter to Bishop Coudert, a copy of which I enclose for your information.\n\nI shall be obliged if you will let me know how soon it will be appropriate to send our Educational Surveys Officer for consultation with you. I expect also to have the assistance on the spot of an official from the Hydrographic Survey.\n\nIn the meantime you might be collecting information concerning availability and costs in connection with the supply of materials for construction, and any information as to the nature and usefulness of the soil and the supply of timber and fuel wood on the land near the probable site of the school.\n\nB. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent, Welfare and Training.\nColonel Bernard F. Neary  \nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nBooth Building  \nOttawa\n\nMarch 8, 1947\n\nRe: Indian Boarding School in Teslin\n\nDear Mr. Neary;\n\nI have your communication of February 22 and wish to thank you for the information contained therein regarding the proposed School at Teslin.\n\nIndian Agent Meek has kept me informed re the acquisition of a certain number of buildings along the Alaska Highway; naturally, at this stage, most of those buildings are not in very good condition, but a good quantity of building material will be available from them.\n\n1.-Re Water Supply. On two different occasions I have sent a party to take soundings on Fox Creek flowing through the location I have suggested to the Branch as the most suitable site for the proposed School; and I have taken all available information regarding the said Creek by consulting the local Indians and White Trappers or Prospectors of the area.\n\nAll agreed that Fox Creek, being a large creek flowing from a distance of some fifteen miles and draining thro' different branches, part of a considerable Mountain Range, should normally provide plenty of water for the needs of the school.\n\nThe Indians, however, told me that on some very severe winters the creek has frozen to the very bottom for a while. As our winter has been one of the most severe, I decided to have soundings made immediately after the cold wave we had in February.\n\nThe soundings revealed that the creek was frozen, indeed, to the very bottom with four feet of ice; this finding has shown clearly that Fox Creek is not a small spring but a real creek, since it had as much as four feet of ice in the winter; and tho' the findings did not appear very encouraging for a year like this one, all those whom I consulted agreed that a well, dug deep enough along its bank, would certainly provide enough water by seepage to supply the school at any time.\n\nAs this conclusion, however, may not be entirely satisfactory to you in view of the findings, I may assure you, on the other hand, that another absolutely sure supply of water may be obtained directly from Teslin Lake. The school property is to run, indeed, along the lake, and Teslin Lake is one of the largest Lakes of the North, several hundred feet deep, with a considerable current, and draining the glacier water of a large area of the Coast Range; the water of Teslin Lake is never muddy but crystal clear and should be of the purest. Actually the R.C.A.F. detachment on the Teslin Airport pumps water from the lake shore.\n\nPumping water from the lake will evidently entail a greater expense than getting it by gravity from Fox Creek, but the supply could never fail.\nVICARIATE APOSTOLIC OF WHITEHORSE\n\nIn order to reduce the cost of installation and pumping with such a water system, the best thing would be to build the school as close to the lake as possible, on the most suitable location. What made the installation of the water system at the Teslin Airport so expensive was due to the various experiments they made in foraging and finally in laying the main from the lake shore on a distance of well over a mile.\n\nAs a practical conclusion, my suggestion is that the best solution for the water supply at the Teslin Boarding School would be to install an alternate system whereby the water could be obtained both by gravity from Fox Creek, and by pumping from the Lake, in case the supply from the creek would fail.\n\n2.-Re Land and Location.-If the Land Branch objects to give you too much frontage on the Alaska Highway, it would be enough to apply for an outlet of a few hundred feet on the Highway, and then get the rest of the land from the restricted area to the Lake shore; another quarter section might be applied for on the east side of the Highway, also beyond the restricted area in a heavily timbered location.\n\nIn regard to the exact location of the land and the spot on which the school should be erected, it is quite hard at this time to determine it, on account of the heavy snow covering the ground. The month of May would seem to be the most suitable time for looking over the whole ground thoroughly.\n\n3.-Re Mr. Clark's Visit.-I beg to say that Indian Agent Meek has not yet received the letter in which you asked him to indicate to you the earliest appropriate date when your Educational Surveys Officer (Mr. Clark) should proceed to Teslin. After discussing this matter with Mr. Meek yesterday, in view of the conditions stated above, we have both come to the conclusion that the most appropriate time for Mr. Clark's visit should be in the early part of May. I may add that at that time, I expect to be in Whitehorse and could easily accompany your Officials to Teslin.\n\nIndian Agent Meek is eagerly looking forward to Mr. Clark's visit to determine the exact location of the school, the extent of the land, the kind of work to be carried on this summer and the plans for the building which the Branch has in mind with the amount of money available.\n\nHoping that the above informations will be of some help to you, and thanking you for your marked interest in the educational welfare of our northern Indians, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely in Christ\n\nBishop J.L.

Six War Assets nomenclature is quote \"Post Exchange\" -stop- Assets officers here state that transfer procedures have been carried to the point where their convenience would be best suited by formal sale -stop- They agree however not to sell to anyone else while we are negotiating -stop- I suggest our Dept. at Ottawa negotiate legal purchase for $1.00.\"\n\nCan you please advise me if it would be possible to negotiate a purchase as suggested by Mr. Clark.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, May 31, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, SURVEYS & ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nProposed Residential School at Teslin Lake\n\nFor many years we have realized the necessity of establishing another residential school in the Yukon. By selecting the area around Teslin, we have felt that we could also accommodate the children in northern Alberta and in northern British Columbia, who at present have no educational facilities of any kind.\n\nWe have sent Major C. A. Clark, our Educational Survey Officer, into Whitehorse to proceed with Mr. Indian Agent Meek and Bishop Couder to the proposed site of this school.\n\nWe have received from Major Clark a telegram which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"Best site for Teslin School is between highway and lake at Mile eight zero, seven three miles west from village and near enough to airport to draw electricity but not airport water -stop- First job should be demolition of acquired buildings and assembling lumber near site -stop- Competitive bids not likely obtainable -stop- Experienced man named Robert T. Forsild available in about two weeks and must know your decision soon otherwise will work elsewhere and we would have task of finding another man while buildings continue to deteriorate -stop- Forsild would require periodic advances of money to cover disbursements during demolition.\"\n\nI understand that our Superintendent of Welfare and Training has already phoned Mr. Founder concerning this proposed\n\n-- site\nsite. It would be appreciated if you could have Mr. McIougald, your Engineer at Whitehorse, Y. T., proceed with Mr. Indian Agent Meek to Teslin as soon as possible. Once a favourable report is received from him, we can then engage Mr. Forsild to move to Teslin those array buildings which we have acquired along the Alaska highway within the last six months. The present price of lumber is $115.00 per thousand in this area. The camps which we now have contain some 40,000 feet of lumber. You can therefore appreciate our desire to have these camps moved to Teslin, where we can hire a watchman, rather than leave them in their present positions, where they would \"deteriorate rapidly\".\n\nDirector.\n\nCopy sent to Agent Meek\nColonel D. Henry, Superintendent\nWelfare and Training\nIndian Affairs Branch\nBooth Building\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI am quite pleased with the visit of Major Clarke in connection with the educational survey concerning the proposed Boarding School at Teslin.\n\nFollowing such a visit, I am sure that you expect on my part a report summarizing my viewpoint:\n\n1. Regarding the Location.-Major Clarke has agreed with me that, considering the general aspect of the country and the kind of soil prevailing throughout the central portion of the Territory, the proposed site is about the best which could be found, though not an ideal one for cultivation.\n\na. It is conveniently located near the Northwest corner of the local airfield, wherefrom electric power and fire fighting equipment can be easily obtained.-It is hardly two miles from the Teslin village where many conveniences can be found, and man power easily obtained.\n\nb. The property has natural limits, with a gravel pit in the East; the lake shore in the South; Fox Creek in the West; and the Alaska Highway in the North.-It is very nicely exposed, facing the lake and the South, which position will provide plenty of light and sunshine to the buildings, which I consider as very important in a country where the winters are so long and so dark.-It is sheltered from the North and Northwest cold winds by rather heavy timber and a mountain range.\n\nc. Along the bank of Fox Creek, which is running on the western limit of the property, there seems to be some fairly good soil somewhat swampy, but which could easily be drained and turned into a vegetable garden, where, in my estimation, most of the vegetables needed for the school could be grown.-Within eight or ten miles of the property, there is, between the mouth of the Misutlin River and Morley Bay, some low land with marshes and natural meadows, which at a later date may be more thoroughly explored and worked up, when the school develops so as to provide fodder for a few heads of cattle; the said low land is within easy reach of the Alaska Highway.\n\nd. In regard to the water supply, I am of the opinion that it would be much safer to get directly from Teslin Lake, after the experience we had with Fox Creek last winter, which froze solid to the\nVICARIATE APOSTOLIC OF WHITEHORSE\n\nvery bottom until recently\u2014we have located a very appropriate site for the proposed buildings, just above the highwater mark of the lake and within 200 feet of the low water mark; at a point south east of said location, the lake is very deep, and would provide a water of the purest type; the water is crystal clear and comes from the many creeks and glaciers of the surrounding mountain ranges; moreover the lake itself is more a river than a lake with quite a current.\n\nMy suggestion is that you should first try to dig a well right on the proposed site of the school, which work could be done with local native labor at a very small cost; so close to the lake, you may get good sippage thro' the gravel; if, by chance, clay is encountered and the water obtained unfit for general purposes, then a trench of eight feet deep can be dug right down to the lake shore, on a distance of some 200 feet, assuring to the school a permanent flow of water, which cannot possibly fail.\u2014Of course a tank should be provided in or close to the building.\n\nc.\u2014For recreational purposes, a part of the property is heavily wooded and can be turned into a fine park; another part is made up of a level gravel bench very suitable for a playground; moreover, the north-western portion of the property is sloping down gently to a sand beach, near the mouth of Fox Creek, and affords an ideal summer resort for bathing and boating, with a little bay well sheltered from the prevailing winds.\n\nf.\u2014Finally, the mouth of Fox Creek and most of the surrounding bays are teeming with the best fish, trout and white fish at all times, and salmon in the fall of the year.\u2014If, through a special permit, the local Indians are allowed to sell us some wild meat, I may add that the region is rich in game, especially in moose, and we should have no trouble in getting such a meat from the natives.\n\n2.\u2014Regarding the Building Proper.\u2014The building to be erected should be able to accommodate not less than 30 children from the start, and if possible 50.\u2014You may judge of the amount of children who might benefit from the boarding school by looking over the enclosed copy of our Catholic Indian children now frequenting our day schools, or boarding in Grouard and in Leflar.\n\nI would insist on having a full size basement under each building; though, you should avoid digging more than two feet in the ground, so as to have full size windows in said basement, and so as to keep on the coarse and dry gravel bed, and away from moisture or dampness which cause the foundations to freeze and heave and crack.\n\nThe main central building could have in the basement the kitchen and accessories; the dining rooms; and the laundry and store rooms. On the main floor, two class rooms, a chapel, a little dispensary, the parlors, and the quarters for the staff.\n\nThe side buildings should not be too far apart from the central building, or even could be connected with it by corridors, which should be well insulated in case of fire.\u2014One of said buildings would used for\nVICARIATE APOSTOLIC OF WHITEHORSE\n\nthe boys, and the other for the girls. In each building, the basement should be utilized as a recreation room with spare rooms for casual training. The main floor would have the dormitory, a large clothes room, and private quarters for the guardian, with the necessary accommodations for toilets and showers.\n\nAs a practical conclusion for the present,\n\n1.-I kindly ask you to give to the local Indian Agent the necessary authority to start immediately with some activities, while the weather is so favorable and Mr. Forsild is available; Mr. Forsild is, indeed, a very reliable and quite a capable foreman, willing to work for the Department at a reasonable price. Under his direction much work could already be done, no matter what the plans may be for the approved structure, viz., he can have the site cleared and prepared; the buildings already acquired, or to be shortly acquired from the War Asset Corporation, can be dismantled and moved to the site; an electric line can be extended from the airport so as to use the power during the construction process; hangar or store room must be immediately erected near the building site to put the perishable material, tools etc., etc., in a safe place sheltered from the weather and from depredation; and finally a well can be dug to ascertain, as stated above, the possibility of having the water supply right under the building.\n\nN.B.-All that work can be done by Mr. Forsild with local labor, white or Indian, before the final blue prints are approved.\n\n2.-I would like you to send a blue print copy of your plans, as soon as available, to the Very Reverend Mother Berenice Superior General Providence Mother House 3011 St. Catherine East Montreal, P.Q.\n\nIn order to ask for her suggestions, as it is very likely that her sisters will accept to come and work in the new Institution, and I would like, as much as possible, to meet their wishes.\n\nI would appreciate also receiving a copy of the same blue prints for my own information.\n\nI am sure that Major Clarke will give you, with many more detailed informations, all the additional data you wish to have on the subject. After the thorough investigation he made of the whole problem, I entirely rely on his knowledge of the situation and his good judgment for whatever suggestion he may have to make over and above what I am sending you here.\n\nYours very sincerely in Christ\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop J.L.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Johnson's Crossing Camp, Mile Post 837\nAlaska Highway\n\nI have your letter of May 30th inquiring relative building referred to as No. W.A.C.-6 located at the above mentioned Camp.\n\nThis Camp has not as yet been reported to us for disposal, our latest record indicating that the buildings were still in the possession of the Dept. of National Defence (Army).\n\nIt may be that a declaration is enroute to us and when received we will be glad to arrange for the sale of this particular building to your Department at its appraised value.\n\nThe buildings in this area were purchased from the Americans and for this reason we are required to attempt to recover the purchase price, which precludes our being able to sell them for the nominal sum you suggest.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nWAR ASSETS CORPORATION,\n\nR.P. Gutelius,\nfor Director,\nLands & Buildings Dept.\nAir Mail\n\nOttawa, June 13th, 1947.\n\nMr. R.J. Meek, Indian Agent,\nWhitehorse, Yukon.\n\nProposed Teslin Residential School\n\nThe attached letter has been received from War Assets Corporation. Would you please check with the Royal Canadian Engineers to ascertain if they intend taking steps to declare building No. 6 surplus.\n\nThis letter contains information directly contradictory to that contained in Major Clark's telegram of May 27th.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nBFN/MGD\nDear Mr. Philan,\n\nSome time ago you should have received a parcel from Teslin which may have mystified you. The explanation is that I was pulling wires in those buildings we acquired along the Alcan Highway so that I could provide you with a sample of the electrical materials used therein. It is suggested that the same material could safely be used in the proposed Teslin Residential School. Even the fine new Teslin Tourist Lodge uses this stuff, rather than metal conduits demanded in most cities. Our legal department would know whether any Yukon ordinances apply.\n\nPTO\n\n\"ON TO THE FRIENDLY NORTH\"\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6482, file 942-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSchool repairs in various areas, probably all, are now being discussed. The catch is that inspectors and agents do not seem to be able to tell principals and teachers what can or cannot be done during the vacation. Too often the question is not settled until late in the vacation and holidays are extended or the school disturbed while a rush job is done. Couldn't we initiate proceedings a little earlier in the school year\u2014preferably before Christmas\u2014to determine what should be done, provide for it in the estimates and let the field men know in May so that they can get on with it?\n\nI hope I don't again arrive at one of our agencies to find the agent thrown with all the keys to whatever vehicles the Department of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, happens to possess. Maybe a circular letter should go out reminding the gentry that it is desired to use existing equipment at full potential rather than to compel the hire of taxis or quadrupeds.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nCharles Fordyce Clark\nOttawa, 21 June, 1947.\n\nR.

Will try and arrange to visit this Site with him early next week. In the meantime would like to suggest that the Salvaging of lumber from purchased buildings could be started at any time.\n\nThis Area of approximately seven acres bordering Fox Creek to the East and facing on Teslin Lake is I think, about the best building Site in proximity to Teslin.\n\nTimber Growth\nThis area was burnt over some years ago and there is some dead timber lying over the surface. The second growth Poplar is small and fairly dense, in places but very little under brush over the entire acreage and some widely spaced very attractive looking Spruce and Pine trees (which apparently came through the fire) between the 15 and 20 foot contours. Should this location be finally decided on, care should be taken in clearing property in order to preserve some of the standing timber.\n\nSoil\nSub soil gravel to depth of some seven feet, from exposed gravel excavations. Top soil fine, sandy, with light covering sandy clay. Would appear to have possibilities for vegetable growth from present covering of timber and grass, and is very similar to soil along Lake Superior, at the Japanese Camps, where we had some success growing vegetables by using a heavy coating of fertilizer and disk ing it into the sandy topsoil.\n\nWater\nWould suggest the most important features in connection with this Site, would be to try for water, some place close to this place shown as Clearing on Sketch. Mr. Meek mentioned using water from Teslin Lake, but would draw attention to the fact that when the Lake level lowers, the water line recedes to a considerable distance out on the shallow shore line on this lake, and might prove an expensive operation, especially during the winter months. This Creek flows during some winters, but from information available it sometimes freezes and would be rather questionable as a steady water supply for a school.\n\nElectric Power\nThe Airport have been applying the Village of Teslin from their plant at 5\u00a2 a kilowatt, but the Village has now been notified that this service is to be discontinued. Understand their plant at the Airport is not in the best of condition, and supply from this source would now appear to be very questionable.\nOwing to the timber growth, and using a hand level, working back from lake level, these contours as shown, will not of course be too accurate but the general picture should be fairly close. Should you think it necessary I could hire a couple of men and cut the necessary lines for a more accurate description of this area, or better still, I think it would be advisable to have clearing completed first before definitely deciding on the proper building site for a school.\n\nAm fairly certain this is the best available site for an Industrial School - but I think the sinking of a well for water supply should be given first consideration.\n\n(Sgd) A.R.

This building contains approximately 22,000 feet of lumber with 95% expected recovery. The same contractor who successfully did the work at Johnson's Crossing has submitted a bid of $1,025.00 for the dismantling, cleaning, bundling and moving of these building materials from the above building to Teslin. This will involve a move of about 40 miles by truck.\n\nIt is recommended that authority be given for the approval of the wording of a contract to Mr. Forsild for the removal of this building, as indicated above.\nWHITEHORSE, AUG. 5.\n\nCOL.

During a recent conversation with Mr. R. Porsild, he stated that in the two buildings at Johnstons Crossing in the process of being dismantled and moved to Teslin, there are 80 windows and frames. These are locally made, of fly-screen and cellophane, and entirely unsuitable for use in a school building. They measure 3 feet 9 1/2 inches by 3 feet 6 inches.\n\nAs it is rather pointless hauling them to Teslin where they cannot be used, Mr. Porsild suggests they be hauled to Whitehorse where they could be turned over to War Assets Corporation. Porsild would haul the windows to Whitehorse as part of the same contract. May I have your instructions in this regard.\n\n(R.J. Meek)\nIndian Agent.\nARMY SIGNAL\n\nWHITEHORSE AUGUST 11/47\n\nCOL.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe Teslin Residential School\n\nI beg to advise that on August 14th I proceeded to the proposed site of Indian Residential School at Teslin in company with A. MacDougall, Surveys and Engineering Branch, Whitehorse. The ground in the vicinity of the proposed site of the school was looked over very carefully by Mr. MacDougall, accompanied by myself. Several suggestions and recommendations were made by Mr. MacDougall, mainly with a view to drainage and water supply. His findings will no doubt be the subject of a report to his Branch.\n\nAll of the material from Mess Hall, Johnstons Crossing, was piled close to the proposed site. It will be accessible with ease regardless of the ultimate site chosen in that area. Mr. Forsild on his own initiative had hired a watchman who was camped on the site and was engaged in clearing brush. At the suggestion of Mr. MacDougall the watchman was instructed to dig a number of test holes at specified places.\n\nA recent letter from Surveys and Engineering Branch to Mr. MacDougall expressed concern over the possibility of permafrost. It is generally considered that south of the Pelly River there is no permafrost; therefore no fear need be felt in this regard.\n\nI would strongly recommend that material not be stored at Teslin, but be piled at proposed site. In this regard, estimate of $650.00 for moving material from proposed site to Teslin was excessive, as it was assumed all material was already at proposed site. Material from WAC 6 not moved as yet, and moving it three miles or 20 miles makes little difference, the cost being in loading and unloading the material. Arrangements are under way for storing electrical equipment and the two kitchen ranges with R.C.M.P. at Teslin. It will be possible to have an Indian on relief camp at proposed site at subsistence wage until the first snow.\n\nN.J. Meek\nIndian Agent\nWHITEHORSE AUG. 25, 1947.\n\nB.F.

As you remember, you agreed to my point of view and promised to take up matter with your head office at Ottawa right away.\n\nNo word was received from you about the matter by August 3, and as my crew started hauling on Aug. 4, I, on my own initiative, employed Dick Morris of Teslin to move to Fox Point and remain at building site until further orders. As this required moving also his wife and two babies, and setting up a temporary tent &amp; he demanded $7 per day, what I deemed reasonable, considering value of materials involved and high price of store supplies at Teslin Trading Post, (about 30% over Whitehorse prices).\n\nAs it was at that time believed construction work at Fox Creek Point would be commenced this season, the job was only to be temporary.\n\nLater you informed me that the government had postponed construction till next spring and also considered $7.00 per day too high a pay for a watchman. As I explained to you then I only considered a watchman needed during the process of moving materials or eventually till construction started.\n\nOn August 30th the last load was hauled to site, and accordingly I told Morris that his service was not required any longer. Realizing that the man needed his pay first chance and seeing no other way, I paid him with a personal check on Canadian Bank of Commerce, Whitehorse, for $189.00.\n\nThis employment started on Aug. 4th and lasted to August 30 incl. 27 days at $7.00 per day - $189.00. During his stay at Fox Point Morris was instructed to clear away brush and windfalls around proposed building site, also Mr. McDougall, Surveys and Engineering Branch, Whitehorse, instructed him to try to dig prospect holes for water.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(signed) Robert T.

As I explained to you then I only considered a watchman needed during the process of moving materials or eventually till construction started.\n\nOn August 30th the last load was hauled to site, and accordingly I told Morris that his service was not required any longer. Realizing that the man needed his pay first chance and seeing no other way, I paid him with a personal check on Canadian Bank of Commerce, Whitehorse, for $189.00.\n\nThis employment started on Aug. 4th and lasted to August 30 incl. 27 days at $7.00 per day - $189.00. During his stay at Fox Point Morris was instructed to clear away brush and windfalls around proposed building site, also Mr. McDougall Surveys and Engineering Branch, Whitehorse, instructed him to try to dig prospect holes for water.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(signed) Robert T. Forsild.\nIndian Affairs Branch\nMr. J. Mack\nWhitehorse, N.T.\n\nIn account with:\nRobert Powell\nWhitehorse, N.T.\n\nAug 15. To Tobin from Johnson Crossing\nTo measure and compile amount\nof lumber in 6 buildings, including\ntransportation both ways; result\ntelephoned to Whitehorse from\nJohnson Crossing, $15.00\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe Teslin Indian Residential School. On July 26th telegram was sent by me requesting authority to obtain Indian as watchmen for material being stored on proposed site of school. On August 2nd I was asked for the cost of hiring a watchman and to which I replied on August 4th. I was not able to advise Mr. R.T. Forsild until Aug. 14th that hiring of a watchman was not authorized.\n\nAs moving material started on Aug. 4th, Forsild on his own initiative hired an Indian from Teslin at the rate of $7.00 per day. Standard rate of pay in the Yukon this summer has been $1.00 per hour, and I would not consider $7.00 per day excessive. On Aug. 14th I visited the site in company with A. MacDougall, Surveys and Engineering Branch, Whitehorse, who instructed Dick Morris to sink several holes in connection with water and sewerage problems.\n\nCommunications between this office and Mr. Forsild were none too good, and at times it was a couple of days before information could reach him. On the several occasions when I visited proposed school site I found Morris clearing brush.\n\nI attach hereto letter from R.T. Forsild to myself concerning his actions in hiring this Indian as watchman. Forsild did not obtain a receipt from Dick Morris, but enclosed cancelled cheque which is attached hereto. Forsild contends that Morris was hired to protect government property, and considers the $189.00 in wages a proper charge to Indian Affairs Branch. I would recommend that Forsild's claim be given favorable consideration - at the least until he was advised by me on August 14th. A further point to consider is that Engineer MacDougall, as part of his recommendation re proposed school site, required certain test holes dug which would take a further three or four days.\n\n(R.J.

Mr. Forsild particularly requests that attention be brought to the 10,000 sq. ft. of wallboard, and 5000 sq. ft. of Rubberoid saved in very good order.

R.A. HOEY  \nDirector of Indian Affairs.\n\nRe - Representations by Bishop Coderre of Whitehorse  \nand Father Plourde\n\nThese two gentlemen called on me yesterday afternoon,  \nand the points covered in our conversation can be summarized  \nas follows:\n\n(a) They are very anxious to have progress made with the  \nTeslin School. They argue that if local contractors  \nare not in a position to undertake this work, it should  \nbe given to a company from Vancouver, Calgary or Edmonton.\n\n(b) They wish to have the Canol Road kept open as far as the  \nRoss River (160 miles from Johnson's Crossing). They  \nclaim that this will be of great help in their missionary  \nwork, as well as being valuable from the standpoint of  \nmining and transportation generally.\n\n(c) They pointed out that the Indians at Watson Lake are  \nin the Stikine Agency. It takes the agent from Telegraph  \nCreek three or four days to go down to the coast, come  \nup through Skagway and Carcross to Whitehorse and thus  \nmake his way to Watson Lake. They suggest that the  \nIndians at Watson Lake could be much better taken care  \nof if they are placed under Mr. Meek, who is stationed  \nat Whitehorse.\n\n(d) Many of the children in Whitehorse have no opportunity  \nof going to a Catholic residential school except at Skagway  \n(in United States territory). The Catholic school at the  \nlatter place will take these children at $300 each per  \nannum, and the representatives of the church want to know  \nwhether we would approve of such an arrangement. The  \nproposal is, of course, only for a temporary arrangement  \nwhile awaiting the completion of the Teslin School. They  \npointed out that a number of Canadian half-breeds are  \nalready going to the Skagway school.\nI said that I thought that there would be a good deal of difficulty in getting the Canadian Government to agree to pay for the education of Canadian Indians in an United States School. However, I should like to have your views on this matter.\n\n(e) The Catholic Church wants to build a school at Yellowknife. In view of the fact that our new school there is large enough to take care of all the children in the area, it is my feeling that if the Catholic Church insists on putting up a school there, it should be prepared to defray all the costs in connection therewith. We can, of course, make arrangements for the church to give instruction after hours in the present school if they wish to do so. I do not, however, see any reason for our taking part in the construction of duplicate and unnecessary facilities.\n\n(f) The church officials were very upset over delays that have taken place in purchasing articles for their schools in the west. They stated that after approval of the expenditure had been obtained it was often months before our Purchasing Department got around to obtaining the desired commodities. They would like to have the system re-arranged so that purchasing can be done in the areas in which the commodities are to be used. They stated that this was the case in previous years, and they would like to have it revived.\n\n(g) They put in a word for Mr. John McIsaac, a road builder in the Yukon area who is anxious to get a contract in connection with the Atlin Road. They say that he has all the necessary equipment, is a responsible person of good character, and they would like to have him employed. I made no promise in this connection.\n\nWill you please let me have your comments on these suggestions at your convenience.\n\nH.L. KEENLEYSIDE\nDeputy Minister.\nOttawa, October 20, 1947.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your memorandum of October 15th, in which you summarize and submit for my consideration certain representations made to you by Bishop Coudert, of Whitehorse, Y.T., and Father Plourde.\n\nI may state that somewhat similar representations were made to the officials of this branch by the Bishop and Father Plourde a few days ago. They were both assured by us that everything humanly possible would be done to expedite the construction of the school at Teslin Lake. They were also assured that the desirability of transferring the Watson Lake Indians to the care of Mr. Meek would be discussed very fully with Major MacKay in the immediate future.\n\nI am not personally in favour of the enrolment of Indian pupils at the Skagway Residential School, Alaska, although such enrolment might have certain temporary advantages. It would be, in my judgment, a somewhat dangerous precedent and might result in demands from Indians residing temporarily in the United States for financial assistance from this department for the education of their children. I feel disposed to favour the immediate construction of the Teslin Lake school; thus making provision for the education of Indian children within the boundaries of our own country.\n\nIt is my opinion that the delays in securing the supplies to which Bishop Coudert and Father Plourde refer are due not so much to the work of our Purchasing Division, but rather to prevailing economic conditions.\nconditions and the difficulty experienced by citizens generally in securing supplies promptly. This is a matter that can be given additional consideration.\n\nThe question of the construction of a school at Yellowknife is one that has already been reviewed by the Northwest Territories Council and will no doubt be reviewed again before a final decision is reached.\n\nI am sending forward your memorandum to the Superintendent of Welfare and Training for his consideration.\n\nDirector.\n| For your attention and necessary action |\n|----------------------------------------|\n| For preparation of reply                |\n| For suggested reply                    |\n| For your comments                      |\n| For noting and return                  |\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6482, file 742-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI have for acknowledgment your memorandum of October 15th, in which you summarize and submit for my consideration certain representations made to you by Bishop Coudert, of Whitehorse, Y.T., and Father Plourde.\n\nI may state that somewhat similar representations were made to the officials of this branch by the Bishop and Father Plourde a few days ago.

We do not, however, consider that it would be satisfactory to have Indian children, residents of the Yukon Territory, enrolled at the Skagway Residential School. The officials here point out that a large number of Indians take up temporary residence in the United States from time to time and, while there, seek assistance from this department such as relief supplies, transportation costs and educational grants. It has not been our policy to grant these requests at any time, but should we sanction payment of residential school grants in Alaska, such action might lead to a renewal of requests for somewhat similar grants under circumstances which would render expenditures difficult to defend or justify. My own opinion is that in view of all the circumstances we should proceed as rapidly as possible with the construction of schools for the education and care of Indian children within the boundaries of our own country.\n\nYour request that the Indians at Watson Lake in the Stikine Agency be placed under the care of the Indian Agent now established in the Yukon will be discussed with the Indian Commissioner for B.C. at an early date. There does not appear to be any valid reason...\nreason why these Indians should not be transferred promptly to the Yukon Agency.\n\nThe officials of the Indian Affairs Branch express the opinion that the difficulty in securing the necessary supplies for Indians and particularly the supplies necessary for the operation of schools, is due to the prevailing shortage of supplies throughout the country. They point out that supplies purchased through the Purchasing Division cost substantially less than supplies of similar quality purchased locally.\n\nYour reference to Mr. John McIsaac has been carefully noted and his name sent forward to the Director of Lands, Parks and Forests, and to the Director of Indian Affairs.\n\nI am attempting to secure information with respect to transportation on the Canol Road during the winter months. Just as soon as this information is obtained, I shall be glad to communicate with you again.\n\nIt is unnecessary to add that your interest in the Indian population, their care and general advancement, is very much appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDeputy Minister.\n\nThe Most Reverend J.

You are requested to prepare the plans and specifications for these buildings and to finalize their exact location.\n\nThe pupilage to be provided for at this school will be 120 (60 boys and 60 girls). Due to the isolation of this school it is felt that frame construction should be used but that the dormitories should be in separate buildings, in order to minimize the danger from fire.\n\nIt is felt that the school should consist of the following buildings:\n\n(1) Boys' Dormitory Block consisting of\n\n(a) Sleeping quarters for 60 boys\n(b) Two staff rooms.\n(c) Wash rooms.\n(d) Recreation room.\n(e) Manual training shop\n\nIt is suggested that this be a one-storey building with a full basement. The sleeping quarters, staff rooms and wash rooms could be on the main floor with the recreation room and manual training shop in the basement.\n(2) Girls' Dormitory Block\n\nThe general planning of this building would be as for the boys' dormitory block with the exception of course being the manual training room. In the girls' block this would be replaced by a domestic science room which should have extra electrical outlets provided for a power sewing machine and electrical rangeettes.\n\n(3) Administration Building\n\nThis would be the main building of the group and could be of two stories in height with a full basement also. We would require the following rooms in this building:\n\n(a) Principal's quarters.\n(b) Staff quarters for six.\n(c) Chapel.\n(d) Four classrooms.\n(e) Kitchen and dining room.\n(f) Wash rooms for use of school pupils and staff.\n\n(4) Power House\n\nIt is suggested that the buildings be heated throughout, with steam heating and that this steam be piped to them from a centrally located power house. It is suggested that a small room be provided as living quarters for the Engineer.\n\nIt is recommended that buildings 1 and 2 and 3 be joined by fireproof corridors. As Teallin is located in the coldest part of Canada it is felt that some provision will have to be made for providing covered approaches to these buildings.\n\nI would recommend also that a meeting be held between your Architects and our school officials to finalize the exact details of the building required.\n\n(sgd) R.A.

We have already been in contact with you concerning the site for this school. You are requested to prepare the plans and specifications for these buildings and to finalize their exact location.\n\nThe pupilage to be provided for at this school will be 120 (60 boys and 60 girls). Due to the isolation of this school it is felt that frame construction should be used but that the dormitories should be in separate buildings, in order to minimize the danger from fire.\n\nIt is felt that the school should consist of the following buildings:\n\n(1) Boys' Dormitory Block consisting of\n\n(a) Sleeping quarters for 60 boys\n(b) Two staff rooms\n(c) Wash rooms\n(d) Recreation room\n(e) Manual training shop\n\nIt is suggested that this be a one-storey building with a full basement. The sleeping quarters, staff rooms and wash rooms could be on the main floor with the recreation room and manual training shop in the basement.\n(2) Girls' Dormitory Block\n\nThe general planning of this building would be as for the boys' dormitory block with the exception of course being the manual training room. In the girls' block this would be replaced by a domestic science room which should have extra electrical outlets provided for a power sewing machine and electrical rangettes.\n\n(3) Administration Building:\n\nThis would be the main building of the group and could be of two stories in height with a full basement also. We would require the following rooms in this building:\n\n(a) Principals quarters\n(b) Staff quarters for six\n(c) Chapel\n(d) Four classrooms\n(e) Kitchen and dining room\n(f) Wash rooms for use of school pupils and staff.\n\n(4) Power House:\n\nIt is suggested that the buildings be heated throughout, with steam heating and that this steam be piped to them from a centrally located power house.

I greatly appreciate the deep interest you have manifested in all matters brought to your attention.\n\n1. - I fully understand your attitude in regard to sending our Indian children to a school in Alaska.\n\n2. - I was given assurance before leaving Ottawa that our Catholic Residential School in Teslin would be built next summer; as the season is short, however, and the estimates have first to be approved by the House, may I suggest that the plans be already prepared to gain time, and submissions asked from various contractors in Edmonton or in Vancouver, so as to gain time, in the event that the budget be voted too late. The work on the school should not begin later than June 15 or July 1st, if anything worthwhile is to be built in 1948.\n\nThe Sisters of Saint Ann who have already worked for sixty years along the Yukon River among the natives have definitely accepted to come and work in the proposed school. I would appreciate that a copy of the plans be sent to them, at their Mother House, in case they have some practical suggestion to make to the Branch for the best possible disposition of the rooms. Their address is: Rev. Mother M. Berenice, Superior General Sisters of Saint Ann, Lachine, P.Q.\n\n3. - I understand that Mr. John McIsaac intends to go shortly to Ottawa about the same time as Mr. McDougall, who knows him very well; he will call at your office and will give you interesting data on both the Haines and the Canol Roads,\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6482, file 942-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nwell as on the proposed road to Atlin.\n\nYours sincerely in Christ,\n\n(Signed) J.L.Coudert, O.M.I.

In this connection I may say that Bennett & White Construction Company of Vancouver is willing to undertake the construction of this school on a cost-plus fixed fee basis. Moreover, I have word from the President of the White Pass Company that his company would do the work under an arrangement of this kind.\n\nFrom our discussions with Mr. Buck, it seems that he has not even prepared a preliminary sketch of the structure, and evidently if he had no other job in hand it would take him two months to get ready the plans and specifications that should be furnished to a contractor.\n\nI discussed this subject briefly on the telephone today with the Director of the Indian Affairs Branch, Mr. Hoey, and also with Colonel Neary who is in charge of education and welfare for that branch. Mr. Hoey said that he did not think it should be necessary to prepare complete new plans and specifications for each building erected for the Indian Affairs Branch and that we might use at places like Teslin any building designs which had proven satisfactory elsewhere. Colonel Neary told me that for reasons of fire protection it is desired to have these new schools built in four separate units and that the situation is about as follows:\n\n(1) The school rooms are to be identical with a satisfactory design prepared for a school at Shubenacadie.\n(2) The dormitories for the girls and for the boys are to be of simplest construction so long as reasonable facilities are provided and safety guaranteed as far as possible.\n\n(3) For the administrative building they are prepared to accept the design of the school at Alberni.\n\n(4) It will be necessary to design a central heating plant. I believe that oil is to be used at Teslin but that coal will be used in the other groups of school buildings which are to be designed for Lac la Ronge, Norway House and Seven Islands. Indian Affairs Branch seems to be of the impression that for the four schools it should not be necessary to design more than two sets of plans.\n\n(5) One thing that is important is the availability of an adequate water supply. I think we should lose no time in verifying the sites of these buildings. A wire should be sent to Mr. MacDougall to look over the Teslin site.\n\n(6) I shall get in touch with the Deputy Minister's office at once about the services of architects in private practice whose services could be obtained for the designs. Probably the design could best be made by Ottawa architects and the supervision in the field done by the nearest reliable firm to the place where the work is to be done.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, January 24, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Mills,\n\nRe - Indian Residential School,\nTeslin, Yukon Territory.\n\nThere is urgent need for the early construction of this school which is estimated to cost in the neighbourhood of $200,000. It is likely that the job will be done by contract on a cost-plus-fixed-fee basis.\n\nOur problem is supervision. We are very short of qualified architects and engineers and we cannot afford to assign anyone full time to this particular project. On the other hand, we know from discussions which we have had about Whitehorse buildings that your department is well organized to carry on or to supervise construction activities in this area. Moreover, the construction of typically northern buildings would seem to be along the line of training.\n\nUnder these circumstances, I venture to bespeak your co-operation. I would ask that your department assume the responsibility for inspection and continuous supervision of construction of operations which will be arranged under contract. The accounting problem will be taken care of by the Comptroller of the Treasury. If, as we hope, you are able to agree to undertake the supervision feature for us, we will be glad if you will let us know as quickly as possible and we will ask the Indian Agent for the district to get in touch with your command at Whitehorse to facilitate the assembling of topographical and other site data required immediately.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd) H.L. Keenleyside.\nDeputy Minister.\n\nW.G. Mills, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Minister of National Defence,\nOttawa.\nExtract from letter from Most Rev. J.L. Coudert dated February 5, 1948 - Original on file 158-5-1\n\nN.B. Owing to the difficulties of communication with Telegraph Creek, I doubt whether all the children of school age will be able to be recruited for the Teslin School from that area, outside of the orphans and destitute children, unless they are brought in Teslin by special chartered plane every summer and fall. Plane communications are, indeed, the only normal communications with that part of our Vicariate Apostolic. Even if they are sent by boat via Wrangel in Alaska, they will not be able to travel by boat from Wrangel to Skagway - the only passenger boats in that part of the alaskan panhandle being Canadian steamers, which are forbidden to carry passengers from an American port to an American port. When our missionaries travel this way, they have to fly from Wrangel to Skagway, and then take the train from Skagway to Whitehorse. The only Direct communication from Telegraph Creek to Teslin is, therefore, by air, and, everything considered, it is the shortest and cheapest way.\n\nThis communication problem between Telegraph Creek and Teslin will have to be thoroughly studied and settled by the Officials of the Branch when the Boarding School at Teslin is in operation next year.\n\nHoping that the above information will prove useful to you and the other officials of the Branch to enable you to understand the unique situation of that part of the country, I assure you once more of my earnest desire fully to cooperate with the Branch for the welfare of the natives of our Apostolic Vicariate.\nOttawa, February 7, 1948.\n\nMr. Jackson\n\nRe - Indian Residential School, Teslin\n\nAs you know our Deputy Minister has written to the Deputy Minister of National Defence asking whether that department will be willing to undertake the supervision of the construction of this school. We are asking authority to engage Mr. Noffke to prepare the plans. So far we know of two contractors who would be willing to undertake the construction, i.e., the White Pass Company with whom we have had very satisfactory dealings, and the Bennett and White Construction Company which has done a considerable amount of building for the Department of Transport.\n\nYou will understand that we prefer to deal with contractors who have had experience in this remote locality. Will you please let me know whether these two firms are approved for government business, also whether any additional names can be added to the list. Arrangements will be made on a cost-plus-fixed-fee basis.\n\nDirector.\nDEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL DEFENSE\nArmy\n\nOTTAWA, Canada, 9 February, 1948.\n\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. Keenleyside:\n\nReference is made to your letter dated 24 January, 1948, soliciting the aid of this Department in supervising the construction of the Indian Residential School, Teslin, Yukon Territory.\n\nMay I advise you that this Department will assume responsibility for inspection and supervision of the construction of this project as requested in your letter of 24 January, 1948.\n\nIt is requested that your Indian Agent be advised to contact the Commander Northwest Highway System at Whitehorse to arrange any local details, while if any problems arise in Ottawa, Major Stevens of the Directorate of Works and Accommodation should be contacted at local 7949.\n\nIn order that the supervision of this project may be carried out in an efficient manner, it is considered advisable that plans and specifications for the Indian School be forwarded at as early a date as possible to enable personnel charged with the responsibility of inspection of construction to become familiar with the details.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) James A.

Emery, that coal from the government sponsored mine at Carmacks can be brought upstream by barge; the probable selling price at Whitehorse will be $17.00 per ton. It is about 110 miles from the wharf to site of proposed school. Present hauling rate is .10\u00a2 per ton mile. The final price of $28.00 per ton will vary considerably until all phases of this new enterprise have been worked out.\n\nWood sells at an average of $16.00 per cord. It is generally considered that one ton of coal is the equivalent of two cords of wood. It would appear probable that a slight saving in cost of fuel will be obtained by the use of coal. Any further information in this regard will be communicated to you.\n\n(RVJ. Meek)\nSupt.

MacDonald\nFrudham Company\nA.M. Berry & Co.,\n914 McLeod Bldg.\n\nThis for your information.\n\n'Sgd.' W.J.F. Pratt.\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nMr. Gibson\nFor your information.\n\n'Sgd.' C.W.J.\nDomestic hot water should be heated by means of an indirect steam fed heater connected through a pressure reducing valve from the high pressure header, for winter service. The storage tank should be located in the boiler house, and the water circulated to the buildings by means of a relatively inexpensive circulating pump. For summer service when laundry operations do not require the daily use of the high pressure boiler, a high test jacket heater should be provided to heat domestic hot water.\n\nIt is understood that electrical energy will be provided by diesel generating equipment located in the power house.\n\nThe above outline describes a simple high pressure heating design, the advantage of which far outweigh those which may be gained by low pressure service. Should Indian Affairs wish at some time in the future to increase the size of the institution, a plant such as outlined would be flexible enough to handle a reasonable additional load without adding to the equipment.\n\nIndian Affairs will be advised that well qualified operating personnel will be imperative.\n\nRegarding the project generally, Mr. Buck advises that after contacting the Directorate of Works and Accommodation, Department of National Defence, the data that has already been requested from the Commander, Northwest Highway System, is expected in Ottawa about June 10th, and it is therefore, reasonable to expect that copies of such data can be furnished you about the 15th instant. This would possibly enable you to complete working drawings and specifications by your estimated date of June 30th next.\n\nWe will write you further within the next few days regarding the preparation of an agreement between the crown and yourself at which time we will also discuss the matter of obtaining blueprints of the drawings and copies of the specification required for inviting tenders.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nT.S. Mills,\nChief Engineer.\nOttawa, February 17, 1948.\n\nMr. Jackson\n\nRe - Indian Affairs Branch Building Program\n\nWe are engaging Mr. Noffke, local architect, to prepare plans and specifications for the construction of the following schools -\n\n(a) Teslin, Yukon Territory,\n(b) Norway House, Manitoba,\n(c) Lake la Ronge, Saskatchewan,\n(d) Seven Islands, Quebec.\n\nThe first project will be supervised by the Department of National Defence but we should have the names of architects who could supervise the construction of the other three.\n\nFor all four projects we should have the names of contractors who can be invited to quote on terms of construction.\n\nYou have given us the name of an architect to supervise the construction of the Indian Day School at Caughnawaga. We should have as soon as possible lists of contractors who can be asked to quote on this job.\n\nI presume you have supplied Mr. Hoey already with a list of contractors who can be asked to quote on the construction of the small day schools which it has been the custom to have constructed under the supervision of the Indian Agents.\n\nDirector.\nEX'D.\n\nA.\n\nOttawa, February 24, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, British Columbia.\n\nEducation - Stikine Agency.\n\nReference your 13-11-1 of February 1st.\n\nThe correspondence and reports attached to your letter of February 4th have received consideration here at some length. Our Educational Survey Officer recommended the following educational improvements which might affect the Stikine Agency:\n\n(1) The construction of a Residential School at Teslin, Yukon.\n(2) The enlargement and improvement of a Residential School at Carcross.\n\nHis other recommendations have resulted in the opening of day schools at Whitehorse and Mayo. However, he did not cover the Northern British Columbia area. On further discussion with Major Mackay this morning, it is felt that Inspector Davey should consider the possibility of making an Educational Survey of this area.\n\nThe Residential School at Teslin should be constructed this summer if all goes well, with a proposed pupilage of one hundred and twenty. Arrangements have been made by our Lands and Development Services Branch to have this building constructed under the supervision of Canadian Army engineers. However, we will keep you advised as to the progress made with regard to this building in view of the large number of children from Northern British Columbia who will probably attend.\nWe have also had a request for another R.C. Residential School at Fort St. John. However, no action has been taken with regard to this proposal and none will be taken until Inspector Davey has had an opportunity of surveying the situation.\n\nMajor MacKay mentioned that he had discussed the matter with Inspector Davey and suggested that at least a month would be necessary for such a trip. It is expected that it will be mid-June before this survey can be carried out.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFN/HM.\nMarch 11, 1948.\n\nMr. R. J. Meek, Indian Agent,\nWhitehorse, Yukon.\n\nTeslin Indian Residential School.\n\nPlans are proceeding for the construction of this school during the 1948 summer. It is understood that this project will be supervised by the Department of National Defence as their engineers are carrying out work along the highway and will be able to provide supervision of the contractor's work.\n\nI am advised by our Lands and Development Services Branch that plans and specifications are being rushed to completion and that they hope to engage a contractor as soon as these are completed.\n\nIn discussion with the Chief Architect of the Lands and Development Services Branch, he suggested that I write to you and inform you that you will very likely be hearing directly from this branch with regard to certain phases of this work. Therefore, you can anticipate receiving letters from Mr. Mills or Mr. Buck, of the Lands and Development Services Branch, with reference to the clearing of the site, the engaging of some Indian labour, etc. It would be appreciated if you could do everything possible to assist the Lands and Development Services Branch, the Department of National Defence, and the contractors in clearing any difficulties which might arise in connection with this project.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nCopy sent to Mr. Buck\nOttawa, March 11, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS and DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH,\n\nTeslin Indian Residential School -\n\nWe appreciate being advised by you with regard to the engagement of Mr. Neffke, local architect, to prepare plans and specifications for the construction of the Teslin Residential School, Y. T.\n\nIt is understood that you are already in contact with certain contractors who are interested in this project.\n\nLast year we hired a local mover to transport building materials from certain former army camps along the Alaska Highway to the proposed site of the school. We were advised by Mr. Indian Agent Meek at Whitehorse, Y. T., that there was much salvageable material in certain of these army camps and construction camps and much of it would be useful in constructing the proposed residential school.\n\nPlease find attached a detailed list of the materials and equipment which was salvaged and which is now stored at Fox Creek (the proposed site of the school). The only exception is the electrical fixtures which are in care of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at Teslin. Tarps have been placed over the wallboard and all lumber has been piled in a neat and orderly fashion. The R.C.M.P. are checking on this stored material on their patrols up and down the highway.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Meek has drawn our attention particularly to the 10,000 square feet of wallboard and 5,000 square feet of rubberoid which were saved in very good order. You will\nalso find attached a plan of the roof trusses which were salvaged as is. One hundred and six pieces were recovered from one mess hall and 78 pieces from Camp 6 at Johnston's Crossing. It is felt that this list of materials will be of assistance to the contractor who is awarded the tender for this project. If any further information is required, we will be only too glad to have it furnished by Mr. Indian Agent Meek.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, March 13, 1948.\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nRE: Teslin Indian Residential School\n\nThanks for the information supplied in your memorandum of the 11th instant.

We would, therefore, for the present, still vouch for a furnace heated by wood, at least for the general heating system of the buildings.\n\nOil tankers travel regularly along the Highway, and therefore will go right by the door of the school; I think that we could obtain at a reasonable price fuel oil from the B.Y.N.

They would seem to be very widely separated. Of course I realize the fire hazard and am willing to abide by your more expert advisers in this regard.\n\n(b) The buildings seem too large for the pupilage and staff. There will only be 120 Indian children in attendance. This point has been settled with Bishop Coudert. We have also wired him re the number of Sisters and male staff members for whom accommodation should be provided. His answer read as follows:\n\n\"Besides private bedroom to be provided in each of four dormitories in proposed Teslin school suggest eight separate bedrooms for sisters and six separate male bedrooms.\"\n\n(2) ADMINISTRATION BUILDING\n\n(a) Main Floor.\n\n(i) Kitchen. I would ask that the actual planning of the kitchen be referred to the Nutrition Division\nof the Department of National Health and Welfare. They are vitally interested in all matters concerning the diet and feeding facilities at our residential schools and I feel that the architect should 'phone Dr. Pett at 9-3103 and arrange for one of his dietitians to go over these kitchen plans when they are ready.\n\n(ii) Dining Room. It is noted that the capacity of the dining room is one hundred and ninety-two children. Please note my general comment above with regard to the pupilage of this school being only one hundred and twenty.\n\n(iii) Auditorium. We try to keep these residential school plans as standard as possible. It is common practice for the assembly hall, or auditorium, to be used as a chapel by the various denominations. Therefore, steps can be placed in front of the stage so as to enable it to be used as a sanctuary.\n\n(b) First Floor.\n\nThe chapel should be eliminated as it is our intention to use the auditorium as a combined assembly hall and chapel. This is done in all our other schools and we feel that it would be much too expensive to provide both an assembly hall and a chapel.\n\n(c) Second Floor.\n\nThis floor should be eliminated entirely. The sick bay could quite easily be placed on the first floor where the chapel is now located.\n\nThe sick bay need only have the following accommodation:\n\nBoys' infirmary and bathroom\nGirls' infirmary and bathroom\nNurses' room\nFirst Aid room\nJanitor's closet\nLinen closet.\n(3) **DORMITORIES**\n\n(a) **Basement.**\n\nThis is quite satisfactory on the whole but the building will have to be smaller in view of our recommendations of the next paragraph.\n\n(b) **Ground Floor.**\n\nIt is noted that the dormitory has a capacity for ninety-six children. This is much too large and it can be reduced to a pupilage of sixty for each dormitory. It is not necessary to provide two separate bathrooms for the supervisors; one will be quite sufficient.\n\n(4) **CLASSROOM BUILDING**\n\nThe classroom building is quite satisfactory and we have no comment to make concerning it. It is suggested that cupboards be placed in the two teachers' rooms for the storage of books and other classroom materials.\n\n(5) **BOILER ROOM**\n\nWe approve entirely of having the small living quarters attached as shown.\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6482, file 942-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nVeuillez exp\u00e9dier la d\u00e9p\u00eache suivante aux conditions mentionn\u00e9es au verso auxquelles je consens par les pr\u00e9sentes.\n\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nOttawa April 14, 1948\n\nMost Reverend J.

They are quite a departure from our ordinary conception of residential schools as these were built in the past, but I heartily approve of the plans, and I feel sure that both the Principal and the Sisters who will have charge of this school, will be very well satisfied with them.\n\nThere are a few changes which I would like to bring to your attention, as far as the auditorium is concerned. It will be used by the Church as a Catholic chapel and, therefore, the sanctuary part should receive a different treatment from that given to an ordinary auditorium. I have explained this to Mr. Noffke, and I am now enclosing a rough draft of the changes which I would like incorporated in the plans whenever they are used for Catholic schools. The cost will not be material and will give greater satisfaction to our people.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O.

In such a design, the following equipment would be necessary:\n\n(a) Two high pressure steam steel fire fox boilers.\n(b) One receiving tank.\n(c) One blow-off tank.\n(d) One motor driven boiler feed pumps.\n(e) One domestic hot water storage tank.\n(f) One indirect steam fed heater with one extra separator tube element.\n(g) One circulating pump.\n(h) One high test jacket heater for summer service.\n(i) One stoker with control equipment.\n(j) Additional miscellaneous auxiliary equipment to complete the hook-up as required by Provincial and Interprovincial Regulations, covering high pressure steam plants.\n\nOne High pressure steam main should be taken from the boiler room and carried through the covered passage to the Administration building with branches to each of the other buildings. A pressure reducing valve and a vacuum return line pump will be required for each building. A High pressure line taken from the main distribution line should be extended into the laundry and branched to the various items of equipment requiring such service.\n\nW.E.

A. Hoey, Director of the Indian Affairs Branch of this Department, who wishes to ascertain the availability of Carmacks coal, also the price at Teslin, Y. T., for a supply to meet the heating requirements of an Indian residential school for 120 pupils, which it is intended to erect there. The school will consist of a number of buildings with a central heating plant.\n\nThe above would be an important market as we understand verbally that the requirements will probably amount to 1,000 to 1,100 tons per year. Construction of the buildings is expected to start next fall and some coal may be required next winter or in the early spring.\n\nWe would appreciate hearing as soon as possible what reply can be made to Mr. Hoey, as the design of the buildings and heating plant is in hand.

Timm,\nDirector.\nMemorandum to: Mr. R. A. Hoey,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources.\n\nRe: Coal Supply for Teslin Indian Residential School\n\nI am glad to have Mr. Allan's further memorandum of June 4th, giving comments from Indian Superintendent Meek in regard to the above subject. I am attaching copy of a letter dated June 8th from Mr. F. M. Connell, who is President of United Keno Hill Mines, Limited, as well as of Yukon Coal Company. The main problem of providing coal to the school at Teslin is apparently the obtaining of transportation from Carmacks to Whitehorse and you will note that Mr. Johnston, who is Mr. Connell's Consulting Engineer, was leaving for the Yukon and will investigate what can be done.\n\nIn the letter of the previous day, Mr. Connell gave me the following price schedule for coal F.O.B. the mine at Carmacks:\n\n| Description                  | Price per ton |\n|------------------------------|---------------|\n| Graded and sacked            | $12.50        |\n| Run of mine (sacked)         | $10.00        |\n| Run of mine (loose)          | $8.00         |\n\n(The cost of sacks extra with the understanding that price to be refunded on return)\n\nIt is noted that Mr. Meek has given you a probable selling price at Whitehorse of $17.00 per ton. If his quotation was based on the graded and sacked domestic coal which Mr. Connell quotes at $12.50 per ton Carmacks, the price would allow only $4.50 per ton for the transportation from Carmacks upstream to Whitehorse and we question whether that would be sufficient. The transportation downstream from Carmacks to Dawson, which appears to be a slightly greater distance, is quoted at $7.50 per ton according to the information in our files. Mr. Connell has stated that the navigation company has so far not set any rate from Carmacks to Whitehorse.\n\nWhile insufficient may have been allowed for the transportation to Whitehorse, it would seem, on the other hand, that Mr. Meek's quotation of $11.00 per ton for hauling on the Alaska Highway from Whitehorse to Teslin, 110 miles, is a very high figure.\n\nI think you will be interested in the following quotation from a progress report by Mr. George Miller, Mine Manager, as just received:\n\n\"Quality of Coal. Coal from underground has been used in the camp all winter and represents a very good average sample of all the development faces to date. Domestic coal plus # product has been used in the camp cook stove and has proved to be a wonderful fuel for cooking. It burns...\"\ncompletely to a fine ash and gives off great heat. Two coal burning heaters are used to heat the rest of the camp, an area of 100' x 20'. Run of mine coal is used in these heaters. Although tons of coal have been fed to each heater all winter, the grates have never been dug out at any time nor has a clinker or piece of slate been picked out of either one. All that has been necessary to do is give the grates a slight shake. The ash is very fine and is estimated to be about 9-10%. A great heat with long flame is given off from the run of mine product.\n\nThe eventual cost of coal at Teslin will, of course, depend upon whether you will require graded or run of mine coal for the school. While the information I have given you is not very definite as to what the delivered price would be, you nevertheless have a fairly close indication and I should like to know your reaction in regard to the price and the using of coal rather than wood for heating of the school. If I had your thoughts on the matter, it might enable me to exert more pressure upon Mr. Connell in regard to making arrangements for delivery of coal to Whitehorse from this Government assisted project. It seems to me that the market available from Whitehorse, including the railway, will be large and that some arrangement for the upstream transportation will have to be made as rapidly as possible.\n\nI shall advise you further as soon as I learn the outcome of Mr. Johnston's present trip.\n\nW.

A. Hoey, Director of Indian Affairs Branch, for coal to meet the heating requirements for a school at Teslin. I wrote you yesterday reporting progress by Mr. George Miller in marketing coal in Dawson and Mayo area.\n\nThe question of delivery of coal in Whitehorse has been discussed with the officials of the White Pass and Yukon, and they claim they have not the equipment (boats and barges) to handle both ore and concentrates from Mayo and coal from Carmacks. The United Keno Hill Mines Limited, under the circumstances, cannot press for delivery of coal to Whitehorse, as they have 5,000 to 6,000 tons of ore and concentrates to be transported to Whitehorse and it is very essential that nothing interfere with the transportation company in making delivery to Whitehorse.\n\nMr. A. W. Johnston left today for the Yukon, and he will discuss the situation with the White Pass. As soon as I hear from him I will let you know what they can do.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd.) F. M.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Teslin Residential School - Fuel Supply\nFile 166-15-5\n\nDear Mr. Neary;\n\nI have your communication of July 7 with enclosed copies\nof a correspondence between the Officials of the Yukon Coal Company\nand Mr. R.A. Hoey regarding the Fuel Supply for the proposed School\nof Teslin.\n\nI have recently made a trip to Dawson and had occasion to\nvisit the said Coal Mine at Carmacks; and the information I gathered\nfrom Mr. George Miller, the engineer in charge, corresponded exactly to\nyour own information on the subject. The coal is there, and in big\nquantity, and appears to be very good for domestic use, but the great\ndifficulty is the transportation; the only freighting Company on the\nYukon River is the White Pass, and with all their steamers and barges\nthey will barely be able to handle the silver ore concentrates piled\non the shore at Mayo and Minto before the winter season.\n\nUntil the transportation company is properly organized to handle\nthe coal on the river or here in Whitehorse, there is little chance to\ndepend on that supply for the school.\n\nFrom my experience with other schools in the North, I think that\nyour figure of 1000 tons per year is abnormally high; I was figuring on\nsome 600 cords of wood or 400 tons of coal for the needs of our school\nper year.\n\nAt any rate, my present suggestion is the same as the one pre-\nviously made, viz., that we should use wood for the first years until the\ncoal situation is clarified; it seems to me that the change from wood\nto coal could be made with a very slight alteration in the grates of\nthe same furnaces.\n\nI am really sorry that the work has not yet started; we have\nbeen enjoying the best weather the Yukon ever had in years for the past\nsix weeks; it would have been an ideal weather for the laying of the foun-\ndation and all the outside work to be performed in the open. I still firmly\nhope that the cement foundations of all the buildings will be laid in August\nbefore the September frosts start.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBishop J.L. Coudert O.M.I.\nVic. Ap.of Whitehorse\nMemorandum to: Mr. R. A. Hoey,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRe: Coal Supply for Teslin Indian Residential School.\n\nUnder date of June 12 I have provided you with a memorandum in regard to the above subject and mentioned that Mr. A. W. Johnston, Consulting Engineer for Mr. F. M. Connell, was leaving for the Yukon.\n\nIn Toronto a few days ago Mr. W. H. Norrish had a chat with Mr. Johnston who expressed the view that a coal supply for the Indian School to be built at Teslin should not be depended upon for the coming winter. Mr. Johnston thought that a wood supply should be laid in but that it might be possible to provide a small quantity of coal for trial during the coming winter.\n\nWe now have a copy of a report dated July 13 which Mr. Johnston has written for Mr. Connell, in which he states that coal from the mine at Carmacks has now started moving to Mayo and to Dawson, but that movement is slow because of a lack of barge space. While the White Pass and Yukon Route anticipates being able to move substantial quantities of coal to Dawson and Mayo during this navigation season, the delivery of coal to Whitehorse, on the other hand, is problematical. Mr. Johnston states that after several conferences with the White Pass and Yukon on this point, they feel they can give no assurance of carrying any appreciable tonnage upstream to Whitehorse this season due to congestion on the boats and barges. It is hoped that towards the end of the season some coal may be moved upriver, but Mr. Johnston says that householders and other potential users should not count upon coal this season. He also indicates that Yukon Coal is expecting the market on the river and upstream to Whitehorse to become very important, with White Pass and Yukon potential users of 10,000 to 15,000 tons of the Carmacks coal per year.\n\nAs far as the future is concerned, it would appear that Yukon Coal will be definitely making every effort to get into the Whitehorse market and to have coal available for such potential customers as the Teslin school. Mr. Rogers, President of the White Pass and Yukon, is stated to be very interested in the whole matter and realizes the necessity of providing barges especially for the coal movement.\n\nJ.R. Kerboonee\n\nW. B. Timm,\nDirector.\nOttawa, Canada, July 22, 1948.\n\nMemorandum to:\nMr. R. A. Gibson,\nDirector of Lands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Development of Tantalus Butte Coal Mine, Yukon Territory\n\nWe gave you a memorandum on the above subject under date of July 6, 1948, and you may be interested to learn that we have information now that coal from the mine at Carmacks has definitely started to move to Mayo and to Dawson. Mr. A.W. Johnston, Consulting Engineer for Mr. F.M. Connell, President of Yukon Coal Company, reporting to Mr. Connell after date of July 13, states that at the time of his visit approximately 2,000 tons of sacked coal were ready for shipment, of which amount 1,400 tons was mine run and 600 tons domestic screen coal. Mr. Johnston stated that, although little coal had gone down the river due to lack of barge space, the White Pass and Yukon Route anticipated that the requirements of Dawson and Mayo could be met this year. These requirements would involve the delivery of at least 1,000 tons to each of the two points. He also reported that delivery of coal to Whitehorse this season was very problematical, although attempts would be made to get small quantities delivered to Whitehorse before the close of the navigation season. Efforts would be made to provide 200 tons to the White Pass and Yukon for trial in locomotives and river boats. Mr. Johnston placed the potential use of Carmacks coal by the White Pass and Yukon at 10,000 to 15,000 tons of coal per year.\n\nWe have been especially interested in the outlook for getting coal up to Whitehorse this year, particularly as Mr. Hoey has been interested in the possibilities of obtaining coal for an Indian residential school to be erected at Teslin. In a current memorandum to Mr. Hoey we have indicated that the prospects for this year are not good and that a wood supply would apparently need to be laid in for the proposed school, although some coal may possibly be provided for trial next winter.\n\nIt appears from Mr. Johnston's discussions that Mr. Rogers, President of the White Pass and Yukon, is now most interested in the new coal mine and the possibilities for large scale utilization of its product. Mr. Johnston states that Mr. Rogers realizes the necessity for additional barges on the Yukon River primarily designed to carry bulk coal. In conversation with Mr. Norrish in Toronto a few days ago, Mr. Johnston thought that the White Pass and Yukon would probably take action next winter to have a number of special barges built for the coal business.\n\n(sgd.)

From your visit to Mr. Noffke, you will be aware that we intend to locate the school fairly close to the highway. This is the site which has been agreed upon by the engineers and upon which they have conducted their topographical survey. What worries me is that a change in the site might cause a delay in the erection of this school.\n\nThe engineers of the Department of National Defence have obtained complete data on the selected site and have forwarded this information to their own engineers and architects. If a change is made in the site and it is decided to move it closer to the lake, I do not know but that a delay will be encountered in having another survey made of the new area when ground conditions permit in the Spring.\n\nI would be pleased to hear from you concerning your attitude towards this problem.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nTeslin Residential School Location\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nI have your communication of Dec. 23 regarding the Residential School Location in Teslin.\n\nThe proposed ground or area of school has been thoroughly surveyed twice, and lines have been cut through and through the property at given distances, and I do not think that such an elaborate work would have to be gone over again, no matter where the building is erected, as long as it is on said property.\n\nAs a matter of fact, since the plans of the proposed school have been so radically altered and we are going to have only one or two buildings at most, instead of four or five, the exact location of the proposed building still remains to be decided upon.\n\nMy main objection to the first plan of the engineers was:\n\n1. They had the main building facing North-East and looking towards a high nearby mountain, without any chance of sunshine on the main front of the building for six months of the year.\n\nBy turning the building right around, it would face the South-West and enjoy a unique scenery over Lake Teslin, with the full benefit of every ray of sunshine available in the winter time.\n\nn.b.-all the Residential schools I know which have been built near a lake, such as Lejac, Kenora, Fort Chipewyan, Fort Resolution, Grouard, Calais or Sturgeon Lake, Joussard, etc., etc., are all facing the nearby lake.\n\n2. The location pointed out by the engineers, close to the Alaska Highway:\n\na.-will necessitate the destruction of a beautiful spruce and jackpine grove (the only one on the property) which would have made an ideal park for the children during the summer months, would have given the school a little privacy from all indiscreet visitors, and protect the school from the heavy clouds of smoke and dust arising from the Alaska Highway during the summer.\n\nb.-it will increase the cost of excavating for the water line and the cost of operation of the same by putting the school uselessly too far away from the lake shore.\n\nn.b.-Major Clarke can tell you, on the other hand, that closer to the lake, there is an ideal high ground, already cleared and almost level. I deeply regret that the engineers who have suggested a different location have never consulted me nor Father Dream, who was readily available at Teslin.\n\nSo, unless they have a very serious objection to the location...\nVICARIATE APOSTOLIC OF WHITEHORSE\n\nwe ourselves had in view and which I constantly pointed out to the Government Officials, I still insist that our location is the most satisfactory.\n\nYours sincerely in Christ\n\nBishop J.L. Couder O.M.I.\n\nP.S.-I would advise you to discuss this matter with both Major Clarke and Father Plourde, who have both explored the property, and even arrange a conference between them and the man responsible for the survey, who must be in Ottawa.\n\nAfter seeing the property, Father Plourde was 100% in favor of the location I pointed out to him.\n\nJ.L.C.\nOttawa, January 5, 1949.\n\nMr. R.J.

MacKay,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. MacKay:\n\nI am in receipt of a special and pressing letter from His Excellency Bishop Coudert of White Horse in which he asks me to speak to you about the site of the Teslin School.\n\nAccording to plans which were shown to me and which were also forwarded to the Bishop, the main building will be situated on the Alaska Highway and at a distance of two hundred feet.\n\nThis means that the front of the building comprising the principal's rooms and main offices will face north and has as its only panorama a high mountain which even during the summer months will throw a continuous shadow of darkness. Moreover, the dust on the highway is at all times quite abundant and at a distance of 200 feet will be a real nuisance for the inhabitants of the school.\n\nIn place of the sight which is marked A on the plans, the Bishop suggests placing the school close to the lake on site B where the bank is quite high and where there is no danger of a flood, even during the spring of the year. Moreover, the lake at this point is a thing of beauty. With the sun bathing the front of the building most of the time, living in the school will be a pleasure for both the children and staff.\n\nMay I add that the Bishop is very insistent on this change, as he knows the country very well and he has asked me to place his views before you so that you may study the question of the site once more and if at all possible grant his wishes.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O.

This would give eastern exposure to the front of the building and would provide the most satisfactory light obtainable for the classrooms.\n\nThe location of this school has recently been discussed with Bishop Goudert, O.M.I., and he is quite satisfied with the site. From his knowledge of local conditions, his only suggestion was that the building be moved to the southeast some forty or fifty yards as apparently there is a clearing at this point.

These buildings, in themselves, have little value... But there are many thousand feet of good rough lumber in them, just what our Teslin Indians need to build their houses.\n\nThe Teslin Band is increasing rapidly... Many young couples need a house. A few have started to build in logs, but have been unable to finish for lack of lumber for the roofs and floors. Therefore, if these buildings, owned by...\nthe Department, are no more intended for the school\npurpose, I respectfully request the Department\nof Indian Affairs to release them to the Tsilhqot'in\nIndians rather than to give or sell them to private\nenterprise.\n\nYours Very Truly,\n\nFather A.

The basic plan was a series of single-storey buildings on foundations or basements, heated from a central heating system and supplied with services from a central point. A large H-type building dormitory was designed with accommodation for recreation rooms for the boys and girls respectively. Class rooms were supplied on the idea of day schools - each being a separate building. The staff buildings were separate as well as a mess hall and the chapel.\n\nIf you have not seen this layout, we would be pleased to forward you a preliminary plan and if this proves interesting to your Department, we would be pleased to prepare an estimate of the cost of such a project once you have determined the extent of all work, the sub trades and also the location of your site.\n\nCordially yours,\n\nNORTH AMERICAN BUILDINGS LTD.,\n\nC.J.

George Frederick Kingston, Ph.D., D.D.,\nArchbishop of Nova Scotia,\nPrimate of all Canada\n\n414 Barrington Street,\nHalifax, N.S.,\nJune 24th, 1949.\n\nThe Hon. Colin W.G. Gibson, K.C., M.C.,\nMinister,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Church of England Residential Schools\n\nIt has recently been brought to my attention that the Indian Affairs branch is calling for tenders for the erection of a large residential school at Teslin Yukon Territory to be used by the Roman Catholics. It is understood that the building is to have four floors and be in size about 200' x 67'. A Chapel also is contemplated and is planned to be 64' x 30' in size. The building will house 120 pupils, as well as a number of priests and sisters and is to cost in the neighborhood of $700,000.\n\nI make bold to point out that the Southern Yukon area is a comparatively new field of operation for the Roman Church. On the other hand the Anglican denomination has operated an educational institution for the Indians of Southern Yukon since 1903. at Carcross. In April of 1939 the Carcross School, a government owned building, was burned and because of the urgencies of war was not replaced by Government. In 1944 however, the Anglican Church, at no cost to Government, rebuilt the present structure so that the educational needs of the Indians might be met. Archbishop Adams and The Indian School Administration Office have stressed with Indian Affairs Branch the urgent need for rebuilding and enlarging the Carcross school but to no avail. It is very disconcerting to us to find that a comparatively new group in the area is being so elaborately cared for while we who have toiled under adverse circumstances are being wholly overlooked in our pleas for assistance.\nTo add weight to the above statement a similar policy seems to prevail in other centres. Last year the Roman Church was built a modern day school at Atikameg where we have had, for many years, a residential school with classroom facilities to care for all the children of the little settlement.\n\nThen too down the years a number of Church of England Schools have been burned. The Mackay School, the Pas in March 1933; Onion Lake School, Saskatchewan, November 1943; Wasbasca School, January 1945 and Lac la Ronge School in Saskatchewan in February of 1947. Mackay school has never been replaced. To take the place of the Onion Lake School the Indian Affairs Branch rents for our use a most inadequate building in Prince Albert. Wabasca School was replaced by the Church in the purchase of a number of odd buildings. Now the Government is building a new School at Wabasca, granted, but two years later than promised and without many necessary features. Just recently we were informed that the two playrooms were to be made into classrooms. The Principal's residence is more than half a mile from the School and out of sight of the building. A make-shift replacement for Lac la Ronge was given us at an army camp on the outskirts of Prince Albert where our operational costs are extremely high and where promises take the place of actual alterations in the structure of the buildings to convert them into decent living quarters.\n\nThen too it can be stated that in cooperation with the Government's policy of establishing day schools on some reserves our Church has closed two of its residential schools, namely at Chapleau, Ontario and Elkhorn, Manitoba. I cannot recall of the Roman Church thus cooperating.\n\nWe were led to believe that this summer would see the erection of a Hostel at or near Lac la Ronge and a new classroom block at Alert Bay for the use of Anglican Indian Pupils. We are told now that funds are not available but the government, apparently, can afford to erect a $700,000. structure for the Roman Church in an area the majority of the people of which are Anglican.\nI feel that after reading the above and checking its accuracy you will agree that the Anglican has justifiable cause in protesting the erection of such an expensive institution at Teslin when many of our requests might well have had priority. I sincerely trust that you will see your way clear to have justice done and I would appreciate having your comments.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.) George Frederick Nova Scotia\nArchbishop of Nova Scotia\nand Primate of All Canada.\n\nGFNS:MC\nOttawa, July 4, 1949.\n\nThe Most Reverend George F. Kingston, M.A., Ph.D., D.D.,\nArchbishop of Nova Scotia,\nPrimate of All Canada,\nAll Barrington Street,\nHalifax, Nova Scotia.\n\nMy dear Archbishop Kingston:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of June 24 concerning various matters relating to the operation of Indian residential schools by the Church of England.\n\nWe have noted your comments concerning the proposed erection of an Indian Residential School at Teslin, Y.T. While tenders have been called for the erection of this building, no decision has as yet been reached with respect to the awarding of a contract. You can rest assured that the Department does not propose to spend seven hundred thousand dollars or anything approaching such an amount for the erection of this school.\n\nWe are quite aware of the work that has been done by your church in the Southern Yukon. The 1941 census of the Indians in Canada shows that there are some 307 Indians of the Roman Catholic faith in the Yukon. These are mainly situated at Burwash Landing, Pelly Banks, Frances Lake, Watson Lake and Teslin. In addition to the children of these Indians, we had of course planned to provide for the children of the northeast corner of British Columbia. There are some 450 Catholic Indians in this region, including 96 in the Atlin-Teslin Lake area, 75 at Nelson Creek, 42 in the Liard-Frances Lake area, 60 in the Nelson River district and 184 at Tahltan. There are also Indian children in the Peace River district down the Alaska highway.\nas far as Prophet River, who require institutional care.\n\nBefore a decision was reached to erect this school, two separate educational surveys were carried out. Both were in agreement that such an institution was necessary.\n\nWe are aware of the situation at the Carcross Residential School, and as you know, intend to purchase these buildings as the first step in the improvement of the facilities at this institution.\n\nWith regard to your comments on the Whitefish Reserve at Atikmeg, assurance has been given to your officials that we are prepared to erect a day school for the Anglican children, similar in every way to that erected last year for the Roman Catholic children. This is in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 of the Indian Act.\n\nI was disappointed to read your comments concerning the new dormitory block at the Wabasso Residential School. We had been advised that your officials were quite satisfied with this fine new building and our own engineers and inspectors had reported satisfactorily on the work being done by the contractor. It is not our intention to have the children use the playrooms as classrooms unless it is so recommended by your principal.\n\nI have noted your comments concerning the closing of Indian residential schools. You have apparently been misinformed with respect to the fact that the Roman Catholic Church has never closed any of its institutions. The former Youville Residential School, near Edmonton, Alberta, is no longer used by Indian pupils and is functioning as an old people's home. Day schools have been erected on the Michel, Stony Plain and Alexander Reserves to replace this residential school. You will find the details of its closing reported in the October 1948 issue of the Indian School Bulletin, which is sent to all Indian day and residential schools in Canada.\n\nOur building programme has been curtailed this summer due to the fact that only fifty per cent of our Departmental\nEstimates were voted by the last session of Parliament. As soon as new funds are made available, it is our intention to proceed with the new classroom block at Alert Bay. The erection of the hostel at Lac La Ronge is pending the results of negotiations with the Saskatchewan Department of Education. As you are aware, Bishop Martin is anxious to have a guarantee that Anglican teachers will be employed in the day school which we propose to have operated by the Provincial Department of Education.\n\nIn conclusion, therefore, may I again draw to your attention the second paragraph of my letter, in which I assured you that no contract has been let for the erection of the Tealin Residential School at such a price as mentioned by you.\n\nYours sincerely,\nOttawa, July 5, 1949.\n\nJ.

We had been advised that your officials were quite satisfied with this fine new building and our own engineers and inspectors had reported satisfactorily on the work being done by the contractor. It is not our intention to have the children use the playrooms as classrooms unless it is so recommended by your principal.\n\nI have noted your comments concerning the closing of Indian residential schools. You have apparently been misinformed with respect to the fact that the Roman Catholic Church has never closed any of its institutions. The former Youville Residential School, near Edmonton, Alberta, is no longer used by Indian pupils and is functioning as an old people's home. Day schools have been erected on the Michel, Story Plain and Alexander Reserves to replace this residential school. You will find the details of its closing reported in the October 1948 issue of the Indian School Bulletin, which is sent to all Indian day and residential schools in Canada.\n\nOur building programme has been curtailed this summer due to the fact that only fifty per cent of our Departmental...\nEstimates were voted by the last session of Parliament. As soon as new funds are made available, it is our intention to proceed with the new classroom block at Alert Bay. The erection of the hostel at Lac la Ronge is pending the results of negotiations with the Saskatchewan Department of Education. As you are aware, Bishop Martin is anxious to have a guarantee that Anglican teachers will be employed in the day school which we propose to have operated by the Provincial Department of Education.\n\nIn conclusion, therefore, may I again draw to your attention the second paragraph of my letter, in which I assured you that no contract has been let for the erection of the Tealin Residential School at such a price as mentioned by you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6432, file 942-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, July 7, 1949.\n\nNorthern Construction Company and\nJ.

Gibson,\nMinister of Mines & Resources,\n\nMy dear Sir:\n\nI have just heard that your branch of Indian Affairs is calling for tenders for the erection of a new residential Indian School at Teslin, Yukon, at a cost of $700,000, to house 120 pupils.\n\nThe majority of Indians in the Yukon Territory are non-Roman Catholic, and frankly the numbers and names of those whom the R.C. authorities claim should be examined. In the last eighteen months I have visited all the larger settlements of Indians. Only at one (Kluane) can they be said to be the ministering Church to the majority. At Teslin, before the opening of a joint English-Indian School, the Anglicans had a greater attendance than at the R.C. School, which on a visit during the winter I noticed was closed. I have also visited Villages, Selkirk, Carmacks, Roos River, Moosehide, Old Crow and Mayo, where I honestly do not believe R.C. adherents number ten all places together. If the Roman Catholics need a school then the site should be much further south than Yukon.\n\nYou are aware of our repeated requests to have the Carcross School enlarged to accommodate the children of parents who wish their children to go there. Because I am convinced that there is no need commensurate with the R.C. Claim to have a school at Teslin, I venture, Sir, thus to address you, and believe me to remain,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.) Walter Kootenay\nFrom The Most Rev. W. R.

The letter is largely the same as the one written by Archbishop Kingston and replied to on July 4th.\n\nHowever as the Minister is away, no time will be lost in having a reply prepared in the Branch.

T.\n\nWhile tenders have been called for the erection of this building, no decision has as yet been reached with respect to the awarding of a contract. You can rest assured that the Department does not propose to spend seven hundred thousand dollars or anything approaching such an amount for the erection of this school.\n\nWe are quite aware of the work that has been done by your Church in the Southern Yukon. The 1944 census of the Indians in Canada shows that there are some 307 Indians of the Roman Catholic faith in the Yukon. These are mainly situated at Burwash Landing, Pelly Banks, Frances Lake, Watson Lake and Tealin. In addition to the children of these Indians, we had of course planned to provide for the children of the northeast corner of British Columbia. There are some 450 Catholic Indians in this region, including 96 in the Atlin-Tealin Lake area, 75 at Nelson Creek, 42 in the Liard-Frances Lake area, 60 in the Nelson River district and 184 at Tahltan. There are also Indian children in the Peace River district down the Alaska highway as far as Prophet River, who require institutional care.\nBefore a decision was reached to erect this school, two separate educational surveys were carried out. Both were in agreement that such an institution was necessary.\n\nWe are aware of the situation at the Carcross Residential School, and as you know, intend to purchase these buildings as the first step in the improvement of the facilities at this institution.\n\nWe have noted your representations that the enlargement of the Carcross Residential School should receive priority over the building of the Teslin School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6482, file 942-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nGeorge Black, K.C.\nBarrister, Solicitor, Notary Public\n\nWhitehorse, Yukon\nJuly 15, 1949\n\nMr. R.A.

Arthur H. SOVEREIGN,\nM.A., D.D.\nPeace River, Alberta.\n\nSynod Office,\nPeace River, Alberta,\n\n12th July, 1949.\n\nThe Hon. Colin W.G. Gibson, K.C., M.C.,\nMinister,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nHonourable and dear Sir:\n\nI have received word that the Department of Indian Affairs is planning to erect an Indian Residential School at Teslin in Yukon Territory for the Roman Catholics at a cost of $700,000. Surely my information must be incorrect, for I can hardly imagine such a project by the Roman Catholic Church in the Teslin area,- especially when the Department has stated that it is not able, due to lack of finances, to build a proper school at Atikameg in the Whitefish Lake area in the Diocese of Athabasca in Northern Alberta.\n\nFor some time, I was Bishop of Yukon with headquarters at Dawson City. At that time, at the beginning of the last decade, there was only one Roman Catholic priest in permanent residence in the whole of the Yukon. I frequently visited Teslin while I was Bishop and there was no Roman Catholic priest there, although sometimes a visit was made by a priest from outside Yukon, but they had practically no Roman Catholic Indians in that area. All the Indians of that district look to the Anglican Church for spiritual administration. We also, at our own cost, provided a school teacher for the children at Teslin for five months of each year. The attendance would average about 30 children and I have been personally present at the school. The Roman Catholics did nothing of this kind for the Indian children.\nOur Indian Residential School buildings at Whitefish Lake in this Diocese in Northern Alberta, are literally falling to pieces. They are all of logs and are absolutely inadequate for the accommodation of the children and staff, yet we have never been able to obtain a sufficient grant from the Department of Indian Affairs for the erection of suitable buildings,- and I assure you that the cost would be far less than $700,000.\n\nThe Department is erecting, this year, a new school for the Anglican children at Wabasca, yet there is no proper residence being provided for the Principal of the Wabasca Indian School. It also is of logs and is in terrible condition. The last time I was there in the Winter I nearly froze to death. The cold was terrible and the wind and cold penetrated the building.\n\nWe have tried to co-operate fully with your Department and we have tried to play the game. How then is the Roman Catholic Church able to obtain a grant of $700,000 for one residential school when the Anglican Church goes begging for a school at Whitefish Lake which would cost not more than one-seventh of the above amount?\n\nMoreover, as I have pointed out, practically all of the Teslin Indians were Anglican and I do not suppose they have changed since the last decade.\n\nI know you will forgive me as I point out this seeming injustice and lack of proportion in the granting of funds for buildings and equipment which would be used in the care of our Indian wards.\n\nWith every good wish, believe me,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA. H. Soversign Bishop\nMEMORANDUM\n\nJuly 19, 1949.\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER:\n\nAttention - Director of Indian Affairs\n\nAttached hereto is a letter addressed to the Minister on July 12th by Bishop A.H. Sovereign of the Diocese of Athabasca, with further reference to the construction of the Roman Catholic Residential School at Teslin. You will remember Archbishop Kingston, Primate of All Canada, and Archbishop W.R. Adams of Yukon, have also written in this matter. As this letter goes more fully into the question of the Indian Residential School buildings at Whitefish Lake, than do the other letters, it will be appreciated if a reply could be drafted for the Minister's signature.

Upon completion of the work, and before payment is made on any final estimate, certificate, or statement the Contractor shall submit to the Engineer, a statement attested by Statutory Declaration showing that all works performed and materials supplied are free of all lawful liens or claims.\nProofs required for default of Contractor\n\n48. The Minister or the Engineer may, in their discretion, at any time require proof, with such formalities or to such extent as they may deem requisite, of any claim under the said Fair Wage Clauses or Schedules, or fees wages or hire of teams in arrears or of accounts for materials, or other things unpaid.\n\nSchedule of Unit Prices\n\n49. The Contractor shall submit with his tender a detailed schedule of unit prices of all materials worked or in place, which shall, upon approval of the Engineer, be used as a basis of payments for all work under the contract.\n\nClassification of Costs\n\n50. There shall also be submitted at the same time, a classification of costs at the schedule of unit prices submitted, aggregating the total contract price. This schedule shall be so computed that all incidental charges shall be distributed over the various trade items shown on the Departmental Progress Estimate form or as approved by the Chief Engineer, and shall be used as a basis for the Engineer's Monthly Progress Estimates.\n\nPrices to be accepted as full compensation\n\n51. The said price or prices shall be accepted by the Contractor as full compensation for everything furnished and done by the Contractor under this contract, including all work required but not included in the items hereinabove mentioned, and all for all loss or damage arising out of the nature of the works or the action of the weather, tides, elements, or any unforeseen obstruction or difficulty encountered in the prosecution of the work, and for all risks of every description connected with the works, and for all expenses incurred by or in connection with the works, and for all works, and for all expenses incurred by or in consequence of any delay or suspension or discontinuance of the work as herein specified, and for well and faithfully completing the works as in this contract provided.\n\nProgress payments\n\n52. Payments equal to about ninety per cent of the value of the work done, approximately estimated from progress measurements and computed at the price or prices agreed upon or determined under the provisions of this contract, will be made to the Contractor monthly if practicable, on the written certificate of the Engineer, stating that the work for or on account of which the certificate is granted has been done, and stating the value of work computed as above mentioned; and the said certificate shall be a condition precedent to the right of the Contractor to be paid the said ninety per cent or any part thereof. The remaining ten per cent shall be retained till the final completion of the whole work to the satisfaction of the Engineer, and will be paid within two months after such completion. The written certificate of the said Engineer certifying to the final completion of the said works to his satisfaction, shall be a condition precedent to the right of the Contractor to receive or to be paid the remaining ten per cent or any part thereof.\nEngineer in certifying values for progress payments may disregard price list.\n\n53. Provided always that, where in the opinion of the Engineer the work done is not sufficiently finished, or is not of sufficient value to justify payment at the price or prices agreed upon or determined under the provisions of this contract, the Engineer may, for the purpose of such payment, disregard the price or prices agreed upon or determined, and may estimate the proportionate value payable in respect of such work and issue a certificate accordingly; in which case the Contractor shall only be entitled to receive ninety per cent of such estimated proportionate value as stated in such certificate, and shall not be paid the ninety per cent of the price or prices agreed upon or determined under the provisions of this contract, until such time as the Engineer, by reason of the performance of additional work, shall certify that the Contractor is entitled thereto.\n\nClaims under progress certificate\n\n54. It is intended that every allowance to which the Contractor is fairly entitled will be embraced in the Engineer's monthly certificate, but should the Contractor at any time have claims of any description which he considers are not included in the progress certificates, such claims must be made in writing to the Engineer within thirty days after the date of the delivery to him of the certificate from which he considers the items of such claims to have been omitted, but in no case beyond the period of sixty days from the date of the practical completion of that portion of the work to which such claims apply. And in default of the presentation of such claims within the times so limited the Minister may treat such claims as absolutely barred.\n\nClaims, evidence of accuracy\n\n55. The Contractor in presenting claims of the kind referred to in the last preceding clause must accompany them with satisfactory evidence of their accuracy and the reason why he thinks they should be allowed.\n\nPayment for additional or extra work\n\n56. Payment for any work or additional work done, or materials or things provided, under the written orders of the Engineer, for which no price or prices are named, and which is not covered by the contract, His Majesty, in consideration and subject, as aforesaid, will pay to the Contractor the actual and reasonable cost, as determined by the Engineer, of such work, materials and things, with an additional ten per cent thereon for the use of tools, Contractor's plant, superintendence and profits.\n\nApproximate quantities\n\n57. The quantities (if any) given are approximate only and no claim shall be made by the Contractor against His Majesty on account of any excess or deficiency, absolute or relative, in the same.\n\nProgress measurements and certificates not binding\n\n58. The progress measurements and progress certificates shall not in any respect be taken as binding upon the Engineer, or as final measurements or as fixing final amounts; they are to be subject to the revision of the Engineer in making up his final certificate, and they shall not in any respect be taken as an acceptance of the work as a release of the Contractor from responsibility in respect thereof.\nRectification\n\n59. Should it subsequently be found that inferior materials or workmanship have been incorporated into the works, or that the contract has been departed from in any way, the Contractor shall be responsible for making good, without expense to the Department, any defects together with any and all damages that may have resulted from such defects.\n\nPROVIDED, notice shall be given the Contractor regarding such defects within a period of one (1) year after date of the final certificate of the completion of the work.\n\nPROVIDED, the period stipulated in any guarantee given by the Contractor has not expired.\n\nExtension of time\n\n60. Any extension of time requested by the Contractor due to circumstances beyond his control delaying the work, shall be made in writing, to the Chief Engineer, at least 10 days before expiration of the contract; Any extension of time that may be granted to the Contractor shall be so granted and accepted without prejudice to any rights of His Majesty whatsoever, under this contract, and no assent thereto on the part of the Contractor shall be necessary.\n\nMinister sole judge of reasonableness of extension of time for completion\n\n61. Provided always that after the expiration of the time limited for the completion of the works the Minister shall be sole judge as to what additional time, if any, may be allowed to the Contractor for such completion, and his decision as to the reasonableness or sufficiency thereof for the purpose of completion shall be final and binding upon the Contractor.\nLABOUR CONDITIONS\n\nThe following labour conditions are applicable to the work of construction of an Indian Residential School at Lower Post, B.C., Citizenship and Immigration to be undertaken for the Department of Resources and Development.\n\n(1) No workman employed upon the said work shall at any time be paid less than the minimum rates of wages, or shall work more than the number of hours, set forth in the following schedule:\n\n| TRADE OR CLASS OF LABOUR | RATE OF WAGES NOT LESS THAN | HOURS OF LABOUR NOT MORE THAN |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|\n|                          | PER HOUR                    | Per Day                      |\n| Asbestos insulation workers | $1.85                       | 8                            |\n| Blacksmiths              | 1.85                        |                              |\n| Blacksmiths' helpers     | 1.05                        |                              |\n| Brick and hollow tile layers | 1.50                      |                              |\n| Brick and hollow tile layers' helpers (mixing and tempering mortar) | 1.10                      |                              |\n| Boatmen (rowboats)       | 1.00                        |                              |\n| Carpenters and joiners   | 1.60                        |                              |\n| Cement finishers         | 1.30                        |                              |\n| Cement and concrete mixer operators: Steam - Gas. or else. | 1.55                      |                              |\n| Compressor operators (gas. or else.) | 1.10                  |                              |\n| Drivers                  | 1.00                        |                              |\n| Driver, team and wagon   | 1.40                        |                              |\n| Drill runners            | 1.50                        |                              |\n| Electricians (inside wiremen) | 1.50                     |                              |\n| Engineers, operating, steam | 1.67                     |                              |\n| Engineers, crane (steam, gas. else.) | 1.67                 |                              |\n| Engineers on steel erection | 1.90                   |                              |\n| Firemen, stationary      | 1.10                        |                              |\n| Labourers                | 1.00                        |                              |\n| Lathe operators: Metal - | 1.55                        |                              |\n| Wood -                   | 1.45                        |                              |\n| Linoleum layers          | 1.10                        |                              |\n| Mastic floor layers      | 1.45                        |                              |\n| Mastic floor rubbers and finishers | 1.15                  |                              |\n| Motor truck drivers      | 1.05                        |                              |\n| Motor truck driver and truck | 2.05                  |                              |\n| Ornamental iron workers  | 1.70                        |                              |\n| Painters (spray)         | 1.25                        |                              |\n| Painters and glaziers    | 1.25                        |                              |\n| Pipefitters (surface - temp. work) | 1.05                |                              |\n| Pipe layers, caulkers and solderers | 1.05             |                              |\n| Plasterers               | 1.50                        |                              |\n| Plasterers' helpers (mixing and tempering material) | 1.10                  |                              |\n| Plumbers and steamfitters | 1.60                        |                              |\n| Plumbers and steamfitters' helpers (all men assigned to help tradesmen) | 1.10                  |                              |\n| Powdermen                | 1.45                        |                              |\n| Pumpmen                  | 1.10                        |                              |\n| Redmen (reinforced steel) | 1.10                        |                              |\n\nN.B.\u2014The wages rates specified above are those deemed to be current at the time this schedule was prepared.

And in no event shall the Contractor have or make any claim on His Majesty for any damages or compensation by reason of the suspension of payment, or by reason of any delay or loss caused by the stoppage of the work.

The Minister may, from time to time and for such period as he may deem expedient, delay or suspend, in whole or in part, operations under this contract, either upon the whole of the works, or at any particular point or points. Should any such delay or suspension, or the stoppage of the works under the provisions of Section 30, or should any delay caused by any circumstance which, in the opinion of the Engineer, is beyond the control of or not the fault of the Contractor, in the opinion of the Minister unreasonably limit the time for the completion of the works, within the time specified by this contract, the Minister as often as the case occurs shall allow such additional time as to him may seem sufficient in the extension of such time for completion; but no such delay, suspension or stoppage shall vitiate or avoid this contract, or any part thereof, or any security or obligations for the performance thereof, nor shall the Contractor be entitled to make any claim for damages by reason thereof. Upon the termination of such delay, suspension or stoppage, or upon the removal of the cause thereof, or upon the Contractor receiving notice from the Minister or Engineer requiring him to resume the work, he shall at once resume operations and diligently carry on the same.\nWaiver negatived\n\n32. No condoning, excusing or overlooking by His Majesty, or any person acting on his behalf, on previous occasions, or breaches, or defaults similar to that for which any action is taken or power exercised, or forfeiture is claimed or enforced against the Contractor, shall be taken to operate as a waiver of any provision of this contract, nor to defeat or prejudice in any way the right of His Majesty thereunder.\n\nMembers of H. of C. not to benefit\n\n33. Pursuant to the provision of the Statute in such case made and provided, no member of the House of Commons of Canada shall be admitted to any share or part of this contract, or to any benefit to arise therefrom.\n\nNo Public Ceremony\n\n34.

The Contractor shall promptly pay for all labour, service and materials in or about the construction of the works, and all payments for such purposes shall be made by the Contractor, at least as often as payments are made to the Contractor by His Majesty under this contract, and in the event of failure by the Contractor at any time so to do, or if any sum due for labour of any foreman or workman, or for hire of horses, teams or carts upon or in respect of the works, or any part thereof, remain in arrears or unpaid, or if there be at any time found to exist any claims against the Contractors, or any sub-contractor, for labour, teams, tools, plant, equipment, materials, articles or things employed, hired or supplied upon or for the works or any part thereof, or if the Minister has reason to believe that any such payments, sums or claims will not be promptly made or paid, the Minister may, in addition to or in lieu of exercising any powers conferred by the Labour Conditions, at his option, retain out of any moneys due or become due to the Contractor from His Majesty such amount or amounts as the Minister may deem sufficient to satisfy the same, or pay the Contractor the moneys due him in instalments, giving him from time to time such sums as the Minister or the Engineer deems sufficient to meet such payments, sums or claims or any of them, and with-holding the balance due him after deducting the payments so made. The Contractor shall be estopped from denying the accuracy and correctness of any and all payments so made by the Minister.\n\nBooks, etc., of Contractor open for inspection\n\n45. The Contractor's pay-rolls, time-books, books of account, invoices and statements shall be at all times open for inspection and extract by the Engineer and any authorized representative of the Minister, or either of them who shall be assisted in every possible way by the Contractor, to enable the Engineer and such representative to ascertain, as far as possible, the exact payment, sums or claims so due and remaining unpaid by the Contractor.\n\nWork to be free from all encumbrances\n\n46. Before making any payment on any progress estimate the Minister may require the Contractor to satisfy the Engineer, or other authorized representative of His Majesty, that all work performed and materials supplied and all structures built for which payment is being made are free and clear from all lawful claims or liens under any law for labour, workmanship, materials or otherwise; the Contractor shall indemnify and hold harmless His Majesty from and against any and all kind of claims or liens accruing from labour and services performed and material furnished, or otherwise, and any of the same in or about the works.\n\nStatutory Declaration\n\n47.

The Minister or the Engineer may, in their discretion, at any time require proof, with such formalities or to such extent as they may deem requisite, of any claim under the said Fair Wage Clauses or Schedules, or for wages or hire of teams in arrears or of accounts for materials, or other things unpaid.\n\nSchedule of Unit Prices\n\n49. The Contractor shall submit with his tender a detailed schedule of unit prices of all materials worked or in place, which shall, upon approval of the Engineer, be used as a basis of payments for all work under the contract.\n\nClassification of Costs\n\n50. There shall also be submitted at the same time, a classification of costs at the schedule of unit prices submitted, aggregating the total contract price. This schedule shall be so computed that all incidental charges shall be distributed over the various trade items as shown on the Departmental Progress Estimate form or as approved by the Chief Engineer, and shall be used as a basis for the Engineer's Monthly Progress Estimates.\n\nPrices to be accepted as full compensation\n\n51. The said price or prices shall be accepted by the Contractor as full compensation for everything furnished and done by the Contractor under this contract, including all work required but not included in the items hereinabove mentioned, and also for all loss or damage arising out of the nature of the works or the action of the weather, tides, elements, or any unforeseen obstruction or difficulty encountered in the prosecution of the work, and for all risks of every description connected with the works, and for all expenses incurred by or in connection with the works, and for all works, and for all expenses incurred by or in consequence of any delay or suspension or discontinuance of the work as herein specified, and for well and faithfully completing the works as in this contract provided.\n\nProgress payments\n\n52. Payments equal to about ninety per cent of the value of the work done, approximately estimated from progress measurements and computed at the price or prices agreed upon or determined under the provisions of this contract, will be made to the Contractor monthly if practicable, on the written certificate of the Engineer, stating what the work for or on account of which the certificate is granted has been done, and stating the value of work computed as above mentioned; and the said certificate shall be a condition precedent to the right of the Contractor to be paid the said ninety per cent or any part thereof. The remaining ten per cent shall be retained till the final completion of the whole work to the satisfaction of the Engineer, and will be paid within two months after such completion. The written certificate of the said Engineer certifying to the final completion of the said works to his satisfaction, shall be a condition precedent to the right of the Contractor to receive or to be paid the remaining ten per cent or any part thereof.\nEngineer in certifying values for progress payments may disregard price list\n\n53. Provided always that, where in the opinion of the Engineer the work done is not sufficiently finished, or is not of sufficient value to justify payment at the price or prices agreed upon or determined under the provisions of this contract, the Engineer may, for the purpose of such payment, disregard the price or prices agreed upon or determined, and may estimate the proportionate value payable in respect of such work and issue a certificate accordingly; in which case the Contractor shall only be entitled to receive ninety per cent of such estimated proportionate value as stated in such certificate, and shall not be paid the ninety per cent of the price or prices agreed upon or determined under the provisions of this contract, until such time as the Engineer, by reason of the performance of additional work, shall certify that the Contractor is entitled thereto.\n\nClaims under progress certificate\n\n54. It is intended that every allowance to which the Contractor is fairly entitled will be embraced in the Engineer's monthly certificate, but should the Contractor at any time have claims of any description which he considers are not included in the progress certificates, such claims must be made in writing to the Engineer within thirty days after the date of the delivery to him of the certificate from which he considers the items of such claims to have been omitted, but in no case beyond the period of sixty days from the date of the practical completion of that portion of the work to which such claims apply. And in default of the presentation of such claims within the times so limited the Minister may treat such claims as absolutely barred.\n\nClaims, evidence of accuracy\n\n55. The Contractor in presenting claims of the kind referred to in the last preceding clause must accompany them with satisfactory evidence of their accuracy and the reason why he thinks they should be allowed.\n\nPayment for additional or extra work\n\n56. Payment for any work or additional work done, or materials or things provided, under the written orders of the Engineer, for which no price or prices are named, and which is not covered by the contract, His Majesty, in consideration and subject, as aforesaid, will pay to the Contractor the actual and reasonable cost, as determined by the Engineer, of such work, materials and things, with an additional ten per cent thereon for the use of tools, Contractor's plant, superintendence and profits.\n\nApproximate quantities\n\n57. The quantities (if any) given are approximate only and no claim shall be made by the Contractor against His Majesty on account of any excess or deficiency, absolute or relative, in the same.\n\nProgress measurements and certificates not binding\n\n58. The progress measurements and progress certificates shall not in any respect be taken as binding upon the Engineer, or as final measurements or as fixing final amounts: they are to be subject to the revision of the Engineer in making up his final certificate, and they shall not in any respect be taken as an acceptance of the work as a release of the Contractor from responsibility in respect thereof.\nRectification\n\n59. Should it subsequently be found that inferior materials or workmanship have been incorporated into the works, or that the contract has been departed from in any way, the Contractor shall be responsible for making good, without expense to the Department, any defects together with any and all damages that may have resulted from such defects.\n\nPROVIDED, notice shall be given the Contractor regarding such defects within a period of one (1) year after date of the final certificate of the completion of the work.\n\nPROVIDED, the period stipulated in any guarantee given by the Contractor has not expired.\n\nExtension of time\n\n60. Any extension of time requested by the Contractor due to circumstances beyond his control delaying the work, shall be made in writing, to the Chief Engineer, at least 10 days before expiration of the contract; Any extension of time that may be granted to the Contractor shall be so granted and accepted without prejudice to any rights of His Majesty whatsoever, under this contract, and no assent thereto on the part of the Contractor shall be necessary.\n\nMinister sole judge of reasonableness of extension of time for completion\n\n61. Provided always that after the expiration of the time limited for the completion of the works the Minister shall be sole judge as to what additional time, if any, may be allowed to the Contractor for such completion, and his decision as to the reasonableness or sufficiency thereof for the purpose of completion shall be final and binding upon the Contractor.\nLABOUR CONDITIONS\n\nThe following labour conditions are applicable to the work of construction of an Indian Residential School at Lower Post, B.C., Citizenship and Immigration to be undertaken for the Department of Resources and Development.\n\n(1) No workman employed upon the said work shall at any time be paid less than the minimum rates of wages, or shall work more than the number of hours, set forth in the following schedule:\n\n| TRADE OR CLASS OF LABOUR | RATE OF WAGES NOT LESS THAN | HOURS OF LABOUR NOT MORE THAN |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|\n|                          | PER HOUR                   | Per Day                      |\n| Asbestos insulation workers | $1.85                     | 8                            |\n| Blacksmiths              | 1.85                      |                              |\n| Blacksmiths' helpers     | 1.65                      |                              |\n| Brick and hollow tile layers | 1.50                  |                              |\n| Brick and hollow tile layers' helpers (mixing and tempering mortar) | 1.10                |                              |\n| Boatmen (rowboats)       | 1.00                      |                              |\n| Carpenters and joiners   | 1.60                      |                              |\n| Cement finishers         | 1.50                      |                              |\n| Cement and concrete mixer operators: Steam - Gas. or elec. | 1.55               |                              |\n| Compressor operators (gas. or elec.) | 1.10            |                              |\n| Drivers                  | 1.00                      |                              |\n| Driver, team and wagon   | 1.40                      |                              |\n| Drill Runners            | 1.50                      |                              |\n| Electricians (inside wiremen) | 1.50                |                              |\n| Engineers, operating, steam | 1.67              |                              |\n| Engineers, crane (steam, gas. elec.) | 1.67          |                              |\n| Engineers on steel erection | 1.90             |                              |\n| Firemen stationary       | 1.30                      |                              |\n| Labourers                | 1.00                      |                              |\n| Lathers: Metal - Wood    | 1.55                      |                              |\n| Linoleum layers          | 1.10                      |                              |\n| Mastic floor layers      | 1.45                      |                              |\n| Mastic floor rubbers and finishers | 1.15          |                              |\n| Motor truck drivers      | 1.05                      |                              |\n| Motor truck driver and truck | 2.05              |                              |\n| Ornamental iron workers  | 1.70                      |                              |\n| Painters (spray)         | 1.55                      |                              |\n| Painters and glaziers    | 1.25                      |                              |\n| Pipefitters (surface - temp. work) | 1.05           |                              |\n| Pipe layers, caulkers and solderers | 1.05        |                              |\n| Plasterers               | 1.50                      |                              |\n| Plasterers' helpers (mixing and tempering material) | 1.10          |                              |\n| Plumbers and steamfitters | 1.60                    |                              |\n| Plumbers and steamfitters' helpers (all men assigned to help tradesmen) | 1.10          |                              |\n| Powdermen                | 1.10                      |                              |\n| Pumpmen                  | 1.10                      |                              |\n| Redmen (reinforced steel) | 1.10                    |                              |\n\nN.B.\u2014The wage rates specified above are those deemed to be current at the time this schedule was prepared.

The remaining ten per cent shall be retained till the final completion of the whole work to the satisfaction of the Engineer, and will be paid within two months after such completion. The written certificate of the said Engineer certifying to the final completion of the said works to his satisfaction, shall be a condition precedent to the right of the Contractor to receive or to be paid the remaining ten per cent or any part thereof.\nEngineer in certifying values for progress payments may disregard price list\n\n53.

The quantities (if any) given are approximate only and no claim shall be made by the Contractor against His Majesty on account of any excess or deficiency, absolute or relative, in the same.\n\nProgress measurements and certificates not binding\n\n58. The progress measurements and progress certificates shall not in any respect be taken as binding upon the Engineer, or as final measurements or as fixing final amounts; they are to be subject to the revision of the Engineer in making up his final certificate, and they shall not in any respect be taken as an acceptance of the work as a release of the Contractor from responsibility in respect thereof.\nRectification\n\n59.

Immediately upon receipt of notice of any decision of the Minister of Labour hereunder, the Contractor shall adjust the wages and hours and classification of work so as to give effect to such decision. In case the Contractor shall fail so to do, or fail at any time to pay to any employee or employees for any services performed or for any hours of labour wages according to the rates set forth in the schedule or fixed therefor by the Minister of Labour hereunder regarding overtime, the Minister of Labour may authorize and direct the Minister to pay any such wages at the rates so fixed and to deduct the amount thereof from any moneys owing by the Government to the Contractor and any such payment shall for all purposes be between the Contractor and the Government deemed and taken to be payment to the Contractor, and the Contractor shall be liable in every particular by any such authority, direction and payment as aforesaid.\n\n(3) For the protection of the workmen employed, the Contractor shall post and keep posted in a conspicuous place on the premises where the contract is being executed and frequented by the workmen, the Schedule inserted in this contract, also the preceding paragraph (2) and any decision of the Minister of Labour made thereunder.\n\n(4) The Contractor shall keep proper books and records showing the names, trades, and addresses of all workmen employed and the wages paid to and time worked by such workmen, and the books or documents containing such record shall be open for inspection by the Fair Wages Officers of the Government at any time it may be expedient to the Minister of Labour to have the same inspected.\n\n(5) The Contractor shall not be entitled to payment of any money which would otherwise be payable under the terms of the contract in respect of work and labour performed in the execution of the contract unless and until he shall have filed with the Minister in support of his claim for payment a statement attested by statutory declaration, showing: (1) the number of weeks and hours of labour of the workmen employed in the execution of the contract; (2) whether any wages in respect of the said work and labour remain in arrears; and (3) that all the labour conditions of the contract have been duly complied with; nor in the event of notice from the Minister of Labour claims for wages, until the same are adjusted. The Contractor shall submit from time to time such additional information and evidence as the Minister may deem necessary in order to satisfy him that the conditions herein contained to secure the payment of fair wages have been complied with, and that the workmen so employed are aforesaid upon the portion of the work in respect of which payment is demanded have been paid in full.\n\n(6) In the event of default being made in payment of any money owing in respect of wages of any workmen employed on the said work and if a claim therefor is filed in the office of the Minister and proof thereof satisfactory to the Minister is furnished, the said Minister may pay such claim out of the moneys at any time payable by His Majesty under the contract and the amounts so paid shall be charged against the Contractor.\n\n(7) These conditions shall extend and apply to moneys payable for the use or hire of horses or teams, and the persons entitled to payments for the use or hire of horses or teams shall have the like rights and remedies moneys so owing them and the same shall be subrogated thereto in respect of wages.\n\n(8) With a view to the avoidance of any abuses which might arise from subletting, the subletting of contracts it shall be understood that subletting, other than such as may be customary in the trades concerned, is prohibited without the approval of the Minister obtaining such approval shall be obtained in all cases to conform to the conditions of the main contract, and the main contractor shall be held responsible for strict adherence to all contract conditions on the part of subcontractor; the contract shall not, nor shall any portion thereof be transferred without the written permission of the Minister of any portion of the work to be executed and approved by the honours of the workmen.\n\n(9) All workmen employed upon the work comprehended in and to be executed pursuant to the said contract shall be residents of Canada, unless the Minister is of opinion that Canadian labour is not available or that other special circumstances exist which render it contrary to the public interest to enforce this provision.\n\nA.

The buildings do not take advantage of native materials such as logs, and in some instances the specifications are difficult to fulfill and will prove costly. For instance Page 23, para. 38 of the Specifications calls for walks and drives to be rolled with a twenty ton roller, as there is no machine of this size in the Territory, the roller will have to be brought in at enormous expense. No advantage has been taken of the surplus electricity from the nearby R.C.A.B. powerhouse.\n\nThe 1939 Census of Indians of Canada shows approximately 11%, or 146 Indians, of the Yukon Agency to be Roman Catholic. Census figures for the Stikine Agency show 466 Roman Catholic and 305 Protestant Indians. There are 1352 Indians of the Yukon Agency shown as Anglican. As the latter group have only a small (45 pupil) school at Carcross, and as they have been established for some 40 years there, it is possible they will request a justification of the proposed school.\n\nThe changing circumstances mentioned above include the formation of a school board and the building of a new day school by the Province of B.C. at Lower Post, B.C., which will materially assist the 100 or so Indians of that immediate\narea. They have been served in the past by a well-conducted seasonal school under the direction of Fr. P. Poulet O.M.I., who informed me recently that his school would probably close when the Provincial school became a reality.\n\nOn July 15th, 1949, I was requested to attend a meeting of the Directors of the Board of Trade, Whitehorse, at which I was asked to outline the events and steps leading up to the present situation with regard to the proposed Teslin Residential School. I gather there is a strained feeling, probably with no justification, by the parents in Whitehorse, owing to the almost complete lack of school facilities for more than 300 white children of the town. Until Mines and Resources in conjunction with Department of National Defence can build a school in Whitehorse, there will undoubtedly be opposition to any large scale school building for smaller population groups in the Yukon.\n\nI would recommend that a smaller school be built at Teslin; one to accommodate 50 or 60 children, as was originally proposed by Bishop Coudert O.M.I.\n\nFacilities for white children should, no doubt, concern the Dept. of National Defence and whatever tax-collecting authority is constituted at Whitehorse.\n\nLong ago I wrote in a memo that the Yukon whites have little appreciation of the Indians' status as wards. Our agent might assure us that he has reminded the Board of Trade of the special responsibility of the Gov't of Canada.\n\nI agree that we have come a long way from the pattern Bishop Coudert had in mind.\n\n(R.J.

Gibson,\nDirector,\nLands & Development Services Branch,\nNorlite Bldg, 150 Wellington St.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Gibson:\n\nActing upon your suggestion, Mr. B.F. Neary, Mr. Charles Buck, Father O. Flourde and myself met this morning in the architect's office and discussed and studied the plans of the Teslin School, with a view of reducing it to meet the wishes of Mr. MacKay, director of Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nWe finally agreed that we might do without:\n\n1 - The Chapel;\n2 - The third story of the main building;\n3 - About a third of the storage room adjoining the kitchen;\n4 - The men's quarters adjoining the Heating Plant.\n\nYour Mr. Buck will establish the cubic contents of the space thus reduced and let you know what in his estimation might be expected as a reduction in the contractors' bid for the erection of the building.\n\nDoes it may I here state, that this school was requested first of all in 1906 and again in 1918. I personally wrote my first letter asking for this institution in 1930. Three years ago the first money was appropriated for it. The following year plans were drawn and found too expensive. Your architect was then asked to reduce them in size. These second plans are found again to be too elaborate and I am asked to reduce them once more.\nMr. D.V. MacKay,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. MacKay:\n\nOn your suggestion His Excellency Bishop J. Coudert, O.M.I., Mr. B.F. Neary, Mr. Charles Buck and myself went over the plans of the Teslin Indian School to reduce them in size and thus meet the desires of the Department to build this school for the amount voted for its construction.\n\nThe attached letter written to Mr. R.A. Gibson states the proposed reductions. Copy of this letter is forwarded to you in the hope that you may act upon it as early as possible.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nTeslin Indian Residential School\n\nReference the above and your file 942-5 (E). In December 1946, Mr. Normile of Dawson Creek, B.C., purchased the whole of Camp 804 from War Assets Corporation. Shortly before this I had obtained six buildings from the Canadian Army at Whitehorse, for future use in connection with the above school. Mr. Normile has already staked property covering the area, and which includes the ground upon which our buildings stand.\n\nOnly two buildings have any value as they stand: Nos. 5 and 6, being 20' x 48' frames structures in fairly good shape. They are in the centre of a group of buildings being used as a tourist camp, and operated by Mr. Normile. The other four buildings are in very poor shape, but there would be a certain amount of salvage lumber.\n\nI have taken up this matter with Mr. Villeux, War Assets Corp., Whitehorse, who advises me that he has looked thoroughly into the matter and finds the statements made by Mr. Normile correct. Fr. A. Dream O.M.I., in a letter to you of May 15th suggests that lumber from these buildings be used by the Teslin natives for building homes. May I request that authority be granted for dismantling all buildings except Nos. 5 and 6, for use in the building of houses on Teslin Indian Reserve.\n\nAs Buildings 5 and 6 are in good repair, may I have the wish of the department as to their disposal. It would be a waste of two perfectly good buildings to tear them down. Mr. Normile has been misinformed by W.A.C. and his cash payment included both these buildings. If they are not going to be used for the proposed school, may we turn them back to War Assets, or to the Canadian Army. In conclusion I might add that nothing has been removed from these buildings and they stand just as we obtained them in 1946.\n\nR.J. Meek\nSuperintendent.\nAugust 22, 1949.\n\nPERSONAL\n\nMr. W.S.

C.\n\nWhen Bishop Coudert and Father Plourde visited the Branch recently in connection with the above noted matter, we did not have available plans of Liard River Indian Reserve No. 3, but ordered several copies thereof, and I am enclosing herewith two copies of each of the plans showing the Reserve.\n\nFrom the course of the conversation, Bishop Coudert stated that the school would require about 50 acres and suggested that the site be in the east part of the Reserve between the river and the Alaska highway. As will be noted on plan B.C. 685, the area lying between the highway and the river appears to be approximately somewhere between 50 and 70 acres, and provided there are no Indians resident thereon, there would appear no reason why this parcel should not be made the site for the new school, if that is satisfactory to you.\n\nIt is assumed there is no formal Band Council on this Reserve, and we can hardly follow our customary procedure of setting aside the land for the use of the residential school following a Resolution of Council to that effect, and it is suggested that the preferable means of securing the use of this property would be to take it for school purposes by Order in Council passed under Section 11 of the Indian Act.\n\nD.

Plourde O.M.I., to the Director of the Indian Affairs Branch and subsequently to the Director of the Lands and Development Services Branch, a meeting was arranged in the Chief Architect's office, where the matter of attempting to bring the cost of construction for the Teslin Residential School down to the level where it could be built at a cost approaching the funds allotted by the Department.\n\nAt the meeting were Bishop Coudert, Reverend J.O. Plourde, Col. R.F. Neary, Superintendent of Education for the Indian Affairs Branch and C.H. Buck, Chief Architect for the Lands and Development Services Branch.\n\nThe initial item discussed was the difference in what the building would cost if erected on the basis of the lowest tender received namely $536,215.00 and funds provided by the Indian Affairs Branch in the amount of $300,000.00.\n\nThe Church officers realized that in as remote a region as Teslin, costs for the purchase and transportation of materials, and the cost of obtaining, feeding and housing the necessary working staff would remain constant, and that to reduce the finished cost of the building to an acceptable level, a reduction in the volume must be made.\n\nThe Church officers had agreed previously to eliminate the chapel shown in the school design, and those present at the meeting carefully studied the drawings prepared by W.F. Noffke, F.R.A.I.C., of Ottawa, with a view to further reduction in volume.\n\nAs a result, it was agreed that the following accommodation now included in the school design, would be omitted,\n\n(a) The chapel, occupying approximately........30,500 cu.ft.\n\n(b) Storage for provisions, as agreed to by Architect Noffke and Indian Affairs at the suggestion of dietetic personnel Department of National Health and Welfare, occupying approximately..................11,200 cu.ft.\n\n(c) The whole third floor, occupying approximately..........................44,250 cu.ft.\n\n(d) Boiler room staff sleeping quarters in boiler house, occupying approximately........6,150 cu.ft.\n\nTotal decrease in volume...............92,100 cu.ft.\n\nHaving decided that this reduction in volume would not prevent efficient operation of the school, the meeting agreed that the Church officers present would further study the drawings, with a view to determining if any other space, if any, might be eliminated and that the Branch Chief Architect would explore the possibility of substitutions in materials and equipment in the specifications that might effect further reductions.\n\nThe meeting then adjourned.\n\n(Continued)\nSince August 15th, the Noffke plans as drawn, have been cubed and the volume of construction for which the lowest tender of $36,215.00 was submitted is approximately 487,000 cubic feet, producing a cost of $1.10 per cubic foot. It is reasonable to assume therefore, that by eliminating 92,100 cubic feet of volume, a saving of approximately $101,310.00 would be possible. The total approximate cost thus produced, amounting to $434,905.00 which still is $134,905.00 higher than allotted funds.\n\nMr. Noffke and the writer, discussed the drawings and specifications on the 17th instant, and Mr. Noffke is now giving consideration to a number of modifications suggested by your Chief Architect. Mr. Noffke will analyze the suggestions and if adoptable will incorporate them into his drawings and specifications for the use of those contractors whom we wish to approach for a revised tender.\n\nWhile this Branch has not been officially notified, it is understood that in an attempt to reduce the cost of transporting material to the site of the school, Bishop Coudert has agreed to a change in location from Teslin in the Yukon, to Lower Post in British Columbia. If a suitable site is available at Lower Post, the reported existence of lumber mills there, would be no mean factor in reducing transportation costs and structural timber costs for a revised tender.\n\nNo value is attached of course to the report that a suitable site is available at Lower Post until a thorough investigation has been carried out.\n\nChas.

H.F. Neary, Superintendent of Education for the Indian Affairs Branch, yourself and the undersigned, considered might be eliminated from the design of the above, you are advised as follows:\n\n(a) The blueprint drawings and cubage reduction schedule were thoroughly discussed with the Director of Indian Affairs who approved the omission of the accommodation listed.\n\n(b) The Director of Indian Affairs requests that partitions in the basement, dividing recreational space from vocational training areas, be shown as in the original design.\n\n(c) Working drawings on the reduced basis are to be prepared, and amended specifications are to be written, as a basis for inviting tenders.\n\n(d) Forty sets of blueprints from the revised drawings and forty copies of a revised specification are to be furnished to the Director of the Lands and Development Services Branch, in care of the undersigned as a basis for revised tenders.\n\n(e) Certain difficulties regarding the actual site have still to be overcome and therefore, it will not likely be possible for this Branch to furnish you with a topographical plan of the area, before working drawings and specifications are required for tendering purposes. For this reason, kindly prepare your drawings as though no unusual site conditions were present. Any changes in construction brought about by the exhaustive site investigation which will be carried out before construction operations begin will have to be shown as revisions to the working drawings and paid for as an extra to the contract price, should a contract have been awarded.\n\n(f) It is agreed, that the necessary services required from you in this endeavour to reduce the building cost to an amount not exceeding $300,000.00, are to be provided without any increase in your fee.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nChas.

MacKay,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nMr. Aubrey Simmons, M.P., has asked for information about the progress which is being made with the plans for the construction of the residential school at Lower Post in British Columbia. I suppose this information should be furnished through the Minister's office on a report from your branch.\n\nThe Engineering and Construction Division of our branch report that the working drawings and specifications are now complete; the drawings have been checked and blueprinted, and the specifications mimeographed. Particulars have not been had about the site peculiarities but it is proposed to have tenders called for on the premise that normal soil conditions exist. We have been advised that water supply and sewage disposal should present no unusual difficulties.\n\nTo prepare and issue tendering data and allow time for the contractors to prepare and submit their tenders, and to allow further time for securing the authority from Council, it is estimated that it would take at least six weeks. However, one important feature of a job at a place like Lower Post is the transportation of materials to the site, and it would seem that a lot of this could be done in the wintertime when the Alaska Highway is kept in excellent condition.\n\nI gather from what Mr. Simmons says that he is in favour of the contract being awarded as soon as possible.\n\nR.A. Gibson,\nDirector.\nNovember 3, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH\n\nLower Post Indian Residential School\n\nI have noted the contents of your memorandum of October 31 and the inquiries made by Mr. Aubrey Simons, M.P.\n\nWe are pleased to note that the working drawings and specifications are now complete and that preparations are being made to prepare and issue tendering data.\n\nI have been advised by the Superintendent of Education that Mr. M. Taylor of the Bond Construction Company also pointed out to him the advantages of advertising this project in the near future. With road transportation the only means of communication to the school site, it is understood that winter trucking is much faster than spring hauling when the roads are soft and dangerous.\n\nHis attitude was that most contractors would prefer to have the matter settled and the supplies shipped in by February or March.\n\nTherefore this Branch is in agreement with the action suggested in your letter of advertising for tenders and, if found to be satisfactory, that the contract be let before the end of January, 1950.\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6482, file 942-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, November 8, 1949.\n\nAubrey Simmons, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Simmons:\n\nI understand that you have been making inquiries with regard to the progress being made with the plans for the construction of an Indian residential school at Lower Post in British Columbia.\n\nAs you are aware, it was originally our intention to erect this school near Teslin in the Yukon Territory and that tenders were called for its construction last summer.\n\nHowever, the bids which were received were higher than could be recommended for acceptance and it was decided to move the school to Lower Post in British Columbia.

I do not think your responsibility will be too great as the work on this school will be administered and supervised for the Crown by Colonel J.R.B.

Under separate cover I am also sending you a copy of the plans and specifications. With regard to the site, we will have to obtain an Order-in-Council under Section II of the Act, taking the land for school purposes. Your report of September 28, 1949, indicates that the members of the Lower Post Band are unanimous in their willingness to have the land set aside for a residential school. I note that the four occupied Indian dwellings on the proposed site will be excluded in a strip of land 200 ft. in depth running parallel to the road, north and south from the Liard River to the Alaska Highway. It might even be possible to have the engineers do a survey on this while they are supervising the erection of the building.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard E.

The Contractor shall promptly pay for all labour, service and materials in or about the construction of the works, and all payments for such purposes shall be made by the contractor, at least as often as payments are made to the Contractor by His Majesty under this contract, and in the event of failure by the Contractor at any time so to do, or if any sum due for labour of any foreman or workman, or for hire of horses, teams or carts upon or in respect of the works, or any part thereof, remains in arrears or unpaid, or if there be at any time found to exist any claims against the Contractors, or any sub-contractor, for labour, teams, tools, plant, equipment, materials, articles or things employed, hired or supplied upon or for the works or any part thereof, or if the Minister has reason to believe that any such payments, sums or claims will not be promptly made or paid, the Minister may, in addition to or in lieu of exercising any powers conferred by the Labour Conditions, at his option, retain out of any moneys due or become due to the Contractor from His Majesty such amount or amounts as the Minister may deem sufficient to satisfy the same, or pay the Contractor the moneys due him in instalments, giving him from time to time such sums as the Minister or the Engineer deems sufficient to meet such payments, sums or claims or any of them, and withholding the balance due him after deducting the payments so made. The Contractor shall be stopped from denying the accuracy and correctness of any and all payments so made by the Minister.\n\nBooks, etc., of Contractor open for inspection\n\n45. The Contractor's pay-rolls, time-books, books of account, invoices and statements shall be at all times open for inspection and extract by the Engineer and any authorized representative of the Minister, or either of them who shall be assisted in every possible way by the Contractor, to enable the Engineer and such representative to ascertain, as far as possible, the exact payment, sums or claims so due and remaining unpaid by the Contractor.\n\nWork to be free from all encumbrances\n\n46. Before making any payment on any progress estimate the Minister may require the Contractor to satisfy the Engineer, or other authorized representative of His Majesty, that all work performed and materials supplied and all structures built for which payment is being made are free and clear from all lawful claims or liens under any law for labour, workmanship, materials or otherwise; the Contractor shall indemnify and hold harmless His Majesty from and against any and all kind of claims or liens accruing from labour and services performed and material furnished, or otherwise, and any of the same in or about the works.\n\nStatutory Declaration\n\n47. Upon completion of the work, and before payment is made on any final estimate, certificate, or statement the Contractor shall submit to the Engineer, a statement attested by Statutory Declaration showing that all works performed and materials supplied are free of all lawful liens or claims.\nProofs required for default of Contractor\n\n48. The Minister or the Engineer may, in their discretion, at any time require proof, with such facilities or to such extent as they may deem requisite, of any claim under the said Fair Wage Clauses or Schedules, or for wages or hire of teams in arrears or of accounts for materials, or other things unpaid.\n\nSchedule of Unit Prices\n\n49. The Contractor shall submit with his tender a detailed schedule of unit prices of all materials worked or in place, which shall, upon approval of the Engineer, be used as a basis of payments for all work under the contract.\n\nClassification of Costs\n\n50. There shall also be submitted at the same time, a classification of costs at the schedule of unit prices submitted, aggregating the total contract price. This schedule shall be so computed that all incidental charges shall be distributed over the various trade items as shown on the Departmental Progress Estimate form or as approved by the Chief Engineer, and shall be used as a basis for the Engineer's Monthly Progress Estimates.\n\nPrices to be accepted as full compensation\n\n51. The said price or prices shall be accepted by the Contractor as full compensation for everything furnished and done by the Contractor under this contract, including all work required but not included in the items hereinabove mentioned, and also for all loss or damage arising out of the nature of the works or the action of the weather, tides, elements, or any unforeseen obstruction or difficulty encountered in the prosecution of the work, and for all risks of every description connected with the works, and for all expenses incurred by or in connection with the works, and for all works, and for all expenses incurred by or in consequence of any delay or suspension or discontinuance of the work as herein specified, and for well and faithfully completing the works as in this contract provided.\n\nProgress Payments\n\n52. Payments equal to about ninety per cent of the value of the work done, approximately estimated from progress measurements and computed at the price or prices agreed upon or determined under the provisions of this contract, will be made to the Contractor monthly if practicable, on the written certificate of the Engineer, stating that the work for or on account of which the certificate is granted has been done, and stating the value of work completed as above mentioned; and the said certificate shall be a condition precedent to the right of the Contractor to be paid the said ninety per cent or any part thereof. The remaining ten per cent shall be retained till the final completion of the whole work to the satisfaction of the Engineer, and will be paid within two months after such completion. The written certificate of the said Engineer certifying to the final completion of the said works to his satisfaction, shall be a condition precedent to the right of the Contractor to receive or to be paid the remaining ten per cent or any part thereof.\nEngineer in certifying values for progress payments may disregard price list\n\n53. Provided always that, where in the opinion of the Engineer the work done is not sufficiently finished, or is not of sufficient value to justify payment at the price or prices agreed upon or determined under the provisions of this contract, the Engineer may, for the purpose of such payment, disregard the price or prices agreed upon or determined, and may estimate the proportionate value payable in respect of such work and issue a certificate accordingly; and while hence the Contractor shall only be entitled to receive ninety per cent of such estimated proportionate value as stated in such certificate, and shall not be paid the ninety per cent of the price or prices agreed upon or determined under the provisions of this contract, until such time as the Engineer, by reason of the performance of additional work, shall certify that the Contractor is entitled thereto.\n\nClaims under progress certificate\n\n54. It is intended that every allowance to which the Contractor is fairly entitled will be embraced in the Engineer's monthly certificate, but should the Contractor at any time have claims of any description which he considers are not included in the progress certificates, such claims must be made in writing to the Engineer within thirty days after the date of the delivery to him of the certificate from which he considers the items of such claims to have been omitted, but in no case beyond the period of sixty days from the date of the practical completion of that portion of the work to which such claims apply. And in default of the presentation of such claims within the times so limited the Minister may treat such claims as absolutely barred.\n\nClaims, evidence of accuracy\n\n55. The Contractor in presenting claims of the kind referred to in the last preceding clause must accompany them with satisfactory evidence of their accuracy and the reason why he thinks they should be allowed.\n\nPayment for additional or extra work\n\n56. Payment for any work or additional work done, or materials or things provided, under the written orders of the Engineer, for which no price or prices are named, and which is not covered by the contract. His Majesty, in consideration and subject, as aforesaid, will pay to the Contractor the actual and reasonable cost, as determined by the Engineer, of such work, materials and things, with an additional ten per cent thereon for the use of tools, Contractor's plant, superintendence and profits.\n\nApproximate quantities\n\n57. The quantities (if any) given are approximate only and no claim shall be made by the Contractor against His Majesty on account of any excess or deficiency, absolute or relative, in the same.\n\nProgress measurements and certificates not binding\n\n58. The progress measurements and progress certificates shall not in any respect be taken as binding upon the Engineer, or as final measurements or as fixing final amounts; they are to be subject to the revision of the Engineer in making up his final certificate, and they shall not in any respect be taken as an acceptance of the work as a release of the Contractor from responsibility in respect thereof.\nReaffirmation\n\n59. Should it subsequently be found that inferior materials or workmanship have been incorporated into the works, or that the contract has been departed from in any way, the Contractor shall be responsible for making good, without expense to the Department, any defects together with any and all damages that may have resulted from such defects.\n\nPROVIDED, notice shall be given the Contractor regarding such defects within a period of one (1) year after date of the final certificate of the completion of the work.\n\nPROVIDED, the period stipulated in any guarantee given by the Contractor has not expired.\n\nExtension of time\n\n60. Any extension of time requested by the Contractor due to circumstances beyond his control delaying the work, shall be made in writing, to the Chief Engineer, at least 10 days before expiration of the contract; any extension of time that may be granted to the Contractor shall be so granted and accepted without prejudice to any rights of His Majesty whatsoever under this contract, and no assent thereto on the part of the Contractor shall be necessary.\n\nMinister sole judge of reasonableness of extension of time for completion\n\n61. Provided always that after the expiration of the time limited for the completion of the works the Minister shall be sole judge as to what additional time, if any, may be allowed to the Contractor for such completion, and his decision as to the reasonableness or sufficiency thereof for the purpose of completion shall be final and binding upon the Contractor.\nDEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nCONTRACT AGREEMENT.\n\nTHIS AGREEMENT made (in triplicate) the Twenty-Seventh day of March in the year Nineteen Hundred and Forty A.D.\n\nBETWEEN\n\nDawson and Hall Limited,\n775 Clarke Drive,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nhereinafter called the \"Contractor\", of the first part;\n\nAND His Majesty the King, represented by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration of Canada, hereinafter called the \"Minister\", of the second part.\n\nWHEREAS the party of the first part, for the consideration hereinafter mentioned, has agreed with the party of the second part, to do, furnish and perform the work, materials, matters and things required to be done, furnished and performed, in the manner hereinafter described, in connection with the work or works:\n\nNOW THIS INDENTURE WITNESSETH that the said parties hereto, hereby covenant, promise and agree, each with the other as follows:\n\nARTICLE II The covenants, clauses, provisions and conditions of the Tender Form, General Instructions to Bidders, and Specifications, (embracing the General Conditions, Labour Conditions, General Specifications and Trade Specifications) together with the drawings and such additional detail drawings, shop drawings and instructions, as may from time to time be furnished, shall be as fully part of this Agreement as if attached hereto, or herein repeated, and should the Contractor or Minister fail to sign them, they shall nevertheless be binding on both parties.\nARTICLE II: The Contractor undertakes and agrees:\n\n(a) to do, furnish and perform, the works, materials, matters and things required to be done, furnished and performed, in connection with the following work or works namely:\n\nThe construction of a Residential School building complete with drainage and sewage disposal system; furnishing all materials, labour and plant together with all miscellaneous items of equipment and labour as may be required to carry out all work in accordance with Plan Index No. 913 Sheets 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9A, and the accompanying specifications as furnished by this Department, at Lower Fort, B.C., in the location indicated on the plot plan.\n\n(b) To complete substantially, and to the satisfaction of the Minister, all the work, on or before the date or dates following, viz.:\n\nthe thirty-first day of March Nineteen Hundred and Fifty-one A.D.\n\n(c) Time shall be deemed to be material and of the essence of this contract.\n\nARTICLE III: The Minister undertakes and agrees, in consideration of the premises, and subject to the performance and observation on the part of the Contractor, of all covenants, provisos and conditions in the Specifications contained:\n\n(a) To pay the Contractor in current funds, for the performance of the contract, Three Hundred fifty-two thousand eight hundred forty-one dollars and nine cents ($352,841.09) subject to additions and deductions as provided for in the Specifications governing the work.\n(b) To make progress payments on account thereof, as provided for in the Specifications, equal to ninety per cent (90%) of the value, proportionate to the amount of the Contract, of labour and materials incorporated into the work, as estimated by the Engineer, less the aggregate of previous payments.\n\n(c) On completion of the entire work, and on full performance of the covenants and clauses of the Specifications, to make full payment of the balance due under the Contract, as set out in the Specifications.\n\nARTICLE IV: The Contractor and the Minister for themselves, their successors, executors, administrators and assigns, hereby undertake and agree, to the full performance of the covenants contained herein.\n\nARTICLE V: The security deposit furnished His Majesty by the Contractor shall be held and retained by His Majesty as security for the due and complete performance, observance and fulfilment by the Contractor of all the covenants and provisions of this Contract.

Hall\n\nGentlemen:\n\nRe: Indian Residential School, Lower Post, BC.\n\nWe are mailing to you today, under separate cover, three prints of each of our drawings V. 2621/E1 to E5 inclusive, being erection diagrams of steelwork which we are fabricating to your order for the above mentioned building in general accordance with Architect's drawings Nos. 913-1 to 9 inclusive.\n\nPlease note the following points:-\n\n1. As arranged we propose to make the following substitutions for the steel sections shown on the Architect's drawings:-\n\n| Required | Proposed Substitution |\n|----------|-----------------------|\n| 14 WF @ 43# | 15 I @ 42.9# |\n| 16 WF @ 50# | 18 WF @ 55# |\n| 21 WF @ 96# | 20 I @ 65.4# with 2 - 9x\u00bd Cover Plates |\n| 21 WF @ 62# | 20 I @ 65.4# |\n| 18 WF @ 64# | 20 I @ 65.4# |\n| 10 I @ 15# | 8 I @ 18.4# |\n| 8 LB @ 13# | 7 I @ 15.3# |\n| 8 WF @ 24# columns | 8 WF @ 25.9# |\n| 8 WF @ 20# columns | 6 H @ 20# |\n\n2. In checking over the Architect's drawings we find that the flanges of all the columns, as shown on the floor plans, do not face in the same direction as on the footing plan. Our erection diagrams show the column flanges oriented to agree with the footing plan.\n\n3. The four columns 37'-0\" in from the outside wall of both the north and south wings have been located 4\" inside the outside wall line.\n\n4. On Architects drawing No. 913-3 beam in north wing shown as 14 WF @ 43# while corresponding beam in southwing is shown as 12 WF @ 27#. We have queried this on our erection diagram E2.

It is suggested that this beam should be placed on the underside of the floor and possibly carried to the corridor wall line.

Applewhaite, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Applewhaite:\n\nRe: Indian Residential School,\nLower Post, B.C.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of May 24th and may advise you that tenders were invited through the medium of regional newspaper advertisements for carrying out the construction of this building.\n\nThe lowest tender received was from Dawson and Hall, Limited, Vancouver, B.C., and P.G. 851 dated February 21st, 1950, authorized acceptance of the tender mentioned. The firm has already begun construction.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDirector.\nMust Explain Fees Paid Ottawa Architect\n\nHigh officials of the Federal Works Department and the Citizenship and Immigration Department will be summoned before the Public Accounts Committee of the Commons to explain fees paid to Ottawa architect W. E. Noffke.\n\nOpposition members this morning brought assurance from Chairman David Croll that a full explanation of two payments made to Mr. Noffke would be forthcoming from departmental officials.\n\nCited in Report.\n\nThe payments were cited in the 1948-49 report of Auditor-General William Short, which today was under discussion.\n\nThe Auditor-General's report said an agreement was made by the Mines and Resources Department with Mr. Noffke through his son-in-Council in February, 1948. In August he received payment of $13,800, 75 percent of his total fee for plans for a school building in the Yukon Territory.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch of the Works Department now comes under Citizenship and Immigration.\n\nLater Mr. Noffke had been asked to draw a second plan of the same school at a lower cost and had received $7,200 on account.\n\nProgressive Conservative Leader Robert Drew objected to the payments in view of the fact that no construction had gone on in the fiscal year.\n\nRoss Thatcher, CCF-Moosejaw, asked why Public Works Department architects haven't have prepared the plans. Mr. Thatcher said the payments seemed excessive.\n\nHe asked why Works Department architects should be standing idly by while the Department was hiring outside architects to do work in another province.\n\nJohn Hambacher, Progressive Conservative member for Lake Centre, asked for the total amount of government paid to outside architects by the Works Department in the 1948-49 fiscal period.\n\n\"Was this contract let without competition?\" Mr. Drew asked.\n\nCalling Witnesses.\n\nChairman Croll said officials of the Works and Citizenship departments would be called to answer such questions.\n\nMr. Thatcher asked why the architect's fee had been paid even before the building was started.\n\n\"Is he finished now or is he putting in further bills?\" the CCP member pursued.\n\n\"Of course he is putting in further bills,\" Mr. Croll answered. \"For the supervision of the job.\"\n\n\"There's something wrong here,\" Mr. Thatcher insisted.\n\nConstruction of a temporary fish products laboratory in Ottawa on rented land was criticized. Mr. Thatcher said it would have been cheaper to build when the Government's lease on the land was due to expire.\nAnd any other officials who should see this item\n\nTo be retained in Branch\n\nTo be initialed and returned with clipping to Editorial and Information Section.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6482, file 942-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nB.F.

The teacher did not have facts available to show how many of the pupils enrolled are of Indian status. She expects \"some\" to attend the Indian school next year, but she is not sure that she is returning to this school. Her salary is $2700 (seven years' experience) but this figure probably includes an isolation bonus.\n\nThe teacherage is quite spacious and well-furnished.\n\nC.A.F.

The opinion expressed was -\n\n(a) That the whole room, now housing both the walk-in and commercial type refrigerator, should be fitted out as a walk-in unit. The door should be hung on the left jamb to swing out;\n(b) That the commercial refrigerator be located on the left side of the kitchen, against the exterior wall;\n(c) That space be provided on the right-hand exterior wall for the compressor unit of the walk-in refrigerator;\n(d) The space now constituting the walk-in unit be narrowed to 5'10\" by the present width of 10'0\" and assigned to fish storage, with the balance of the refrigerator assigned to other perishable goods and meat; and\n\nCont'd....\n(e) Rails and hooks to be provided for the latter area as equipment to hang five beef or venison carcasses.\n\nA larger scale dimensioned drawing of the kitchen area affected should be prepared, and a specification written from which the Army may have Messrs. Dawson and Hall, General Contractors, obtain competitive tenders for the issuance of an extra work order. As is customary, the specification should not refer to any specific manufacturer's product, and should provide for the submission of shop drawings by the successful tenderer for checking purposes.\n\nWhen the drawing and specification is completed, twelve copies of each should be sent to this office for transmission to the Army.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nChas.

MacKay, Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Major MacKay;\n\nI am writing in regard to some used lumber stored at Teslin, Y.T. This lumber came from dismantled Army buildings and was purchased by the Indian Affairs Branch about three years ago, with a view of using it for the construction of temporary buildings, while the proposed Residential School was being built. Inasmuch as the Residential School site was transferred to Lower Post, this material has been lying here at Teslin, unused and is rapidly deteriorating.\n\nI believe that we could make very good use of this lumber and certain pieces of equipment at the Lower Post Residential School for the construction of service buildings, such as garage, storehouse etc. If we could obtain this material now, it would save us considerable expense later on. Furthermore if it is left much longer where it is, its value will be so impaired as to be of little value to anyone. If we were able to obtain this material for the Lower Post School, we would be careful to finish and paint any buildings made with it, so as to harmonize with the new main building.\n\nThe equipment in question consists of several thousand feet of used lumber, beams, rafters, flooring and some V-joint; also a steel storage tank and a couple of stoves. Not so very far in the future we will be looking for material like this and it would be a decided help to have this on hand.\n\nI have not seen the Lower Post School for the past six weeks, as I have been travelling around the Territory. However latest reports from the Army supervisor indicate that construction is going very well. I trust that you will give the above request your sympathetic attention.\n\nWith kind personal regards.\n\nVery sincerely,\n\nA.H.

The purchase and operation of a 3-ton truck on a weekly schedule would be a rather expensive proposition. While you say that the rate from Dawson Creek to Lower Post is $3.10 per hundred pounds with a minimum of four tons, I understand that the British Yukon Navigation Company of Whitehorse provides a weekly way-freight trucking service between Dawson Creek and Whitehorse. Would this not be a more economical method of serving the school than for the school management to send a heavy truck the full distance each week, even though the Department bought the truck?\"\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would advise concerning the cost of this way-freight trucking service. You should also provide any other information which will assist us in urging the necessity of providing this truck.\n\nBernard F.

Fleury, O.M.I.,\nSt. Joseph's Church,\nOblate Fathers,\n535 - 8th Street,\nSaskatoon, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Father Fleury:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant and have carefully noted its contents.\n\nI have noted particularly the communications which you received, and I can realize that they could have been interpreted to mean what you considered they did. However, while Father Plourde was informed that it was our intention to supply a truck, we did not advise him that you could be authorized to make the purchase. Before any department can purchase a vehicle such as a truck, the matter has to be referred to the Vehicle Control Board, and of course, the purchase has to be made through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nWe have submitted the contents of your previous letter to the Purchasing Branch with the requisition for the truck, and it is quite possible that the order will be placed with the firm from whom you received the quotation, but I am not in a position to state definitely that the order will be placed with that firm.\n\nIn spite of your previous experience in Indian work, I feel that it is advisable at the present time to direct your special attention to the following matters for your future guidance:\n\n....2\n1. The official name of the school is \"Lower Post Indian Residential School\".\n\n2. The Lower Post School is located in the Fort St. John Indian Agency, and the Superintendent is E.J. Galibois, Fort St. John, B.C.\n\n3. When it is desired to either purchase or repair equipment, or repairs are required to the building, you should forward detailed information regarding what is needed and the approximate cost, to Superintendent Galibois who in turn will communicate with the department through the office of Indian Commissioner W.S. Arneil at Vancouver.\n\n4. While we are supplying at the outset cleaning equipment, such as brooms, mops, brushes, etc.; dishes, tableware and bed clothes, it should be definitely understood that such expendable articles are not subsequently supplied by the department, but will have to be purchased by the school management from the per capita allowance or other receipts.\n\n5. It is our intention to supply hotel ware type of crockery, and enamelware will not be purchased for kitchen pots, etc.\n\nIn reviewing your requisition, it is noted that there is an entry,\n\n1000 ft. lumber\n1 x 12 and 2 x 12,\n\nand it is noted from your letter of the 19th ultimo that this can be obtained at $70.00 per 1000. Do you mean 1000 of each size or 1000 ft. of the two sizes combined. If the latter, you may purchase same. If the former, the cost will be over $100.00, and you should forward a\nrequisition so that we can have a Purchase Order issued. When sending this requisition, you should state the name and address of the local firm from whom you state it can be obtained at the price mentioned above.\n\nIt is noted that letters should be addressed to Watson Lake, Y.T., and that telegrams should be addressed to Lower Post, B.C.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nLower Post, B.C.\nOctober 19, 1950\n\nMr. P. Phelan,\nChief Education Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan;\n\nYou will find enclosed the list of equipment etc. for the Indian School at Lower Post, which supplements the previous list forwarded to you. I am also returning the list which you kindly sent me some time ago. I have tried to make my list as complete as possible and hope the Department will find it satisfactory. I would respectfully suggest that the equipment and appliances be of a heavy duty type for institutional purposes; thus the children's crockery should be of hotel ware type. If plastic is chosen, there should be a guarantee that it will stand up under very hot water. Enamelware is not at all suitable for kitchen pots. It chips and leads to unsanitary conditions. The regular heavy hotelware type lasts almost indefinitely, new bottoms can be put in when necessary and each vessel re-tinned yearly at small cost.\n\nThere will be need for quite a bit of shelving to be erected after the contractor is finished, and in certain rooms well finished heavy seat benches should be installed. For these purposes I have requested lumber, which can be supplied by a local mill for $70.00 per M. If there is any question about the list please get in touch with me.\n\nThe school is coming along nicely. The top floor is just about completed and the painters will soon start decorating. For your information, letters should be addressed to me at Watson Lake Y.T. as there is direct plane service there. Telegrams to be addressed to Lower Post, B.C. With kindest regards.\n\nVery sincerely,\n\nA.H. Fleury, O.M.I.\nLower Post, B.C.\nOctober 16, 1950\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan;\n\nI am enclosing a list of furniture and bedding supplies etc. for the Lower Post School. This list is complete in regard to this type of furnishings, however I am preparing a supplementary list of other items, such as kitchen and household smallware, which will go forward in the following mail. At that time I will return the list that you sent me some weeks ago.\n\nIn regard to the enclosed list, I have made it as complete as possible, yet it contains nothing of a superfluous nature. My intention was to requisition those items, which would furnish the school in a practical and efficient manner. This is an extremely cold country and to a large extent we will be isolated, so it is necessary that the furnishings of the school be comfortable and durable.\n\nAs mentioned above, I will send another list in the next mail, which should complete our furnishings, down to the smallest detail. I intend to ask Mr. Davies, the B.C. school inspector, to help me prepare the classroom supplies, as he is acquainted with the latest items supplied by the Department. In like manner, I will send my drug requisition through Dr. Tenant of Vancouver. He was up here recently and suggested that procedure. I trust that this will be agreeable to you.\n\nVery sincerely,\n\nA.H. Fleury, O.M.I.\n\nP.S. What will be the official name of the School?\nNovember 6, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nAttached you will find requisitions for equipment and supplies for the Lower Post Indian Residential School. This school is a new building and the requirements are for all items required for the opening and efficient operation of the school. It is expected that the school will go into operation on or about January 1, 1951. It is, therefore, respectfully requested that every effort be made to have this equipment delivered prior to that date.\n\nThe capacity of the school is for approximately 120 pupils plus a staff of 20 adults. The Department is anxious to provide the most suitable equipment for an institution of this size. The large stock pots should be in bi-metal or aluminum. The smaller articles should be in aluminum or stainless steel.

Simpson's Western catalogue was not satisfactory as many of the items were missing.\n\nAs Dawson Creek is 620 miles from the school, it is imperative that this Branch be informed immediately when an order has been placed with a firm, in order that we might inform the parties concerned to be on the lookout for the ordered items and arrange for trucking as soon as the items reach the end of the railway. Therefore, it would be\nappreciated if our copies would be forwarded to this office as soon as the suppliers copy has been sent out.\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Neary;\n\nI wish to acknowledge and thank you for letter of November 3rd, file number 942-1-5-14E1.\n\nI realize that you have done all that is possible to correct the unfortunate misunderstanding that has led to the present situation; a situation that is very embarrassing to myself and which can well lead to financial loss by the dealer I contacted. In some years a truck could be sold easily enough, but in view of the prevailing poor crops, there is no demand at all. I sincerely hope that the purchasing agent will take all aspects of the case into account and order the truck from the firm involved. I have no alternative but to remain here until this question is decided. Consequently, would you be kind enough to advise me, at the earliest possible moment, when a definite decision has been reached.\n\nI wish to advise you that I have noted the instructions, contained in the second part of your letter: namely, that the school is to be known as the Lower Post Indian Residential School; that it is to be under the Fort St. John Agency, whose superintendent, Mr. E.J. Galibois, should be contacted in case of repairs etc. I have also noted the information given, in regard to furnishings and kitchenware.\n\nThe lumber required is 500' 2x12 and 500' 1x12, to cost $70.00. Following your instructions, I will arrange to purchase same.\n\nPlease keep in mind that I will be in Saskatoon until further notice.\n\nVery sincerely,\n\nA.H.

Presumably, the heating plant has not been changed. I enclose a copy of a wire sent to Father Fleury regarding oil for the lighting plant.\n\nI have also received a letter from him inquiring about the van or trailer. You will remember that this was included in his original letter, but as far as I remember had not been mentioned to us previously. Consequently, when we submitted the memorandum to the Minister about the per capita rate, we only mentioned the truck and not the trailer.\n\nIf my memory serves me correctly, when we were issuing the requisition for the truck, you stated that the trailer should not be included in it. This was correct in view of the fact that we had not mentioned it in the original submission to the Minister, as stated above.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\n\nPP/ST\nEng.\nRev.

Therefore it is suggested in both cases adding 1/4\" thick brown linoleum glued on to our regular tables too, although this would mean there would be nothing around the edge of this linoleum, but we do believe it would be so glued that there would be no trouble with pupils prying it loose with their finger nails. The extra costs for the above would be as follows:\n\n(a) The 9 folding banquet tables 30\" x 96\" would be priced at $5.75 additional each, which would give an individual cost of $27.75 each, plus 5% sales tax, plus the same freight as originally quoted.\n\n(b) On the 15 folding banquet tables 30\" x 120\" there would be an additional charge of $6.25 each, which would come to $53.75 each, plus 5% sales tax, plus the same freight as originally quoted.\nConcerning the kindergarten tables 36\" x 48\" with book shelf, we feel that the reinforcing we discussed with you can be done at no extra charge, although to be on the safe side it would be appreciated if you would consider $1.50 extra for each table, if this is necessary, on future orders. However, we feel it can be done at the same price as originally quoted you, namely $25.25 per table, plus sales tax, plus freight.\n\nYour early comments will be awaited with a great deal of interest, and we would appreciate receiving this additional business.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n(Arthur J.

This school is a new building and the requirements are for all items required for the opening and efficient operation of the school. It is expected that the school will go into operation on or about January 1, 1951. It is, therefore, respectfully requested that every effort be made to have this equipment delivered prior to that date.\n\nThe capacity of the school is for approximately 120 pupils plus a staff of 20 adults. The Department is anxious to provide the most suitable equipment for an institution of this size. The large stock pots should be in bi-metal or aluminum. The smaller articles should be in aluminum or stainless steel. Enamelware will not be acceptable except where indicated.\n\nFor dishes and dinnerware, the heavy hotelware chinaware should be supplied. Plastic will not be accepted.\n\nFor staff, dinnerware and flatware, Eaton's Western catalogue was used as a guide. Simpson's Western catalogue was not satisfactory as many of the items were missing.\n\nAs Dawson Creek is 620 miles from the school, it is imperative that this Branch be informed immediately when an order has been placed with a firm, in order that we might inform the parties concerned to be on the lookout for the ordered items and arrange for trucking as soon as the items reach the end of the railway. Therefore, it would be\nappreciated if our copies would be forwarded to this office as soon as the suppliers copy has been sent out.\n\nBernard F.

Coudert, O.M.I.,\nVicar Apostolic of Whitehorse,\nP.O. Box 35, Whitehorse, Y.T.\n\nDear Bishop Coudert:\n\nLower Post Indian Residential School\n\nIn your letter of January 3rd forwarding accounts for rental of school buildings, you referred to the Lower Post Residential School.\n\nThe purchase of the truck has not yet been finally completed, but it is expected that we will receive the Purchase Order within the next week. There is no doubt about obtaining the truck, but as I explained to you when you were in Ottawa, there are a great number of formalities to be carried out before vehicles can be purchased, and while the delay is apparently bothering Father Fleury, it is due to circumstances beyond our control.\n\nWe have, however, placed purchase orders for a major portion of the furnishings required for the school. Copies of these purchase orders have been addressed to Father Fleury at Watson Lake, and as I was not certain if he had left Saskatoon, a copy of our letter to Watson Lake was also forwarded to him at Saskatoon. In the majority of cases, we requested the firm to ship at the earliest possible date and I feel that by February 15th some of the furnishings at least should reach the school. We have notified North American Trucking and Transporting Co. Limited, that they are to handle the trucking of the equipment from Dawson Creek to the school.\n\n.....2\nIn our letter to Father Fleury, I pointed out that as soon as the furnishings are received and if they are satisfactory, he should certify the accounts and forward same to Ottawa for payment. From your experience with us, you will realize the importance of having all the accounts reach us before the end of March, the close of our fiscal year.\n\nThe copies of the purchase orders sent to Father Fleury showed the approximate date on which shipment should be made by the firm with whom the order was placed. If there is any undue delay in this particular regard, Father Fleury should wire us at once so that we can communicate with the firm and have all shipments reach the school before the end of March.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nDecember 18, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Charles H.

Box 95,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\n\nDear Bishop Coudert:\n\nRe: Lower Post Residential School\n\nI received your kind letter of January 15th and appreciate very much its contents.\n\nNo doubt you have received by this time, the letter which I wrote you last week regarding the furnishings for the Lower Post School. As stated in that letter, Purchase Orders for most of the furnishings have already been issued and copies of these Purchase Orders have been forwarded to Father Fleury. I presume that Father Fleury will be stationed at Lower Post so that he can get in touch with the Schmidt Transporting Company and make certain that the shipments reach Dawson Creek and that the Company takes charge of them.\n\nIn our letter to Father Fleury we advised him of the rate that is charged for a four-ton load. In view of the quantity of furnishings being ordered, it should not be difficult to arrange for a load to the capacity just mentioned.\n\nI also enclose for your information a copy of a progress report on the construction of the school. You will note from this that the Colonel in charge of Works and Accommodation considers that the school will be completed by February 15th, 1951.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nOttawa, Ontario,\n\nJan 51\n\nRe: Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDevelopment Services Branch,\nDepartment of Resources & Development,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Progress Report on\nIndian Residential School,\nLower Post, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Gibson:\n\nFollowing is a breakdown of construction progress on the Indian Residential School at Lower Post, B.C., which is being constructed for your Department by the Army.\n\nThe breakdown is as follows:\n\n(a) Clearing 100%\n(b) Excavation (hand) 100%\n(c) Excavation (bulk) 100%\n(d) Filling Earth Bankfill 80%\n(e) Gravel under floors 100%\n(f) Drainage fibre tile 100%\n(g) Concrete 100%\n(h) Floor finishing concrete 90%\n(i) Forms 100%\n(j) Masonry 100%\n(k) Waterproofing 100%\n(l) Carpentry 97%\n(m) Millwork 93%\n(n) Sanitaryware 100%\n(o) Insulation 100%\n(p) Structural steel 100%\n(q) Structural steel 100%\n(r) Miscellaneous Iron 90%\n(s) Steel work 100%\n(t) Glazing 100%\n\nProgress of sub-contractors required to supply the following:\n\n(a) Roofing and sheet metal 100%\n(b) Mastic and asphalt tile 80%\n(c) Linoleum 90%\n(d) Electric wiring 90%\n(e) Electric generator 60%\n(f) Plumbing 60%\n(g) Heating 60%\n(h) Painting 70%\n\nThe total percentage completed to date is 94% with the estimated date of completion as 15 Feb 51.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n(L.G.C.

R. Prowse Range Co. Limited, through J.L.G. LeCours of Ottawa, should be accepted, with the added item of a peel trap for the vegetable peeler at a cost of $37.00.\n\nThis added item will raise the Prowse tender to a new total of Ten Thousand One Hundred Fifty-five Dollars and Fifty-six Cents ($10,155.56), f.o.b. Dawson Creek. The Prowse tender promises delivery in approximately 40 days.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch has already made arrangements for transportation of equipment from Dawson Creek to Lower Post with the North American Trucking and Distributing Co. Ltd., of Dawson Creek. These arrangements will be brought to bear on transportation required for equipment on which you recently invited tenders, among which the above-noted materials are included.\n\nIt is anticipated that the only reasonable arrangement that can be reached for installing equipment will be with the general contractors, Dawson and Hall, who erected the building. In this regard, only the Army personnel who are supervising the work have records of how space in the designated areas has been affected by on-the-job departures from the original architectural layout. Consequently, before installation of any kitchen, laundry or refrigeration equipment can be undertaken, revised layouts of the space will be\n\nCont'd....\nrequired. This office is contacting the general contractors by Army Signal today to obtain these layouts, which in turn must be furnished to the supply firms before their installation drawings can be prepared. The connection or installation demands on water, power, and drainage services, established from the manufacturers installation drawings, will then be included in the general contractor's installation price.\n\nThe supplier of each type of equipment should be informed of these responsibilities at the time the order is placed.\n\nIt is understood that your office will obtain the necessary authority for the purchase.\n\nThe tenders and summary which accompanied your memorandum of January 31st are returned herewith.\n\nCHB:AB\n\nEncls.\n\nChas.

Dawson Creek, B.C.\n\nDepartmental arrangements have already been completed for the transportation of equipment from Dawson Creek to the school, and when all equipment for which you have recently invited tenders reaches the site, the general contractors, Messrs. Dawson and Hall, will be requested to submit a price for installation.\n\nBruce Robinson Electric Ltd. should be reminded that the terms of tendering obligates them to furnish the Department with layout drawings for approval. Such drawings, however, can only be completed when we have assured them that no changes in the original layout have been made during construction by the Army engineers supervising the job. The general contractors have been requested to obtain the necessary information, which is not expected to affect the refrigeration installation. Nevertheless, when we hear from the general contractors, Bruce Robinson Electric Ltd. will be advised.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Neary;\n\nSupplementing my letter, dated January 19th, I am listing below several additional matters, which I wish to draw to your attention:\n\n1. Now that the school kitchen is finished, only awaiting reception of equipment, it becomes apparent that an extraordinary length of stove pipe will be needed to reach from the stove to the chimney. This presents a twofold disadvantage; firstly, because the ceiling is not very high and the pipe will have to be large, it will detract greatly from the appearance of the kitchen and bakery room. It will have to pass through the wall into the bakery room and continue its ugly length to the far corner of same, dodging a few steam and water pipes on the way. Secondly, and far more serious, this long length of stove pipe will drip creosote constantly, no matter how well it is fitted. This is due to the type of firewood in this country. I have been told that it will be necessary to hang pails at each joint and further that the whole length of pipe will have to be taken down once a week and cleaned. If this is so, and dependable local inhabitants have assured me that it is, some change will have to be made, otherwise we will be put to a considerable degree of trouble and a mess will be created in the two places, kitchen and bakery, where it is necessary to maintain a high degree of cleanliness, above all others. Will you please take this matter up with the architect at once. I would suggest that for the time being, the kitchen stove flue should run through the roof right above the stove, utilizing what is called a 'Yukon chimney'. Later on during the summer a permanent solution could be found. There are enough bricks left over here to build an extra chimney.\n\n2. A number of parcels have arrived here from the Department, mostly stationery supplies, on which we have had to pay cartage charges from Dawson Creek, B.C. I know that it is the intention of the Department to prepay all the way to the school, so I would like to know what procedure I should follow in securing re-imbursement for past payments and also for the future. So far I have receipts for all expenditures of this nature.\n\n3. As you know, it is the Bishop's intention, with the approval of the Department, to bring the children from the Grouard School and the\nLejac School to Lower Post as soon as the building is ready. Apparently the expenses of these transfers have to be borne by the Lower Post School. We are anxious to have these children so that the school may get under way promptly, but we will require some financial assistance in the way of a special transportation grant from the Department. Will you therefore, please consider this as an application for a grant to cover the transportation of children from these two schools. I can ascertain the exact cost and so inform you as soon as possible. I would be very grateful if you would let me know the Department's attitude in this matter, by return mail.\n\n4. In a previous requisition, I requested for the use of the School, one 16mm sound projector. This machine would have educational as well as recreational benefits. I see no mention of this equipment in the purchase orders and thought that perhaps it was overlooked. I need hardly tell you how important such a machine would be to us up here. We are very limited in our recreational facilities and the children coming from other schools can hardly help but draw comparisons to our disadvantage, since they have enjoyed moving pictures, both recreational and educational in their former schools. I trust that you will ask the Department to give special consideration to this matter.\n\n5. In a previous letter, I requested information about installation of the school telephone. The cost of services to connect the school was quoted by the C.N.T. as about $75.00. I did not receive any reply to my request for information, but I notice on my return to Lower Post that the poles have been erected by the C.N.T. to carry the wires to the school. Apparently they had to get the poles set up before the ground froze too hard. Please advise me on this matter.\n\nI wish to take this opportunity to thank you and other members of the Department for your kind co-operation and assistance in getting the Lower Post Indian School under way. Naturally, in an undertaking of this nature, it is to be expected that many unforeseen difficulties and problems will crop up, whose solution requires mutual understanding. We, who are to live in the school are apt to see things solely from a practicable standpoint. I mention this to assure you of my utmost sincerity in requesting adjustments of furnishings and equipment, as above.\n\nVery sincerely,\n\nA.H. Fleury, O.M.I.

The contents of this paragraph are being forwarded to the Chief of the Engineering Service, as the erection of the Lower Post School comes under his Division.\n\n2. We are prepared to pay the cartage charges from Dawson Creek on the parcels mentioned in the second paragraph of your letter, but would it not be possible to hold some or these parcels in Dawson Creek until one of the larger loads is going forward and thus save extra expense? We ordered the stationery supplies so that they will reach the school in good time, but as we all know they are not absolutely necessary at the moment.\n\n3. We are prepared to assist in the cost of the transportation of the children being transferred to the school, but our funds for travelling expenses have been considerably reduced, and consequently, we will not be able to provide any large amount. You might let me know what you estimate the expense will be.\n\n4. It is not our usual practice to supply a 16 mm projector to a residential school. However, if any residential school purchases this type of projector and forwards to us the receipted account, we are prepared to refund half...\nthe expenditure incurred. If you want more particulars regarding the type of projector we suggest be purchased on the basis mentioned, please let me know.\n\n5. With reference to the installation of a telephone, I am communicating with Indian Commissioner Arneil.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nA/Superintendent of Education\nFebruary 15, 1951.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

You will be advised when such action is taken, and at that time a decision can be made regarding the additional funds that might be advanced to you in order to cover current expenses prior to the reception of pupils.\n\nI understand that the Principal, Reverend A.H.

When this information is received, your representations will have careful consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLeval Fortier.\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of yours of Jan. 30.\n\nFather Fleury has just visited Whitehorse and we discussed together several problems connected with the turnover of the School Building from the contractors \"Dawson and Hall\" to us.\n\nIn this connection I am sending you herewith a copy of my letter to Deputy Minister Laval Fortier, who had asked me, when I was in Ottawa to let him know whether we were in need of more money before the school is actually in operation.\n\nI hope that the Officials of the Branch will back our demands, as we are certainly in urgent need of financial assistance to carry on until the children come in.\n\nWe have advised the Sisters of Saint Ann (three or four in number) to come to Lower Post after Easter, and help us to prepare the arrival of the children, as soon as it will be possible to look properly after them.\n\nYou will also notice the postscriptum of my letter to the Deputy Minister regarding the cost of transportation of the children of Grouard and Lejac back to their country and the Lower Post School.\n\nMay I ask your Officials further information concerning the School?\n\n1.- Is it possible to call the School \"Saint John's Residential School\" or, if the Department is reluctant to give it a Christian name, could it be called by a name recalling the Indian tribes it will serve, e.g., \"Nahanni Residential School\"? Nahanni is the Indian name for \"People of the Setting Sun\"; it is the name given by the Dene or Athabascans of the River McKenzie to all their Dene or Athabascan brothers living beyond the Rockies, where the sun sets.\n\n2.- Why is it that Superintendent Clarke has not been designated to supervise the School, since the School is located in his agency, and the Lower Post Indians come under his present care? We find it strange that Agent Meek, who has already more than he can handle in his own huge Agency of the Yukon should be designated to supervise the Lower Post School. The ideal set up would be to have Superintendent Clarke moved to Lower Post with a subagent located at Telegraph Creek; such was my suggestion to the Officials of the Branch last Fall.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.L.

Eaton Company and Marshall-Wells Company.\n\nI wish to point out a discrepancy in the Marshall-Wells invoice, towards which, you may care to show consideration. Departmental purchase order #1162 calls for one only rubber tired hand truck, whereas Marshall-Wells has shipped two of these items, and invoiced accordingly. We would be glad to have the extra hand truck at the school, as it would serve many useful purposes. Consequently I would recommend keeping it here, rather than have it returned to the company; provided that this meets with your approval.\n\nVery sincerely,\n\nA.H. Fleury, O.M.I.

You will note the following:\n\n1. The price of 3 gross clothes pins raised from $2.70 to $3.89.\n\n2. Purchase Order was for 12 platters and the company supplied 18, and the Principal requests that he be allowed to retain the extra 6. This means an additional charge of $11.03.\n\n3. The Purchase Order included one hand truck. The company supplied 2 and the Principal requests that he be allowed to retain the second one. This makes an additional amount of $12.88.\n\n4. I also direct your attention to the undermentioned items on the Purchase Order for which the extensions are not correct:\n\n   - 2 sets kitchen salt and peppers at 36\u00a2 should read 72\u00a2 and not $1.32.\n   - 18 wire soap holders at 20\u00a2 should read $3.60 and not $2.60.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would authorize the Treasury to accept the account as submitted.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nA/Superintendent of Education\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6482)\n\nFile 942-1, part 1\nStikine Agency - Lower Post Residential School - (Teslin Lake) - General Administration. 1940 - 1950\n\nFile 942-5, part 1\nStikine Agency - Lower Post Residential School - (Teslin Lake) Establishment - Supplies-Accounts (plans). 1946 - 1949\n\nFile 942-5, part 2\nStikine Agency - Lower Post Residential School - (Teslin Lake) Specification. 1949\n\nFile 942-5, part 3\nStikine Agency - Lower Post Residential School - (Teslin Lake) Establishment - Accounts-Building Specifications (plan). 1949 - 1950\n\nFile 942-5, part 4\nStikine Agency - Lower Post Residential School - (Teslin Lake) Building Maintenance-Supplies-Accounts (plan). 1950 - 1951\n\nFile 942-10, part 1\nStikine Agency - Lower Post Residential School - (Teslin Lake) Admissions & Discharges. 1950 - 1953\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nCLOSED FILE\n\nFILE NUMBER 942-10 VOLUME 1\n\nSUBJECT ADMISSIONS AND DISCHARGES\nLOWER POST RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSTIKINE AGENCY\n\nCORRESPONDENCE FROM MAR. 1951 TO SEPT. 1953\n\nNO FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE TO BE PLACED ON THIS FILE\n\nNOTE: For subsequent correspondence relevant to the subject matter of this closed file see\nFILE 166/25-2-942 VOLUME 1\n## Indian Affairs Branch\n\n### Department of Citizenship and Immigration\n\n#### Subject: Admissions & Discharges\n\n**Lower Post Indian Residential School**\n\n**Skitine Agency**\n\n| Reference | Date       |\n|-----------|------------|\n| E         | 26759      |\n| E         | 38687      |\n| E         | 41         |\n| E         | 40         |\n| E         | 20         |\n| E         | 67         |\n| E         | 67         |\n| E         | 27         |\n| E         | 52         |\n| E         | 27         |\n| E         | 52         |\n| E         | 74         |\n| E         | 70273      |\n| E         | 70396      |\n| E         | 27         |\n| E         | 27         |\n| E         | 27         |\n| E         | 27         |\n| E         | 27         |\n| E         | 27         |\n| E         | 27         |\n| E         | 27         |\n| E         | 27         |\n| E         | 27         |\n| E         | 27         |\n| E         | 27         |\n| E         | 27         |\n| E         | 27         |\n| E         | 27         |\n| E         | 27         |\n| E         | 27         |\n| E         | 27         |\n\n**DO NOT WRITE BELOW THIS LINE**\nNew Lower Post Residential School (St. John's) During the latter part of May construction of the above noted school commenced. Although schedule to be completed during the following December delays in construction were unavoidable due to material delivery and later cold weather which slowed work. Recent advice reveals that the school is due to open April 1st 1951 having an accommodation of between 100 to 120 pupils in residence. With the opening of this institution, many problems effecting the general welfare of large Indian families located at various bush camps can be solved by the admission of their children and due to its location in this Agency transportation costs for those being admitted will be greatly reduced in comparison to previous costs paid by the Department to Grouard and Lejac located many miles distant. To date there are fifteen children of the Atlin-Teslin Band and Tahltan Bands whose applications have been received at this office and it is expected that an added ten or more will be placed there from the isolated bush camps adjacent to Lower Post and Telegraph Creek, thereby avoiding possible starvation and illiteracy which are most evident amongst these camps and neglected children. It is proposed to have these cases dealt with during the summer months forthcoming and in some cases at the time of school opening whenever it is possible to contact the families in question. Arrangements are currently underway with Father Fleury, Principal of the new school, to carry out this work. With the accent on the admission of those children whose father or mother is deceased resulting in the Department supplying direct relief to widow and children the relief costs for this Agency should take a notable decrease.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Citizenship & Immigration, OTTAWA\n\nReference D.L.981-10(E) dated February 22/50.\n\nApplication is made herewith for the enrollment of Patricia WILLIAMS, daughter of Steve and Elizabeth Williams, native of the Atlin-Teslin Band in the St John's Residential School at Lower Post, B.C.\n\nIn January 1950 an application was made for the admission of Patricia's brothers and sister to the Lejac Residential school following their father's removal to Miller Bay Hospital for treatment of his active T.B. condition, on receipt of department approval.\n\nAs the child Patricia is now of school age and since she cannot obtain academic training in Atlin it is respectfully requested that her admission be approved following a satisfactory medical examination enroute at Whitehorse, Y.T.\n\nSince the father Steve Williams is due for continued lengthy hospitalization it has been necessary for this office to maintain the child from welfare funds. This office is in receipt of written request that her child be placed at the Lower Post institution from the mother.\n\nAs this family is destitute it is requested that travel costs be paid from public funds. Exact costs can not be quoted as arrangements will be made for her removal in group with other applicants but should not exceed $50.00.\n\nMay favourable consideration be granted in this instance?\n\nF.T.

A.H. Fleury, O.M.I., Principal of the Lower Post Indian Residential School. Original on File 942-5.\n\n3. As you know, it is the Bishop's intention, with the approval of the Department, to bring the children from the Grouard School and the Lejac School to Lower Post as soon as the building is ready. Apparently the expenses of these transfers have to be borne by the Lower Post School. We are anxious to have these children so that the school may get underway promptly, but we will require some financial assistant in the way of a special transportation grant from the Department. Will you therefore, please consider this as an application for a grant to cover the transportation of children from these two schools. I can ascertain the exact cost and so inform you as soon as possible. I would be very grateful if you would let me know the Department's attitude in this matter, by return mail.\n\nExtract from official letter of February 15th in reply to the above. Original on file 942-5.\n\n3. We are prepared to assist in the cost of the transportation of the children being transferred to the school, but our funds for travelling expenses have been considerably reduced, and consequently, we will not be able to provide any large amount. You might let me know what you estimate the expense will be.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Citizenship & Immigration, OTTAWA.\n\nAttached hereto, application forms for the admission of William, Belfry Harry, Albert Henry, and Eugene Etzerza, natives of the Tahltan Band to the new Lower Post Indian Residential School, Lower Post, B.C.\n\nFollowing the death of her first husband, Nanook Etzerza, the mother married Jimmy Lew of white status. Immediately after her marriage with Lew the latter party deserted his wife and his whereabouts have since been unknown to both this office and Mrs. Lew. Special permission was granted by the Department for this woman to live on Tahltan I.R. 1 so that she could care for her family of Indian status. During this time these children have received regular relief assistance amounting to approximately $50.00 per year over the past five years.\n\nDue to the location of their home some fifteen miles from Telegraph Creek the children have been unable to attend school. They have not received satisfactory supervision or training. Furthermore, due to their location they are undergoing hardship as they must transport their food supplies, by dog team some fifteen miles, since the family head is without a husband these chores and others fall upon the mother and small children.\n\nWith a view of improving the welfare of this family, this office has recently communicated with Father Fleury, principal of the new school explaining these circumstances and enquiring if it would be possible to employ Mrs. Lew in the new institution. Father Fleury has advised that he would be able to employ Mrs. Lew in the kitchen and bakery when it is opened April 1st next.\n\nThe children have been examined by the local resident physician and are in his opinion fit for admission.\nIt should be mentioned that the child Eugene Etzerza is the illegitimate Indian son of Dorothy Edna Etzerza eldest daughter of Mrs. Low. This girl with her mother reside in the same household and as the same circumstances are prevalent in this case as those for the other three children listed, Eugene's admission is also recommended.\n\nIn view of the above, will the Department approve of these applications and grant authority to provide for their air passenger costs from Telegraph Creek to Lower Post from public funds? These charges would amount to $175.00, the only means available, an approximate $44.00 per child.\n\nEnc.\nC.C. W.S. Arneil Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6482, file 942-10, part 1)\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to Supt. Clark's letter of March 2nd attached, the status of the illegitimate children of Lucy Johns of the Atlin Band has been the subject of previous correspondence with you and although some of the children were excluded from Band membership, Roy James Johns, age 4, has retained Indian status and maintenance has been paid for him by the Department.\n\nWe are not favourably impressed with Mr. Clark's solution for care of this child but can see no alternative to his admission to the Lower Post Residential School. We propose asking Mr. Clark to make a further determined effort to find a suitable foster home for this child but do not anticipate that he will be successful; in view of which tentative approval of admission of the child to the Lower Post school is recommended.\n\n-W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nW.S. Arneil Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nRe: Roy James JOHNS, age 4.\n\nWith regard to the above named and previous exchange of correspondence concerning the mother Lucy Johns (158/19-1) the following is submitted.\n\nFollowing the conviction and removal of Lucy Johns to the Provincial Gaol at Prince George, B.C. during the spring of 1950 the responsibility in obtaining an Indian person or couple to care for this child fell upon this office. After considerable difficulty arrangements were made with Mrs. Paddy Ward, an aged widow and grandmother of the child to undertake this work for a monthly fee of $15.00. No other party could be interested in caring for this child.\n\nRecent reports from the Resident Nurse at Atlin, B.C. revealed that the child was not being properly fed or attended. Mrs. Ward does not speak a great deal of English and although Nurse Reddis has attempted to correct the situation by making periodic visits to this home and instructing the old lady it has been to no apparent avail. Lucy Johns has not returned to Atlin and for all intents and purposes this child could almost be classed as that of an orphan and certainly a destitute or neglected child.\n\nThe matter was discussed with Father Fleury of the Lower Post Residential school recently and he informed this office that he would be prepared to admit Roy pending the approval of the Branch.\n\nThe cheapest travel from Atlin to Lower Post amounts to approximately $80.00 and in addition it would probably be necessary to arrange for an escort in this instance. However, it may be possible to arrange to have Supt. Meek visit Atlin with his agency car thereby avoiding this expenditure.\nMr. Arneil\n\nApplication forms for the admission of Roy Johns are being completed in Atlin and will be forwarded on receipt.

Since the death of her husband, this office has provided regular monthly relief assistance; since this family is fully dependant on government aid with no relatives financially able to assist. At the present time, there is no opportunity in Atlin whereby these children can receive an education and further as this woman is expecting another child the three enclosed applications for admission are strongly recommended.\n\nAt the time this family was in residence at this centre and the children attending the Telegraph Creek Public School, repeated trouble in endeavouring to ensure that they attend regularly was the constant concern of this office. Little co-operation was received from the mother. It is felt that constant guidance and training in a residential school would be most advantageous in this instance.\n\nAll have been medically examined and transportation costs to school should not exceed $60.00 for all three children Whitehorse to Lower Post. May approval be granted?\n\n[Signature]\n\nF. A. CLARK,\nSuperintendent.\n\nEnc.\nC.C. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nJune 6, 1951.\n\nMr. F.A. Clark,\nSupt.

Meek at Whitehorse or through the Superintendent at Telegraph Creek and the reason the enquiry was made was because we propose to hold whichever Superintendent is indicated responsible for the immediate reporting of admission and discharges to the Family Allowance Division.\n\nIn a circular letter dated March 15th to Superintendents and school Principals, a copy of which was sent to you, we stated: \"It shall be the responsibility of the Superintendent in whose Agency the residential school is located, to check the quarterly return with the application forms and to delete from the return the names of those pupils for whom no application form was completed and submitted, and to facilitate checking, application forms from outside agencies shall be forwarded to the Superintendent in charge of the agency in which the residential school is located, for forwarding to the Department.\"\n\nIn the case of the Lower Post Residential School we shall have to make an exception to this statement of procedure if the school is to remain under the supervision of Mr. Meek.\n\nW.

A.H. Fleury, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nLower Post Indian Res. School,\nLower Post, B.C.,\n\nDear Father Fleury:\n\nWith the coming of September and the opening of schools across the country, we are anxious to know whether the Lower Post Indian Residential School will open classes on September 4th.\n\nWe are under the impression that most of the necessary supplies and equipment have been shipped. Would you kindly advise whether we are correct in this respect.\n\nThere are accounts for the following Purchase Orders outstanding:\n\nP.O. # 2128 Refrigerator\n    2198 Laundry equipment\n    2621 Darning machine\n    2694 Fencing material\n    2845 Hair clippers\n    2129 Kitchen and bakery equipment\n\nIf these items have been delivered and you have the accounts, you should certify them in the usual manner.\n\nOur records indicate that we have approved admissions for about thirty pupils to enter the school for the first time.\nOn November 22, 1950, we forwarded you copies of letters sent to Reverend J. Mulvihill, O.M.I., Principal, Lejac School and Reverend G. Tessier, O.M.I., Principal, Grouard School advising them of the children that will be transferred to the Lower Post School when it opens.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would advise as soon as possible whether these pupils have been transferred, whether the new pupils have been admitted and what other pupils you are expecting shortly after opening. It would also be appreciated if you would let us know how many pupils are enrolled and have commenced their studies.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nApplications for Admission\n\nI am in receipt of Applications for Admission to the Lower Post Indian Residential School for Mack and Annie Ladue, children of Jack Ladue, No. 026, of the Selkirk Band, Yukon Agency.\n\nFr. Fleury, O.M.I., Principal of the School states: \"These two children were sent to the school by authority of the doctor who was in Ross River.\" A very severe form of measles recently swept through the Indians at Ross River and it would appear that the doctor who was sent there by Indian Health Services sent the children to the Lower Post school to protect them. Unfortunately he did not conduct a physical examination.\n\nMay approval be given for the admission of these children. They will be medically examined by a doctor being sent by Indian Health Services at Edmonton.\n\n(R.J. Meek)\nSuperintendent\nIndian Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI have Applications for Admission to the Lower Post Indian Residential School in the names of Bernadette Jack, 6, whose father is George Jack, and Patricia Williams, 6, father Stephen Williams. Both children are at Atlin, B.C., and belong to the Stikine Agency. Admissions are signed by Indian Supt. F.A. Clark.\n\nPhysical examination has not yet been completed. It will be more economical to have the children sent direct to Lower Post where Indian Health Services are arranging to have a doctor examine all the children.\n\nMay approval be granted for the admission of these two children providing their physical examination proves satisfactory.\n\nc.c.

They have been duly completed and recommended by Indian Superintendent F.A. Clark, Telegraph Creek.\n\nPhysical examination has not been completed. I have been advised that a doctor is being sent from Charles Gamsell Hospital, Edmonton, to examine all the children at the Lower Post School.\n\nMay approval for these admissions be obtained please.\n\nR.J.

Clark,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.,\n\nIt is noted that you have been forwarding applications for admission for children in your Agency seeking admission to the Lower Post School to Superintendent R.J. Meek.\n\nThis practice is not necessary. You are authorized to forward these applications when they have been completed directly to this office.\n\nWhen an admission is approved, you will be advised. Then you may take the necessary steps to place the child in the school.\n\nWhen forwarding the applications to this office for approval, you should indicate on a separate letter any special information that the particular cases may entail in order that the Department may be able to make the necessary decision.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMr. R.J. Meek,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.,\n\nThis refers to your two letters of August 31st, files 25-2-942 and 166/25-2-942 seeking approval for admission for four children to the Lower Post Indian Residential School.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would forward the applications for admission to this office for consideration.\n\nIt is appreciated that in some cases, it is not possible to have the Physical Examination section completed. In such cases, the applications should be forwarded to Ottawa where they will be considered on their merits. If there is any doubt in your mind that a child may be physically unfit, you should not forward the application to Ottawa until the Medical Examination is given.\n\nWhen a pupil enters school and has not had a Physical Examination prior to admission, the Principal should be advised in order that he may take the necessary steps to have such children examined at the school as soon as possible.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nReference admission of pupils to the Lower Post Residential School. On September 8th Fr. Dream, O.M.I., Teslin, Y.T., phoned to obtain authority to send three children to the school as the parents were proceeding to their trap-line. I had received a previous request from Fr. Fleury, principal of the Lower Post School that he was not quite ready for pupils. I therefore requested Fr. Dream to phone Fr. Fleury and if he would accept the children, to place them on the bus which was due at Teslin.\n\nI have now been in conversation with Fr. Fleury by phone, he has a few pupils at the school and one class is in session. He does not wish children sent until laundry equipment is installed. He is visiting Whitehorse on Thursday to make final arrangements before opening the school.\n\nI have issued a Transportation Warrant for the three children from Teslin to Lower Post and trust that this action will meet with your approval. It is not known how many children are to be sent by bus from the Yukon, and how many Fr. Fleury will take by private car. May I have authority to make the most convenient and economical arrangements with Fr. Fleury for transportation of pupils to Lower Post Residential School.\n\ne.e.

Indian Agency,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.,\n\nThis refers to your letter of\nSeptember 11, file 166/2--2-942 regarding\ntransportation of Indian children to the\nLower Post Indian Residential School.\n\nIt has been a practice of long\nstanding that the Department would pay the\ntransportation charges for pupils entering a\nresidential school for the first time and on\nleaving the school after discharge provided\nthe parents are unable to contribute.\nTransportation charges are not paid by the\nDepartment for children leaving and returning\nto school for holidays. These costs must be\nmet by the parents or the schools concerned.\n\nThe Department authorizes you to\nmake the most economical arrangements with\nFather Fleury for the transportation of Indian\nchildren to the Lower Post Indian Residential\nSchool.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA,\nOntario.\n\nI am in receipt of Application for Admission to the Lower Post Indian Residential School on behalf of Susie Doris Dick, grandchild of Frank Dick, 003, of the Frances Lake Band.\n\nAlso application on behalf of Mary Dick, daughter of Frank Dick, 003, Frances Lake Band. These two girls are eight and eleven years old.\n\nDuring the measles epidemic at Ross River both children were taken to the Lower Post school on medical advice. They have been there since the beginning of the present school term. May approval be obtained for their admission. Physical examination has not yet been conducted.\n\nC.C.

Fleury O.M.I.,\nPrincipal\nLower Post Residential School\nLower Post, B.C.\n\nDear Father Fleury:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of Aug. 27th regarding the admission of Alice Bill, Aida Jack and Dorothy Johnson to the School. I understand that more definite information about these cases is desirable and very willingly I hasten to give it.\n\nApart from the fact that these girls are anxious to get more education but have no chance to go to any other school, the social environment in which they live presently is a great danger to their morals; they are good, want to stay good, but it seems that everything is up against them. They belong to very small bands (2 or 3 Indian families) living along the Alaska Highway, in proximity of army camps and taverns. Since there is no police around, drunks and hobos are free to go and mix with the Indians, especially women and girls. In the past few years, we had to deplore quite a few cases of illegitimate babies. And what makes the situation worse is the fact that these many girls actually can't get acquainted with Indian boys that they would contemplate to marry later on, because there are very few boys and they are all too closely related to them; there is no big Indian village in this part of the Yukon but only small bands living hundreds of miles apart and closely related to one another.\n\nAlice was 14 years old when Johnny Bill married her mother. Johnny and his wife don't get along too well and can't have children so Johnny is trying to go with Alice, who has to live in the same house since she doesn't have any other place to go. Alice doesn't want that business and so gets beaten every once in a while.\n\nAida and Dorothy are not spoiled yet but other big girls who are running wild with soldiers and hobos are trying to get them in their ways. Their parents can't control everything and feel more or less helpless; they want protection for their daughters, especially at that critical age. In my opinion, a period at the Lower Post Residential School is a \"must\" for these girls if they are to start well in life.\n\nHoping that these explanations are satisfactory, I remain\n\nYours very truly in Christ and Mary Immaculate\n\n\"Father E. Morisset. O.M.I.\"\nI am in receipt of three Applications for Admission to the Lower Post Indian Residential School, on behalf of Alice Bill, 17 (born Sept. 12 1934), 001 Snag Band; Ida Jack, 15 (born Jan. 21 1936), 005 Snag Band; and Dorothy Johnson 15, 009 Burwash Band. Owing to the ages of these girls and the fact they are not from broken homes I sought the opinion of Rev. A.H. Fleury, O.M.I., principal of the Lower Post Indian School.\n\nFr. Fleury visited this office yesterday, the attached letter from Fr. E. Morisset explains the circumstances of the application. I am not able to substantiate Fr. Morisset's statements other than two cases of illegitimacy, the mothers being members of the Burwash Band. The Army camp referred to by Fr. Morisset is an engineering unit at the Donjek River, between Burwash and Snag Bands, on the Alaska Highway.\n\nIn my opinion Ida Jack and Dorothy Johnson should be accepted but I would prefer to have your concurrence before recommending Alice Bill, due to her age. Fr. Fleury states there will be sufficient accommodation for these pupils.\n\nc.c. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n(R.J. Meek)\nSuperintendent\nIndian Agency.\nMr. R.J. Meek,\nSupt.

There are 9 half fares @ $26.45 each and 11 full fares at $52.90 each, grand total of $819.95.\n\nI checked with the Central B. C.

Father Fleury advised that he was prepared to accept her on these conditions. If in Principal Fleury's opinion she is ready for further training after June 30th next an application could be made for a tuition at that time.\n\nThe parents of this girl cannot financially afford to pay the costs for her fare from Atlin to Lower Post which approximates $75.00 by car and bus; May favourable consideration be granted this expenditure? In order to expedite this matter a telegram has been forwarded on even date for this authority to your office since we are without mail service until November 15th.\n\nSusie Jack is seventeen years old, was discharged from Lejac in June 1950 and considered well mannered and applied herself to studies and other work-states she is anxious to resume school studies.\n\n[Signature]\nP.

Coudert, O.M.I., visited this office. He advised me that he had received word that Dick Ladue, son of Jack Ladue, 026, Selkirk Band, now living at Ross River, was destitute and uncared for. The mother of Dick is presently a patient at the Charles Camsell Hospital, the father is out on his trap-line, and the boy is being maintained temporarily by his grandfather who is unable to continue this care. Dick Ladue is nearly six years old.\n\nBishop Coudert requested authorization to bring in Dick on the next available aircraft from Ross River and to have him admitted to the Lower Post Residential School. I advised His Excellency that I felt sure no difficulty would be found in admitting Dick a few months before his sixth birthday.\n\nThere is no regular fare from Ross River by aircraft; charges are usually split into different amounts between traders, missionaries, Government officials and others. I trust my actions meet with your approval.\n\n(R.J.

From October 1, 1951 this school is placed under the Per Capita Grant system and full per capita grant will be allowed from that date consequently the first per capita grant cheque will be going out to Father Fleury early next week.\n\nWith reference to the children listed on the December Quarterly Return for this school, applications for admission for the following pupils are still outstanding:\n\nLouise Louie\nMatilda Reid\nDolly Johnston\nSady Joe\nElsie Allick\nEmma Allick\nMaggie Allick  \nPaula Porter  \nNettie Porter  \nJessie Porter  \nMaggie Porter  \nJennie John  \nLouise Abou  \nMargaret Abou  \nLouis Louie  \nDempsey Allick  \nRoy Johns  \nJohn Porter  \nMurphy Porter  \nTommy John  \nPeter John\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would arrange to have these applications forwarded to this office for the necessary approval with the least possible delay.

Goudert O.M.I., Vic.Ap.of Whitehorse\nMost Reverend Bishop Jean-Louis Coudert O.M.I.\nP.O. Box 95\nWhitehorse, Yukon\n\nYour Excellency,\n\nI would like to bring to your attention the case of Clyde Blackjack, of the Carmacks Indian Band.\n\nClyde, 14 years of age, is now without a home. His father died few years ago. His mother was sent to Cassell Hospital last fall. I understand that Clyde was left in charge of his brother Roddy; but he too has spent most of his time in Whitehorse Hospital, where he still is as a patient. Consequently Clyde is left by himself, taking refuge with some of the Indians trapping up the Yukon river.\n\nThis boy has never been to school. Being an orphan, I think that he should be directed to a boarding school. I took the matter up with the Indian Agent, Mr. Meek, last fall, but the Agent insisted that we could not force Clyde to go to school if he did not want to. He tried to argue with the new Indian Act in hand that no compulsory action could be taken in such a case. Is the government spending thousands of dollars to build and upkeep schools only for children who feel that they would like to attend these schools?\n\nI do not have to go over all what the Indian Act says in regard to school, but permit me to quote No. 115: \"... every Indian child who has attained the age of seven years shall attend school.\" No. 119-b says: \"An Indian child who refuses or fails to attend school regularly shall be deemed to be a juvenile delinquent within the meaning of The Juvenile Delinquents Act.\"\n\nIf I see clear through this, it seems to me that the official government policy is that every Indian child should attend school and that proper measures should be taken when one does not abide by the Law.\n\nClyde being of school age and a catholic should normally be sent to a catholic school, in this instance to the Lower Post Catholic Indian Residential School. Here again the Indian Agent seemed to have a different opinion. He told me that if Clyde would decide to go to school, we could not \"ipso facto\" direct him to the Catholic school. Reason: his mother being away, she could not sign the required application form. Therefore any guardian, (to my knowledge no one has been officially appointed) being protestant, could sign in favor of a protestant school. This opinion seems to me to be contrary to the letter and the spirit of No. 117 of the Indian Act.\n\nI hope, Excellency, that you will give due consideration to this case since it is in the best interest of the child involved.\n\nI have the honor to be, Your Excellency,\n\nSincerely yours in Christ Jesus,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6482, file 942-10, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFebruary 7, 1952.\n\nMr. R.J.

Acting on your instructions I made enquiries as to Clyde's whereabouts and found he was out on the trap-line of his uncle. On February 18th I received the following telegram from A.R. Hayes, J.P., Carmacks:\n\nCAN YOU PLACE CLYDE BLACKJACK WITH REV LEE OR CARCROSS SCHOOL IMMEDIATELY STOP HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY GEORGE CHARLIE ALL WINTER BUT POOR FUR CATCH WITH LOW PRICES MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR GEORGE TO CONTINUE ARRANGEMENTS STOP PLEASE WIRE REPLY BY NOON TUESDAY\n\nThere was considerable correspondence concerning the sending of two Blackjack children to the Grouard Residential School some years ago instead of the Carcross Residential School where David Blackjack, (deceased) the father, wished them sent. See your file 131-1-10 (W1), August 15, 1947, and November 18, 1947, also my letter of June 28, 1948, wherein I quoted statement from him as follows:\n\n\"Mr. Ward came down river with preacher, he asked me 'Do you want to send your children to school?' I said 'Yes, Dolly and Sally to Carcross School.' I signed three papers for Mr. Ward. A week or two later Father Bob he came with papers and asked me to sign for my kids to Catholic School. My wife said she don't want to send to Catholic School, so I don't sign papers. That's all I know until I hear my kids at Grouard School.\"\n\nIn view of this I sent the following telegram to George Charlie, uncle of Clyde Blackjack:\n\nRETET CLYDE BLACKJACK HAVE LETTER FROM DEPARTMENT STATING CLYDE SHOULD BE PLACED LOWER POST CATHOLIC SCHOOL STOP AS MY RECORDS SHOW HIM ANGLICAN REQUEST FURTHER INFORMATION PREFERABLY FROM OLDER MEMBER HIS FAMILY HIS RELIGIOUS AFFILIATIONS AND IF DESIRED TO ADMIT TO LOWER POST SCHOOL\nThe following reply was received from A.R.

His oldest brother Roddy Blackjack, who has been acting as his guardian since the death of Clyde's father, is in the Whitehorse General Hospital. Yesterday I interviewed him on his wishes and he made the following statement:\n\n\"I want my brother Clyde to be near me and to go to Whitehorse or Carcross School. Before my mother left Carmacks for Charles Camsell Hospital she told me to send Clyde to Carcross School. Signed.\n\nRoddy Blackjack.\"\n\nMay I have your instructions.\n\nc.c.

Meek,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nWhitehorse, Yukon.\n\nRe: Clyde Blackjack\n\nI have your letter of the 20th ultimo with reference to the above-named boy.\n\nThe contents of your letter have been very carefully considered and it is difficult to understand why you found it necessary to communicate with so many people.\n\nAs we had previously informed you, this boy is only 14 years of age and his immediate relatives are in no position to support him. This information is borne out by the messages which you quote in your letter of February 20th. Consequently, it is in the boy's best interests to be in a residential school.\n\nOfficial letter of February 7th instructed you to place this boy in the Lower Post Residential School. It is felt that it was unnecessary for you to consult other people as these instructions were specific and should have been carried out.\n\nI will expect to hear from you in the near future, stating that this boy is in the Lower Post School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nReference your letter of 7th instant, file 942-10 (E), re Clyde Blackjack. I beg to advise that on Thursday March 13th, I proceeded by car to Carmacks to pick up Clyde Blackjack, however he was not then in the village and I decided to return later.\n\nOn March 20th Clyde was brought to Whitehorse by Fr. Turenne, he was given a medical examination, and was sent to Lower Post Residential School on March 22nd.\n\nApplication for admission form is attached hereto.

T. Jack, native of the Atlin-Teslin Band, residing at Telegraph Creek I.R. 6 for the admission of his three children Cecelia Jack, Margery Jack & Lydia Jack to the Lower Post Residential School this coming September 1952.\n\nThese children have had three, four and one years of schooling respectively to date. The home conditions with which these girls are faced daily are such to definitely warrant their admission to the Lower Post School.\n\nThe mother of these children, Rosie T. Jack is separated from her legally married husband. She has been repeatedly brought to Court for the making of intoxicants and living an immoral life. Even so, no penalty appears to correct her ways and as a result the environment with which her young daughters are being brought up in is and will be a disaster for them. This woman openly lives with another man, other than her husband, has had one illegitimate child and is now expecting another. The girls on whose behalf we are now applying for admission are definitely in need of a home away from home and proper discipline.\n\nMr. Jack is anxious that his daughters be granted the privilege of attending the Lower Post School. He is unable to meet the transportation charges by aircraft which would of necessity be borne from public funds and would amount to $60.00 per child. Father Fleury has signaled his acceptance of them on or about September 1st next, if authorized by the Department.\n\nMay favourable consideration be given in this instance. Completed application forms duly signed are attached hereto.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6482, file 942-10, part 1)\n\nEnc...\nJuly 29, 1952.\n\nMr. F.A. Clark,\nSupt.

G. Harris, P.H.N., of Miller Bay Hospital which is self explanatory.\n\nAlthough applicant is almost 18 years of age this office would recommend that every consideration be given to have her admitted to the Lower Post Indian Residential School for a least one full year term commencing September 1952. Gertie has no parents living, her relatives are most incompetent to ensure that she receives the proper rest necessary after her lengthy illness and supervise her using the necessary T.B. rehabilitation ration authorized by Dr. Galbraith, Medical Superintendent of Miller Bay Hospital. It is apparent from Nurse Harris's report that this child is not content nor will she possibly improve in her present location.\n\nThis office has contacted Father Fleury, O.M.I., Principal of the Lower Post School and he has consented to admit this girl for a period of one year.\n\nMay this office be notified by wire if transportation costs will be met from public funds for Gertie Dennis Prince Rupert to Lower Post, B.C. at an approximate cost of $95.00 since there are no relatives to financially assist.\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nC.C. Miss. G. Harris, P.H.N., Miller Bay Hospital, Prince Rupert, B.C.\nJuly 22nd 1952.\n\nMr. F.A. Clark,\nIndian Superintendent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nRe: Gertie Dennis\n\nDear Mr. Clark:\n\nThe above named girl came to Miller Bay Hospital December 28th 1946 where she remained until June 12th 1951 when she was transferred to Ceqaleetza Hospital for surgery. She has had a right upper thoracic plasty and returned to Miller Bay Hospital March 28th 1952. On June 29th 1952 she was discharged a little earlier than Dr. Galbraith wished but not against medical advice.\n\nSince discharge she has been living with Peggy Etzerza at Port Edward in very crowded housing at Port Edward. Dr. Galbraith would like to have Gertie take rest periods and go to bed early for another two year period. She should not undertake any work for some time yet. Tuberculosis ratings have been issued from the day of her discharge.\n\nBecause the present living conditions at Port Edward are most unsuitable for post hospital care of a patient Dr. Galbraith has asked me to write to you about alternative plans for Gertie. This girl who is less than eighteen years of age, has had only about two years schooling at Lejac plus some tuition whilst in hospital. Besides her tubercular handicap she is also suffering from impaired hearing. Her elder brothers and sisters at Telegraph Creek seem to have no interest in Gertie whatsoever. None of them have ever written to her nor have they ever visited her. The only person whom Gertie seems interested in are her younger brothers and sisters at Lower Pest, B.C.\n\nConsidering all the facts above, Dr. Galbraith was wondering if it would be possible for Gertie to have one more year's schooling at Lower Pest, B.C., where she would not only have the additional instruction but would have a regular routine and close supervision. If this could be arranged she probably would be well enough to work by the end of the school year June 1953.\n\nWe would very much appreciate an early reply as to what you think Gertie should do now.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSGD.\nMiss. G. Harris, P.H.N.\nOttawa, August 18, 1952.\n\nMr. L.A.

Clark,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.,\n\nWith reference to your letter of August 7th regarding the admission of Gertie Dennis to the Lower Post Indian Residential School, the Department approves her admission on the understanding that you will forward the necessary application for admission for this girl. This application is required for our files and you are urged to have this forwarded as soon as possible.\n\nIt is not common practice for the Department to approve the admission of a pupil who is eighteen years of age to a residential school, however, in view of the contents of your letter the Department approves this girl's admission on the understanding that her case will be reviewed from time to time and if the Principal is experiencing any difficulty with her he should feel free to approach the Department in this regard and the necessary action will be considered.\n\nAs advised by our telegram of even date, the Department approves her admission for one year only. At the end of 1952-53 academic year, her case will be reviewed and brought to the Department's attention for consideration as to what further action should be taken.\n\nThe Department is prepared to pay travelling costs of $90. for this girl. I am forwarding a copy of this letter to Father Fleury for his information.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nThe Superintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept.

I note that this girl is shown as pupil No. 08, Lower Post Residential School, per Form I.A. 403, Quarterly Return for period ending September 30th 1951, and very recently received at this office. On Form I.A. 411 she is shown as an admission, daughter of William Johnson of Teslin, and having formerly attended the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nElizabeth Johnston belongs to the Stikine Agency, being a member of the Atlin-Teslin Band, family No. 036. Some two months ago Fr. A. Dream of Teslin mentioned to me in casual conversation that William Johnston, father of Elizabeth had been received into the Roman Catholic church.\n\nI do not appear to have an Application for Admission form for Elizabeth Johnson, though it is possible that this has gone to Mr. F.A. Clark, Superintendent of Stikine Agency, for his signature. If the Application for Admission is in order may discharge from Carcross Residential School be obtained.\n\n(R.J.

Indian Agency,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.,\nvia Whitehorse, Y.T.,\n\nIt has been brought to our attention that Elizabeth Johnston of the Teslin Band was admitted to the Lower Post Indian Residential School although she had been in the Carcross Residential School for several years previous.\n\nWe took this matter up with Mr. Meek who states that he had not received the necessary application for this girl's admission to the Lower Post school although he was aware that she was at the school. Mr. Meek further suggested that the application might have been forwarded to your office for the necessary approval.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would secure the necessary application for this girl. However, in view of the fact that she had been at the Carcross school we are not prepared to pay a per capita grant for her at the Lower Post school, consequently her name is being deleted from the December Return until such time as her admission is approved.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs\n\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Citizenship & Immigration, OTTAWA.\n\nFurther to your letter 942-10(E6) of February 1st regarding admission forms concerning Stikine pupils of the Lower Post Residential School.\n\nThe outstanding completed applications were forwarded to you under cover of letter from this office dated December 21st last. We were without mail service to this centre for over a month during January which therefore accounts for the delay in receipt.\n\nThere still remains to be completed seven applications namely five Porter children and two of the Abou family. These are being prepared and will be forwarded as soon as signatures are obtained.\n\nWith regard to the admission of Elizabeth Johnston of the Atlin-Teslin Band. During a visit to Teslin in June the father of this girl, Chief William A. Johnston requested that she be admitted to the Lower Post Residential School. A signed affidavit to this effect was completed and attached to the application which should now be in Ottawa.\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nC.C. Supt. Meek, Whitehorse, Y.T.\nAn affidavit of parents, whose children are not yet received into the Catholic Church:\n\nI, Chief William A. Johnston, hereby certify that I am a non-Catholic and that my children... Elizabeth Johnston... have not yet been baptized in nor received into the Catholic Church. Nevertheless, wishing to avail myself of the freedom given to the Indians, according to the new Indian Act, to send their children to a school of their own choice, I do hereby certify that I wish to have the above-named children sent or transferred to the Lower Post Indian Residential School, at Lower Post B.C.\n\nSigned at...

Indian Agency,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.,\n\nWith reference to the application for admission for Elisabeth Johnston to the Lower Post Indian Residential School, attached to the application was a statement signed by the father reading in part as follows:\n\n\"I Chief William A. Johnston hereby certify that I am a non-Catholic and that my child Elisabeth Johnston have not yet been baptized in nor received into the Catholic Church\".\n\nOn the certificate of baptism it is shown that this child was baptized on the 13th day of September, 1951. These two statements are contradictory.\n\nPlease advise whether you have any information to indicate the religious denomination of the parents and under what circumstances this girl was admitted to the Carcross Indian Residential School in 1948.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Citizenship & Immigration, OTTAWA.\n\nWith reference to your letter dated March 13th 942-10(E6) concerning the admission of E. Johnston to the Lower Post Indian Residential School.\n\nAccording to our band book records this family was considered to be of the Roman Catholic faith and still so indicate. During a visit to Teslin, Y.T. in June 1951 the father of the child approached the writer concerning the admission of his daughter to the Lower Post Residential School. Since there was some doubt by church officials with their records that this child was or was not Catholic or non-Catholic a statement concerning the denomination was signed by the father who indicated that she was not Roman Catholic.\n\nAs a result, Johnston was advised that the child could not be admitted to the Lower Post Residential School unless the girl was properly received into the Roman Catholic Church and if this was his wish he should take the necessary steps. Prior to admission the child was received on the 13th day of September 1951 and both documents sent with the application to positively establish that according to the parent\n\n(a) The child had not been a member of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n(b) That the child through the baptism was now positively a member of the church and eligible for admission.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Superintendent,\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6482, file 942-10, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nApril 21, 1952.\n\nMr. R.J. Meek,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.,\n\nOur records indicate that Elizabeth Johnston was admitted to the Carcross Indian Residential School on September 15, 1948 and remained at this school until the end of June 1951.

Meek,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.,\n\nWith reference to your letter of April 28th regarding Elizabeth Johnston, it would be appreciated if you would reply to our letter of April 21 as to whether there was any particular reason for placing this girl in the Carcross school without referring the matter to this office.\n\nWe have received a copy of her application for admission to the Carcross school, however, it is noted that the Agent's signature is not indicated. Please advise if you have any information as to who signed the application for the Department as it is evident that you could not sign it as this girl is from the Teslin Band.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nMFT/HM\nMay 7, 1952.\n\nMr. F.A. Clark,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.,\n\nWith reference to your letter of April 4th regarding Elizabeth Johnston, in the second paragraph of your letter you stated as follows:\n\n\"According to our Band Book records this family was considered to be of the Roman Catholic Faith and still so indicate\".\n\nWe have received a copy of the application for admission dated August 13, 1948 for this girl to the Carcross C.E. Residential School indicating her religious denomination was \"Church of England\". This application was signed by William A. Johnston. On the strength of this application the girl was admitted to the Carcross school.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would review your records to find if you have any information regarding her admission to the Carcross school and whether there may be any correspondence to indicate that this girl was of the Church of England Faith.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nReference your letter of 7th instant, file 942-10 (E6) and Elizabeth Johnston. Due to poor transportation and communication facilities in the more remote areas of the Yukon and northern B.C. it occasionally happens that a child is placed in Residential School before the authorization for admission is received from Headquarters. In the case under review, the Application for Admission Forms were forwarded to the Indian Superintendent in charge Stikine Agency, at that time I believe it was F.A. Clark. In the summer time mail does not fly in to Telegraph Creek but has a very long roundabout route and it is probable that quite a few weeks elapsed before the Superintendent was able to forward the Application to Ottawa.\n\nOn speaking to Mr. J.F. Orman, who signed as a witness to the signature of Chief Wm. A. Johnston, he states that Johnston was anxious to have his child Elizabeth attend Carcross Residential School, and that the baptism of Elizabeth is recorded in the Anglican Register at Teslin.\n\n(V.T. Meek)\nSuperintendent\nJune 6, 1952.\n\nMr. F.A. Clark,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.,\n\nWith reference to our letter of May 7th regarding the admission of Elizabeth Johnston to the Carcross Indian Residential School in 1948, it would be appreciated if you would forward any information you have as requested in the above-mentioned letter as we are anxious to have the case settled.\n\nMr. Meek's recent letter to this office indicates that the original application for her admission was forwarded to the Indian Superintendent in charge of the Stikine Agency on August 13, 1948.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Citizenship & Immigration, OTTAWA.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter 942-10(E6) dated May 7th 1952 concerning Elizabeth Johnson member of the Atlin-Teslin Band currently attending the Lower Post Indian Residential School.\n\nA search has been made of our records at this office concerning the original admission of this girl to the Carcross Residential School during 1948 and we are unable to trace any past correspondence concerning same.\n\nThe family file indicates by way of family allowance notices that she was in attendance at this school and also in a letter from Father Dream of Teslin, Y.T. that Johnson's girl was currently at the school, in letter to this office dated December 8th 1950, stating that the father intended to remove her to the Lower Post School when opened.\n\nAs stated, our band books indicate that the girl was of the Roman Catholic faith. This could be an error. We had no positive record until the baptismal certificate was received and forwarded to Ottawa with her application to the Lower Post School.\n\nAs previously stated, the father approached the writer in June 1951 requesting that she be enrolled at Lower Post and the steps taken by this office have been outlined in letter dated April 4th 1952, to definitely establish her denomination.\n\nIf so instructed, may this matter be held in abeyance until a visit is made to Teslin in June whereupon the father can be again interviewed and the written direction of the parent obtained as applicable under section 117 of the Indian Act?\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6482, file 942-10, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDecember 17, 1952.\n\nMr. F.A.

To date we have not heard further from you.\n\nWe have been recently informed that the father William Johnson became a Roman Catholic in 1951. It would be appreciated if you would get in touch with either Mr. Johnson or the Church authorities to have this matter clarified and if certified extracts from the Church records can be obtained these should be forwarded to this office.\n\nWe are anxious to have this case settled and it would be appreciated if you would give this matter your early attention.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Lower Post Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child:\nEnglish name: Shirley John\nAge: 7 years\nName of Band: Ross River Selkirk\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid:\nFather's full name and No.: Arthur John 018\nMother's full name and No.: Ethel John 018\nParents living or dead: Living\nState of child's health: Good\nReligion: Catholic\nDoes applicant speak English?

Meek)\nSuperintendent\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nWhen visiting Teslin Band last week I was requested by Charlie Jules to have his daughter Kitty, returned to her home to assist her mother who is ill. Kitty Jule is No. 014 on the Register of the Lower Post Indian Residential School, age 13, and in Grade IV.\n\nI visited their home, the mother, Graffie, has three young children to care for, and is not well. I spoke to Fr. A. Dream, O.M.I., and we agreed that the request was reasonable. Kitty would return to school in September 1953, her older sister Effie will have then reached the age of 16 and be discharged from Lower Post School.\n\nI sent a message to Fr. A.H. Fleury, O.M.I., Principal of Lower Post Residential School asking for his recommendation. By telegram received yesterday he concurs in discharge of Kitty Jule. May authorization be received for the discharge (or leave of absence) of Kitty Jule for the remainder of the present school term.\n\n(R.J. Meek)\nSuperintendent\nTo my great surprise, I was told by Father Murray, Principal of the Lower Post Residential school, recently, that he is not receiving any grant from the Government for Elizabeth Johnston of Teslin. I am at a loss to understand the policy of the Government.\n\nEarly in the spring of 1951, Mr. William Johnston notified Indian Superintendent Mr. Pheek, contact man for the Lower Post school, that he wanted to transfer his daughter Elizabeth from Carcross to Lower Post because the whole family was following instructions in order to become Catholic.\n\nMr. Pheek told me himself, that his reply to William Johnston was: \"It is up to you.\"\n\nWhen Elizabeth came back from Carcross for the holidays of 1951, her father sent her to the Catholic mission, every day, for instruction. After two months, Elizabeth was baptized.\nand received in the Church. Then, Official application for transfer and admittance in the Lower Post Residential School was made. Baptism Certificate and written affidavit by the Parents were attached to the application.\n\nAs all this was completely in accordance with the new Indian Act, completely in accordance with Indian Superintendent Mr. Week, Contact Henry. As Elizabeth was now a Catholic child and as her Parents did not want her to lose any \"school time\", they sent her to the Lower Post Residential School when that school opened in the fall of 1951.\n\nIn the summer of 1952, after a full course of instructions, Mr. William Johnston, his wife and the rest of the family were officially received in the Church. They made their Profession of Faith and were baptized Confirmationally. Then the whole family is now Catholic - Mr. Week has been notified of this. Last summer, I sent a list of our True Catholic Indians to your Department showing William Johnston and his family as Catholics... And yet, Elizabeth is not officially admitted in the Lower Post Residential School.\n\nI am unable to understand such pressure on the part of the Government.\nWould you kindly advise me, Dear Mr. Phelan,\nwhat should be done next in order to have\nthis matter cleared out. I can send you copies\nof the profession of faith of Parents and children,\nbaptism certificates; copies of affidavits if any\nof these things can help.\n\nMr. Wreck, Indian Superintendent, has been reluctant\nto correct the errors in his census about the\nreligious denominations. Last year, Jack Smarch\nof Teslin and Watson Smarch discovered that\nthey were registered as Church of England, and so\nwas the family of Jack Smarch. They went to\nmake an official protest to Mr. Wreck who\ncorrected the error. I was present at the Protest.\nWe found out then also that \"Tom Peters\" who\nhad his son Frank and who still has his daughter\nTheresa in the school at Lower Post, was also\nregistered as Church of England. We brought to the\nattention of Mr. Wreck that \"Tom Peters\" and his\nfamily never belonged to the \"Church of England\"\nbut were always faithful Catholics. Mr. Wreck\nreplied that he was almost sure that this was\nan error but he would not correct the error until\nhe sees Tom Peters. Tom Peters and his family are\nstill registered as Church of England today in his\nbooks.\n\nHoping to have some advice from you, in the\nnear future, on the matter of Elizabeth Johnston\nand wishing you a very happy and most\nkind New Year.\n\nI am,\n\nTruly Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6482, file 942-10, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nLower Post Indian Residential School\nLower Post, B.C.\n\nJanuary 4th, 1953\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan;\n\nIn reference to the case of Jennie Dickson, pupil #065 at the Lower Post Indian School, whose removal you have requested in a recent letter, will you please consider the following facts:\n\n1. The above named child, Jennie Dickson is a Roman Catholic. Her father, John Dickson is also a Roman Catholic. Copies of affidavits certifying these facts are enclosed.\n\n2. Application for admission to the Lower Post Indian School was signed by the father, John Dickson and recommended by Mr. R.J. Meek, Indian Superintendent, in September 1952. The application was held here pending medical examination of the child. Copy has now gone forward to Ottawa.\n\nIn your letter you have stated that this girl should leave the Lower Post School, because the Department has not approved her admission. May I respectfully point out that in view of the above facts, it would appear to be in order now for the Department to approve the admission.\n\nIn discussing this case with His Excellency, Bishop J.L. Coudeurt, it would appear that, if the child Jennie Dickson were summarily dismissed from the Catholic Indian School at Lower Post, certain regretful and disturbing results would ensue; namely (a) The Indian people of the district would look upon it as a penalty imposed on the parent for becoming a Catholic, since he now would be unable to find schooling for his child, although the Indian Act guarantees such schooling. (b) A very weighty obstacle would be placed before the future activities of the missionaries in the Ross River district, since the people would consider that even if they freely wished to become Catholics, they would have great difficulties in sending their children to a Catholic school.\nI have mentioned the results of my discussion with Bishop Coudert in order that the Department may have full knowledge of the import of this case.\n\nAs Principal, I have submitted above (paragraphs 1 and 2) the facts which led me to accept the child Jennie Dickson, into the Lower Post Indian School. I see no reason why approval of admission should be withheld. The circumstances of this case are similar to the admissions of other children in the school; namely: the child is a Catholic Indian; the father is a Catholic and wishes the child in the Catholic school.\n\nIn view of the above, I trust that you will please review this case and advise me of the results. I will be glad to forward any additional information that you may require.\n\nVery sincerely,\n\nA.H. Fleury, O.M.I. Principal\nVICARIATE APOSTOLIC OF WHITEHORSE\n\n1.- I, John Dickson, do certify that after having attended Roman Catholic Church services for two years, and been duly instructed, I was received and baptized in the same Church by Reverend Father P.

Indian Residential School. Although her admission to this school was not approved she remained there until June, 1951.\n\nOn checking the December 1951 Quarterly Return for the Lower Post Indian Residential School, this girl's name was noted on it. As her admission to the Lower Post R.C. School had not been approved and as she previously attended the Carcross C.E. School, Superintendent Meek under whose jurisdiction the Lower Post School is, was written. He was instructed to advise Father A.H. Fleury, O.M.I., Principal of the Lower Post School that no grant would be allowed for this pupil until her admission to the Lower Post School was approved. Superintendent Meek was requested to obtain full particulars on this girl's admission to the Lower Post School after attending the Carcross School from 1948 to 1951.\n\nOn January 10, 1952, Superintendent Meek replied:\n\n\"Elizabeth Johnston belongs to the Stikine Agency, being a member of the Atlin-Teslin Band, family #036. Some two months ago, Father A. Dream of Teslin mentioned to me in casual conversation that William Johnston, father of Elizabeth had been received into the Roman Catholic Church\".\nAs Mr. Meek's letter indicated that the girl is a member of a Band in the Stikine Agency, Superintendent Clark was written and in a letter dated February 15th he stated:\n\n\"With regard to the admission of Elizabeth Johnston of the Atlin-Teslin Band, during a visit to Teslin in June the father of this girl, Chief William A. Johnston requested that she be admitted to the Lower Post Residential School.

Father M. Bobillier, on the same day as Stanley (March 10, 1944).\n\nc.- Five other children of the same family, viz. Roddy, Kitty, Sally, Dolly and Clyde, were received in the Church on the same day as their parents and their brother Stanley.\n\n2.- Following their reception into the Church, and after the required applications had been properly approved by the local Agent, two of the children of School Age were sent to the Catholic Indian Boarding School of Grouard, Alberta, viz. Sally and Dolly, around 1946.\n\n3.- Their brother Clyde has been for the past two years at the Indian Catholic Boarding School of Lower Post, B.C.\n\n4.- Both parents are now dead.\n\n5.- Stanley has spent the past two or three years as a patient in Charles Camsell Hospital, and was duly registered there, as well as his sisters Sally and Dolly, and his mother Bessie (who died there last fall) as a Catholic patient.\n\n6.- Upon Stanley's discharge from the Hospital, and notwithstanding our protests, Stanley has been placed by Indian Agent Meek in the Baptist Indian School of Whitehorse, after obtaining from Stanley's brother (Roddy, also a Catholic) a signature to that effect.\nCertificate of Baptism\n\nPARISH OF St. Jude's Catholic Mission\nMISSION OF Carmacks, Y.T.\n\nTHIS IS TO CERTIFY\n\nThat Kitty Blackjack\nChild of David Blackjack\nand Bessie Billy\nwho was born on the 4th day of May 1932\nwas \u2020 BAPTIZED \u2020\non the 10th day of March 1944\n\nAccording to the Rite of the Roman Catholic Church\nby the Rev.

Meek,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.,\n\nWith reference to your letter of July 17th regarding the placing of Stanley Blackjack in the Whitehorse School, we are anxious to know the reason for your placing this boy in the Whitehorse School without first having the necessary authority to do so.\n\nIf you will refer to our letter of February 7th you will note that the Department instructed you to place Clyde Blackjack, who we are informed is a brother of Stanley Blackjack in the Lower Post Indian Residential School as our information at that time indicated that the parents were dead and that the parents were of the Roman Catholic faith. In view of this information it is felt that Stanley Blackjack should also be placed in the Lower Post Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted from your telegram that you have an application for admission for this boy. It would be appreciated if you would forward it to this office and make immediate arrangements to have Stanley Blackjack removed from the Whitehorse School and placed in the Lower Post Residential School.\n\nPlease advise this office by telegram when this has been done.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMr. Phil Phelan, Superintendent of Education  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Immigr. and Citizenship  \nCopeland Bldg. - Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Stanley Blackjack's admission to Lower Post Indian Res. School.-(Whitehorse Agency)\n\nDear Mr. Phelan;\n\nI deeply regretted on my way through Ottawa on July 13 last, to have been unable to see you and discuss thoroughly with you the Stanley Blackjack's case.\n\nAt the occasion of a visit I paid to the Acting Director of the Branch, Mr. Jones, I entrusted to his care all the documents concerning the matter to be communicated to you.\n\nI feel that the settlement of this case is very urgent and should be dealt with immediately, for the following reasons:\n\nAfter a long stay in Camsell Hospital, Stanley Blackjack was sent last Spring to the Whitehorse Baptist School, on the sole authority of Agent Meek, though the boy was a Catholic and had never had any connection with the Baptists; in fact, the whole family had been received by one of our missionaries into the Catholic Church, at their own spontaneous request, some 9 years ago, following which two of his sisters and one of his brothers, being of school age, were sent to our Catholic Boarding Schools of Grouard and Lower Post, with forms of admission duly signed by Agent Meek. After a stay of one month at the Baptist School of Whitehorse last Spring, the boy was allowed to go to Carmacks and spend the summer with his relatives.\n\nThe father and mother being now dead, Stanley is an orphan, and in my estimation should not have been allowed to return to Carmacks, where he is running a great risk of being neglected and of relapsing to an active tuberculosis condition.\n\nWe all feel very upset about the handling of this case and the prejudice shown against us, since we have not even been consulted by your Agent concerning the disposal of the child, upon his being discharged from the Camsell Hospital.\n\nI am prepared to go to the utmost to have this situation straightened up, and have the boy protected physically, morally and religiously, as he is fully entitled to according to the Indian Act, in his capacity as a Catholic orphan boy deprived of both parents; all the lawyers I talked to concerning this matter, were indignant over the arbitrary way the case has been handled by your Agent.\n\nOur principal, Father Fleury, is willing to accept the boy immediately and I respectfully beg you to take the proper step to have him sent without any further delay to the Lower Post Residential School.\n\nYours sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6482, file 942-10, part 1)\nAugust 19, 1953.\n\nMost Rev.

On April 20th 1953 Dr. Falconer, Charles Camsell Indian Hospital, advised me that Stanley Blackjack was ready for discharge. Hospital Discharge form dated April 29th recommended that Stanley attend a Residential School.\n\nI wrote to Stanley's oldest brother, Roddy, who is the head of the family, asking him where he wished Stanley to be sent. Roddy replied on May 13th that he wanted Stanley to attend Whitehorse Indian Day School. Application for Admission dated May 6 1953 was not completed by the examining doctor until later. It is undated and I am unable to ascertain when it arrived at this office. I attach original Application for Admission.\n\nI also attach copies of several letters received at this office during August, also copies of my correspondence with Roddy Blackjack before placing Stanley in the Whitehorse Indian Day School.\n\nAgency records state Stanley is a member of the Church of England.

Citizenship & Immigration, OTTAWA.\n\nA request has been received from Mr. J. Rob, 05-001, of Tahltan Band concerning the admission of his five children of school age to the Lower Post Residential School on or about August 1952.\n\nApplication forms duly completed are forwarded herewith for the following children:\nLinda Julia 6, Tony 5, William 12, Lovata 9, Merle 7.\n\nThis application is favourably endorsed by this office. There are seven children in this family and the five above listed will be of school age this coming August. The family head is an industrious sort who finds it impossible to support this large family and is forced to constantly apply for relief assistance to this office. Bob as stated is industrious and a progressive type who is most anxious that his children be well treated and given an opportunity to receive proper guidance and education. The children, although in satisfactory health for admission purposes, are in need of a more balanced and satisfactory diet.\n\nAs mentioned this head is totally destitute. If approved it would be necessary to pay, from public funds, air transportation costs from Telegraph Creek to Lower Post, B.C. This would amount to $180.00 or $36.00 per child.\n\nMay the enclosed applications be given your favourable consideration and this office further advised?\n\nEnc....\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6482, file 942-10, part 1)\nMay 28, 1952.\n\nMr. F.A. Clark,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.,\n\nWith reference to your letter of May 8th regarding the admission of the five Bob children to the Lower Post Indian Residential School, the Department approves their admission.\n\nIt is noted that the Department will be obliged to bear pay transportation charges of $18c. for these children from Telegraph Creek to the Lower Post School.\n\nThe Department is prepared to bear this expenditure and it is felt that the children should not be placed in the Lower Post school until September 1st. In that way, it would not be necessary to bring them home for summer vacation.\n\nIt is noted from your correspondence that the father of these children is working when work is available and it would be appreciated if you would advise him that the Department will not be able to pay transportation charges for these children when returning home for holidays in future years; consequently he should be advised to keep in mind this fact and save sufficient money to bring the children home for vacations in future.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nJuly 21st 1952\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Lower Post Indian Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child:\nEnglish name: Richard Garlick\nBorn: 29-9-40\nAge: N/A\nName of Band: Tahltan\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid: N/A\nFather's full name and No.: Harry Garlick 05-010 (Deceased)\nMother's full name and No.: Helen Garlick 05-010\nParents living or dead: Mother living Father dead\nState of child's health: Apparently satisfactory\nReligion: Roman Catholic\nDoes applicant speak English?
