Mr. Macdonald.\n\nFRIDAY, AUG. 14, 1885.\n\nREFERENCE.\n\nPresent indications point to a rather lively competition for the forthcoming election for the North West Council, and we must confess to a feeling of surprise that this should be the case. We believe, in our opinion there can be found more to object to than to count in the position. In the first place while the work which has to be done by the Council is of the most necessary in itself just alike as well be undertaken without the presence of the electoral element at all, nor is any sane man deceived into the opinion that in going to the Council they are not sent a member that is in any way enjoying representative government. While the whole body of the Council has no power to initiate anything of considerable benefit to the people it is no less necessary to make sure that the bulk of the constituency recognize this fact, and it is very questionable as to whether any man having political aspirations will not seriously damage his eventual prospects by occupying a seat at the Council board-to-day. Any good that a member is likely to do his district under present circumstances is apt to be far proportional to the amount of influence he may be able to bring to bear personally upon the Government, and as that sort of influence entails frequent visits to Ottawa, it may be furthermore laid down that the amount of benefit he can hope to confer upon his constituents will bear a distinct relation to the length of his purse. It seems, however, that the experience of those gentlemen who have been members and have been out of pocket by the occupation of this position is not such as to prompt them to desire to resume it, nor can it be denied that it has a very strong tendency to be a very thankless task. Nevertheless, so far as what has been done for the district by the retiring members is such as to prevent its being generally recognized, and it is a poor lookout for the next candidate to find Mr. Macdonald granting his objections to assuming such a task a commonplace thing, and the fact of finding the utmost unwillingness in him to greater expense than he feels justified in incurring. Under these circumstances it becomes a matter of vital necessity that the councils of the district be consulted with all possible dispatch, and then there really is no just reason why any expense should be incurred. What we wish to draw the attention of the people to is the fact that if they vote to put a good man to represent them and aid us as possible to advocate their interests, it is their business to put him there; for a candidate must feel that he is open to the suspicion that he is interested in the interest involved if he can be expected to spend time and money and beg votes as a favor in order to secure the position. Of the number of names mentioned in connection with the various seats there are several men quite equal to undertaking all the legitimate duties attaching to the position, but it is high time that steps were taken to reduce that number to such a point that every probability that unless there is every possibility to concentrate their energies, the upshot of the business will be that some one of those in every way the least desirable may find himself elected. We protest that no one of the gentlemen who are likely to do us credit will accept a nomination without knowing pretty exactly the amount of support he can depend upon, nor is there any reason why such information should not be forthcoming with tolerable accuracy when required.\n\nThe recently appointed Governor of the Hudson Bay Company, who has been making a tour of inspection through the Territory, gave a banquet on Saturday night to an assemblage of about forty-five, composed of members of the district and a number of others who happen to be here on Government business of various sorts. This entertainment turned out a complete success, and Mr. H. B. Co. Wingfield made a most happy impression upon those who had the honor of making his acquaintance for the first time. An interesting feature of the occasion was the appearance of Messrs. Munro and Quinn, the Government Commissioners who have come to inquire into the claims of those who have suffered loss in consequence of the late rebellion. We regretted not having known of this before making some remarks which appear in our last issue. However, we have much pleasure in using our opportunity to express the hope of Commissioners made by the Government is certain to insure a completely satisfactory settlement of the claims in question. Mr. Munro has been a lawyer by trade, and the sending of a man of that stamp is evidence of the desire of the Government to do what is fair in the matter. Mr. Munro has had a great deal of experience of this sort of work, and assures us that he will approach the matter in a liberal spirit, and that the Government wishes to settle up the losses of the people at once, intending to let the H. B. Co. and others who can better afford to do so wait until such people have been paid. Mr. Quinn represents Lower Canada upon this Commission, and a very few words with him impresses one with the idea that his ability for the work is such that in which he is engaged alone it has never been desired. We were delighted with the way in which he explained the public sentiment of Quebec with regard to the unfortunate rebellion.\n\nWe learn from reliable sources that the distress at Dartmouth has been considerably exaggerated when reported, and that all cases of real necessity have been attended to by direction of the Government. If we have not been giving the Government credit for such discretion as it has already been making it is only because we have been kept in the dark with regard to their proceedings.\n\nCOMMUNICATIONS.\n\nWHAT WAS IT?\n\nTo the Editor of The Times,\n\nSir,\u2014Last Friday night about eleven o'clock there was seen a bright light rising up from the summit of the hill. You will remember there was a very bright moon\u2014but from the flight of the lamp on its arriving we judge it was hill, could be seen to be traversing the summit of the hill, which step was broken at intervals by a sudden halt. Some hours after this, the light was seen again, and was once again visible on the top of the hill. Now what could this mean? Was there anyone there that night, and if so, were his friends still residing along in search of him? Or, were these two, who visited the scene of the photograph taken lately, and on seeing the \"just like life,\" were so pleased, that the town became too small to hold them?

D. MAVETY, PUBLISHER AND PROPRIETOR\n\n3RD ST., PRINCE ALBERT, SASK\nTHE REBELLION.\n\nContrary to expectations (see last No.), by the end of March there were very few of the loyalist settlers who had not found their way into the town; although some of the people of St. Catharines and the Portage district had been able to find shelter in the woods or in the river for some time longer. On the two last days of March and the early days of April there was no doubt but that the call of the rifle companies was answered in and formed into separate companies, the intention being to supply the place of the regulars, who had deserted. In order to do this the members of these companies were stationed not at angles armed with all the arms that could be spared, but to be ready to defend the town from the expected attack. The number of companies congregated in and about the town for protection became so large that the police and the citizens became convinced of the intention of the enemy to make an attempt to enter the town. It would have been easy to maintain the strength of the garrison at night, but the enemy had greatly increased the strength of the force which was to be used against them.\n\nIn order to do this the members of the companies were stationed at all angles armed with all the arms that could be spared, but to be ready to defend the town from the expected attack.
