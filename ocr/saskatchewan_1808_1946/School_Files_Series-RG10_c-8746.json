Her salary will be at the same rate namely $125.00 a teaching month.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nCOPY\n\nTHE UNITED CHURCH OF CANADA.\nBritish Columbia Conference.\n\nRev. W.P. Bunt, B.A., B.D.\nSupt. of Home Missions\n807 Dominion Bank Bldg., 207 West Hastings St.\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay; Re Indian Day Schools\n\nRe Port Simpson: Following our conversation by telephone I beg to advise that Miss A. H. Currie, presently teaching the senior room in the above school has asked for transfer to another school at the end of the present term. The Agent, Mr. Anfield, has written urging that she be given another school. There is therefore no doubt that her formal resignation will be forthcoming, if it is not already in the Agent's hands. I have therefore written to Dr. Dorey, asking him to nominate, for the vacancy created by Miss Currie's resignation, Mrs. Ethel G. Castleman, who, for the past year has been teaching at Aiyansh. In view of her recent appointment, you will have all particulars regarding her qualifications.\n\nI have wired Miss Currie, offering to nominate her for the senior room at Kispiox, and have asked her to wire her acceptance. On receipt of same I shall forward it to our Toronto office and at the same time inform you of what has been done.\n\nRe Cape Mudge: Miss Jean Hill, presently teaching at Koksilah, is, as you know, ready to return to the Cape Mudge School, and I wish to advise you that her transfer will meet with the approval of the United Church of Canada. I have advised Dr. Dorey accordingly, but in this case, understand that any further action, making the transfer effective, will be taken by you and the Agents concerned.\n\nRe Koksilah: In view of the pending vacancy at Koksilah, I have asked Dr. Dorey to place before your Department the name of Mrs. D.J. Miller, 727 W. 17th Ave., Vancouver, with a view to her being appointed as from January 1st, 1947. As she is a former teacher in the Koksilah School, you will be in possession of all particulars which you require. I understand that she gave good satisfaction when she was the teacher of this school.\n\nTrusting that these nominations and transfers may have your approval.\n\nW.P. Bunt.\nMrs. Castleman will likely fit in well at Port Simpson School and it is recommended that she be allowed salary at the rate of $118.00 a teaching month as quarters are provided.\n\nMiss Hill applied for a transfer to the Cape Mudge School on the condition that her salary would not be less than she is receiving at the present time, but as furnished quarters and fuel are provided it is felt that her salary should not exceed $118.00 a teaching month. Miss Hill is a well qualified teacher and has given good service. Her salary should be reviewed by Mr. Davey with a view to an increase.\n\nMrs. Miller who rendered good service during her employment as teacher at Koksilah should be allowed the same salary as Miss Hill is now receiving at that school.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n/mh\nenc.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter dated December 11th from Reverend W. P. Bunt in connection with certain changes affecting the Port Simpson, Kispiox, Cape Mudge and Koksilah Indian Day Schools. Briefly, the proposal is:\n\n(1) Port Simpson\u2014Miss A. M. Currie, senior room teacher to be transferred to Kispiox and assume the duties there as teacher of the senior room, effective January 1st. Mrs. Ethel Castleman who has been teaching at Aiyansh but is unable to return there due to lack of medical services at that point to replace Miss Currie at Port Simpson, as soon as it is possible for her to do so.\n\n(2) Cape Mudge\u2014Miss Jean Hill, teacher at Koksilah to be transferred to Cape Mudge and assume her duties there effective January 1st.\n\n(3) Koksilah\u2014Mrs. D.J. Miller who formerly taught at this school to replace Miss Jean Hill. Mrs. Miller's duties to commence January 1st, 1947.\n\nAlthough I am not entirely satisfied that Miss Currie is a suitable person for the Kispiox Indian Day School in view of past difficulties in her relationship with other teachers, her transfer is recommended for the balance of the academic year pending an inspection of her work by the School Inspector. She will likely be able to obtain accommodation in the Mission House, for which the Department provides fuel and consequently I would recommend that she be paid at the rate of $125.00 a teaching month.\nJanuary 13th, 1947.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nSkeena River Agency Quarterly Report\nending December 31st, 1946.\n\nEducation:\n\nAt Aiyansh Day School, Mrs. Castleman, senior teacher, left on account of ill health and later took an appointment at Port Simpson Day School where she would be nearer medical advice. Miss Currie, for the past five years senior teacher at Port Simpson, transferred to Kispiox Day School, Babine Agency.\n\nF.

In addition there are vacancies at the Hartley Bay (1) and Port Simpson (2) schools under United Church auspices. Port Essington is also vacant, but negotiations are proceeding with a view to having these pupils attend the white school on a contract basis.

The discrepancy would appear to be in the salary of Mrs. Kinch, second teacher at the school, who assumed her duties the same date but apparently was paid salary for the full month. I may say we have nothing on file to indicate that either Miss Bray or Mrs. Kinch would be paid salary in excess of the amount that they would earn during the period in which they taught.

M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nPort Simpson Indian Day School\n\nIn Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's report for the month of October upon his visit to the above Indian Day School, he makes the following comments:\n\n\"The teachers are having janitor troubles, the man presently engaged having quit. It is considered that the sum of $12.00 paid per month is quite insufficient for a school of this size, involving the care of a furnace, cleaning of two rooms and extensive halls as well as the emptying of toilet pails. The Council was instructed to see that a proper janitor was appointed at once. The toilets were emptied and the teachers instructed to lock them until a proper janitor was obtained. It is recommended that at least $25.00 a month will have to be paid to get a suitable worker for the janitory of this school. By comparison, it should be said that the janitor of the adjacent white school is paid $15.00 a month. It is a small one room school with only nine pupils. The question of opening a third room at this school must be faced immediately. The senior room is overcrowded and the Principal instructed to move half of Grade III group to the junior room as a temporary measure. If all the junior grade children enrolled were present a third teacher will be needed at once. This room would be set up in the Annex, which was carefully painted and set up this summer. Only blackboards and cupboards, plus teacher's desk will be needed as additional equipment.\"\nWe are prepared to consider the payment of the janitor on the basis of $12.00 per classroom for a two-room school at Port Simpson. It is felt that you will wish to make a specific recommendation concerning Mr. Anfield's proposal regarding the third classroom.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nNov. 21, 1947.\n\nF. E. Anfield, Esq., Indian Agent, Prince Rupert, B.C.\n\nRe: Port Simpson Day School\n\nWith reference to your letter of November 7th, file 2-11-4, regarding the proposed purchase of an oil heater for the above mentioned school, the Department in a recent communication has intimated that the funds available in the Education Vote are almost exhausted and only the most urgent expenditures can be approved. Apart from this, however, I am not convinced that the Department should supply an oil heater for this school.\n\nIt is my understanding that the classroom and teacherage are heated from a central furnace in which case it would appear that some adjustment to the heating system should ensure reasonable heat to the teacherage during periods when the classroom is closed without excessive fuel consumption.\n\nI note your statement that neither teacher is willing nor capable of handling the furnace themselves but would point out that although the Department provides fuel and accommodation for the teachers they are not responsible for maintaining heat in the teacherage and if the teachers are unable to look after the furnace themselves over weekend periods they should employ someone to do so at their own expense.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nNovember 18, 1947.\n\nF. E. Anfield, Esq., Indian Agent, Prince Rupert, B.C.\n\nYour report for the month of October, 1947, for the Port Simpson Indian Day School has been drawn to the attention of Inspector Davey, who has made the following observations:\n\n1. The report shows that the number who should be attending is 53, 34 shown in the senior room and 19 in the junior room. This number does not warrant the employment of a third teacher. In the Provincial schools, the enrolment must exceed 70 before an additional teacher will be appointed. However, for a village the size of Port Simpson, it would appear that the number of 53 who should attend is an error.\n\n2. The report indicates almost twice as many pupils in the senior room as in the junior, and it is probable that there should be some redistribution of the Grades in order to equalize the teaching load.\n\nThe Inspector has further suggested that you be asked to confirm the number of pupils who should actually be attending the Day School. He states that it will be difficult to secure the services of an additional teacher at this time but anticipates there will be no difficulty during the summer in securing a teacher for next year.\n\nIt is noted you recommend that the sum of $25.00 per month be provided for janitor services, and it is assumed that this will be the subject of separate correspondence.\n\nD.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nRFD/AC\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa\n\nRe: Port Simpson Indian Day School\n\nI wish to refer to Mr. Neary's letter of December 2nd (file 168-2-1 WT) wherein he quotes from \"Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's report for the month of October covering his visit to the Port Simpson Indian Day School.\n\nA copy of the report referred to was received at this office and I wrote to the Agent on November 18th, a copy of my letter being attached for your information.

Dr Sutherland writes under date of the 21st instant asking that provision may be made in the Supplementary estimates for money to put up a new day school building at Port Simpson to cost from $1000 to $1200.\n\nHe states that he is informed that owing to a new survey of the village, the present school building is found to be in the middle of the street and will have to be moved, which Mr Osterhout thinks could not be done with safety, at least without going to very great expense.\n\nThe Department contributed $500 towards the cost of the present building in 1882 and I think before moving it or putting up another one, Mr Vowell should be asked to report in regard to this matter, which could be allowed to stand until next year's estimates as there need not be any great hurry for opening up the street. The survey was made about three years ago but the field notes are not on file in the office and the plan does not show where the school building stands.\n\nThe census gives the population of Port Simpson as 680, which would give about 150 children of\nof school age and the attendance at this school been over 100 for some quarters.\n\nIf it is found necessary to rebuild, it would require quite a large school to accommodate all these children.\n\nFive hundred and sixty of the inhabitants of Port Simpson are given as Methodists, and as I said on my memorandum on file 77,025, that denomination is conducting three schools there, two boarding and one day, and I have no doubt but that the boarders attend the day school, to which all the children might go, boarding school provision being necessary only for orphans and children of that class. The Port Simpson Indians are well to do and should be able to provide for the maintenance of their own families.\n\nMartin Brown\nOTTAWA, 12th March, 1900\n\nSir,\n\nAn application has been received from Rev. DF Sutherland, General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society for a grant to erect a new day school building at Fort Simpson. He states that he is informed by the Rev. Mr Osterhout that according to the new survey of the village, the present building is in the middle of the street and will have to be removed, and that this could not be done with safety without going to very great expense.\n\nThe Department would like you to report fully on this application stating whether it is absolutely necessary that the present building should be removed at present, and if so, whether it would stand moving and what it would cost to put it up on another site.\n\nIf you consider that a new building is required please state approximately what it would cost to provide a building sufficiently large to accommodate all the Indian children of school age in the village.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.W.

Field\nInd Agent\nMetlakatla B.C.\nApril 18th 1900\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 4406 dated 22nd March 1900 respecting an application made to the Indian Department by the Rev. Dr. Sutherland for a grant to erect a new school house for the Indians of Fort Simpson, I have the honour to report that the present school building is old and that the foundation timbers are not firm enough to admit of moving it to another site. The building stands on a town lot not outside of the ground allotted to the Methodist Mission Society by the Indian Council for Church and School purposes. The said town lot has been given to an Indian for his inheritance upon which he intends to build himself a dwelling house. The new site for the school house is about eighty feet distant and twelve feet higher in altitude than the present site. The building as it stands might last for a year or two more.\n\nThe building must be removed from the Indians' town lot for long in any case so as not to retard the completion of the arrangement of streets and buildings according to the new survey.\n\nAbout one third of the material required for a new school house can be obtained.\nobtained from the old building and\nthe cost of new material and labour\nwill approximate $100.\n\nThe present building is in two sections\nand therefore much of the timbers in\nit will be too short for the new building\nwhich should be built by 25 feet inside\nmeasurement. Such a building\ncan be arranged to seat 120 pupils\nthe highest number likely to attend the\nnew school at Port Simpson.\n\nI enclose herein an estimate\nof the cost of renewing the school\nbuilding made to myself which\nI think is very nearly correct.\n\nAt the present time it can hardly\nbe expected that the Indians should\ndo the work of rebuilding their school\nhouse themselves at their own expense\nbecause of the great amount of\nlabour required in remodeling\ntheir town and making new streets\nwhich work they are pushing to their\nutmost back.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. W. Cowell\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs\nVictoria\n\nS. Edd\nInd Agent\nN.W. Coast Agency\nSir,\n\nIn a letter recently received from the Rev S.S. Osterhout, of Port Simpson, B.C., he informs me that owing to a new survey of the village (or part of it) ordered by the Indian Agent, the public school building will be left standing in the middle of a new street. This would indicate, of course, the necessity of moving the school building to a new site. But Mr Osterhout is of opinion that the condition of the building is such that it cannot be safely moved, at least without great expense, and suggests whether it would not be better and cheaper in the end to erect a new building. As present building has been standing for a long time it is probable that Mr Osterhout is in the right. In view of the number of children of school age at Port Simpson it is probable that a fairly good building, large enough for the purpose, would cost from $1000 to $1200. It is evident that something must be done forthwith, and I earnestly hope that the Superintendent General will take the matter into favorable consideration, and make provision in the present year's supplementary estimates for such amount as may be necessary to meet the needs in the case.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nA. Sutherland\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Honorable the Super't General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nBritish Columbia,\n\nIndian Superintendent's Office,\n\nVictoria, April 1900\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th ultimo, No. 119542, in reference to an application received from the Rev. Dr. Butterland, General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society, for a grant to erect a new day school at Port Simpson.\n\nThe Missionaries have now the honour to forward herewith for the Department information duplicate of a report on the subject sent from Mr. Agent Todd, and would recommend that his suggestions, being under the circumstances, fair and reasonable, be carried out.\n\nIn Mr. Todd's report will be found an approximate estimate of cost of building.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe Secretary:\n\nIn further reference to the application made by Rev. Dr Sutherland in February last for provision to be made in the Supplementary Estimates for the erection of a new day school building at Fort Simpson I beg to say that Mr Supt. Vowell who was written to for a report in this matter has replied under date of the 30th ultimo recommending that the suggestions of Mr Agent Todd for the erection of a new school house be carried out.\n\nMr Agent Todd's report is placed herewith and in it he states that it will be necessary to have a new building within a very short time, as the site where the old building stands is required for other purposes, and as the old building will not stand removal it will have to be taken down and a new one put up, but that a considerable portion of the material in the old building can be used in the new one, thus reducing the cost of material and labor to about $3000, which sum he considers would be sufficient, and he furnishes an estimate in support of his figures. Mr Todd states in his report that the present building might last a year or two more, but that it must ere long be removed so as not to retard the completion of the arrangements of the streets according to the new survey.\nOf the Department decides to contribute towards the erection of the new building, I think it would be time enough to give a grant next year when funds could be provided in the main estimates and Dr Sutherland and Mr Vowell might be so advised.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhereas the building now occupied by the Port Simpson Indian Day School is no longer fit for use, being greatly out of repair, the roof leaking badly, the front approach gone, the front porch sunken on its foundations, the foundation of the main building rotting owing to the bad location of the building, the floors worn out, and the place being totally without out-houses of any description;\n\nAnd whereas, owing to the condition of the building, as also to the undesirableness of its present location, the ground being very wet and boggy, making it unwholesome for the children as well as ruinous to the building, we deem it unwise to expend the considerable sum now required for repairs on the old building; and in this we think that you, sir, having inspected the place, will agree with us;\n\nAnd whereas the attendance at the school is large, there now being nearly eighty pupils enrolled on the register, which attendance is sometimes increased to about a hundred by the pupils of a neighboring institution, and two teachers are usually employed in the building;\n\nAnd whereas the present building was erected without any aid from the Indian Department;\n\nAnd whereas such a building as is specified in the accompanying plan and estimates is the cheapest kind of building which will adequately meet the requirements of the place, viz., a main building twenty four by forty feet ground measurements, with fourteen foot posts, fronted by a porch ten feet square, and having at the rear a wing twenty by thirty two feet, opening into the main building by sliding doors, the building to be covered with rustic nailed on ship-lap, and ceiled inside with four inch v siding, and at the rear of the wing a fuel shed ten by sixteen feet, and two water closets eight feet square, separated by a tight board fence eight feet high and thirty feet long;\n\nAnd whereas the Mission will undertake the erection of the new building without further cost to the Department, provided the Department cause to be placed on the ground the required material;\n\nAnd whereas the Georgetown Saw Mill Company of Port Simpson has peculiar facilities in the shape of saw-mill, steamboat, etc., for undertaking the contract to supply the material to better advantage than anyone else we know of;\n\nAnd whereas the said Company submit herewith tender to place on the ground the required material detailed in the accompanying specifications for the sum of thirteen hundred and ten dollars;\n\nWe therefore humbly request that the Indian Department make grant of that amount for such purpose.\n\nAnd ever we will pray.\n\nYour humble petitioner,\n\nB.

O'Donnell and Principal Edwards accompanied me to this school, and the remarks contained in the petition pertaining to the condition of the old building are correct in every particular, and a new building is absolutely necessary.\n\nI have carefully gone over the specifications submitted to Rev.

Vowell encloses an application from Rev. P.C. Froemen, Supt. of Methodist Missions at Fort Simpson, asking for a grant of $1309.92 for the purchase of material to erect a new Indian day school building at that place. Mr. Agent Morrow of Metlakatla recommends this application in view of the large number of children in attendance and the dilapidated condition of the present building.\n\nThis application is a renewal of one made four years ago for the same purpose which reached the Department through the General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society. As Mr. Sifton was then absent the matter was laid over.\n\nThe Indians resident in Fort Simpson by the last census number 718, all of whom are Methodists and the school population is given as 127. The enrollment last year was 79. At the time the first application was made the present building was said to be in bad condition and its situation interfered with the proper laying out of the main street. Four years ago the Church would have been satisfied with $1000.00 but the larger amount now asked for is probably due to the increase in the cost of material.\n\nIn addition to the day school the Methodists carry on two boarding schools in the village, one for\nboys and one for girls, which receive a grant for 10 and 20 pupils respectively at $60.00 each.\n\nIt would appear that a new day school building is required and it is a question to what extent the Department is willing to contribute. The sketch prepared by the missionary provides for two class-rooms with seating accommodation for 80 pupils. Outbuildings are also included.\n\nI have turned out my previous memoranda on this subject.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

General,\n\nI have carefully gone over plans and bill of quantities for the proposed school at Fort Simpson, and find that materials proposed to be used are sufficient and of the right dimensions, with a few exceptions.\n\nI would recommend that 2\" x 8\" be used for ceiling joists, as 2\" x 6\", 30' long are not strong enough, and there is no way of bracing to support the same, without using more timber, than in thus increasing the size of joists; also that 2 X 6 rafter and ceiling joists be used for porch instead of 2 X 4\", as specified. The change suggested would require 428 feet, at 2 cents per foot\u2014$8.56\n\nThere has been no provision made for window glass, thirty-six windows, with four lights of 15\" x 36\" would cost glazed, probably, $64. It will be necessary to add these amounts to the bill of quantities, making the amount $1,850.75, instead of $1,778.19.\n\nThere are no specifications supplied, and the plan is a very crude one. It would be necessary to have plans and specifications furnished for filing with the Department, and will also require additional supervision to ensure proper construction, when plans and specifications are so limited as those now submitted.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I was very happy and lived just two doors away from the school.\n\nWhen Miss Perry and I were home for Xmas, the minister's wife died and I was informed that I was to board at the same place as Miss Perry, as it was the only available place.\n\nBefore long both Miss Perry and I became displeased with our accommodation, as we were not pleased with our food, etc., and considered the price too high. We asked for a reduction in price but were refused, so decided to find a new place.\n\nNone of the \"white\" families could take us so we had to make plans accordingly. Miss Perry now \"boards\" with another teacher, quite near the school, while I board with a quarter-breed family, who live off the reserve, about a mile from the school. We are both very pleased with...\nour present living conditions.\n\nHowever, in the coming years, I suggest that it would be better if a suitable boarding house or teachers' quarters could be provided. For them the teachers could be together and would not be constantly on the move.\n\nHoping that this suggestion will bear a little consideration,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6408, file 837-5, part 2)\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to Letter No. 168-25 of the 15th instant, I beg to state that there is no accommodation for new teachers at the Crosby Girls' Home.\n\nFor myself, I do not mind whether a teacherage is built or not, as I shall not return next year, due to ill health.\n\nHowever, for the sake of Miss Terry and any successor, I suggest that the Indian Agent for this Agency be requested to suggest a suitable lodging house, as he has had wide experience in this region and knows these people well.\n\nHoping that some arrangement will be made for next year's teachers,\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nRuth Lewis\nOttawa, April 15, 1933.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter requesting, on behalf of the assistant teacher of the Port Simpson Indian Day School and yourself, that the Department erect a teachers' residence and stating the conditions under which living accommodation is at present obtained.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, as our funds for the present fiscal year have been so considerably reduced, the Department will be unable to consider the erection of a building this year. Could not living accommodation and board be obtained by yourself and the assistant teacher at the Port Simpson Girls' Home? The Department is not aware what accommodation there may be available at the Girls' Home, but it is thought that, if the teachers of the day school could obtain room and board at the Home, it would solve any difficulty in this regard.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I remember the building about twenty-seven years ago, which was then an old building, or at least it was in a condition of disrepair. I was told the building belonged to the Indians and that it stood on Church property; also that the Department assisted in its construction. Perhaps the Department may have some record of this building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C.

With reference to the floors, these should be well scrubbed and oiled. The cost of the above work should be kept as low as possible.

Beaton,\nSecretary Home Mission Board,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Beaton:\n\nFor some time now, there has been an agitation afoot in our village for a new Indian Day School. The Indian Agent has been approached from various directions, and by various individuals. I have broached the subject myself. To date we have received no encouragement from the Indian Department.\n\nWe are all agreed that the present building is in a deplorable condition, and, as I stated in one of my monthly reports to the Indian Agent, is a public disgrace to the community and the Government of Canada.\n\nNo repairs have been done on the building for years. Last year I requisitioned for paint for the inside of the school, but it was not forthcoming. This year, I have decided that the building is not worth repairs or paint. Some months ago the Village Council appointed a committee of three of their best carpenters to examine the foundations of the school building and report what they found.\n\nThis week that report was made by Thomas Gosness, who says that the foundation is a foot lower at one corner, and that a very high wind might send the building over at any time. One of the first things I learned about the building, when I came two years ago, was that the upper room was condemned for the use of a crowd as unsafe. It was considered dangerous to take a class of children up there for physical exercises, - Mr. Gosnell told me that himself, and I am told that Captain Barry condemned the building on one of his visits. At the time of our Christmas entertainment, we considered using the upper room, and were told that it was unsafe, that a hundred people in the upper room might collapse the building. That was eighteen months ago, now it is considered that nowhere is it secure in a high wind.\n\nApart from the fact that the foundations are not safe, and the building is antiquated from the standpoint of heating and lighting, the sanitary conditions of a school that has an attendance of between ninety and a hundred are, to say the least, outrageous, partly due to the antiquity and inadequacy of such necessary facilities, and partly due to the fact that the teachers get little or no support from the Indian Department, in the matter of essential repairs to be made from time to time.\n\nI think that the Indian Department would be well-advised to, at least, make its own investigation of the matter, for conditions are of late rapidly growing worse.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned - Frances L.

However, all funds for building operations were disallowed, and, besides, substantial reductions were made in other services for Indian Education.\n\nThe Department is aware of the condition of the present school building at Port Simpson, and, should it be condemned by our Agent for future use, there would be no other recourse than to close the school, until such time as funds are provided to erect a new building. I may also add that an effort was made to obtain funds to erect a new building when preparing Estimates for the current fiscal year, but this item was disallowed.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nA. F.

May I take this opportunity of saying that the United Church herewith withdraws from any responsibility in connection with what may happen through the continued use of this building.

Added to this the toilet system is a decided health menace.\n\nIn view of all these facts the Council in session on December 11th decided that the school should remain closed until action is taken by the authorities to provide for safe and sanitary accommodation for pupils and teachers.\n\nThe teachers of the school have been notified of the action of the Council and a notice has been posted on the door of the building.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Port Simpson Indian Council.\n\nper\n\nThis letter has been addressed to -\n\nThe Superintendent of Education, Indian Dept., Ottawa.\nThe Commissioner for Indian Affairs in B.C.,\nThe Indian Agent, Prince Rupert, B.C.\nThe Superintendent of United Church Missions in B.C.\nOttawa, December 29, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter, signed by P. M. Wells, Secretary of the Port Simpson Indian Council, in which he states that the members of the Council recently inspected the Port Simpson Indian Day School and that, at their meeting on the 11th instant, they decided that the school should remain closed until action is taken to provide better accommodation. He further states that the teachers of the school have been notified of the motion of the Council and that a notice has been posted on the door of the building.\n\nWhile the Department is aware that a new building is required to replace the present Port Simpson Day School, at the same time, the Indian Council has no right to notify the teachers to discontinue duties. I would appreciate your advising me, at once, whether or not the two teachers of this school closed the school or whether it is to be re-opened on the 4th proximo.\n\nThe necessity for a new building has been carefully considered by the Department but it is regretted that, owing to lack of funds, it is not possible, at the present time, to state definitely when a new school can be erected. Port Simpson is not the only point that requires a new building. At several other places in Canada, new schools are necessary but, as the funds placed at our disposal are not sufficient to permit construction to proceed, the present buildings will have to be used until financial conditions warrant increased expenditure. You should point out to the Indians that the delay in providing a new building at Port Simpson is not due to neglect on the part of the Department but simply due to the fact that the money for the purpose could not be secured.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nDecember 29th, 1936.\n\nDeputy Minister,\n\nFor your information, I enclose copy of a letter received from the Fort Simpson Indian Council with reference to the day school on the Fort Simpson Reserve (Electoral District of Skeena). This school is in the Skeena Agency and the Indian Agent, Mr. E. E. Collison, has his office in Prince Rupert, B.C. An appropriation for the erection of a new building at this point was included in our estimates for the fiscal year 1937-1938 but had to be struck out owing to the reduction in the amount made available for the erection of new day school buildings throughout Canada.\n\nThe enclosed letter emphasizes the necessity of providing a new school at Fort Simpson and the same condition prevails at several other points throughout Canada. The reduction in our estimates makes proper administration of our work extremely difficult.\n\nFrom the last two paragraphs of the Council's letter, you will note that they have issued instructions to the teachers to close the school. They have no authority to direct such action and Indian Agent Collison is being written for a report.\n\nDirector of Indian Affairs.\nPrince Rupert, B.C., Dec. 22nd, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to forward this report for the month of November.\n\nAs stated in previous reports, school buildings at Fort Simpson and Kitkatla are in a very bad condition, being old buildings, and it is a question whether they are worth the spending of money on extensive repair work. It would be advisable to have expert opinion on these two buildings.\n\nW. E.

BOX 666\nVICTORIA, B.C., 29th December, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honour to transmit herewith copy of a letter dated December 21st received at this office from the Port Simpson Indian Council, calling attention to the dangerous condition of the Indian Day School building, together with copy of letter dated December 22nd received from Mr. Agent Collison in the same connection; both letters being self-explanatory.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Collison recommends that the building be inspected and reported upon by Mr. J. R. Mitchell, of Prince Rupert, and the recommendation to have the School inspected should, it is felt, be concurred in under the circumstances. The question, however, of who should be employed must remain entirely with the Department.\n\nWhile I doubt very much that the Port Simpson Council has been given authority to take such drastic action as closing the School, nevertheless, there seems no doubt but that the Council has done so with the conviction that the building is unsafe and the lives of their children may be menaced. At the same time the fabrication of the letter would indicate that white people have had a hand in it and, for this reason, it is considered advisable that the Department should have the building inspected, reported on, and if possible, put in safe and sanitary condition. No doubt the Department will also wish to have the Church authorities consulted with in this connection, inasmuch as the property and building are somewhat involved in recognized jurisdiction. There appears some doubt as to who actually owns the building, as well as the land upon which it stands, and we have no data on file here that would throw light upon the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP:HN\n\nC.

Part of our letter to Mr. Collison read as follows:\n\n\"While the Department is aware that a new building is required to replace the present Port Simpson Day School, at the same time, the Indian Council has no right to notify the teachers to discontinue duties. I would appreciate your advising me, at once, whether or not the two teachers of this school closed the school or whether it is to be re-opened on the 4th proximo.\n\n\"The necessity for a new building has been carefully considered by the Department but it is regretted that, owing to lack of funds, it is not possible, at the present time, to state definitely when a new school can be erected. Port Simpson is not the only point that requires a new building. At several other places in Canada, new schools are necessary but, as the funds placed at our disposal are not sufficient to permit construction to proceed, the present buildings will have to be used until financial conditions warrant increased expenditure. You should point out to the Indians that the delay in providing a new building at Port Simpson is not due to neglect on the part of the Department but simply due to the fact that the money for the purpose could not be secured.\"\n\nYours truly,\n\nD.

The building is very old and it is stated that it would not be practical or advisable to carry out any repairs. It is recommended that a new two classroom day school be erected immediately, same to be constructed by day labour under the supervision of a competent working foreman, and employment given to as many Indians as possible in its erection.\n\nOwing to the location of the proposed school it is rather difficult to make an accurate estimate of the cost, but it is considered that $6,000 will provide for its erection.

The Indian Agent will decide what Indians are to be given employment on the work.\n\nI would also ask to be furnished with the names of firms in Prince Rupert where the materials may be purchased. These materials will consist principally of lumber, millwork, cement, hardware and paint.\n\nThe existing school is situated approximately 35 miles from Prince Rupert by boat and it is proposed to erect the new school on the same site, using as much material from the old building as can be salvaged.\n\nThe Indian Bay School at Fort Simpson is located in the electoral district of Sheena.\n\nDirector of Indian Affairs.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated Dec. 29th last, No.158-2-5, relative to the Port Simpson Indian Day School, which was received on my return on the 13th Jan., from the Queen Charlotte Islands.\n\nIn this connection, I would confirm my telegram to the Department of the 13th as follows\u2014\n\n\"Reference Port Simpson day school closed by village council without authority (stop) recommend competent builder inspect building and report cost and necessity temporary repairs (stop) At present pupils not attending and teachers unoccupied (stop) Kindly wire authorizing same as immediate action advisable.\"\n\nNeedless to say, the action of the Port Simpson council in closing the school was entirely unauthorized, and I have my suspicions that the whole thing was prompted by parties interested in having a new school.\n\nWhilst the building is no doubt old, I am of the opinion that a few repairs would tide over the present situation and as stated in a letter to the Commissioner at Victoria, and in my telegram to the Department, would recommend that an independent inspection of the building be made to determine the present condition of the structure. Although both teachers are on the spot, the pupils have so far not attended and have no doubt been influenced by their parents in this regard.\n\nWith regard to the site of the present building it is, I understand, Indian reserve which was handed over by the Indians for the temporary use\nof the Methodist Church in 1917 for church and educational purposes. (Kindly refer to official letter 119542-1, dated April 17th 1917)\n\nAs to the building itself, there appears to be considerable doubt as to ownership, and it may be that the Department gave a grant in aid at the time of its erection as the upper storey of the building was for some years used for various meetings and classes in connection with the church.\n\nThe Indian Council has been notified of the Department's decision in the matter and as soon as a reply has been received to my telegram, I shall know how to proceed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nJanuary 22nd, 1937.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDr. McGill -\n\nWith regard to the condition of the Port Simpson Indian day school, it would appear from letter hereunder dated January 15th from the Indian agent that before it is definitely decided to proceed with the erection of a new building, careful examination should be made of the old building to ascertain if it would be possible to repair same to make it available for further use.\n\nI should be glad to have your instructions.\n\nArchitect.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOttawa, January 22nd, 1937.\n\nDR.

S. S. OSTERHOUT, D.D., SUPT.\n\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nJanuary 29th 1937\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nI am informed by Mr. Thomas Gosnell, Contractor in Fort Simpson, that there has appeared a notice in the local press, presumably of Prince Rupert, that the Department will proceed at an early date with the erection of a new school for that historic town. Mr. Gosnell is anxious that he should have the opportunity of placing a tender for the new building and I do not see why he should not be favoured at least with that privilege.\n\nI have pleasure in certifying that he is a contractor of good ability and that the workmanship on the new church, for which he has been responsible, is of a very high order and excelled by none that I have personally seen. Mr. Gosnell has a wide experience and being a native of Fort Simpson, other things being equal, should have some preference in the matter. Of course if his tender were out of the question as to price there would be no obligation that way.\n\nIf you could submit him with plans for the new building he would be greatly obliged.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nI remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSSO/AM\nOttawa, February 4, 1937.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, recommending Mr. Thos. Gosnell as contractor in the event of an Indian school being erected at Port Simpson.\n\nAfter communicating with the Indian Agent, it was found impossible to proceed with the erection of a new school at Port Simpson at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. S. S. Osterhout,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n411 Dominion Bank Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to the Fort Simpson day school, I would state that I visited the reserve on the 21st inst. and inspected the school which is a two-storey building over 30 years old.\n\nWhile the foundation is in fair condition, the principal weakness at present lies in the roof which has sagged considerably tending to force out the walls. Any extra weight such as a heavy fall of snow might further endanger the building. I arranged to have temporary buttresses set up against the building on both sides and supports placed under the roof which should strengthen the building for the time being.\n\nI would not advise the Department to go to further expense in connection with the old building and would recommend that a new up to date school be constructed suitable for the needs of the village.\n\nIt has been suggested that the proposed new school should be erected on a new site away from the present mission reserve. I am in favor of this as the new situation will provide a better playground for the pupils and being more accessible to the waterfront, better sanitary arrangements can be provided.\n\nI do not consider it possible to complete the building before the end of the present fiscal year as it will be the end of February at least before actual construction can be started.\n\nThe type of school required will be a two-\nroom building\u2014preferably three, as the attendance in the junior room is sometimes more than one teacher can handle. Accommodation should be provided for at least 100 pupils, and the building provided with necessary conveniences such as central heating, cloak rooms, wash rooms and outside toilets for boys and girls.\n\nThe question of suitable accommodation for the teachers has always been a source of dissatisfaction, and I would suggest, if possible, that suitable living quarters for the two permanent teachers be attached to the school. Should a third teacher be required any time, accommodation can be obtained elsewhere.\n\nIn view of the difficulties and delays we have experienced in connection with the building of the new Kitselas school, I would strongly urge that the building of the Fort Simpson school be placed in the hands of a reliable building firm by contract.\n\nIn order to provide for the future it may be advisable to increase the accommodation to 125 pupils as the population of Port Simpson has increased during the last few years.\n\nI shall be glad to receive complete plans and specifications for the new building together with the Department's instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Louison\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept.of Indian Affairs Branch\nDept.of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, February 10, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nWith reference to the proposed new Day School at Port Simpson, it will be necessary for this office to be supplied with the following information in order that plans and specifications may be prepared for the project.\n\nThe Indian Agent should furnish a sketch showing the approximate size of the lot on which the building is to be erected, also full information as to the contour of the lot, the nature of the soil to be excavated, if a basement is to be provided for, particulars as to the water supply system, and any other information that would be of assistance governing the location of the proposed building on the new site.\n\nThe Indian Agent should also state whether it will be necessary for the department to purchase the site he has in mind or if same is located on Indian lands.\n\nArchitect.\nOttawa, February 11, 1937.\n\nRe: Port Simpson Day School\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe subject matter of your letter of the 27th ultimo has been given careful consideration by the departmental officials, and the suggestions you make have been carefully noted.\n\nI am deeply interested in vocational instruction, and I should like to see greater provision made for such instruction in any schools we may decide to erect during the period that may lie ahead of us. With this thought in mind, I have suggested to the Architect that we might consider the advisability of constructing a day school at Fort Simpson, specially designed for manual training. I have in mind a school with two classrooms, capable of accommodating 40 pupils in each room; and, in addition, a smaller room, designed to give girls a certain amount of instruction in elementary domestic science. I am of the opinion, also, that accommodation should be provided for two teachers. I have been wondering if it would be possible to obtain enough material from the old building to erect a workshop for boys, adjoining the main building. This additional structure would not need to be expensive but should be equipped with benches and the equipment necessary to enable them to undertake carpentry work, boat building, the repair of Diesel engines or any other\n\nEncl.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert,\nB. C.\nother particular branch of vocational instruction which you may feel to be necessary in the district. You are familiar with local conditions and you should be able to give us very valuable information in respect to the actual needs of the school population. I am enclosing, for your information, copy of a memorandum received this morning from Mr. Orr. This memorandum, you will note, is self-explanatory. Your prompt attention to the questions asked by Mr. Orr would be very much appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Heay,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nI beg to report as follows for the month of January.\n\nPORT SIMPSON SCHOOL\n\nOn Thursday, the 22nd inst., a special trip was made to Port Simpson to look into the school situation there.\n\nFollowing a meeting with the village council, and accompanied by some of the members, an inspection was made of the school building. As a result, temporary repairs were arranged for and the building braced pending the Department's decision regarding the erection of a new school. I pointed out to the Council that they had exceeded their rights in closing the school, and was assured that the council's action was taken solely to safeguard the children as it was feared a heavy fall of snow might greatly endanger the building.\n\nHad I not been absent from the agency at the time, matters would have been speedily adjusted and there would have been no need of closing the school. The letter signed by the council was no doubt written by a white resident and that they did not realize the peremptory tone of the communication.\n\nW. E.

(RG 10, Volume 6408, file 837-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, February 24, 1937.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMR. PRATT.\n\nRe Fort Simpson Day School.\n\nAs you are aware, the Department gave some consideration to the erection of a new building, but after correspondence with the Agent it was found that even though construction started it could not be completed before the end of the present fiscal year. In addition, there was some doubt as to the amount of funds that could be secured for the purpose.\n\nIn the Special Supplementary Estimates requested for the fiscal year 1937-38 provision has been made for a new school, at an approximate cost of $7,500.\n\nIf this amount is allowed, and before work proceeds, the matter will, no doubt, be brought to the attention of your office by our Architect. It should be possible to arrange to have the building erected by day labour in charge of a competent foreman, in which event the gentleman whose name has been brought to your attention could be engaged.\n\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter dated Feb. 11th, relative to the proposed day school for the Fort Simpson village, I believe in my previous letter it was stated that it would be necessary to provide for 125 pupils; but as there are 75 names enrolled, I am of the opinion that accommodation should be provided for 100, in order to take care of any future increase, my first figure being based on the increase in population on this reserve.\n\nThe addition of a room for domestic science teaching is I think, a good idea, provided that the services of a domestic science teacher is obtained. With such large classes it would be impossible for the other teachers to take up this subject.\n\nIt will be possible to obtain sufficient lumber from the old building for the erection of a workshop. If this is done, I would suggest that the manual training be started on a small scale. The Indians are handy with the use of tools and frequently have the idea that they know everything.\n\nThey nearly all have some knowledge of gas engines as they own their own fishing boats many of which have been built by themselves, and the boys are accustomed at an early age to handle their boats. With this in view I would suggest that unless a qualified instructor is appointed to teach these subjects the scheme may not meet with the success warranted by a large outlay. Personally, I am strongly in favor of vocational training but consider it advisable that the scheme be tried out gradually before any large expense is incurred.\n\nI would also suggest that a covered shelter, or shed, be erected for use during recess in bad weather.\nThe Indians have set apart two vacant lots for the school, but in order to guard against fire hazard, it is advisable that twenty-five feet of each of the adjoining occupied lots, numbers Two and One, should be purchased by the Department. This could be done for the sum of $50.00 ($25.00 each).\n\nThe accommodation for the two teachers is particularly desirable.\n\nIf central heating is planned a larger appropriation will be required to cover this extra cost.\n\nI am enclosing a sketch of the proposed site with the information asked for by Mr. Orr, and shall await the Department's instructions with regard to the commencement of the work on the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nWEC/JJ\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, branch\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nEncs.\nMemorandum for Mr. Orr, re Proposed New School, Port Simpson Reserve.\n\nSize of Lot, as per sketch\n\nLand level; small amount of clearing to be done; mostly crab apple and elderberry trees.\n\nNature of soil. Muskeg surface, ordinary subsoil.\n\nWater. Can be obtained from village supply, water pipe laid to corner of lot. Water supply low in summer months.\n\nWould suggest that cement piers be used for school building, and cement basement for teacher's residence.\n\nThe land is Indian reserve and the Indian Council has by resolution set apart two unoccupied lots for the purpose.\n\nThe land slopes down very gradually to the north. South end of location dry and suitable for teacher's residence basement.\nOttawa, March 12, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMay I direct your attention to a letter, dated March 3rd, received from Mr. W. E. Collison, Indian Agent, Prince Rupert, B. C. This letter was written in response to our request for additional information in respect to the construction of a day school at Fort Simpson.\n\nIn my judgment, we should proceed with the construction of a day school, consisting of two main classrooms capable of accommodating 40 pupils, each; a smaller room, sufficiently spacious to give instruction in elementary domestic science to groups of girls (25 to 30); and a residence for two teachers. I am convinced, also, that we can very profitably use the material in the old school for the construction of an additional workshop, in which vocational instruction can be provided for boys. This building should be inexpensively constructed. I have no opinion to express in respect to Mr. Collison's suggestion, that a covered shelter or shed be erected for use during recess in bad weather. It is just possible that sufficient material could be obtained from the old building to erect such a shed, in addition to the vocational building.\n\nI may state that I have discussed the rebuilding programme at Fort Simpson very fully and in detail with the representatives of the United Church. We are anxious that this work should be undertaken just as soon as you can complete arrangements to have it started.\n\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n**Hudson's Bay Company**\n\n**Port Simpson B.C.**\n\n**27th February, 1937**\n\n**STATEMENT**\n\n**Department of Indian Affairs**\n\n**Indian Day School, Port Simpson, B.C.**\n\n| Date | To | Merchandise supplied to Local Indian Day School: |\n|------|----|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Feb 17 |    |                                                  |\n\n- 4 Panes Glass .25 1.00\n- 1 Lb.

They have been looked over by Inspector Barry, who is now visiting in this agency, and myself, and in this connection I should like to point out:\n\n1. That no provision has been made for an inside bathroom and toilet for the teacher's residence, and no outside toilets for the school.\n\n2. That platforms have been provided for both class rooms.\n\n3. That blackboard space has only been provided at one end of each class room.\n\n4. That no provision has been made for washrooms for either boys or girls.\n\nWith regard to provision for a bathroom, I would point out that it is absolutely necessary that one should be installed for the convenience of the teachers. In this connection, it will be necessary to provide a sewer pipe from the school to the beach, a distance of approximately one hundred yards, with a good fall towards the sea. This will entail sewer pipe and the digging of a shallow ditch to low water mark.\n\nI am informed by Inspector Barry that class room platforms are unnecessary. Such platforms were used in the past, but have been discontinued in all British Columbia schools for a considerable time. Teacher's desks are not now placed actually at the end\nof a classroom, but diagonally across one corner, this is recognized as the best position for the teacher's desk. Similar platforms as those indicated on the plans have been removed from a number of our Indian schools in the past.\n\nWith respect to blackboard space, it is considered by the Inspector and myself that additional blackboard should be placed in each class room along the whole length of the dividing wall opposite the windows as well as at the end of the class room. The provision for blackboard space as is now suggested is a feature of all modern class room construction. It is necessary that every facility should be afforded the Indian children for blackboard writing and other related work.\n\nWith regard to wash room accommodation, it is hardly necessary to point out the absolute necessity for such accommodation in any modern Indian school. In view of the fact that no provision has been made on the ground floor, it is suggested that possibly the necessary wash rooms could be arranged for in the basement, or if this is considered impracticable, wash basins with water connections might be installed in the corridor on the ground floor.\n\nThe Fort Simpson Indian Council are installing an electric lighting plant for the village which will be of sufficient capacity to supply public buildings on the reserve, and it might be advisable to wire the teachers' residence and school for this purpose as the use of electric light is much safer than coal oil lamps which would otherwise be used in the building.\nThese matters are being brought to the attention of the Department at the present time in order to save the extra expense that would be involved in rectifying such omissions at a later date.\n\nIt is to be regretted that a copy of the school plans was not forwarded to this office at an earlier date so that suggestions could have been made before work commenced on the building.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nNov. 3, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 26th of October, addressed to the Secretary, with reference to certain provisions and changes required in the construction of the new day school at Fort Simpson.\n\nIn reply I beg to advise that arrangements are being made for the following:\n\nProvision of some type of chemical toilet for the use of the teacher's residence.\n\nOmission of the platforms which have been provided in the classrooms.\n\nWiring of the building for a lighting system.\n\nIn regard to the request for more blackboard space this will have to be provided as required.\n\nThe wash rooms for the boys and girls will have to be considered in the future.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSuperintendent, Welfare and Training Service.\n\nW.E.

The work is being done by Indian labor under the supervision of Mr. A.H. MacPherson, foreman carpenter. At the time of my visit excavations for the foundations had been completed, and forms were being made for receiving the cement.\n\nThe Department's attention has already been drawn in my letter of October 26th to other matters connected with this building.\n\nW.E. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nI beg to forward the following report for the month of November.\n\nPORT SIMPSON.\n\nOn the 25th and 26th inst. I was at Port Simpson. I found work on the new school progressing as satisfactorily as could be expected owing to the wet weather during the month.

McNaughton continues to be satisfactory, and the building should be ready for occupation by the beginning of March.\n\nW.H. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report as follows for the month of January:\n\nMost of the carpentry and construction work on the new school being almost completed, only a few Indians were employed at the time of my visit. I was informed by the foreman, Mr. McPherson, that plastering of the interior was about to start.\n\nW. E. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nMarch 10th 1938\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nHaving just returned from a visit to Fort Simpson I beg leave to place before you some of my findings in regard to the new school building now being constructed by the Government for that village.\n\nAs you may know the old school building became very dilapidated and has been used to date by being propped up with heavy timbers to strengthen it in times of storm. The new building was sorely needed and is rapidly taking shape, the workers being engaged with the plastering of the building when I visited the same. The two class rooms I think will be most suitable for the purposes.\n\nThe matter I wish particularly to bring to your attention is that while the building is costing a considerable sum of money - approximately $4,000.00 - there is no provision whatever made for bathroom and toilet accommodation, neither for the two-room school or for the two teachers employed in the work there. This surely must be an oversight on the part of the Government or the Contractors who have had the erection of the building in hand. As the building is still uncompleted I think it is not too late to make a constructive suggestion in regard to this most important and urgent matter.\n\nThe accommodation for the teachers consists of two large bedrooms upstairs and a kitchen and living room downstairs. In addition to that there is a room designated for the purpose of Domestic Science teaching, which is perhaps not urgently needed at the moment, at least not so urgently required as the accommodation I have referred to. My suggestion therefore is that the room set apart for Domestic Science be devoted to bathroom and toilet requirements, with entrances off the hall for class-room purposes, one for the boys and one for girls and a portion of the same room with entrance from the living room of the teachers for bathroom equipment for their use. I presume the Domestic Science room would be sufficiently large for such accommodation. The equipment required might possibly cost a little more than that for domestic science, but it seems to me that the same is so imperative that any additional expense involved in the alteration I am suggesting would be money well spent if indeed it is necessary to make any additional grant for the purpose.\nThe building is very nicely located on the street leading up from the wharf and the Hudson's Bay Co., and faces on property still belonging to that Company which I have no doubt may be used for an unlimited time by the children as a playground, a most desirable acquisition to the school and made possible by the happy location of the building.\n\nTrusting that my suggestion will be welcomed by your department and that I may be favoured with your reaction to the proposal at your own convenience,\n\nI remain,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSSO/AM\nDear Sir:\n\nI am forwarding the enclosed letter received from the Reverend S. S. Osterhout, Superintendent of Indian Missions of the United Church of Canada, regarding the new Indian Day School on the Port Simpson Indian Reserve, in the Skeena Agency.\n\nThe attention of the Department is called to Indian Agent Collison's letter dated 26th October, 1937, his file 2-E-11138, in which certain recommendations were made before work was actually started on the superstructure of the building. In view of the fact that the building is now nearing completion, the recommendations made by Dr. Osterhout would involve considerable additional expense.\n\nThe matter has been discussed with Inspector Barry who agrees with Dr. Osterhout's contention, but suggests that the room intended for a domestic science class be divided into two parts; one to be equipped as toilet and bathroom for use of the teachers; while the other part might well be equipped as a children's washroom. It is suggested that the available village water supply, though not abundant, might be installed in this room.\n\nIt is not considered advisable to have the boys' and girls' toilets on the main floor of the School and in near proximity to the teachers' living quarters. Under the circumstances, it is recommended that separate toilets for boys and girls be erected outside of the building on the School grounds.\n\nI may say that the plans and arrangements in connection with the construction of this School were made without reference to this Office.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nWhile it would be convenient for the teachers to install a bathroom I would point out that this would involve considerable extra expense at this time but as no funds are provided for the purpose it is not possible to favourably consider Doctor Osterhout's request in this regard. The funds for the erection of the Port Simpson School were provided in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1936-37. This Vote expires on the 31st instant and no additional funds have been provided in our next year's estimates for the expenditure that would be necessary to install a bathroom.\n\nOn February 11, 1937, I wrote Indian Agent Collison with a view to ascertaining if he considered it possible to obtain enough material from the old building to erect a work shop for the boys adjoining the new school. I pointed out at that time that this building would not need to be expensive but could be equipped with benches and the equipment necessary to enable the boys to undertake carpentry work or some other branch of vocational instruction.\n\nMr. Collison replied to my letter in part as follows: \"It will be possible to obtain sufficient lumber from the old building for the erection of a work shop. If this is done I would suggest that the manual training be started on a small scale. The Indians are handy with the use of tools but frequently have the idea that they know everything. Personally I am strongly in favour of vocational training but consider it advisable that the scheme be tried out gradually before any large expense is incurred.\"\n\nI concur in what Mr. Collison said in his letter with reference to starting on a small scale and I would, therefore, appreciate if you would let me know what would be the probable cost of the erection of a small work shop for the boys using the material from the old building.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nMarch 23, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 16th instant enclosing letter received from Reverend S. S. Osterhout with reference to the new Fort Simpson Day School.\n\nIt is the Department's desire to have the instruction at Indian Day Schools as practical as possible. Consequently, when erecting new buildings it is our intention to provide facilities for the teaching of domestic science and manual training. As a result, when considering plans for the new school at Fort Simpson it was decided to provide a domestic science room and we are not prepared to make the change suggested by Reverend Mr. Osterhout. I might add that the Associate Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada was consulted at the time the plans were prepared and he fully approved our desire to provide a domestic science classroom.\n\nFor your information I may add that on the second floor of the new building there is a small room in which a chemical toilet has been installed for the use of the teachers.\n\nIf outside toilets for the pupils have not yet been provided you should ascertain from the Indian Agent if the toilets at the old school can be moved to the new site and if not you may authorize the Indian Agent to construct new outside toilets. It is understood, of course, that the cost will be kept as low as possible.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 8,\nVancouver, B. C.\nOttawa,\nMarch 23, 1938.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nThe new Day School at Fort Simpson is practically completed and I hope that it will be ready for occupation early next month.\n\nProvision has been made for two classrooms, also domestic science room. The following accommodation is provided for the teachers: Living room and kitchen on ground floor; two bedrooms, clothes closets and small room with chemical toilet on second floor.\n\nYou will remember that early in 1937 I discussed this school with you and that you agreed that it would be advisable to provide facilities for the teaching of domestic science. Recently I received a letter from Indian Commissioner MacKay enclosing a letter from Reverend Dr. Osterhout suggesting that the domestic science room be divided into a toilet and bathroom. You are aware of my desire to make the training at Indian Day Schools as practical as possible and it is, therefore, rather discouraging to receive a suggestion such as that made by Dr. Osterhout.\n\nIndian Commissioner MacKay is being informed that the Department is not prepared to favourably consider Dr. Osterhout's suggestion. We are also requesting the Indian Commissioner to make inquiries with a view to using the material in the old school for a small work shop for the boys.\n\nRev. Geo. Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. W.,\nToronto, Ont.\nThe completion of the new Port Simpson School raises the question of teaching services for the academic year 1938-39. I have no complaint to make regarding the teachers at present in the school but, as we wish to feature domestic science and manual training, I thought it advisable to bring the matter to your attention as possibly it might be necessary to make a change in the teaching services at this school for the next academic year. I would appreciate your giving the matter careful consideration and advising me regarding your views.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nApril 1, 1938.\n\nMemorandum for file:\n\nMr. Dudley phoned me this afternoon and stated that the Port Simpson School was completed with the exception of some painting which would probably require an expenditure of approximately $100.00.\n\nHe also requested that we wire the Agent and instruct him to keep the building heated until plaster is dry.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nVeuillez exp\u00e9dier la d\u00e9p\u00eache suivante aux conditions mentionn\u00e9es au verso auxquelles je consens par les pr\u00e9sentes\n\n168-2-5\n\nAPRIL 1 1938\n\nW E COLLISON\nINDIAN AGENT\nPRINCE RUPERT B C\n\nDEPARTMENT ADVISED THAT PORT SIMPSON SCHOOL IS COMPLETED\nSTOP PLEASE MAKE IMMEDIATE ARRANGEMENTS TO KEEP THE BUILDING\nHEATED FOR NEXT FEW DAYS IN ORDER THAT PLASTER MAY BECOME\nTHOROUGHLY DRY\n\nR A HOEX\nSUPT WELFARE & TRAINING\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept.

I think that all that Dr. Osterhout had in mind was the necessity of providing some toilet accommodation in connection with the school. He tells me that, apart from the provision which has been made on the upper floor for the teachers, there is absolutely no provision of sanitary toilet facilities for the children. Dr. Osterhout also tells me that your representative thinks that some provision should be made.\n\nI told Dr. Osterhout, however, that we would not think of suggesting that the domestic science room be used for that purpose. I will be going out to British Columbia and will discuss with the teachers and with Dr. Osterhout your desire to feature domestic science and manual training, which is certainly a step in the right direction. It would, of course, be very difficult to have teachers of different sexes, since they occupy the same quarters, unless it would be possible to get a man and his wife, both of whom qualify as teachers. The matter will receive our most sympathetic consideration.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

From this correspondence it would appear double toilet accommodation, i.e., for boys and girls, will have to be provided for the new Day School there, now in course of erection. Mr. Collison informs me that the costs of erection of two double toilets, using some of the lumber material left over from the new school whilst building, will cost approximately $45.00. He informs me that it is not feasible to move the toilet from the old school. It is attached to the main building and is very old material, being mostly perished. As you can see, it is absolutely necessary that this toilet accommodation be provided. I therefore recommend that the sum of $45.00 be allowed for this work.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M.

Miss How, the Senior teacher, is ready to teach this subject and would, I think, take some special preparation for this during the summer.\n\nShe told me that there was not even a chimney in the room so that a stove could be used but that someone had suggested that it would be connected with the village lighting plant - and electric stoves used - we thought such a thing absurd.\n\nWould it be possible to have these two matters attended to right away?\n\n(4) The building now used for a school is very large. There seems to be enough lumber in it to build all the shop needed for Manual Training for the boys. Perhaps as part of the training they might tear it down and rebuild it.

It is not our intention that either expensive or electrically operated equipment should be supplied. Inspector Barry and yourself are no doubt familiar with local conditions at Port Simpson and in supplying articles for this vocational training room it is considered preferable to furnish articles similar to those that the girls might be expected to have when their school days are over.

Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Indian Agent Collison, in which he makes application to expend $150.00 for a board fence to divide the school grounds on the southerly side of the Port Simpson Day School from the adjoining Indian houses, otherwise the School toilets, instructions for the erection of which have been issued, will become public property.\n\nThe application is recommended for favorable consideration, and Mr. Collison is being asked to supply unit costs of materials from firms on the approved list, in case the application is approved.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa,\nMay 20, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant with reference to the erection of a fence at the Fort Simpson Indian Day School. The amount requested by the Agent, namely $150.00, seems rather high.\n\nPlease discuss this matter with me when I am in Vancouver.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nR. A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nPart of the cement has been damaged by dampness and the original value cannot be refunded besides boat freight and handling charges to Prince Rupert would cost as much as the present value of the material. An offer of $15.00 has been made for the 633 common bricks and I would advise acceptance of this offer.\n\nTo dry out the building Mr. George, of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, authorized payment of Two Dollars ($2.00) per week to an Indian to look after the building and light a small fire occasionally in the furnace. It has been necessary to continue this arrangement as the building is still damp and the blackboards have warped slightly. I shall be glad if this expenditure is authorized.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.E. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letters dated April 23rd and May 12th relative to the new Day School at Port Simpson.\n\nOwing to my absence from the office it was not possible to reply to your first letter at an earlier date.\n\nActing on instructions received through Indian Commissioner MacKay on May 13th, an estimate was obtained for the construction of two outside toilets. This work is now in hand. As stated in a previous letter to the Commissioner, the toilets at the old school could not be utilized as they are too ancient. The new ones are being built from lumber and material left over from the new school. This will reduce the cost considerably.\n\nAn estimate, of the cost of erecting a manual training shop, is being prepared and will be forwarded as soon as possible.\n\nIt would be inadvisable to open the new building until after the summer holidays, as most of the pupils are now away from the Village and will not return until late in September. By that time the building will be ready, and the furniture for the teachers' quarters provided and installed. I have already pointed out, in a previous communication, that the toilet arrangements for the teachers' residence is most unsatisfactory and unsanitary.\n\nNearly all the lumber and hardware left over from the new building, as per list supplied by the Surveys and Engineering Branch, can be used in connection with the school outhouses and manual training shop. With regard however, to the hard wall cement (72 sacks) and a quantity of plaster of paris, I inquired of the firm that supplied the cement whether they would take back the unused supply.\nDear Sir:\n\nPrince Rupert, B.C., June 4th, 1938.\n\nI beg to report for the month of May as follows:\n\nPORT SIMPSON DAY SCHOOL\n\nOwing to most of the people being away from the village the attendance at the day school was smaller than usual. Both teachers and pupils are looking forward to the occupation of the new school building in the September term. Equipment and furnishings for the classrooms and teachers' quarters have still to be provided and requisition for this purpose will be forwarded as soon as possible.\n\nW.E. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa,\nJune 3, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo with reference to the Port Simpson Day School. It is noted that the two toilets are being erected and that an estimate of the cost of erecting a manual training shop will be forwarded in the near future.\n\nI have consulted the Surveys & Engineering Branch and they cannot understand why it has taken so long to dry the plaster. Are we to understand that the building has been kept heated continuously since April 1, the date on which we forwarded you a night lettergram authorizing you to keep the building heated for a few days. I understand that the plaster should have been dry within 10 days at the outside.\n\nI would appreciate your advising the reason why it has taken so long to dry the plaster and also why the blackboards are becoming warped.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nW.

Collison,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFollowing are estimated cost for taking down of old Day School, moving of all material needed from old School site to new School site for the building of a manual training building Size 20ft x 40 ft.\n\nTaking down of old Day School building save enough material for building a 20 x 40 ft building, clearing of site of all old foundation material and etc.\n\n$150.00\n\nMoving of building material to new school site 30.00\n\nBuilding Manual training building 20 x 40 ft. on cedar post, double wall and floor, inside lined with V joint from old school, 1 coat paint. Outside wall and roof painted as directed. 550.00\n\nNew material to complete building Cedar Post, shingles, paint, hardware. 130.00\n\nThe basis of labor cost is for Indian labor available after fishing season.\n\n$850.00\n\nYours truly,\n\nTom Gosnell.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of March 23rd, file 168-2-5, I beg to submit herewith an estimate of the costs of dismantling the old Port Simpson Day School and the erection of a new Manual Training Unit out of the old but suitable materials and such new lumber and other building materials that may be required. The estimate of $660.00 was discussed with Capt. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools, who considers the amount reasonable when all the circumstances are considered.\n\nIt may be, however, that if the Department approves of the erection of a building for Manual Training purposes at Port Simpson, that the usual arrangements will be made to call for tenders.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 3rd inst. respecting the new school at Port Simpson, I would state that fires were not kept up continuously at the school. It was necessary however, to have a small fire going twice a week to keep the interior of the building from getting damp. In a drier climate this would not have been necessary.\n\nWith regard to the warping of the blackboards, the only reason I can give is that when the boards were put up, not sufficient room was allowed for expansion, with the result that when they absorbed the least moisture the boards bulged as a natural result.\n\nI am enclosing Vo.8780 for the sum of $12.00 paid through the Hudson's Bay Company for services, lighting fires and looking after the building generally. This service was discontinued at the end of May.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.E.

It would appear that no proper drainage system was installed round the basement walls with the result that water seeps through the walls into the furnace room and coal bin from the rear of the building.

I may add that at the present time there are no funds available for any expenditure at this school.\n\nIn reviewing our files I find that the last memorandum received from your office in connection with the Port Simpson school was dated April 19, 1936, and at that time you stated that no definite figures were available regarding the cost of the building but that the approximate expenditure was $13,900.00. It would be appreciated if you would send me a statement showing the actual amount expended.\n\nDirector.\nFront (North) Elevation.\n\nDAY SCHOOL & TEACHER'S RESIDENCE\n\nPORT SIMPSON, B.C.\n\nPlan 714\n9th March, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Day school and teachers' residence, Port Simpson, B.C.\n\nI am forwarding herewith a photograph of the above school after completion. The final expenditure given as the cost of the school for the year 1937-8 was $13,484.76.\n\nWith reference to the matter which you brought up in your memorandum of the flooding of the basement during wet weather the following is quoted from our Field Engineer's report,-\n\n\"The water table in fall and winter is practically at the surface of the ground. This necessitated digging drainage trenches up to eight or nine feet deep to carry away the water to a creek bottom 250 feet distant from the school before excavation could begin.\n\nOn account of high water table 450 feet of drain tile had to be installed to protect the basement from dampness. Later this was extended for a further 75 feet by using old water pipe from the Port Simpson water lines.\"\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, March 14th, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn receipt of your report for the month of January, I communicated with the Surveys & Engineering Branch regarding the unsatisfactory condition of the basement at the Fort Simpson Indian Day School.\n\nWith reference to this matter, I am informed as follows:\n\n\"The water table in fall and winter is practically at the surface of the ground. This necessitated digging drainage trenches up to eight or nine feet deep to carry away the water to a creek bottom 250 feet distant from the school before excavation could begin.\n\nOn account of high water table 450 feet of drain tile had to be installed to protect the basement from dampness. Later this was extended for a further 75 feet by using old water pipe from the Fort Simpson water lines.\"\n\nIt appears from the above that the Surveys & Engineering Branch consider that they have done everything possible to keep the basement dry. If, in view of the information regarding what has been done, you consider any further work could be carried out in order to ensure a dry basement, please let me have an estimate of the cost of what you recommend might be done to overcome the difficulty.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter dated March 14th last respecting drainage conditions in connection with Port Simpson Indian day school. In this matter, I have also written Mr. C.E. Webb, District Chief Engineer at Vancouver, and enclose herewith copy of my letter to him.\n\nDuring my recent visit to Port Simpson I inspected the basement and drainage leading from the school to the foresnore.\n\nI was informed by the Indian foreman, Mr. Peter Wells, who was engaged on the construction of the school that some loose rock was placed around the foot or the cement walls on the outside, these have evidently become seated in the soft muskeg. He also stated that some drainage tile had been installed. On examination of the drain pipe leading from the school, it was found clogged with lime which has prevented any drainage from the basement.\n\nThe drain pipe to the foresnore is also blocked at a point approximately 120 feet from the lower outlet, owing, as I was informed by Mr. Wells, to the fact that the extension to the 4\" tile pipe consists of 2\" wooden pipe, in other words, 4\" tile pipe empties into 2\" pipe and naturally it has become blocked at the point where the two different sizes of pipe join.\n\nIt will be necessary to take up the 2\" pipe for the distance stated, and replace it with proper 4\" drain tile. The upper end of the pipe should also be cleaned out, otherwise the lime will solidify and may necessitate taking up the whole line.\n\nAs stated in my letter to Mr. Webb, the work should not take longer than three days to do, employing one man and a helper; enclosed is an approximate cost of the whole undertaking.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\n\nWEC/JJ\nApproximate Cost of remedying unsatisfactory condition of new school, Port Simpson Indian reserve.\n\n1 man @ 75\u00a2 per hour - 24 hours . . . . . . . . . . 18.00\n1 helper @ 40\u00a2 per hour 24 \" . . . . . . . . . . 9.60\n120 ft.4\" drain tile @ 15\u00a2 per L.F. . . . . . . . . 18.00\nF.O.B.

C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nDecember 16, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant in which you state you are enclosing a letter from Indian Agent Gillett. However, the letter to which you refer was not received with yours.\n\nIn a letter dated December 15, 1938, Indian Agent Collison requested authority to dispose of two used stoves which had been in the junior and senior classrooms of the old Port Simpson School. He was authorized to sell these to Indians and on February 13, 1939, he remitted the amount of $17.00 and advised us that the stoves had been sold to E. Daldow and Thomas Gosnell but he did not state definitely at the time what price each of the men mentioned had paid. It appears from the second paragraph of your letter that Mr. Gosnell wishes to resell his stove to us at a cost of $10.00. As the stove was not satisfactory for use at the Port Simpson School in 1938 and has been used by Gosnell for the past three years it is extremely doubtful if it is worth $10.00 now. I presume that only a small heater is required for the manual training division of the present Port Simpson School and possibly it would be to our advantage to purchase a new stove even though it costs more than $10.00. You may make whatever arrangements you consider best in the circumstances.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nP.O. Box 444,\nVancouver, B.C.,\nDecember 18, 1941.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nAs requested by you, I have considered with care the contents of Mr. Indian Agent Gillett's letter 2-11-2A of the 13th instant with regard to the provision of fire exit doors in the class rooms of the Port Simpson Indian Day School, Skeena River Agency.\n\nAt present, should an emergency occur, the only possible exit for the children would be through a transverse hallway, each class room opening directly onto this hall. It is, of course, through this hallway that children make their exit during fire drills.\n\nI am inclined to agree with Mr. Gillett that better provision should be made for the safety of the children in case the school has to be evacuated or cleared in a very brief time and without the slightest chance of confusion. I would, therefore, recommend that the provision of two outside doors now asked for be favorably considered.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6408, file 837-5, part 3)\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Port Simpson Council requests that fire exit doors be placed in each class room of the Port Simpson Indian Day School. At present there is one ordinary door opening into an inside corridor from each room.\n\nApart from a possible emergency due to war conditions, I consider that more adequate provisions should be made for escape in case of fire. I strongly recommend that permission be given to have these arrangements made immediately, as there are a hundred pupils in this school at present.\n\nThe Council has agreed to provide the labour if the Department will supply the material which consists of the following:\n\n- 2 outside doors @ $4.75 = $9.50\n- 4 hinges @ 50\u00a2 = $2.00\n- 2 inside sliding bolts with fittings @ 60\u00a2 = $1.20\n- Door facings and jams, etc. = $8.00\n- Paint and incidentals = $4.30\n\nTotal = $25.00\n\nThe prices listed are those from local firms. If these articles were purchased at Vancouver and shipped direct to Port Simpson by S.S. Catala, there would possibly be a saving of $3.00 or $4.00.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. Gillett\nIndian Agent\n\nJG:F\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nVancouver, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the provision of fire exit doors at the Fort Simpson Indian Day School, Skeena River Agency, I am forwarding herewith a letter dated December 13th received from Mr. Indian Agent Gillett and also a letter of today's date from Inspector Barry dealing with the same subject.\n\nIt would appear to me that with one hundred pupils now in attendance at the school and the only exit, in case of sudden emergency, a single hallway, confusion might possibly arise.\n\nAs the Port Simpson Indian Council has agreed to provide the labor if the Department will supply the material, estimated by Mr. Gillett at $25, I would recommend provision of the doors asked for.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Gillett suggests that if favorable consideration could be given by the Department to this project, it might be cheaper to have the necessary material purchased in Vancouver and shipped to Port Simpson. I am not, however, prepared to agree with him as I consider that he is in a better position to purchase the doors, etc., in Prince Rupert, knowing as he does the size necessary and the other details with reference to painting and incidentals.\n\nI would recommend that authority be given for the expenditure of a sum not exceeding $25 for the purchase of materials recommended by Mr. Gillett.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

Mr. Gosnell did not take delivery of the stove and the heater was placed in the Manual Training room.\n\nManual Training is now being carried on weekly in the building which was built out of the lumber from the old school and as a heater is required I recommend that we re-purchase this one from Mr. Gosnell for $10.00.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.

It appears from Mr. Gillett's letter that, although Tom Gosnell purchased the stove now in question for $10, he did not actually take delivery and the stove was placed in the Manual Training shop subsequently erected from the materials available from the old school.\n\nAs there is a need for the conservation of funds and metals, and it would appear from Mr. Gillett's letter that the stove is quite serviceable, I consider it advisable to re-purchase this stove and Mr. Gillett is being instructed accordingly.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

These replacements will make it possible to destroy a number of broken-down double desks which are in the last stages of repair. The tops of many of these desks have been carved and defaced and in many cases the castings are either wholly or partly fractured and broken.\n\nOn my last visit to Port Simpson every desk in both rooms of the school was carefully checked and the number of new desks requisitioned are minimum requirements for the efficient conduct of this school during the coming term. Further replacements should be made in the next fiscal year.\n\nF.

A further letter dated August 21st from Mr. Anfield in support of the need for new desks is enclosed and if funds are available I would recommend that the Department authorize the purchase of the school desks, teachers desks and chairs listed on the requisition.\n\nFor D.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nF. E. Anfield, Esq., Indian Agent, Prince Rupert, B.C.\n\nI would refer to your letter of August 21st, 1946, in which you state that 32 of the Port Simpson Indian Day School desks require replacement as this number is broken down and in the last stage of repair, the tops of many of these desks having been carved and defaced and in many cases the castings either wholly or partly fractured and broken. We have endeavoured to secure quotations on desks without results owing to steel strikes and slow delivery of certain hardwoods, and makers are unable to state when delivery can be made except for movable chair desks and progressive tables and chairs.\n\nThere would appear to have been the most deplorable lack of supervision by the teachers at this point of the pupils in the handling of school equipment to have permitted this wanton destruction to continue at a time when replacements have been most difficult to obtain and it would be appreciated if you would impress on the teachers that their fitness for the position will be assessed by their ensuring care of school property provided from public funds. If they are unable to ensure that this is done, they should undoubtedly be replaced or dismissed.\n\nThe Mission Indian Residential School are extremely anxious to secure desks and if they can be spared, I would request that you ship the ten best of these broken desks to the Reverend Principal, Indian Residential School, Mission, B.C. as they are in a position to make the necessary repairs in the school shop, having welding equipment.\n\nYour application for replacement of school desks was referred to the Department and I am awaiting their authorization covering the expenditure.\n\nFor D.

These had been purchased by Miss Currie herself.\n\nEquipment maintenance included necessary replacement of storm window glass and installation of which was made urgent by extreme cold weather during December to the end of January.\n\nThe account is recommended for payment.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nExtract from Report of P.S. Tennant, M.D., dated February 13th, 1947. Original on file 315-6-3\n\nFILE: 168-2-5 (Port Simpson)\n\nIn reference to your enquiry by wire re the water supply of the Crosby Home the following information is supplied. There are three separate water systems in Simpson all coming from separate sources viz streams from the mountains to the rear of the settlement.\n\nThe village has its own supply of water and also supplies the Hudson Bay store and white residences.\n\nThe hospital and doctors residence is supplied by a second stream. The pipe line is of wood stave pipe and is quite old.\n\nThe Crosby Home is supplied by a small stream with no one else tapping the source. Condition of the pipe line was not ascertained. The source is about \u00bc of a mile from the home. The head of water is estimated at 150 feet or more. The dam is in a poor state of repair and requires to be replaced due partly to its condition, but also to increase storage in case of fire. When visited the reserve of water was nil due to zero weather here. There is no report of there having been a shortage of water in recent years however.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.,\nMarch 31st, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nReference attached Voucher #364 for $26.95 payable to the Hudson's Bay Company. Authority for installing the blackboards was given in your letter of Oct. 23/46 file 215-8-5509.\n\nWhen the work was put in hand I instructed the Hudson's Bay Company to have the doors rehung as they were warping badly. The severe cold snap of January necessitated the immediate placing of storm sash in position and the carpenter was instructed to do this work including necessary reglazing at the same time. No carpenter could be secured at less than $1.10 an hour and the work was ordered ahead at this rate. The account as presented is recommended for payment.\n\nF.

In order to do this, it will be necessary to dismantle the casing and at the same time the furnace can be thoroughly cleaned.\n\nThe junior classroom has insufficient desks for the pupilage attending. It will be necessary to repair some of the old desks now stored in the school annexe and install these in the junior room.\n\nOf the sum requested, $20.00 will cover the furnace repairs and $5.00 those of the desks. Immediate sanction of this work is recommended as the teachers are complaining of coal gas fumes.\n\nF.

Vancouver, B.C.\n\nApplication is made to install bathroom plumbing and a hot water tank at the Fort Simpson Indian Day School. We have a chance of a lifetime to buy a basin, toilet and bath with fittings from the old hospital for $50.00. We can also secure sewer and water pipes and valves from the same source. A hot water tank can be bought for $20.00 f.o.b. Prince Rupert. There is a sewer line running from the Crosby Home right past the Day School and a hook-up with this line can be effected with ease. Mr. H. Brown, the caretaker at the hospital is a practical plumber and will do the work. There is provision for a bathroom in the upstairs quarters of the school.\n\nEstimated cost:\n\nMaterial ex hospital:\nToilet, bath and basin $50.00\nSink for kitchen $15.00\n150' galvanized pipe-used, \u00bd\" $22.50\n100 ft. sewer pipe @ 10\u00a2, \u00be and 1\" $10.00\nFittings, valves, shut offs, etc. $15.00 $112.50\n\nMaterial ex Prince Rupert:\nStandard hot water tank, with freight $24.00\nLabour, 100 hours @ $1.00 an hour $100.00\n\nTotal estimated cost $236.50\n\nThis is a modern school and should have modern plumbing if we are going to hold good teachers.

In the case of the Fort Simpson school we have a modern building and the cost of installation of inside plumbing is reasonable. The installation of such facilities will be an added inducement to qualified teachers to accept positions in our schools and in the case of the Fort Simpson School I would recommend that the Department authorize Mr. Anfield to have the installation proceeded with at a cost of $236.50.\n\nW.S.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.,\n\nWe have your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to the proposed erection of an outside play shed at the Port Simpson Indian Day School. We agree that good advantage might be taken of such a building if it were erected. However, there are several other Indian Day Schools at which a similar building would be useful. If we authorize such a building at one school, we will have applications from others which we could not refuse. Funds, this year are not available for this expenditure and consequently we regret that favourable consideration can not be given to the proposal at Port Simpson.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nPP/HH.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Port Simpson Indian Day School\n\nAttached is a request from Mr. Superintendent Anfield for building materials amounting to $265.51 to be used in the construction of an outdoor play shed for the above named school. Construction of this shed would be undertaken as a manual training project. This project appears to be very practical.\n\nFor a considerable portion of the school term the weather at Port Simpson is very wet and from the standpoint of the health of the pupils it would appear that this project would serve a very useful purpose. I might add that Inspector Davey informs me that a number of Provincial schools in the Prince Rupert area have equipped their schools with similar play facilities.\n\nI would recommend that approval be given for the purchase of this material.\n\nW.S.

Attached please find copy of letter from the Principal, Mr. Flowers, in this connection. A bid on additional manual tools will be forwarded shortly. It would appear that Mr. Flowers is taking hold of this school in a practical way and as the work is to be done by the boys, purchase of the material is recommended.\n\nThe Department's instructions will be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF.

Devey, on his inspection of the Fort Simpson Indian Day School on 9th February, 1949. Original on File 837-6.\n\nGENERAL\n\nThe enrolment at this school has now reached the point where consideration should be given to the establishment of a third room. The small building at the back of the school presently used for manual training could be used for this purpose by the installation of an oil heater, blackboards and desks. This would be a temporary measure only until proper facilities could be provided. The living quarters readily lend themselves to adaptation to accommodate an extra teacher without overcrowding.\n\nConsiderable difficulty is experienced in heating this school. The present plant is a hot air system fired by coal. I believe that the Superintendent has had an experienced man examine the furnace but I am not familiar with his report. It would however seem that the blocking off of the openings between the rafters where the roof overhangs, the exterior walls would be helpful, particularly if the ceilings of the classrooms were insulated at the same time. It was also noted that the hot air conduits are not insulated in the usual manner by covering with asbestos. On each of my three visits to this school teachers have complained about the difficulty of heating all the rooms satisfactorily, and repairs amounting to twenty-five dollars were carried out on the furnace. It was apparently hoped that this work would provide the necessary adjustment to properly heat the school. This has not been accomplished. I suggest that a competent authority be sent to the school to determine the heating requirements.\n| DATE | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Mar. | To purchase of one only oil space heater                               |        |\n|      | for the Port Simpson Indian Day School as                              |        |\n|      | attached invoice of February 26, 1949                                  | $125.00|\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

This item will have to come off the clearing of the playground as a great deal of this work has been done by the boys this winter on a free labor basis with Mr. Flowers.

I would recommend that the Department make funds available for this work and that an accountable advance of $50 be forwarded to Mr. Anfield to cover labour costs.\n\nW. S.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 6th instant enclosing letters from Indian Superintendent Anfield with reference to the construction of a loading platform at the Port Simpson Indian Day School.\n\nWe have reviewed Mr. Anfield's letters but we fail to see the necessity for expending an estimated amount of $230.00 to provide a loading platform. Presumably it has been found possible to unload the coal in years gone by without a loading platform. We are inclined to feel that it is more important to provide a proper playground than to spend the money to erect a platform that would be used only occasionally, as I presume the coal only reaches the school once a year.\n\nPP, ST\n\nBernard F.

Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nJuly 11th, 1949.\n\nW. S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B. C., Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nRe: Port Simpson Indian Day School - Your file 12-11-3.\n\nWe are going to have difficulty heating the upstairs of this teacherage in any case. I was planning to utilize the fresh air vent that goes out through the ceiling of the upstairs and install through an aperture in the wall an oil burner. This would make the upstairs of this teacherage quite comfortable.\n\nWith regard to the store-room downstairs, this would make a useful bedroom provided we had accommodation for the large amount of school material presently stored therein. This could be taken care of by putting a partition in the annex and making a store-room therein.\n\nI am satisfied that Miss Findlay would adjust to conditions at the Nursing Station if she were appointed senior teacher at the school. The other two teachers would be quite comfortable in the teacherage if an oil burner were installed upstairs.\n\nThis action is recommended. The oil heater will cost $125.00 installed and $25.00 should take care of labour for cutting the partition and installing same. Your instructions with regard to this matter will be appreciated so that the work may be completed during the summer, if possible.\n\nF.

E. COLLISON, PRINCE RUPERT, B. C., On PORT SIMPSON INDIAN DAY SCHOOL, for month of FEBRUARY, 1933.\n\nOriginal on 168-2-7.\n\nThe question of suitable accommodation for the teachers in this village is now a problem, as there are so few white families prepared to take in teachers. A small cottage on the reserve, close to the school, may be rented at $10.00 per month, which would provide good accommodation for both teachers. It would require, however, a small outlay to furnish the place and have the rooms kalscrined. This would be necessary, as previous occupants were Indians. I would urge that this be done as present conditions under which the teachers are boarding are not at all satisfactory and may lead to undesirable complications. The girls are young and I feel that the Department is responsible in a case of this kind.\nAccounts to be paid by the 10th of each month\n\nPRINCE RUPERT, B.C., Sept. 3, 1931\n\nM.

Also, two large cracks have developed and will require filling. The approximate cost of the materials will be $2.50. The cost for the labor on this job, including repairs to desks in the school room and fastening storm windows will be approximately $8.00.\n\nI recommend that the above work be authorized.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.

It has been pointed out that the present mattresses on the two beds will require renewal as they are very thin and do not give sufficient warmth during the cold weather. These will cost about $15.00 each, but the supply could be held over if the Department wishes until later in the year. However, the blankets, etc., should be provided as soon as possible if funds are available for this purpose.\n\nFor D.M.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nApplication is made for the purchase of a new kitchen range for the teacherage at Port Simpson Indian Day School. The present range is burned through to the oven and is so badly warped as to be of no further use. It was installed when the school was built and as it was a very inexpensive type it has given fair service. The teachers have complained about it ever since I took over the Agency and if we are to get satisfied teachers, there will have to be a proper range put in.\n\nAttached please find bid from the Hudson Bay Company, Port Simpson for a \"Royal Crest\" range at a price of $115.00 delivered and installed in the teacherage.\n\nThe purchase is recommended on this basis as it is almost impossible to get satisfactory labour at Port Simpson to install a range properly.\n\nThe Department's instructions will be appreciated. There is a range available at the Hudson Bay Company and I have asked the Manager to keep it to our order pending instructions.\n\nF.

The original \"parsonage\" is the old building opposite the Crosby Home. The Department would be well advised to keep out of this building. It is a huge ramshackle affair which will cost a fortune to heat and a large sum of money to put into any sort of shape. Under no circumstances could it be considered suitable for a teacherage.\n\nI am, however, negotiating with the United Church for a price on this building with a view to taking it over as a possible residence for an Indian family of 14 people whose present quarters have been condemned by the Health authorities.\n\nF.

Anfield's letter of July 11th with regard to accommodation for the teachers at the above-mentioned school, a copy of which I forwarded you on July 20th, he suggested that two of the teachers could be accommodated in the teacherage and the third at the nursing station. It subsequently developed, however, that due to conditions beyond our control at the nursing station no accommodation would be available for one of the teachers and consequently it has been necessary to make quite extensive changes to the teacherage and it will also be necessary to provide additional furnishings.\n\nThe expenditures contemplated are as follows:\n\n(1) Materials for changes to the teacherage $145.00\n(2) Labour \" \" \" \" 150.00\n(3) Purchase of kitchen & other equipment 73.29\n(4) Purchase of furnishings 250.00\n(5) Purchase & installation of oil heater 140.00\n\nThis item has already been approved reference Mr. Neary's letter of July 26th.\n\nAlthough I regret having to confront the Department with these expenditures, in the absence of any accommodation for the teachers at the nursing station there would appear to be no alternative and I would ask you to please advise as soon as possible if they are approved.\n\nW.

McKay, Indian Commissioner, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter 215-4976 of the 18th inst., I have to say that I gave the Pacific Coast Militia Rangers permission to store their guns in the manual training building and they held an occasional evening instruction class. The key of the building was held by Miss Currie. Neither Miss Currie nor Miss Hill were the type to give the boys any instructions in carpenter work. We tried to secure the services of an Indian, but, any who were capable of teaching, were employed with other work.\n\nJ. Gillett\nIndian Agent.\n\nJG/MD\nJune 29, 1943.\n\nJ. Gillett, Esq., Indian Agent, Prince Rupert, B.C.\n\nReplying to your letter of the 23rd instant in which you state that the Pacific Coast Militia Rangers have your permission to store their guns in the manual training building at the Day School and use this room for occasional evening instruction classes, I would advise that I was under the impression that the P.C.M.R. kept their rifles in their homes ready for immediate use in case of an emergency.\n\nIn my opinion, the Community Hall would be preferable to the school for drills, etc., of this unit and the manual training room left available for the purpose for which it was intended. Every effort should be made to see that the children are given some vocational training as recommended by the Inspector of Schools.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 18th instant regarding the Inspector's report covering the Port Simpson Indian Day School, I would advise that I took up with Mr. Indian Agent Gillett the question of use of the manual training room by a local organization and the lack of vocational instruction. In this connection, I enclose herewith his reply of the 23rd instant, and a copy of my letter of today's date addressed to him advising that the Indian Community Hall at Port Simpson would be the preferable place in which to hold instructional classes for the Pacific Coast Militia Rangers. This is a large building and should give them much more room for drills, etc. It is hoped that one of the new teachers to be appointed to this school may be able to give some instruction in vocational training.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nKT\nEncls.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nI beg to forward herewith a copy of a letter received from Mr. Indian Agent Gillett making application for authority to employ Peter Wells, an Indian carpenter of the Port Simpson Band, to teach the boys of the Port Simpson Indian Day School carpentry. It will be observed that instruction is to be given for two hours a week at the rate of $1.00 per hour.\n\nThis would appear to be a good opportunity to have some instruction in manual training given to the Port Simpson school boys and I have no hesitation in recommending that same be approved. It seems to me, however, that the period of only two hours a week is altogether too short, especially in view of the number of boys available for instruction, and that 2 two hour periods per week would be little enough. If the Department approves, it will be necessary to purchase some lumber, nails and other materials for instructional purposes for which an amount of approximately $40.00 will be required. The Department's decision in this matter by air mail would be appreciated.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nDec. 24th, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M. Mackay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRE: Manual Training at Port Simpson School.\n\nPeter Wells, an Indian of Port Simpson, is willing to teach the boys carpentry at the Port Simpson Indian Day school for four months, January, February, March and April.\n\nHe is a good carpenter, having received his training at Coqualeetza, and is employed by the canneries during the summer for repair work to buildings and boats. He has built a number of houses for various Indians at Port Simpson. He would be willing to give instructions to the 24 boys for 2 separate hours in each week at $1.00 per hour. I recommend that he be engaged.\n\nThe material required is listed on Form 37 enclosed. We cannot secure the lumber in Prince Rupert. I would suggest, therefore, if the Department approves of the above being carried out, that all the material be purchased in Vancouver and shipped to Port Simpson by the U.S.S. \"Catala\" which leaves Vancouver every Friday.\n\nIf the Department has any designs for manual training work, I would appreciate having a sample.\n\nJ.G.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 3, 1944.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, suggesting the appointment of Peter Wells to teach carpentry to the boys at the Port Simpson Indian Day School. In view of the comparatively small number of boys who will probably benefit from this training the Department feels that Wells should only be employed for two hours a week at the rate of $1.00 an hour. This arrangement should continue for the months of January, February and March and at the end of that time the work done should be reviewed and, if it is still your opinion that we should engage him for a longer period each week, we will be prepared to give favourable consideration to any recommendation you make.\n\nAuthority is also granted for the purchase of lumber, nails and other material for instructional purposes at an approximate cost of $40.00.\n\nR.A.

The teacher, the Rev. Father A. Godfrey informed me that his mission work had grown so, and extended so far from the Indian village, that he was often called away for days at a time. On that account he was compelled to give up the day school. He said the children attended well, and he regretted having to close it. He hopes to get an assistant, if he does, he will then re-open the school.\n\nThe children gathered around me thinking I had come to open the school, and manifested their wish to have the school open. A number of children had made good progress during the time they had the advantage of attending, and some could speak English fairly well.\n\nI have the honor to remain\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector.\nOttawa, May 13, 1913.\n\nRev.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant in further reference to the opening of temporary day schools at Babine, Stuart's Lake and Hagwelget.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that if there are temporary buildings available at Babine and Stuart's Lake the Department is prepared to make a grant for the teachers' salaries and also to supply the necessary school material. However, the salary mentioned by you, $100.00 a month, is more than the Department pays at any point in British Columbia. As to the salaries, much would depend upon the qualifications. Presumably it would be almost impossible to get teachers with proper professional qualifications for these inland districts, but it may be possible for you to nominate teachers, who, if they have not the professional qualifications, may nevertheless be competent to conduct the work at these day schools.\n\nWith regard to Hagwelget, a school was conducted at Roche Deboule, but was closed sometime ago owing to the fact that the Rev. Father Godfrey's time was so taken up with his mission work that he found it impossible to give any attention to the day school. Father Godfrey informed the Inspector that he hoped to obtain an assistant and Mr. Green was then advised that in this event the Department would\n\nRev. N. V.

Father Godfrey in reference to the salary paid the day school teacher at Hagwilget.\n\nThe salary of $400.00, which was agreed upon when the school was first opened a couple of years ago, was looked upon more as a grant to Father Godfrey, who was performing the school work in addition to his clerical duties, than a salary. Now that he has secured a person who has qualifications and whose whole service will be given to the school work I am quite prepared to meet his wish respecting the salary, and the new teacher will be paid at the rate of $750.00, which is the salary allowed the other teacher to whom Mr. Godfrey refers, namely, Mr. Morrissey at Babine.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nH. S. Clements, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ont.\nHouse of Commons\nOTTAWA April 27/14.\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nMy dear Scott:\n\nI enclose you a letter from Father A. Godfrey, who has charge of the Hagwilget Indians, within a mile or two of New Hazelton. This is a point that I have urged for some school, denominational, or otherwise, to be erected, as it is practically midway between all the banded Indians between Prince Rupert and Fort Fraser, and with the convenience of getting to school by both ends of the Railway, I know of no point which has such good arguments in its favor, as the above-mentioned.\n\nPersonally, I think the school would be of great benefit to the Indians there, who apparently have no school of any consequence. The Indians of the total district are industrious, and have made their living in the past, by packing, freight etc., through the different districts. Now, with the railway completed, it will mean that their vast livelihood will be in a great measure cut out, and I have always felt that it was your Department's duty to give them a better system of education.\n\nHowever, you will note that Father Godfrey is asking for a reasonable salary for the teacher, and I certainly think this ought to be granted. It is a well-known fact that all laborers in the country get from $3 to $4 a day. I trust that you will give this your very best consideration and approval of some assistance along the lines I suggested. Father Godfrey, I know personally, has and is devoting a great deal of time and energy towards the different tribes of the district, and is well deserving of any assistance you can give him.\n\nTruly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6408, file 838-1, part 1)\nNew Westminster BC\nApril 2/14\n\nThe Hon. H. Clements, M.P.\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs the Dominion Government, notwithstanding your efforts, has not seen itself in condition to grant a school for the Indians of the Hagiyet-Shinl tribe, I have made arrangements for with the local Indian Agent for a day school for the nation at Hagiyet. I did this upon request of the department for Indian Affairs. I have secured the services of a former teacher, in this country (England) who is a very competent and devoted man. This gentleman Mr. J. Browning is a married man and has got one girl about 9 years old. Mrs. Browning takes an active part\nin the school work looking mostly after\nthe girls and the little boys! They are both\nvery much devoted to their tasks and\nI dare say I could not have secured the\nservices of better people.\n\nUnfortunately there comes now the\nquestion of a salary or at least of a\nsubstantial assistance from the Department\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nThe promising a substantial assistance\nto the local Ondine Agent (forgetting his\nformer promise) said the department would\nonly give $100 a year! This, if it is true,\nis very sad. Just think of a married\nman, a very competent man having to live\non $400 a year! A local chaplain gets\n$600 a year, at Smithers; $750 a year!\nA farmhand gets from $350 to $500 a day\nand more. Miners at New Rossington get\n$350 and more.\n\nMrs. Morrissey, school teacher at\nBabine Indian day school gets $75 per month which is not very much in view of the distance from the Railroad but it is a lot more than $33 per month assigned to the teacher at Hagwilget.\n\nNow dear Sir; I am confident that you are aware of the condition of things in your constituency; I trust likewise that the government does not intend to defeat its own purpose in establishing day schools \u2014 and in consequence I trust that they will give the local teacher an allowance of $75 per month.\n\nHoping you will settle these difficulties to satisfaction I remain\n\nYour respectfully,\n\nJohn A. Godfrey\nRevelstoke, B.C.\nOttawa, May 4, 1914.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Department will pay the new teacher of the Hagwilget School a salary at the rate of $750.00 per year from the first of April, last. It is understood by the Department that the teacher whom you have secured for this school has qualifications and that his whole services will be given to the school work at this place.

Loring, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nDear Sir,\n\nOn Jan 9th 1914 I was appointed as a permanent school teacher at the above mentioned school, commencing my duties on that date, at the salary of $750 per annum; but on receiving my first salary cheque for the first quarter which ended March 31st 1914 and which did not come to hand until May 12th 1914 I only received $100.00 for that term, which is at the rate of $400.00 per annum (the rate previously paid to the Revd Father Godfrey as a remuneration for part time services rendered in teaching the children at the school sometime previous to my appointment) he did not give the whole of his time to the school, as a teacher would do when permanently employed, hence the small remuneration he received.\n\nI wrote to Mr R B Loring, Indian Agent, Babine Agency, Hazelton B.C. relative to the deficiency in my salary on May 12th 1914, but he replied stating that he...\ndid not have any authority then to pay me more,\nI also called on him personally about the same\ntime, and he then declared that in all probability\nit would be forthcoming very soon. I also wrote\nto him about Dec 15th 1914, but did not receive a reply\nthen again on April 26th 1915, receiving a reply to\nthe effect, that it was a fallacy on my part ever\nto expect it, although he promised to the Indian\nDept, relative to my application for redress.\nNow sir, I think you will favorably consider my\nletter, and I know you would do me justice in\nforwarding my arrears of salary, which would be\nof great service to me, and taking into consideration\ntoo, that the cost of living in this northern portion\nof B.C. is very high, that I have a wife and child\nto maintain, and I do not want to run into debt,\nbut on the other hand, to be strictly honourable in\nall my dealings with everybody, I look to you for\nredress in this my application for the balance of\nmy salary for the quarter ended March 31st 1914.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours obediently\n\nSydney Browning\n\nTeacher.\nRocks Debonle\nIndian Day School\nOttawa, June 14, 1915.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, in which you request that your salary as teacher of the Roche Deboile Indian Day School be paid monthly instead of quarterly, in future.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the salaries of all day school teachers are only paid quarterly, upon receipt of the usual return of attendance at the end of each quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nSydney Browning, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nRoche Deboile Indian Day School,\nNew Hazelton, B.

Godfrey, O.M.I., and Mr. Agent Loring were informed by official letter of May 4, 1914, that a salary at the rate of $750.00 per year would be paid for your services from the first of April, 1914 and your salary has been paid at that rate from that date. As you began duties at this school, according to the information received by the Department on January 9, 1914, salary was only paid you for the March quarter of that year at the rate of $400.00, the same as was paid the previous teacher. The Department has decided to allow you salary at the rate of $750.00 from the date on which you began duties at this school and is therefore, enclosing herewith a cheque for $27.50, the balance of salary due for the quarter ended March 31, 1914, at the increased rate.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

I am glad to inform you that the girls take great interest in their needlework.\n\nIf anything could be done to show your appreciation of their work, such as awarding them with prizes, (e.g., a nice reading book) it would be appreciated by them as well as myself.\n\nI am your respectfully,\nS.

Your husband receives a salary of $900.00 per annum as teacher and $150.00 as bonus. This makes a combined salary of $1,220.00 paid yourself and husband.\n\nI would point out that the enrolment at this school is about 26 pupils, and the Department would not be warranted in paying any increase in salary for this school. No further increase can be allowed you at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nMrs. Sydney Browning,\nBox 28,\nNew Hazelton,\nB. C.\nRegarding my salary of $120.00 per annum as Assistant Teacher and Matron, it is not so much as that which has been paid to others performing similar duties elsewhere, e.g., the former Matron at St. James received $300.00 per annum and she did not perform any more work than I also. The $120.00 per annum is paid to me from part of the total vote of $420.00 per annum allowed to heads of households who are receiving less than $200.00 per annum, namely, my husband for example, and which was confirmed by Act of Parliament and operative as from April 1st, 1918.\n\nI most respectfully wish to remind you that I did not receive any remuneration for performing those duties until up to that time practically four years altogether (1914 to 1918). Therefore I feel I am fairly entitled to $30.00 per annum.\n\nDo you not think so? I do.\nYour thorough and earnest investigation into the items contained in this letter would be greatly appreciated, also being any anomalies they also may be removed and matters adjusted.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nOttawa.\nMarch 20th, 1921.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI received the samples of needlework by the girls of the Roche Deboule school and was very much pleased with them. I wish to extend to yourself and to the girls my appreciation of their work and to express the hope that they will continue to try to perfect themselves in this very useful branch of domestic science. I am returning the samples as I thought that the girls would like to retain the products of their handiwork.\n\nIn the near future I shall be pleased to send some books as suggested by you, to be distributed as rewards among the pupils for proficiency, good conduct and regular attendance, as you may see fit.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nS. H. Browning, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nRoche Deboule Indian School,\nNew Hazelton, B. C.\nDear Sir,\n\nI very much regret that I feel compelled to write you regarding the non-receipt of my salary & bonds cheques for the quarter ended June 30th 1921.\n\nI wish to respectfully inform you that I sent in my school report for that quarter on July 1st last to Mr. Edgar Hyde, Indian Agent, Hazelton, B.C.\n\nI wish to point out that it has been the custom for me to use 2 forms when it has been found necessary; No. 1 form for the boys, & No. 2 form for the girls, adding up the totals of No. 1 form & carrying them forward to No. 2 form, filling up the \"remark\" column, making up the final totals, also giving a record of\nSchool materials, Government property, etc., signing my name in the allotted spaces on No. 2 form then clipping the forms together by a patent clip securely, all this according to instructions furnished me by Mr. R.E. Loring, formerly Indian Agent at Hazelton B.C., witnessed by him now.\n\nOn Tuesday evening July 26th Mr. Hyde (Indian Agent) much to my surprise called on me bringing No. 1 School report form for me to sign (which I did at his request) although I felt sure that such an operation did not pertain before, I pointed out to him at the time that such an action would cause confusion at Ottawa, as he had already sent No. 2 form to a voucher to your Dept. which he stated was sent from here on July 10th that my cheques should have been here now (ie. July 26th) but now Aug. 13th.\n\nThe fact of the whole matter is this\u2014Mr. Hyde must have detached the 2 report forms sending on No. 2 form with voucher, leaving No. 1 form laying around his office for \"25 days\" at least before finding out his mistake and unfortunately trying to lay the blame on me. This I do not accept as this is why I am writing to you to protest.\nmyself from all such accusations & incumbrances.\n\nI have been in the service of your Dept. for nearly 8 years & many reports have been made out by me during that time & not one error has ever been made in any of them.\n\nFurthermore, when Mr. Hyde assumed office here as Indian Agent, one of my first things was to render him all the assistance I could in giving him information regarding the Indians located in Hagwilget Reserve, quite recently furnishing him with all the names of the old Indians & when compiling his Census returns, therefore I think respect is due tome, the value of information given by those who have been in the service of your Dept. for so many years should be appreciated, recognised by him. It would save him a vast amount of time & trouble, especially when it comes to fixing school reports etc.\n\nHaving been brought up business myself, I expect things done in a business-like manner.\n\nThe forwarding of my salary & bonus cheques for quarter ended June 30th, by you as soon as possible would be appreciated. I trust that in future they may be received.\nmuch earlier than what has pertained heretofore. It would indeed be a welcome change. Would it not be possible for your Indian Agent here to be instructed to forward all school reports from here within a week dating from the end of each quarter? No school teacher delays their reports not one hour more than is absolutely necessary, any information to the contrary is pure fiction.\n\nI think this letter explains the whole position.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSydney Browning.\n\nTeacher\n\nH.B. Indian Day School\nOttawa, Sept. 26, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. Sydney Browning, Teacher of the Roche Debois Indian Day School, complaining regarding our failure to grant his requisitions for biscuits for the noon-day meal to the Indian pupils.

If you are in need of biscuits at this time, you would do well to requisition, through Mr. Agent Hyde, for the quantity needed. We expect our teachers to exercise economy in this connection, as it is not our wish to develop indigent Indians. I also hope that you will endeavour to establish more cordial relations with our representative in the field, to whom you are responsible for the conduct of the Indian school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Sup't General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe the undersigned very much regret that we feel it necessary (in order to protect our good name & honor) to write to you calling your kind attention to an inference or rather an innuendo contained in a letter received from Mr. E. Hyde, Indian Agent, Hazelton, B.C. (Babine Agency) dated the 9th ultimo, it reads as follows:\n\n\"I have been instructed by the Department to inform you that it considers you have issued during the past year too many biscuits and, consequently, they are not prepared to authorize the purchase of any more biscuits at the present time.\"\n\nP.H.O.\nAs we keep a record of all goods so ordered and supplied to the above-mentioned school, we wish to state that 18 boxes of Pilot Bread were received by us during the fiscal year 1921-22, they were ordered and received, respectively, on the following dates, to wit:\n\nOrdered March 31st/21 \u2014\u2014 received May 12th/21 \u2014\u2014 6 boxes\n\" June 30th/21 \u2014\u2014 (Received in two lots) Sept 25th/21 \u2014\u2014 3 boxes\n\" Dec 31st/21 \u2014\u2014 received Jan 7th/22 \u2014\u2014 6 boxes\n\nTotal: 18 boxes\n\nNo biscuits or goods of any kind being ordered at the end of Sept quarter 1921.\n\nHowever, there were 3 boxes of Pilot Bread on hand at the end of March quarter 1921, 2 boxes of that number were in a very broken & mildewed condition. This fact was brought to the notice of your Indian Agent Mr. H. H. but unfortunately he appears to be hot headed & inconsistent & does not seem to appreciate the veracity of our statement & is somewhat lacking in respect. We feel however that your Department must\nbe labouring under a misapprehension or have been misinformed as to the actual quantity of biscuits supplied to this school, we wish to state at once that we perform our duties conscientiously, and this is the reason why we are writing this letter as we do not wish our good name and honour maligned by anyone. We have justifiable reasons for mentioning this fact.\n\nDuring the period herein mentioned the average attendance of pupils at school were 17.46; the number of days school was open, 200; the number of biscuits per box $2.40 (20 doz); the maximum price per box $4.00 working out at the rate of about 1/4 biscuits or 2 cents per child, per school day.\n\nAlthough your Dept. kindly allows the sum of $1.50 per child per month for provisions in connection with mid-day meals it cost your Dept. about $147.00 per year including supply of biscuits, made up as follows:\n\n10 months supplies for mid-day meals at $1.50 per month $75.00\n18 boxes Pilot Bread (maximum price) $4.00 per box $72.00\n\nTotal $147.00\nWe do not think that any reasonable person knowing the circumstances, the miserable conditions prevailing among the children in this Hagwilget P. R. (for who should know better than the priest & teacher, for are we not with them practically all the time?), would call the quantity of biscuits supplied as being \"too many,\" including the soup it cost you, Dept on the average about 4\u00bd cents per child, per school day.\n\nWe sincerely trust however that your Dept will still grant the allowance of biscuits as formerly, for the sake of the poor little Indians, some of whom are not only underfed but are badly clad. We very much appreciate what has been done for them in the past & trust that assistance will be rendered them in the future.\n\nWe are,\n\nYours most respectfully,\n\nSydney Browning\nTeacher\n\n(Signed) J.

She is also in receipt of salary at the rate of $60 per annum for her services as janitress. In view of the Inspector's recommendation, we have decided to grant Mrs. Browning an increase of $20 in her salary as assistant teacher. This will make her salary from the 1st of October, last, at the rate of $14 per month for the ten teaching months in the year.\n\nIt will not, in future, be necessary for you to prepare a separate voucher for Mrs. Browning's salary as assistant teacher. This voucher will be prepared in the Department and a cheque will be sent her at the same time as salary is being paid to Mr. Browning, the teacher. You should, however, prepare and forward a voucher for the amount due her at the end of each quarter for her services as janitress.\n\nPlease inform Mrs. Browning of the increase at the rate of $20 per annum allowed her in her salary as assistant teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

They learn to knit and to do needlework. This work is well done. The school won a $10 prize at the Kamloops Fair. Mrs. Browning has been in charge of this work. The Department pays her a yearly salary of $140.00. I am asked by Mrs. Browning if it would be possible for her to have an increase in salary. I told her that I could not recommend that, as there was not much money available for the schools.// I am not certain that I can recommend the retention of the services of Mrs. Browning in the school. These teachers have been in the school for very many years. I do not think that a person suffering from the nervous twitchings and jerkings so pronounced as in the case of Mrs. Browning is a fit person to be in a school with young children. Mr. Browning's control of the children is very weak. He seems to have little idea of control of children and to rely on going around amongst them with a ruler or stick to urge them on to greater effort. In place of asking the Department to terminate the engagement of these teachers at the end of the school year, I most strongly urge that the Department will let them know that I am not satisfied with either the work of the children or their methods of control. I hope that the Department will instruct the Indian Agent to visit the school often during the remainder of the school year and to report if there has been much improvement as a result of my inspection.\nOttawa, July 21, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter regarding the samples of needlework performed by the Indian girls attending the Rocher Deboule Indian Day School. The Department is pleased to note that the girls in this school are continuing good work in the making of garments under the charge of Mrs. Browning. Please inform the pupils that the Department is pleased with the work they performed in the sewing, etc.\n\nThe needlework is being returned to you under separate cover, and should be given to the girls who did the work in each case. Owing to the possibility of loss of these articles in transit, it is considered that in future years it will not be necessary to forward these samples to the Department and they should be given to the pupils who do the work after the school closed for the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Order in Council of July 31, 1935, with amendments of August and November of the same year, provides that all employees reaching 65 years of age should be retired.\n\nAs you may be aware, Mr. Browning was appointed teacher of this school on January 8, 1914, and his wife, assistant teacher and matron, from April 1, 1919. While their services have been satisfactory, I would submit, for your consideration, in view of their age, the question of dispensing with their services at the end of the present academic year, June 30th next. Please inform the Department regarding the present circumstances of these teachers and state if you consider there would be any difficulty in obtaining the services of a married couple - the man to have professional qualifications and his wife to assist in the classroom work and the other duties performed by Mrs. Browning.\n\nIf the services of Mr. and Mrs. Browning are to be retained after the date mentioned above, it will be necessary to obtain an Order of His Excellency in Council to extend their engagement for a period of one year. In order to obtain same, it would be necessary to state definitely that their services are of such a nature that it would be difficult to replace them.\n\nI regret there are no pensions or superannuation provided for teachers in Indian day schools, and, should Mr. and Mrs. Browning retire, they would be entitled only to a gratuity of two months' salary.\n\nI would request that you consult Mr. and Mrs. Browning, point out the situation to them and advise the Department what action you would recommend be taken.

You should obtain and forward to the Department their formal resignation.\n\nIt is noted that Right Rev. Bishop Bunoz is prepared to nominate a man and his wife to replace Mr. and Mrs. Browning. You should inform the Department at the earliest possible date of the names of the persons nominated by Bishop Bunoz. You should also state the age of each and their experience and qualifications.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. C.

Father Godfrey, who acted as spokesman for Bishop Bunn, and he informed me that the necessary steps had been taken to appoint a new teacher and his wife to take over the Roche Deboule Indian Day School on September 1st, 1935. I have no hesitation in saying that a suitable teacher will be installed at this school.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Browning have been notified, with the regrets of the Department, that their services will cease on June 30th, 1935.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. C.

F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B. C.\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 9th with reference to the retirement of the above named teacher and assistant teacher of the Rocher Deboule Indian Day School, Taitsk.\n\nIn reply I wish to state that I interviewed Mr. and Mrs. Browning regarding your letter - in part - and they informed me that they were anticipating this action of the Department, knowing that both had about reached the age limit.\n\nRegarding the matter of installing a new teacher it would be impossible to obtain a qualified person locally. There is no suitable accommodation on the reserve, the house at present occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Browning being old and dilapidated - in fact it is little more than a shell.\n\nRegarding Mr. and Mrs. Browning, I have much pleasure in saying that their duties of teaching and social work on the Taitsk Reserve have been very satisfactory.\n\nIf it meets with the approval of the Department may I suggest that an Order of His Excellency in Council be obtained to extend the services of Mr. Browning for one more year. This would allow sufficient time to find a suitable teacher and possibly give the Church an opportunity of building a new residence. However, if it is agreeable to the Department I should like to take up the matter with Bishop Buncey and Father Godfrey, both of whom are expected in Hazelton toward the end of the present month.\n\nI would imagine that Mr. Browning is in fairly comfortable circumstances, the family having lived a very quiet life.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGCM/SM.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(Teitstok Reserve, No. 3A - Electoral District of Skeena), I would say that the former teacher, who had been employed at this school for 22 years, was given gradual increases until he received salary at the rate of $105 per teaching month.\n\nWhile this is the salary rating approved for this position, I would suggest that the new teacher who is to be appointed, as recommended in my memo above referred to, should be allowed salary only at the rate of $90 per teaching month. This is a rather isolated school, and the cost of transportation, etc., is high. This is the average salary rating provided for schools in British Columbia.\n\nI would therefore recommend that Mrs. James Macdonald, who has been nominated by His Lordship Bishop Bunoz, be appointed as teacher and that the salary allowed her be at the rate of $90 per teaching month.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nJuly 10, 1935.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,-\n\nMr. and Mrs. Sydney Browning, teacher and assistant teacher, respectively, of the Recher Debeule Indian Day School, Babine Agency, B.C. (Teitak Reserve, No. 3A - Electoral District of Skeena) have tendered their resignation as from June 30th, last. In this connection I would refer you to my memorandum dated March 29, 1936. I may add that they tendered their resignation, voluntarily.\n\nThis school is conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church, and His Lordship Bishop Bunes has nominated the services of Mrs. James Macdonald, of Smithers, B.C., as teacher. This lady is a certified teacher of the province of Quebec and has taught for several years. She is also a qualified nurse and is a holder of three post-graduate diplomas.\n\nThe salary allowed the senior teacher at this school is $105 per teaching month. It is not intended to fill the position of assistant teacher, as it is considered that the work at the school can be satisfactorily carried on under one teacher.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your concurrence in the appointment of Mrs. Macdonald.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of June 7th regarding the appointment of a teacher to the Rocher Deboule Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I wish to state that, although Mrs. James Macdonald has no qualifications as a teacher in British Columbia, she has done considerable teaching, privately, in this province, and, as there have been no objections raised by the B.C. Teachers' Association in the past, I do not anticipate any in this case.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Macdonald, this gentleman, who is a returned soldier and suffers from some war disability, is at times given work by the Fisheries Department in this area. He undoubtedly would want to reside with Mrs. Macdonald, should she be appointed, and could do the janitor work at the school.\n\nAs this is a small school the salary that was given to Mrs. Sydney Browning is not necessary in a new appointment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6408, file 838-1, part 1)\nOttawa, June 7, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo, regarding the nomination, by His Lordship Right Reverend E. M. Buncos, of Mrs. James Macdonald, Smithers, B.C., as teacher of the Recher Deboule Indian Day School, and also forwarding the resignation of Mr. and Mrs. Sydney Browning, to take effect on the 30th instant.\n\nThe resignation of Mr. and Mrs. Browning is accepted from the date mentioned.\n\nRegarding Mrs. Macdonald, it is noted that she has Quebec qualifications and also that her husband is living. Do you consider there would be any objection from the British Columbia Teachers' Association in engaging a teacher who has not B. C. qualifications. Please state, also, if it would be necessary that Mr. Macdonald live on the reserve with his wife if she is appointed teacher, and, if so, what duties he would perform. The Department is not favourably disposed to the appointment of a married woman as teacher when her husband has to reside on the reserve, with no special duties. If Mrs. Macdonald is appointed, the Department understands that the services of only one employee would be required, viz.: the teacher, and that the salary provided in the case of Mrs. Browning could be dropped.\n\nWhen the Department receives further information, as requested, consideration will be given to the appointment of Mrs. Macdonald.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHAZELTON, B. C.\nRe - New Teacher for the Roche Deboile Indian Day School\n\nIn reply to your letter dated May 10th 1935, I beg to report that the Right Rev. Bishop Bunoz has recommended and nominated a lady named Mrs James Macdonald of Smithers B.C., as teacher of the above Roche Deboile School. I interviewed this lady who is at present giving private tuition to several children at Smithers.\n\nMrs Macdonald is in possession of the following qualifications; a certified teacher of the Province of Quebec in both English and French, and has taught school for several years. Mrs Macdonald is also a qualified nurse having graduated in St Luke Hospital Ottawa, and is the holder of three Post-graduate Diplomas.\n\nMrs Macdonald is 50 years of age, married, her husband James Macdonald having served four years with Canadian Forces in France, he now suffers from ill-health, but has no pension. From enquiries and observations I am fully of opinion that Mrs Macdonald with her teaching and nursing experience would make a very suitable teacher for the Roche Beboile Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.B.

This meeting was held on September 14th and the\nfollowing is a report taken from notes by Mr. Mallinson, clerk\nof this Agency.\n\nThree of the leading Tsitak Indians spoke asking that\nMr. Browning be re-appointed as teacher of the Rochar Deboule\nSchool, giving as their reasons the good work Mr. Browning had\ndone for their children; for his help to the destitute; for his\ncounsel and advice to all; for his church work and for his\nsocial work generally. They stated he had been teacher of the\nschool for over twenty years and that he had done very good work.\nThey also stated they were very glad to meet Inspector Barry.\n\nInspector Barry, in his reply, stated that he was glad\nto meet the Indians of Tsitak and had carefully noted what had\nbeen said with regard to Mr. Browning and the good work he had\ndone both at the school and in the village. He informed the\nmeeting that Mr. Browning had resigned as teacher of the Rochar\nDeboule Indian Day School and that the Indian Department had\naccepted his resignation. He mentioned that the Indian\nDepartment, like all other departments of the Dominion Government,\nhad a rule that all members must retire from duty on reaching the\nage of 65 and that Mr. Browning had already reached that age.\nConsequently his term of office was at an end and that his place\nmust be filled by some other person. He stated that the Roman\nCatholic Church had put forward the name of the new teacher, Mrs.\nMacdonald, and that the Indian Department had approved of this\nchoice and appointed Mrs. Macdonald as teacher of the Rochar\nDeboule Indian Day School. He mentioned that he had given\nabout four hours to Mrs. Macdonald, instructing her in the methods\nof teaching as set forth by the Department of Indian Affairs, and\nhe was sure this lady would do her best to make the school studies\ninteresting and do everything possible for her pupils. He hoped\nthe Indians of Tsitak would help Mrs. Macdonald in every way and\ngive her a chance to make good. He also stated that the new\nteacher had only recently come to the reserve and that she could\nnot possibly do, at once, all that Mr. Browning did after twenty\nyears' experience with the Indians of the Tsitak Reserve. He\nasked the Indians to give Mrs. her time - probably several months -\nand their constant help and he was sure that Mrs. Macdonald would\nbe very much liked and loved by all on the Tsitak Reserve. He\nstated that Mrs. Macdonald, besides being an experienced teacher,\nwas a trained nurse and would be of great help to all in time of\nsickness. Inspector Barry thanked the Indians for their kind\nattention.\n\nI am informed Inspector Barry called upon Mr. Browning\ndirectly he reached Hazelton at the latter's request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

General of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nRe: Sydney Browning, South Hazelton, Skeena, B.C.\n\nThis matter was brought to your attention last Session. I have not the file with me in connection with it but before leaving for the East received the following letter from Mr. Browning:\n\n\"Some time ago you promised that you would make another attempt to obtain more remuneration from the Indian Department, Ottawa, for Mrs. Browning and myself in recognition of our 21\u00bd years faithful services as teachers of the Rocher Deboule Indian Day School, Hagwilget I.R., near New Hazelton, B.C. I had written recently to His Lordship, Bishop Bunoz, O.M.I., Prince Rupert, B.C., and have received a reply from him that he was writing to the Indian Department, Ottawa, heartily supporting us in our further endeavour to obtain better remuneration and his letter (enclosed) is at your disposal, and probably be a means or help to you in support of our case, and we know you will do your best in this important matter, and we will fully appreciate whatever you may do for us.\"\n\nThe letter which Mr. Browning mentions and is signed by Bishop Bunoz reads as follows:\n\nIn.....\n\"In reply to your letter, I must say that I deeply sympathize with you on your grievance against the Indian Department for having allowed you a gratuity of only two months' salary after a devoted service of 21\u00bd years at the Indian School of Hegwelget. I am writing to the Department, praising your excellent work at the above-named school during the long period of 21\u00bd years and strongly recommending that a further allowance be granted you in recognition of your long and devoted services.\n\nI hope that my letter will strengthen the efforts of Mr. Hanson, M.P., and that you will obtain the desired further assistance.\"\n\nI would appreciate it if you would look into this matter again and see if there is anything which can be done to reimburse Mr. Browning to a greater extent for what he calls his \"long and faithful service.\"\n\nYours very truly,\n\nOlof Hanson, M.P.,\nSkeena Riding, B.C.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 26, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Hanson,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of January 19th written on behalf of Mr. Sydney Browning, of South Hazelton, B.C.\n\nMr. Browning's request for an additional retiring allowance on account of his long service with the Indian Department as Teacher, and that of his wife, has, as you know, been previously before the Department, and in December last, a communication in this regard was received from Right Reverend E.M. Bunoz, O.M.I., of Prince Rupert.\n\nIn this connection I regret to say that as previously stated, it is quite impossible to meet Mr. Browning's wishes. Like all Teachers of Indian Schools, Mr. and Mrs. Browning were classified as temporary employees. As such they did not contribute to the Civil Service Superannuation Fund, and are therefore ineligible to receive any benefits under the Civil Service Superannuation Act of 1924. On retirement they received the usual gratuity equivalent to two months' salary, and there is no authority under which the Department would be in a position to grant an additional retiring allowance.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\n\nOlof Hanson, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 22, 1944.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY.\n\nRe: Roche Deboile Indian Day School,\nNo. 838.\n\nThe Department has approved an increase in salary to Mrs. J.

Progress records should be brought up to date. Control good. An attempt has been made to group the children according to their mastery of past work. Pupils assist in classroom duties. Junior Red Cross. Good use is made of the library. Hot lunch programme during winter months.\n\nWork is planned and prepared, but could be better organized on a more systematic basis. Time for study has been stressed throughout the fundamental skills and the attainment of the appreciation and content subjects. Teaching is thorough but tends to underestimate the capacity for growth of the pupils. More attention should be paid to silent reading in the upper grades. The emphasis on rote spelling of unfamiliar words is not conducive to reading development. Content detail rather than general principles have been stressed in social studies. Individual attention has been given to the pupils. The Spirit of the Programme of Studies should be followed more closely than the organization of work on a purely text-book basis.\n\nIt is hard to estimate the progress of the pupils, as it is evident that the work of previous grades was not completed satisfactorily. The result has been an attempt to complete all the work of previous grades in each subject. Although the principle of learning no gaps in the mastery of necessary skills is good teaching practice care must be taken to ascertain exactly what those gaps are and to teach accordingly. In the Primary grades reading progress is good, although there is a tendency to word-calling which should be checked. The Grade IV group is below standard in reading comprehension. Grade V is reading well. Spelling progress is good and writing fair. There is a good grasp of arithmetic fundamentals. Grade VIII has done little work in mathematics at its own grade level. Pupils show a willingness to learn, but are not advancing rapidly enough to retain interest. It is not desirable to \"prove\" in writing every answer in arithmetic once the pupils know how to make a quick check.\n\nMrs. Chapman has conscientiously tried to teach each pupil at the level of mastery reached. Greater familiarity with modern teaching and testing techniques, and with the Programme of Studies would have saved a lot of time and brought quicker results.\n\nSigned. F.P.

Neary,\nSept. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, December 24, 1947.\n\nInspector's Report -\nRocher Deboule Indian Day School\n\nDear Bishop Jordan:\n\nDistrict School Inspector Davey visited the above Indian Day School on October 31. His Inspector's report on the teacher is quite unsatisfactory. On the teacher grading scale D (poor) is given for Personality, Management, Teaching Skill and Pupils' Progress. Under general comments Inspector Davey writes as follows:\n\n\"The work of this teacher is most unsatisfactory. There is little evidence of any progress since my last visit, and practically none of the recommendations made on that occasion have been implemented. Attendance at the school is most irregular and although the teacher is inclined to blame this on the indifference of the parents, it is felt that the chief reason lies in the methods and the personality of the teacher. It is apparently impossible to impress this teacher with the need to follow even the elementary principles. There is a complete lack of organization. No attempt is made to follow a time-table. The teacher was not even sure of the grades in which the pupils had been classified.\n\n\"The school building is a very old structure quite beyond repair, and in view of the proximity of the village to Hazelton, it is felt that when the new school at Hazelton is erected it would be advisable to transport\n\nMost Reverend A. Jordan, O.M.I., D.D.,\nVicar Apostolic of Prince Rupert,\nBox 776, Prince Rupert, B. C.\nthe few pupils to a combined school. This would be a distance of only some three miles. The cost of such a scheme would be far cheaper and the results much better than the operation of two separate schools.\"\n\nYou will recall that I wrote to you on July 15, 1947, concerning a similar proposal made last year. I would appreciate hearing from you with regard to future plans for the Rochele Leboule Indian Day School. Our records indicate that only nine children are now in attendance, with an average daily attendance of five.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nJanuary 15, 1948\n\nPersonal and Confidential\n\nDear Colonel Neary,\n\nIf you think that this letter is too straightforward for presentation to your superiors in the Department, I should be willing to amend it and delete, if desirable. Your recommendations would be much appreciated.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6408, file 838-1, part 1)\nJanuary 15, 1948\n\nDear Colonel Neary,\n\nThank you for your recent letter dealing with the subject of the Indian school children at Haqwilget Reserve.\n\nFrankly, I was hoping that some other solution than that of sending them to a non-denominational school would be found by your department. It might not be appropriate for me to go into the most serious reason for disliking such a solution, namely, the lack of Catholic environment, but it seems to me that, if an effort in this direction has not already been made, you might instruct your Agent at Hazelton to have the children sent for the rest of this year to Lejac School. If there were some way of taking care of them in Moricetown, they could be sent there as an alternative, to the day school. But I realize that it would be difficult at present to carry out such a plan.\n\nHaving thus expressed my view, and knowing that the situation is a difficult one, I shall say no more on this subject.\n\nHowever, I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to remark that the whole educational setup as it affects Catholic Indian children is sadly deficient. To seek to assess and apportion blame is a waste of time.\n\nThe problem is constantly on my mind and I would like to tell you what I think would help. If we could place teaching Sisters, say a minimum of two, on each reserve, along with a qualified nursing Sister, we would in five years bring about astonishing changes in education, family life and hygiene.\n\nI have been in touch with Irish nuns, all of whom are either trained...\nteachers or graduate nurses. Their whole work at present is in Northern Africa. When I invited them to come to Canada, the reply was that the acceptance of such an invitation would require a change in their Constitutions. Such a change would have to be made at a General Chapter which meets in May of this year. The Mother General and her Council would make no promises but expressed their willingness to consider the change.\n\nNow, Colonel Neary, if they accept my invitation, I should need the cooperation of your Department. I realize that unauthorized teachers cannot be placed on the Reserves. You will agree however that the advent of Sisters, say to Babine, where I should like them to be established, would be a boon to the Department. Moricetown, and Stony Creek (there are other places, too) could be taken care of in the same way in the course of time.\n\nThe Sisters have not accepted yet and there will be no answer for four months, but could you tell me if there would be any likelihood of the Department approving them, if two names of Sisters were presented as teachers next fall or in 1949? Let me add, that it is not my wish that any teachers now occupying posts, e.g., at Babine, be pushed out to make room for the Sisters. Mr. and Mrs. Berwick at Babine would like to leave there but would like to be sure that there are others to take their place. Naturally, I have not spoken to them of my plan, nor shall I, until I know the views of the Department and know for certain that the Sisters are coming.\n\nIf you say to me that I should have had the Department's opinion before approaching the Sisters, I shall agree entirely. Yet, I hope I am not amiss in presuming that the Department is favourable to any change that will make the Indians of this territory less a problem than they are and are likely to be for a long time.\n\nKind personal regards.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In his letter he states as follows:\n\n\"Frankly, I was hoping that some other solution than that of sending them to a non-denominational school would be found by your Department. It might not be appropriate for me to go into the most serious reason for disliking such a solution, namely, the lack of Catholic environment, but it seems to me that, if an effort in this direction has not already been made, you might instruct your Agent at Hazelton to have the children sent for the rest of this year to Lejac School. If there were some way of taking care of them in Moricetown, they could be sent there as an alternative, to the day school. But I realize that it would be difficult at present to carry out such a plan\".\n\nSize of School:\n\nTherefore, it would seem that a decision will now have to be reached as to whether a 2 or 4 room school would be required at Hazelton. We have plans on hand for both of these types of schools but do not have a 3 room school plan available. It will take some months to make such a plan and before proceeding with this step, I would appreciate hearing from you as to the exact size of school which will be required.\nIt is noted that Mr. Arthur Mowatt of the Hazelton Band has asked $400.00 an acre for a two acre proposed site. In view of the fact that this land will be used for a school site and for Indian Education, it is felt that this price is decidedly high.\n\nElsewhere Indians have allowed the Branch a reduced rate when they realized that the property was going to become a school site to provide better education for all the Indians on the Reserve. The Department feels that when we are providing everything for the education of these Indians, the least that can be expected of them is to provide property for a school site at a reduced rate. As you are only too well aware white property owners have done this when Provincial Schools are being built. Would you please, therefore, have Mr. Indian Agent Boys approach Mr. Mowatt with regard to the obtaining of a reduced rate for this land.\n\nI would also refer you to Inspector Davey's report of January 30, 1947 and attached map as prepared by Inspector Coleman. It would be appreciated if we could be advised as to whether there is access from the road, west of the Arthur Mowatt site into the proposed school. It is felt that the children from the bottom of the bench should be provided with access to the new school without having to go in a round about way.\n\nBernard F.

C.\n\nRocher Deboule Indian Day School.\n\nAt the time of discussing with Bishop Jordan the situation at Fort St. James we also discussed the re-opening of the Rocher Deboule School.\n\nThe Bishop made representations to the effect that we build a small school for these Catholic Indians and if proper teacher's accommodation were provided that we should be able to obtain the services of a good teacher. He appreciates the low calibre of these Indians and feels that a good teacher working among them could help greatly to improve their present conditions. He has asked that an amount for the erection of such a school be included in our 1950-51 estimates.\n\nBernard P. Mary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nYour file 838-1 (E)\nRe: Kochee Debcule Indian School\n\nI refer to Mr. Neary's letter of June 24th concerning the re-opening of the above mentioned school.\n\nIn February last, Inspector Davey had an opportunity of speaking to a Band meeting. He informed the Indians that an effort would be made to re-open the above mentioned school for the 1949-50 academic year and that if attendance, both in regularity and enrolment, was satisfactory an effort would be made to construct a new school on the reserve. It will be recalled that in the past we have had difficulty with regard to attendance and it is felt that the Indians should be made to realize that their cooperation is essential. With this in mind an item will be included in the 1950-51 estimates for a new school on this reserve.\n\nThe present building and teacherage are rented. The school building is in very poor condition. In fact it is one of the worst in this Province. The teacherage however is fairly satisfactory. However, it is considered advisable that when the new school is built provision should be made for a teacherage.\n\nW.S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nJuly 6, 1949.\n\nMost Reverend A. Jordan, O.M.I., D.D.,\nVicar Apostolic of Prince Rupert,\nBox 778,\nPrince Rupert, British Columbia.\n\nRocher Deboule Indian Day School.\n\nDear Bishop Jordan:\n\nYou will recall our conversation with the Director concerning the operation of this school. I wrote to Mr. Arneil and have now received a report from him reading in part as follows:\n\n\"In February last, Inspector Davey had an opportunity of speaking to a Band meeting. He informed the Indians that an effort would be made to re-open the above mentioned school for the 1949-50 academic year and that if attendance, both in regularity and enrolment, was satisfactory an effort would be made to construct a new school on the reserve. It will be recalled that in the past we have had difficulty with regard to attendance and it is felt that the Indians should be made to realize that their cooperation is essential. With this in mind an item will be included in the 1950-51 estimates for a new school on this reserve.\"\n\nWe realize the very poor condition of the present school, located in a rented building. However, the attendance at this school during 1947-48 had fallen to an enrolment of 7 with an average attendance of 5.53. This is too low to warrant the expense of operating a day school.\n\nI would therefore request the co-operation and assistance of your Missionary for this band of Indians. It\nmust be emphasized clearly to them that their children must attend school regularly and punctually if our plans for a new building are to go forward.\n\nI do hope that they will realize the importance of co-operating with the Department in our efforts to educate their children.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard E. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJuly 6, 1949.\n\nMr. W. S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.

It has been pointed out to him that the success of this venture depends entirely on the co-operation of the Indian parents and children. He has therefore been requested to secure the assistance of his Missionary in persuading the Indian parents to have their children attend regularly.\n\nBernard E. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMcBride, Oct.\nJuly 18, 1949.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nThank you for your letter which reached me on Saturday. I hope to see the Indians at Hagwilget in a week or so and shall write you again after talking to them.\n\nLet me express my deep appreciation of your helpful interest in our problems, and especially for accompanying me to see the director last month in connection with Fort St. James.\n\nSincerely yours,\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Bernard F.

We were advised by you in a letter dated September 21, 1949, that he had commenced teaching duties on September 15. It is presumed that he has now received his first salary cheque.\n\nA cheque was mailed to Mr. H. Schroeder, teacher at the Kitwanebool Indian Day School, on October 4, 1949. On October 7, 1949, we received a letter from Mr. Schroeder advising us that he had received his Second Class Certificate. We, therefore, reclassified him as a Grade II teacher, and he will be paid at this new rate effective September 1, 1949. His salary cheques will be adjusted accordingly. Salary letters have been sent to Mr. Schroeder quoting both old and new rates.\n\nOn October 8, 1949, we received the necessary T.D.I forms for Mrs. J.M. Hogarth, teacher at the Kispiox Indian Day School. In answer to our Army Signal we were advised of the date Mrs. Hogarth commenced duties and immediately sent a memorandum to Treasury appointing her effective September 1, 1949. Her cheque will be mailed to her during the course of the next week.\nWould you please convey this information to each of the three teachers and assure them that we wish to hear from them again if there is any further delay.\n\nBernard J.

(RG 10, Volume 6408, file 838-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to respectfully inform you that I sent in my school report for December quarter (1920) to Mr. R.E. Loring, Indian Agent, Hazelton B.C., on December 20th, 1920, this date being part of the usual procedure also according to receipt and ordinary procedure, with the understanding that all salary cheques in future will be sent direct to all teachers.\n\nIt is now Jan. 31st, 1921, two weeks have turned up, why this delay? Need my money, at least within 30 days after sending in reports. According to rules and regulations of your dept., it states that all salaries would be paid immediately on receipt by your Dept. of school reports, surely it does not take 30 days to perform this task, especially when I know that it is possible to receive an answer from Ottawa within 12 days.\n\nI have been over years in the service of your dept. as school teacher & having kept a record etc.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6408, file 838-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nI find it has taken on an average five weeks from the time school reports are sent in, up to the time of receiving salary cheques; the whole thing could be done within 30 days, even after allowing 4 or 5 days for the perusal of the various school reports by the officials at your depot. The school is so far removed from civilization that what reports could be sent in, are sent in good time; certainly no teacher would delay his or her report.\n\nI would respectfully call your attention also that I am perfectly justified within my right as an inhabitant of Canada for over 20 years, in demanding more substantial in payment of my salary. Faithfully perform my tasks as school teacher to meet my salary paid with the least possible delay and records furthermore I know for a fact, school reports are \"held up\" at this end & bureaucratic methods are adopted by your Indian Agent at Hazelton B.C. & I think it is high time such \"tortuous\" procedures should cease.\n\nThen again I would remark that the yearly statistics covering the Babine Agency have been...\ncompiled and written by me during the past weeks, your Indian Agent being incompetent of performing that task.\n\nPromptitude in the payment of my salary in the future would be greatly appreciated. I am entitled to the full value and interest of my hard earned money.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSydney Brebner\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Chief of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nAddendum.\n\nTuesday, Oct 1st 1921.\n\nAs the train from the east was due here today, I was in hopes that \"salary cheques\" would arrive, but I was again doomed to disappointment. It seems strange that such delays should be allowed to exist. It is not business. I have my obligations to meet, not receiving my salary cheques in good time puts me (and other teachers) to great inconvenience & often means extra expense. This should not pertain in a modern country. Do you think so?\n\nYours truly,\n\nSydney Browning.\nOttawa, February 9, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo regarding the non-receipt of your salary cheque for the quarter ending December 31st, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your quarterly return reached the Department on the 26th of January and a cheque for $225.00, being the amount of salary due you, was mailed on the 28th of that month. This cheque was sent c/o Dr. H. C. Wrinch, Acting Indian Agent, Hazelton, B.C.\n\nIt is noted that your return for the December quarter is certified to by Dr. Wrinch on January 17th. There has evidently been delay, owing to the recent change whereby R.E. Loring has been retired from the service, in mailing your return from Hazelton to the Department. I may say that all returns are checked promptly in the Department and cheques for the amount of salary due sent without delay. It is regretted that you have been inconvenienced by the non-receipt of your salary cheque, but the delay in this case was not through any fault of the Department here.\n\nYour bonus cheque for the December quarter was mailed on the 4th instant, also addressed c/o Dr. Wrinch. It is hoped that you have received both your salary and bonus cheques before this date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nSydney Browning, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nRocher Deboule Indian Day School,\nP. O. Box 28,\nNew Hazelton, B.C.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn your letter No. 360020/3 dated Ottawa, Feb. 15th, 1921, which I received on Feb. 15th, I would respectfully call your attention that although you sent forwarded my salary cheque on Jan. 28th last, I never received it through R. Trinch, Acting Indian Agent, Hazelton B.C., until Feb. 7th.\n\nFrom the time I sent in my quarterly report it was exactly 38 days before I received my cheque.

At the present time she is in receipt of $120 per annum for her services in the teaching of sewing, knitting, etc., and the preparation of the noonday meal for the children. She is also in receipt of salary at the rate of $60 per annum for her services as janitress. In view of the Inspector's recommendation, we have decided to grant Mrs. Browning an increase of $20 in her salary as assistant teacher. This will make her salary from the 1st of October, last, at the rate of $14 per month for the ten teaching months in the year.\n\nIt will not, in future, be necessary for you to prepare a separate voucher for Mrs. Browning's salary as assistant teacher. This voucher will be prepared in the Department and a cheque will be sent her at the same time as salary is being paid to Mr. Browning, the teacher.

I wish to respectfully inform you that I sent in my School report for June quarter to Mr. G.C. Mortimer, Indian Agent Hazelton, B.C. on Friday, July 1st last. I cannot understand why there should be such a delay in payment of my salary. Last year I received it on July 13th. Having done my work well I expect to be paid with the least possible delay. It only takes 5 days for a letter to reach OTTAWA from here and the same to return. 60 days in all. Kindly oblige by sending a cheque right away if you have not already done so.\n\nYours most respectfully,\n\nSydney Browning,\nTeacher.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt.

Ottawa, for mid-day meals, could be increased to $15.00 per month, as there are quite a number of pupils attending this school regularly, and an extra food allowance would be much appreciated, at this time particularly.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nSydney Browning\nTeacher.\nOttawa, December 1, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, enclosing a communication which you received from the teacher of the Roche Deboule Indian Day School requesting an increase in the amount provided for the purchase of supplies for the pupils' midday meal.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that at the present time the sum of $7.50 per month is allowed. As our funds this year are very limited and there are many demands, it is regretted that the above amount is the total expenditure that can be provided towards the cost of the pupils' midday lunch for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. C.

Mortimer,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nDuring the course of my visits to the Roche Dehoule and Kispiox Indian Day schools I found that the seating accommodation was not satisfactory, especially for the larger boys and girls, as the desks are too near the floor. May I suggest to the Department that I be allowed to purchase from R. S. Sargent, Limited of Hazelton, 26 pieces of 2\" x 4\" x 16' and 400 - 1/2\" screws. It is my intention to place the lumber under the legs of the desks which will give sufficient room to the larger children and will be more satisfactory. The approximate cost will be:\n\nlumber, $8.35\nscrews, $2.40, $10.75\n\nI would further draw the attention of the Department to the Kispiox School, the roof of which is leaking badly. This school has roofing paper, a large portion of which has been torn off, allowing the snow to melt through and fall into the school. Two rolls of 2 # ply roofing paper would be sufficient to repair same and would cost $6.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG. C.

It is noted you estimate the total cost of the lumber and screws to be approximately $10.75.\n\nRegarding the condition of the roof of the Kispiox Indian Day School, I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase of two rolls of two-ply roofing paper, and have the repairs carried out.\n\nAfter the work in connection with the desks and roof has been completed, please forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the material and for the labour in having the work carried out.

Reference in this regard is made specially to the charges for coffee and tea.\n\nIt is only intended to supply a light lunch at noon or a hot drink, consisting of soup or cocoa. The Department trusts that you will keep our instructions in mind in future and, by so doing, the midday meal will be approximately the same as the Department desires served at Indian day schools and, in addition, the cost should be considerably less.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Soup made from bones with peas, beans and potatoes added is given three times a week and cocoa is given the other two days. At each meal every child is given one Pilot bread biscuit. The average attendance at this school is fourteen (14) children and four boxes of Pilot bread lasts four months, the cost of same being $4.25 per box. As the new scale allowed for groceries for this school is cut from $7.50 to $3.50 per month the average daily cost per child, including Pilot bread, is approximately 2\u00bd\u00a2.\n\nI may state that Tsitsik is one of my poorest reserves and I am of the opinion that one hot meal each day is a blessing to the children.\n\nMay I respectfully suggest that this be continued.\n\nGCM/SM.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This account is being paid.\n\nAs you are aware, our appropriation has been considerably reduced and the Department would appreciate your endeavouring to secure this building at a lower rate. We have been allowing $15.00 a month for several years past and the Department considers that the owner should be disposed to accept a lower rental. Please give this matter your immediate attention and advise the Department.\n\nYour vouchers numbered 118 and 119, covering the cost of midday meal supplies, have also been received and these accounts are being paid. I would point out, however, that, owing to the reduction in our appropriation, very careful consideration will have to be given to what amount can be allowed for midday meal purposes during the coming academic year.\n\nMidday meals should not be served at any of the schools in your agency during the month of September but, when the teachers return after the summer holidays, you should discuss the matter very carefully with them and advise the Department regarding the minimum amount required at each school where a midday meal has been served in the past.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Mortimer,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\n\nRe- Mid-day meals for school children.\n\nDear sir,-\n\nIt is with feelings of keen regret that the Dept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, should desire to stop supplying the mid-day meals for Indian school children at this point for the months of September, October etc., as mentioned in your note of recent date.\n\nAs you are fully aware (more particularly) of the circumstances and conditions prevailing among the Indians living in this Indian Reserve and their precarious mode of living (not at all times providing meals at the proper meal hours) and my own personal knowledge and experience with these Indians as teacher here for nearly 20 years should be sufficient evidence and reason as to the necessity of continuing the mid-day meals for the IC school months of the year, and as it was found (owing to the poverty of the Indians of this Reserve) by the dept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa to grant $7.50 per month for mid-day meals from (which was cut down to $3.30 recently) from Sept. 1916, and at a time when adult Indians could find much work to do in and around this district, it seems more necessary now when there is no work not even for white to do. You ask me what the minimum cost would be for providing these meals. I would respectfully point out that the amount hitherto granted, viz.- $3.30 for soup ingredients etc., plus $3.80 for Pilot Bread equals $7.10 per school month, or $71.00 for 1 school year of 10 months, a very insignificant amount when compared with that which pertains at any Indian Residential School, and I would state that\nMrs Browning has often used some of her own cooking ingredients in making soups for these poor little Indian children; so then the amount is mighty small.\n\nThe mid-day meal although very small, is still of nourishment to the school children and has been appreciated, helping them considerably with their studies, as without proper nourishment and sustenance no child can possibly learn well, a very important fact is it not? I think that if the facts were fully explained and made thoroughly clear by you to the Dept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa they would not begrudge the small amount expended each School year for that purpose.\n\nThanking you for any assistance you can render in this important matter,\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSydney Browning\n\nTeacher.\nSir,\n\nre - Mid-day Meals at Roche Deboule Indian Day School, Tsitsik Reserve.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from Mr. S. Browning, Teacher of the Roche Deboule Indian Day School, Tsitsik, regarding the above mentioned matter.\n\nAlthough the letter is self explanatory on many points, name-the-less some obligations must rest with the parents in feeding their children. The Indians of Tsitsik compare favourably with those of other reserves in this Agency where no relief for mid-day meals is asked.\n\nI would refer you again to my letter of August 21st, No. S-1F-241, which fully covers the situation, and to your reply thereto of August 29th, No. 151-3-5.\n\nEnclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. C. Mortimer,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 14, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, enclosing a communication received from Mr. S. Browning, teacher of the Roche Deoule Indian Day School, with reference to supplying a midday meal at that school.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that, after carefully considering the matter, it has been decided not to make any change in the instructions given in official letter of August 29th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B. C.\nOttawa, September 21, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nIn a report regarding his visit to the Rocher Deboule Indian Day School on May 20th last, which has just reached the Department, Mr. Barry states he found the toilets in very bad condition, and he recommends the erection of a new toilet.\n\nThe Rocher Deboule school building is not the property of the Department and, therefore, it is the duty of the owner to erect a new toilet. It is doubtful, however, if he will do so and, as it is necessary to have a suitable toilet at this school, the Department would appreciate your giving the matter immediate consideration and advising if the present toilet could not be cleaned or if you consider a new one should be erected. In the latter event, you should give an estimate of the cost, and the matter will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. C.

C.\nDear Sir,\n\nre- Rent of Rocher Deboule Day School Building and Teacher's Residence.\n\nI enclose a letter from Rev. J.B. Samuel, O.M.I., New Hazelton, B.C., asking that a reasonable rent be allowed for the residence of the teacher of the Rocher Deboule Indian Day School, Tsitak Reserve.\n\nOn July 5th, 1933, under File 151-3-5, the Department suggested that the school building be secured at a lower rate than $15.00 per month, to which Mr. Indian Agent Mortimer replied on August 21st., 1933, File L-2-240, stating that $10.00 per month would be acceptable to the Indian owner.\n\nApparently the former rent was for the school building and the teacher's residence, $10.00 being paid for the former and $5.00 for the latter, per month. Under the new arrangement the Indian owner of the school building has given $2.50 per month to the Resident Priest of Tsitak as rent of the teacher's residence.\n\nThe teacher's residence, owned by the Roman Catholic Church, is well built and a good deal of money has been spent in making it habitable and comfortable. Might I suggest that a rent of at least $6.00 per month be allowed for this building.\n\nThe amount of $7.50 per month is ample for the school building.\n\nWill you kindly advise what attitude the Department might take in this matter?\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nS. Mallinson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nTo the Indian Agent\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI would like to call the attention of the Department on the following facts:\n\nThe teacher of the Indian School of the Mission has resided for two years in the Mission's house. In the three years she has given to the Teacher's disposition a well built frame house, composed of four large rooms, two downstairs and two upstairs.\n\nBy an anomaly I do not understand, the rent for that house was merged with the rent of the school building. Every three months the check was addressed to Joe Hochloch or Herschel who kept $25.00 and gave to the Mission $7.50.\n\nMay the Department consider the situation and allow us a fair deal. The teacher's residence is a far better building than the school building and the rent for the latter is $7.50 a month, and for the former $25.00.\n\nYou will understand immediately the wrong of the situation.

(RG 10, Volume 6409, file 838-5, part 5)\nOttawa, December 24, 1947.\n\nInspector's Report -\nRoche Debeule Indian Day School\n\nDear Bishop Jordan:\n\nDistrict School Inspector Davey visited the above Indian Day School on October 31. His Inspector's report on the teacher is quite unsatisfactory. On the teacher grading scale D (poor) is given for Personality, Management, Teaching Skill and Pupils' Progress. Under general comments Inspector Davey writes as follows:\n\n\"The work of this teacher is most unsatisfactory. There is little evidence of any progress since my last visit, and practically none of the recommendations made on that occasion have been implemented. Attendance at the school is most irregular and although the teacher is inclined to blame this on the indifference of the parents, it is felt that the chief reason lies in the methods and the personality of the teacher. It is apparently impossible to impress this teacher with the need to follow even the elementary principles. There is a complete lack of organization. No attempt is made to follow a time-table. The teacher was not even sure of the grades in which the pupils had been classified.\n\n\"The school building is a very old structure quite beyond repair, and in view of the proximity of the village to Hazelton, it is felt that when the new school at Hazelton is erected it would be advisable to transport\n\nMost Reverend A. Jordan, O.M.I., D.D.,\nVicar Apostolic of Prince Rupert,\nBox 776, Prince Rupert, B.C.\nthe few pupils to a combined school. This would be a distance of only some three miles. The cost of such a scheme would be far cheaper and the results much better than the operation of two separate schools.\"\n\nYou will recall that I wrote to you on July 15, 1947, concerning a similar proposal made last year. I would appreciate hearing from you with regard to future plans for the Rochele Deboule Indian Day School. Our records indicate that only nine children are now in attendance, with an average daily attendance of five.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

Teachers at Moricetown and Fort Babine, with enrolments of 43 and 45 pupils respectively, have drawn my attention to the fact that during the past two years they have been allowed an amount of $15.00 each for the period 1st November to 31st March. Since neither their enrolments nor local prices have decreased I would ask that Moricetown and Fort Babine schools be permitted to expend $15.00 again this year.

You should state also the number of children of school age in each of the reserves on which you recommend the establishment of a school.\nExtract\n\nBritish Columbia\nIndian Office\nVictoria 7th February 1841\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that on the 6th ultimo I commenced a visitation of the Indian Reserve in Saanich when I found the condition of the Indians in the whole satisfactory.\n\nThe Indians generally throughout Saanich complained that they had no schools at which to send their children, whom they are very anxious to have educated. I informed them that I would report to the proper authorities and that their grievance in that respect I had no doubt would be soon remedied as the Department was anxious of having the Indians' children instructed so as to improve their condition, and would be pleased to hear of the willingness of the Indians to see that their children attended were such an institution provided for them.\n\nWm A. B. Fowell\nIndian Office,\nQuamichan, 9th Feb. 1891.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the application of the Saanich Indians for schools I beg to state that they were the first tribe to ask for the same; on several occasions we had counted up the children but could never make up enough pupils in any one neighborhood to support a day school unless many had to travel a long way say four to six miles, this is supposing a school were built on the middle reserve (Pauquachin) which is the most central.\n\nBut as the Indians themselves remark what is to be done when most of the families are away at Fishing stations?\n\nPersonally I have no faith in any good to be derived from Indian day schools where children are not compelled and seldom encouraged to attend regularly, even when their parents are at home, indeed I feel sure the only way to do real good is to either take more pupils into the Kuper Is. School or establish another on same or on a partially boarding school system.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Ob'dt. Servant,\n\n(Signed) W. H. Lomas\nIndian Agent.\n\nA. W.

The Rev. Father has solved the difficulty by opening two schools and I trust his efforts to obtain the assistance required may be successful.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) W.

Thomas,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nYou are aware that since two years I am regularly keeping a night school for the South, West, and North Saanich. I teach daily from 7 to 9 p.m., and have constantly furnished, free of charge, school premises, fuel, indispensable school furniture, light, stationary etc., etc., for at least fifteen pupils.\n\nIn January of this year I erected with permission of Mr. Vowell a Church School Building on the East Saanich Reservation distant from any place about four miles. Beginning with the month of February last I have kept in this building a day-school. My regular attendance has been from twenty to twenty-five, but many more from other camps wish to come and to board there.\n\nThere also I furnish without compensation: School-room, furniture, fuel, stationary, slate etc., etc. I feel however that the work is too much for me. I have to keep a horse for the purpose of attending both places, and I am unable to pay for much needed assistance. The Indians in East Saanich besides ask me for a night-school. I therefore request you to use your best endeavours in order to obtain\nfrom the Department some pecuniary assistance for these schools. If the Department would allow me, say twenty-five (25) a month, I could therewith procure the assistance I do very much require, and thereby ensure the uninterrupted continuance of both schools.\u2014Surely the Saanich Indians have on account of their proximity to Victoria, even more need for at least elementary instruction than other Indians who have been more favored in this matter by the Department.\n\n\"The Saanich are not a begging lot anyhow\" said Mr. Vowell once to me.\n\nBegging therefore your kind assistance in this matter and hoping to receive a favorable reply,\n\nYours very truly,\nA. J. Wallinga\n\nP.S. For the great satisfaction the Indians have given me, I gave them land for playgrounds, several games, and recently bought a band for them. (Musical instruments.)\nOttawa, April 9th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nA communication has been received through the Victoria Office from the Rev. J. A.

Mr. Van Nevel approval of this appointment, expressing at the same time the hope that Miss Hagan will take up her duties with a determined effort to make this a successful school.\n\nThe records show that a Miss Virginia Hagan taught in this school when it was first established and the Department would like to know if the lady now appointed is the same person.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nW.

This school was opened at the beginning of last quarter vide your letter of the 15th of June last, File No. 206,050-1.\n\nI would recommend that the articles asked for be purchased and for that purpose would request that the necessary authority therefor be given.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Ob'dt.

Father Vullingsh of Saanich, B.C., for a day school for the Indians at that point, I am directed to inform you that no appropriation for this purpose can be made until the next estimates are prepared and when preparing the same you may include an item of $300 for a teacher's salary at that place.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nSecretary\n\nA. V. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Supt.,\nVictoria, B.C.\nOttawa, 26th April, 1901.\n\nMemorandum for the Minister.\n\nMr Ralph Smith M. P. and Mr Riley of Victoria both spoke to me in regard to an application made by Father Vullingsh, the missionary at Saanich, British Columbia, for a day school for the Indians at that point, and have urged very strongly that the application be favorably considered. In the application it is represented that there are from 40 to 50 children growing up in ignorance and that there are at least 25 of them of school age; that the parents are anxious for their education; and that owing to the almost impassable condition of the road it is practically impossible for them to attend the nearest school which is four miles distant. The application was recommended by the agent for the district and by Mr Vowell, and in his letter of the 22nd October last he added that Father Vullingsh was a hard working missioner and that his work among the Indians was productive of good results.\nI remember that when I visited Saanich some years ago with Mr Vowell, I was most favorably impressed with the work which this missionary was doing among the Indians, and I quite concur in what Mr Vowell says.\n\nIt would appear that by some oversight no action was taken upon Mr Vowell's submission of the application and report of the agent. $300 is the amount necessary to provide for the salary of teacher. Father Vullings has a commodious building in connection with the mission which he will devote to the purposes of the school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nQuamichan.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEver since assuming the duties of missionary to the Indians of the Tsartilp, Paquachin, Tseikum, Tsao-out and Malekut Reserves of Saanich, I have been urgently pressed by them to write to the authorities of the Indian Dept. to obtain for those people of the two reserves first mentioned the usual appropriation of $300.00 a year from the Indian Dept., for a teacher's salary, to enable a day-school to be carried on at the Tsartilp Reserve. I have a good commodious building in connection with this mission and, if a grant to pay a teacher can be secured from the Dept., work could commence almost at once.\n\nThere is a good trunk-road between the Tsartilp, Paquachin and Tseikum Reserves, and there are on the Tsartilp and Paquachin Reserves at least twenty-five children of school age. There are at these Reserves of West Saanich from forty to fifty children growing up in ignorance and whose parents are most desirous that an education be provided for their offspring. The parents of these children are well aware of the drawback, that a lack of education entails in after life, and feel the situation very keenly.\n\nThe nearest school is at Tsao-out (East Saanich), four miles from Tsartilp over an almost impassable road, and very much farther from the other Saanich Reserves, which makes it impossible to attend at Tsao-out.\n\nI would on behalf of the Indian bands named, deem it a favor, if you can see your way to recommend, that an appropriation be made by the Indian Dept., for a Day school at Tsartilp for all the Saanich bands, who are now without a school.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6400, file S39-1, part 1)\nThe Indians alluded are nearly all farmers, who dispose of their produce to Victoria merchants, and the Indians, knowing nothing of mercantile life, nor figures, often complain bitterly to me of their own helplessness in trading affairs and the constant worry caused them by a lack of education generally.\n\nI feel confident, dear sir, that your personal views on the subject, based upon your knowledge of the situation here, cannot but be favorable to the desire of the Indians.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nA.J. Cullings.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of a copy of a letter from Mr. Agent Lomas, forwarded by you on the 20th ultimo enclosing a communication from the Rev. Father Vullingham asking for a grant for the Indian school at South Saanich; and in reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that there are no funds available for the purpose at present, and no provision has been made in the Estimates for next year for this school.\n\nIt would be well for you to take a note of this application and include it in your next Estimates.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nA.W.

There are only nine children of school age on the reserve and the Department is of opinion that it would be as well to close the school at the end of the current quarter. If you agree with this you may give the teacher the necessary notice.\n\nCould not provision be made to send some of these children to one or other of the boarding or industrial schools?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. R. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan's Station, B.C.\nSir,\n\nSPECIAL REPORT ON TSARTLIP DAY SCHOOL, SOWICHAN AGE\n\nI have the honor to report that I visited this school on the morning of September 27th. I found the school closed. I saw the priest, Rev. Father Rendall, who lives close to the school house. He said the school was \"dead\". I found him very unreasonable in his remarks. I then went to see the teacher who lives about a quarter of a mile from the school. She said she only had school three weeks in the December quarter, that she went again and again, and as the pupils did not come she stopped going. I asked if she would still teach if the children came and she said she would.\n\nI afterwards saw a number of the Indians. They declared the children went to the school house, and not finding the teacher they returned home. After doing this several times they decided it was no use going.\n\nThese Indians were formerly nearly all good Catholics, but a number joined a new sect \"Shakers\", a dancing religion! The priest properly reproved his people for this, and a hard feeling exists between priest and Indians at the present time. Some think they are getting even with him by not sending their children to school.\n\nI consider the teacher has shown lack of interest in the school the past few months. There are only nine children of school age on the reserve at present and they live quite a distance from the school house. Unless the Indians and the teacher take an interest in the school it would be better to close it. Some of the Indians said they did not wish the school closed.\n\nThe priest said it was not his work, and that he would not go and ask the people to send their children to the school.\n\nI have the honor to remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector.\nI trust that by now you are in receipt of letter from Constable Hon. O'Connell. His office visited my reserve some three weeks ago and between the two of us we managed once more getting the school started. There are now 12 children on the roll although some for illness cannot attend for the time being. Mr. O'Connell promised me that he would visit and recommend that the salary of Miss M. Hogan, the teacher be raised, the Hon. Constable believing himself that the salary of $25.00 a month was an adequate compensation for the work done. I trust you will favorably consider Mr. O'Connell's and my own recommendation. Miss M. Hogan starts school at 9 A.M. She has classes from 9 A.M. - 3:30 P.M. I don't know how long Miss Hogan will supply her services through a salary, but I am absolutely certain that we are doing nothing which is likely to happen we shall find nobody to replace her at $300.00 a year.\n\nHoping that you will kindly regard my appeal.\n\nI remain\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nThe Rev. Father M. M. Condon.\nDear Sir,\n\nMany thanks for yours of Feb. 2nd which came but a few days ago. You say that you find it extremely difficult to put into effect the Regulations. I assure thee regulations you refer are herein (Act, Part II, section 2) and section 3. I am fully aware that it is very difficult matter for the Dominion Constable in charge of the Division of the entire Province to attend to everything as soon as his presence is required anywhere. Would you kindly permit me a suggestion. Why not appoint one or several more officers acting under the supervision of the Dominion Constable and authorized by the Department. This would certainly be more effective means to obtain better results as little attendance at school. I complained to glean from your letter that you are inclined to exonerate both Messrs. Hogan, the teachers and myself of the blame. The latter, field department under the date of Feb. 24th seems to justify us. I should very much like the Department to well understand that no matter how hard the minor ordinary work, his efforts will go to naught unless he is helped by the officials of the Department. You may object that the money ought to\nbe able to exercise their most influence. So far, so good; but we should be well aware of this that the Indians fully well know that the school regulations are not made by the missionary, but by the government, and if he sees that the government that made the laws takes no pains to have them observed and enforced, he will turn a deaf ear to the missionary's advice. The Indian whose natural philosophy will think and say, \"If government does not worry us about these regulations, why should I care?\" I do not see why the missionary should.\" Moreover, the missionary becomes for his very minority, house, leisure time for walking and preaching to the reservation to bring to school refractory pupils. Additionally, the missionary has the slightest consideration for his work from the government. Week in, week out, he is with the Indians, visits them, bears their trouble, helps them out, often financially, mails their letters, travels for their sake and at his own expense, but never gets any remuneration for his work. The encouragement he gets is negligible. His fame, more or less, rests on the official directly responsible for the schools and their working; for two years I was incumbent of this mission post, the mails were neglected hurriedly too. I do not want to reflect on a gentleman now departed for life, but his report may have concerned that letter of Feb. 24, '13. A school inspector who takes his work in hand should visit not only the school but the parents of the children also. Indians like the teachers' fund so much more allow-\none forth easily understandable disposition. Lies and certain, along a department and sloppy, does not have in hand its proportions to look for good results. This will make them. If he resists after eight years more with native uniform then even his district not school. These children have parents forced sending the children to school? You and no. They are to be blamed because they do not send their children, because they were no authority over their children as far as school attendance is concerned. For his child does not like to go to school, the native parent will use no pressure, such as his mentality, or genuine pioneer's duty. They are not bothered by a certain extent, the department faculty appears. After every, not enforcing regulations, the grown man nothing but forbids the Indians' obligations.\n\nWe have regulations, but are they made to be and thrown a dead letter? It might have been as well not to frame any law at all. Officials may object that if they enforce the regulation, they are apt to make themselves unpopular to the Indians, lose their good will and favor, and consequently, perhaps, their office. Is this a reason at all? Should a man who has a straight conscience and wishes to do his duty stop at such material considerations? Why shirk the unpleasant part of the task? Duty and its fulfillment always has a sting. Why throw aside responsibility all the disagreeable work? Why hide behind the difficulties, all the unpleasantness connected\nwith Indians not? Why occasion the unnecessary trouble with the Indians for having them keep regulations the government makes but does not put into practice?\n\nI therefore dare say, and I feel sure, dear Sir, you cannot but agree with me that the government is not enforcing Order in Council, section 3, subsection 2, by deliberately ignoring the Indians whom it professes to educate.\n\nI deliberately diminish the influence and authority which I ought to consider most valuable.\n\nI deliberately and deservedly diminish its own authority.\n\nTrusting, dear Sir, that you will give these few remarks due consideration,\n\nI remain\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nThe Rt. Hon. Mr. M. R. Borden.\nFebruary 2nd, 1914.\n\nRev. Sir -\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of December 30th, last, and I have read with much interest your remarks with regard to the attendance at the Teartlip day school. I quite realize the difficulties that lie in the way of obtaining a regular attendance at our Indian day schools, and I am sure you have done, as you state, your best with this object in view. I note your remarks with reference to compulsory education. While we have this provision in our Regulations we find it extremely difficult to put it into effect. If a satisfactory attendance could be obtained and a qualified teacher engaged I should be prepared to pay a much better salary and I shall be pleased to know whether you consider we might look for results that would justify an increased expenditure in this way.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Father Halle Ronden,\nTurocose P.O.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nR. M. D. No. 1\nYurgoose, B.C.\nDec. 20th\n\nW. C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. Agent W. R. Robertson wrote to me on the 15th inst., quoting an extract from your letter to him, Feb. 24th last respecting non-attendance at the Ventilpa Day School. In that extract I note the statement that \"this non-attendance would appear to be due to lack of interest both on the part of the missionary and the teacher.\"\n\nThat statement compels me to say, in self-defence, that for the securing of proper attendance at Indian schools more than the interest of the missionary and teacher is required, and that we, who it is evident that other proper agencies have been utilized to the full, should so serious an implication be made as to the missionary and teacher. What evidence may I add, has the department that full interest has been shown, and full effort made by others charged with office with working for the success of our Indian educational policy? How many official visits have been made to the school within the year? What official efforts have been made to secure full attendance? For my part I have done and am doing all I possibly can to that end. The teacher is doing more than one can reasonably be expected to do for a salary of $25.00 a month. In these days\nand in our country that is a mere pittance. To ensure enthusiastic effort on the part of the teacher a salary fairly commensurate with the work should be paid. And the efforts of even a well paid teacher are all systems short, must be regularly and efficiently supplemented by the local officials and more particularly by the inspectors of Indian schools. I may add that my experience long ago led me to the conclusion that the legal provision for compulsory education should be enforced. Compulsory education is required to secure the education of all white children whose parents have been for generations subjected to an environment making in favor of their general understanding of the benefit, may the necessity of education, surely create means cannot be counted on to secure the extension of education to the children of a people who but a short time ago emerged from barbarism.\n\nI can assure the department that as a missionary I can be counted upon to do all in my power to help in the work of education; but I must have effective help.\n\nClear evidence of governmental determination to have the Indian children educated is the surest way to ensure attendance at school of these children. Closing a school is not a punishment to delinquent parents, that simply cuts off the possibility of educating for the children.\n\nHoping that you will favorably consider these remarks and consequently exempt both myself and the teacher from blame we decidedly do not deserve.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nThe Rev. Father M. M. Rondan.\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters of the 9th November and 13th instant, with further reference to Indians of the West Saanich Indian Reserve attending the public school in that vicinity.\n\nSince then I have canvassed the situation to see just what can be done for the children of this reserve to afford them educational facilities nearer home than the residential schools at Rupert Island or at Sardis. There are twenty-two children of school age on the West Saanich Reserve and fourteen under school age. These figures are exclusive of five at Rupert Island School and one at Coqualeetza. The parents say they would all like to have the old Day School re-opened and would have their children attend regularly if this were done, but they want a good teacher.\n\nThe old school building has been examined and it is found to be in need of new equipment in the way of desks and blackboards as well as other general school material. If this school were re-opened in all likelihood a fair attendance would be had for at least six months of the year, but as most of the Saanich Indians leave their reserves early in the spring to seek labor in other parts of the Province or the American side, the attendance would be small during the balance of the year.\n\nYou will, no doubt, ask why all these children cannot be sent to the residential schools. The answer to this is that it is extremely doubtful if they all could pass the necessary medical examination and, furthermore, the parents have a considerable antipathy against sending their children to the residential schools.\n\nIn conclusion, I beg to say the experiment of again opening the Indian Day School on the West Saanich Road might therefore be tried, but there is no use thinking of this unless the Department is prepared to pay a good salary for a good teacher with at least a second class certificate. For, what the Indians like about the public schools is that there are good teachers and the children make excellent progress under their instruction.\nREPORT OF REV. R.H. CAIRNS ON THE TRANTLIP DAY SCHOOL.\n\nSince my last visit, June 11th, 1915, school has been open only two weeks (in Nov.), with one pupil in attendance.\n\nThe teacher informed me that everything that was possible had been done to induce parents to send their children to school, but there was no improvement.\n\nMiss Nagan closed the school in Nov., as only one child was in attendance.\n\nEverything possible has been done to interest these people in the school, still, there is no improvement. They tell me that they want to send their children to Kuper Island Industrial school.\n\nIn my opinion the proper thing to do is to close the school for the year, 1916.\n\nReport dated December 1st, 1915.\nReport received in dept...Jan. 8th, 1916.\nOttawa, January 14th., 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to say that a report regarding the Tsartlip Day School has been received from Inspector Cairns. It is dated the 1st December. He states that two pupils of that school died during the year, one in June and the other in August from tuberculosis. He remarks that these deaths indicate that tuberculosis is prevalent amongst the Indians of the district. In view of the foregoing the Department desires that you will bring the matter to the particular attention of the salaried medical officer, Dr. William Gordon Cummings, whose duty it is to attend Indians of the Saanich Band. Kindly point out to him that the Department expects him to do his utmost to prevent the spread of this disease. If possible measures towards its eradication should be taken. Both you and the doctor should take every opportunity of impressing upon the Indians in general the necessity of observing cleanly habits, ventilating their homes, and otherwise taking precaution where there are patients suffering from tuberculosis.\n\nApparently Dr. Cummings has not been sending in reports regularly with regard to his work on behalf of Indians. It is your duty to see that his report is sent in at the close of each month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. R. Robertson, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan's Station B.

He seemed to think that it would be possible to get the children to attend.\n\nMiss Hagan told me that the Indian Agent and Dominion Constable had been there last winter and had held a meeting among the Indians at which the matter of school attendance was discussed.\n\nDate of Inspection,- October 28th, 1914.\nOttawa, May 9, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department has decided to pay Miss Hogan, teacher of the Tsartlip School, at the rate of $400.00 per annum from the first of the current quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

BARRY ON HIS\nINSPECTION OF THE TSARTLIP INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\nDate of Inspection April 5, 1936.\n\nName of Teacher: Miss Catherine B. Morry Age 23.\n\nHealth: This teacher does not appear to me to be well. She does not appear exactly ill, but she has lost much of her vitality. This is not due to the loss of her father which occurred suddenly about a month ago. This appearance of lassitude was very apparent on the occasion of my previous inspection in December 1935.\n\nIn my last two reports I mentioned the neglect of the Primary Grades. The children in the various Sub Grades of Grade 1 have made very little progress during the past year. They have learned some Number Work since my last inspection, but the Reading is very much below the usual standard of the Indian Day Schools. I have of course explained again and again to this teacher how to take up Primary subjects; but for the past two years and particularly for the past year she has shown so little vitality in her work that she is quite unable to teach Primary children with any chance of real success.\n\nI am very sorry that Miss Morry has not been able to continue the good work she did during the first two years here. The past year has been to a great extent just wasted time for the little children. Some progress has been made in Grade 5.\n\nThe children attend in rather an irregular manner. This is partly caused by the absence of the Indians at certain seasons on their Seasonal Occupations. Other schools in the Cowichan Agency can keep up a good average attendance where there are just as great difficulties. I am afraid that the falling off in the attendance is a result of lack of interest in the school. The attendance in the December Quarter of 1935 was a little better. The Quarterly attendance averages are as follows:\n\nQuarter ending September 1934 8.8 September 1935 5.53\nDecember 1934 11.2 December 1935 15.1\nMarch 1935 10.21 March 1936 11.74\n\nThese attendance averages might be much improved with a teacher here who would visit the homes of the Indians and encourage the children to come to school.\nThere appears to be many cases of children coming to school late. The teacher does not mark these in the Register. She tells me that perhaps about three children are late on an average daily. This is of course far too high an average and shows a lack of interest on behalf of the pupils.\n\nThe very worst feature of this school at the present time is the hopeless lack of control of the younger children. With the exception of the Number Work in Grade 1, which has improved a little, the Primary Grades are in a worse condition than when last reported on by me. The only satisfactory work being done is that in Grade 5.\n\nI am very far from satisfied with the work now being done at this school. I am afraid that I must recommend that the Department make a change of teachers here. An energetic young teacher would make a very great difference at this school. I simply am unable to believe that Miss Morry has any further interest in this school outside the fact that it provides her with a pay cheque each month. From a professional viewpoint though good work was done for some two or three years here, the past year or two years have been largely a complete failure. The decline in the work has been progressive and inclines me to think that the teacher is not well.\n\nIt would be best to close this school at the end of May for the summer vacation, and to open it in October with a young energetic teacher, either male or female but for preference the former. This report is being forwarded in time to permit the Department to give the teacher a month's notice and to close the school at the end of May, should they so desire.\n\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF INSPECTOR BARRY DATED APRIL 11th, ACCOMPANYING THE ABOVE REPORT.\n\nI hope that this report will reach the Department in time to close the school for the month of June and thus save a little money which will in my opinion only be wasted by keeping the school open till the end of June. I should like the teacher to have a full month's notice should the Department agree with me that a new teacher should be appointed to open school in October. The number of children likely to attend in September would not be large and another month's salary could be saved. This money might well be used for some new Work Books, Etc., in a number of our Indian day schools.\nEX'D.\n\nMarch 29, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Dickie:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, with enclosure from the Reverend Father Scheelen of Saanichton, concerning the Tsartlip Indian Day School.

Murphy,\nSuperintendent-General of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose for your consideration, a letter just received from Rev. Father Scheelen of Saanichton, with respect to the Indian School at that point.\n\nI have great respect for Father Scheelen and can unhesitatingly back up any statements he has made in the letter in question.\n\nI would be very glad indeed if you could see your way clear to have his wishes acceded to, as he has been a powerful help with the Indians in Vancouver Island, and it would be money well expended if the School is kept open.\n\nThanking you in advance, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(C.H. Dietz)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6409, file 839-1, part 1)\nSir:\n\nAt the beginning of October last Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn informed me that Miss Morry has been appointed as teacher of Tsartlip Indian Day School for six months, the proposed length of time that the said school would be operated for. Miss Morry took up her duties on the 3rd, October, which according to agreement would make the term expire on 3rd, of April.\n\nI discussed this matter fully with Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn last week, and explained to him that the school had been a great success, with more children attending than we had figured on. There were 21 present on my last visit, which is one more than we have seating accommodation for.\n\nIt seems a very great pity that a school that is really doing well should be closed down, except for legal holidays, so I got the parents to sign up how long that they would guarantee to keep their children at school and you will see from the enclosed form that there will be twelve children guaranteed up to end of June, and the remainder to the end of May. Under these circumstances I would certainly like to recommend that the school be kept open. I would ask that the Department please advise me by wire their decision in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nWe the parents who have children attending the Tsartlip Day School, agree to keep our children at school until date as set out.\n\n| Name               | Number of children | Keep children at school until |\n|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Chris Paul         | 3                  | end of June                   |\n| Joe Hartman        | 2                  | end of June                   |\n| Jimmy & John       | 1                  | end of May or Middle of June  |\n| Etienne Smith      | 2                  | end of May                    |\n| Willie Smith       | 3                  | end of June                   |\n| Johnny Sam         | 1                  | end of May                    |\n| William & Paul     | 1                  | end of May                    |\n| Martha             |                    |                               |\n| Gus Molus          | 1                  | end of May                    |\n| William Morris     | 2                  | end of May                    |\n| Johnny Thompson    | 3                  | end of June                   |\n| Matthew Cooper     | 1                  | end of June                   |\n| Peter Henry        |                    |                               |\n\nCowichan Indian Agency\nMAR 21 1932\nDuncan, B.C.\nOttawa, November 13th, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your 15/3/22645 of the 9th ultimo, regarding the Indian day school for the South Saanich Band, it has been decided that this school should be known in future as the \"TSARTLIP INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\".\n\nIn future correspondence, the Department would appreciate your referring to it as such. Please inform Mr. Agent Graham and School Inspector Barry.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your 15/3/22645, with reference to the Indian day school on the South Saanich Indian Reserve (Tsartalip).\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the appointment of Miss Catherine B. Morry for the next six months, at a salary of $90 a month, with an allowance of $2.50 for janitor fees, is approved.\n\nIt is noted that Miss Morry commenced duties on the 3rd instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that the Indian Day School on South Saanich Indian Reserve (Tsawalini) is now in operation and from present appearances it will be a success as there are ten (10) children already in attendance with the prospect of several others, and it may be necessary to purchase a few more desks, only twelve having been purchased as a start.\n\nInsofar as a teacher is concerned I beg to say that Miss Catherine R. Morry has been appointed for six months at a salary of Ninety Dollars ($90.00) per month with an allowance of Two Dollars and Fifty cents ($2.50) per month for janitor's fees. Miss Morry holds a first class (Interim) B.C. certificate and has had two years at Victoria College. Her appointment is perfectly satisfactory to Reverend Father Scheeling, the P.C. Missionary of the District and Right Reverend Gerald Murray, Bishop of Vancouver Island. Miss Morry commenced her duty as teacher on the 3rd instant, in getting supplies unpacked and placed away in the cupboards. Classes started on Monday the 6th. I beg, therefore, to recommend that Miss Morry's appointment be confirmed by the Department.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Graham is being notified in this connection. School Inspector Harris is absent in Northern B.C. at present, and is not expected to return till about the end of the month, otherwise he would have written you on this subject.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.T. Ditchburn\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nFather Scheelen recommends that a Sister of Service be appointed as teacher. Negotiations have, I understand, been in progress between the Rt. Rev. Gerald Murray, Bishop of Victoria, and Father Daly of Toronto, with reference to the recommendation of such a Sister of Service as a teacher. I have an experienced Roman Catholic girl -- Miss Mary Wadel -- available. Miss Wadel has had successful experience in the Osyoces Indian Day School and in the Seabird Island Indian Day School. She is strongly recommended for further employment by Mr. Indian Agent Graham and Mr. Indian Agent Coleman. Though she has not attended Normal School, she holds various summer school certificates and would, I think, prove a success in this part-time school.\nJuly 2, 1951.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. SCOTT,\n\nYou will remember that the Department practically promised to re-open the Saanich Indian Day School, on Vancouver Island. Mr. School Inspector Barry and Mr. Indian Agent Graham, at the request of Commissioner Ditchburn, have gone into the matter carefully and have recommended a new building at a cost of from $1,000 to $1,200. They believe it would cost $800 to put the old building in shape and it would still be more or less unsatisfactory. There are 15 children of school age available and there has been considerable publicity given to the lack of educational facilities there. $1,000 is voted in the Main Estimates for this purpose, and I beg to recommend that a building be provided. If we secured a carpenter foreman from Victoria, he could cooperate with Commissioner Ditchburn and the work could be done on a day labour basis, employing Indians as far as possible.\n\nR.H.T.\n\nRussell T. Harris\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSeptember 29, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Plunkett:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General has drawn my attention to the interview with you, concerning the education of the Indian children at Saanich. Recently, the Department decided to give favourable consideration to the re-opening of the Indian day school there next year. It is proposed to hold classes from October to May. In the early summer of next year, Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn will report on repairs and equipment that are necessary and will secure the services of a suitable teacher.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nD. B. Plunkett, Esq., M.P.,\nVictoria,\nB. C.\nSeptember 29, 1930.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

Scott\nOttawa, August 27, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to your 15/3/16301 of December 20th, last, and to my reply of January 14th, I have now to state that the Department wishes to give favourable consideration to the re-opening of the Saanich Indian Day School next year. During the coming summer, you should report what repairs and equipment are necessary and endeavour to secure the services of a suitable teacher who could commence duties on or about October first. It is proposed to conduct this as a school from October to May only.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nFor Secretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nAm 85 drawn\nmy attention interview.\nAugust 25, 1930.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Thomas G. Murphy,\n\nWith reference to the attached letter from the Secretary of the Victoria branch of the British Columbia Women's Institutes, I have to report that the education of the Indian children of the West Saanich Reserve presents a problem somewhat difficult of solution. An Indian day school could be only partly successful because the Indians do not remain at home from May to October. They gather seaweed in May and June, pick berries in Washington State during the summer, go fishing in the early fall and work in the hop fields until October is well spent.\n\nAll healthy children would be welcome at one or other of the Indian residential schools, where splendid facilities are provided; but, as yet, recruiting activity has not been particularly successful, on account of the unwillingness of the parents to send their children to boarding institutions. Of course, some of the children are not physically fit for the intensive training at residential schools.\n\nThe Department is seriously considering conducting a winter day school on the reserve, but the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current year is completely assigned. If Commissioner Ditchburn, of Victoria, reports favourably next spring, I intend to make repairs to our old school building, supply the necessary equipment and engage the services of a competent teacher for the winter months. If the school proved successful, it would be continued.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nOttawa, January 14, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to your 15/5/16301 of the 20th ultimo, I have to state that the Appropriation for Indian Education is very limited at the present time and I am not prepared to authorise the re-opening of the Samish Indian Day School. At a later date, if you are satisfied that a good attendance would be probable, the matter will be reconsidered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nActing Asst.

This is the second visit that the Inspector has made to this school during the current academic year and one part of his report reads as follows:\n\n\"I am very far from satisfied with the work now being done at this school. I am afraid that I must recommend that the Department make a change of teachers here. An energetic young teacher would make a very great difference at this school. I simply am unable to believe that Miss Morry has any further interest in this school outside the fact that it provides her with a pay cheque each month. From a professional viewpoint though good work was done for some two or three years here, the past year or two years have been largely a complete failure. The decline in the work has been progressive and inclines me to think that the teacher is not well.\"\n\nPlease inform Miss Morry that her services as teacher at this school will not be required after the end of June.\n\nThe nomination of the teacher for this school has, in the past, been referred to the Catholic Bishop of Victoria and the local Catholic missionary. Please communicate with these gentlemen and have them nominate a qualified teacher to take charge of the school after the summer holidays. As soon as you hear from them, you should submit their nomination to the Department, giving full particulars regarding the age, qualifications, experience, etc., of the teacher they recommend.\n\nMr. Barry suggests that this school only be conducted from October each year until the end of the following May. Do you concur in this suggestion? The Department doubts the advisability of making an exception in the case of this school. If this procedure was adopted, it is felt that it should apply to all the schools in the Cowichan Agency. Please let me have your views in the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F.

In this connection applications will be forwarded in due course.\n\nIn regard to Inspector Barry's suggestion that the school only be conducted from October to May, this does not all together meet with my approval, as the same applies to all the schools in this Agency, and if the Indians think they do not have to return their children to school till October, they will want to keep them out till November. I think even though we may be short of pupils when the school opens it is much better to make the Indians know that the children are to be returned to school as soon as they return from the hop-picking.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

Her letter of resignation has however now been received through Mr. Indian Agent Graham of Duncan, and I have forwarded it to Mr. Phelan in Ottawa.\n\nAs time is rather short I am taking upon myself the responsibility of requesting you to nominate on behalf of His Excellency Bishop Cody a successor to Miss Lovick.\n\nYou know of course the circumstances of this little Indian Day School located on the east Saanich Road. Miss Lovick lived with her aunt's people the Hagans near the Catholic Church.\n\nIn the nominations made by His Excellency Archbishop Duke no provision has been made for Miss M.T. Hughes who for the past several years has been teacher of the Songhees Indian Day school. This girl is now available for appointment to another school though I have not been able to give her very good reports. She is a very nice girl and you may wish to consider her. Miss Hughes address is 1259 Richards Street, Victoria, B.C. She has been informed of the vacancy at Tsartlip and instructed to apply to you should she so desire.\n\nA Miss Florence A. Roussel, B.A., of Box 162 Agassiz, B.C. has applied here for consideration in the case of any vacancy. She appears to be a good candidate and I have asked her to write to you also. I have not as yet seen this candidate though she was asked to call here when convenient.\n\nYou have I know at least one local candidate as you mentioned her to me when I called on you.\n\nMay I remind you that teachers in Indian Day Schools must hold the full academic and professional qualifications necessary for teachers in this Province.\n\nI should suggest that you consider the matter and when you have come to a decision communicate direct with Mr. P. Phelan, through the Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa. You might let Mr. Phelan, the Indian Commissioner for B.C., know the name of the teacher you have nominated.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6400, file 830-1, part 1)\nMiss M. T. Hughes,\n1259 Richards Street,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nJuly 27, 1938.\n\nDear Miss Hughes:\n\nI have just been informed that Miss Lovick has resigned her position at Tsartlip to accept a position in Burnaby.\n\nSo far I do not believe that His Excellency Archbishop Duke has been able to see his way clear to nominate you for a teaching position in the Archdiocese of Vancouver.\n\nShould you wish to be considered a candidate for the vacant position in the Tsartlip Indian Day School, you should write at once to the representative of His Excellency Bishop Cody, Mag. A.G. Baker, V.G., at 740 View Street, Victoria, and if possible arrange for an interview with him.\n\nThe nomination of a qualified teacher to fill the Tsartlip vacancy will no doubt be made directly to the Department by the representative of the Bishop. I have nothing whatever to do with the matter.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Schools,\n\nG.H.B.\nMiss Florence A. Roussel, B.A.,\nP.O. Box 162,\nAgassiz, B.C.\n\nDear Miss Roussel:\n\nSince writing to you on July 13th I have not heard if you still desire to be considered a candidate for a teaching position in an Indian Day School working under Catholic auspices.\n\nI shall be away from Vancouver for the next three weeks, and could not see you during that time should you come to Vancouver.\n\nMay I suggest that, as I have little to do with the nomination of teachers for vacant positions, you write to His Excellency Bishop Cody, Bishop's House, 740 View Street, Victoria, B.C.\n\nThrough the appointment of a teacher to a position on a city school staff there is an unexpected vacancy at the Tsartlip Indian Day School, a Catholic school located on the Saanich peninsula near Victoria.\n\nThe Bishop of Victoria or his representative will no doubt make his wishes known to the Indian Affairs Branch in Ottawa by nominating a qualified teacher to take charge of the Tsartlip school from September 1st next.\n\nI do not know of any other positions likely to be vacant. His Excellency Archbishop Duke is I understand nominating a male teacher to take charge of the Seton Lake school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI wish to acknowledge with thanks the receipt of your 985-Z-3 addressed to the Indian Commissioner, and your 986-Z-3, both with reference to the resignation of Miss G. Mary Lovick, the present teacher of the Tsartlip Indian Day School.\n\nA copy of Miss Lovick's resignation is being forwarded to Mr. Phelan at Ottawa, and in the mean time I am asking His Excellency Bishop Cody of Victoria, through his representative Right Rev. Msgr. A.G. Baker V.G., Bishop's House 740 View Street, Victoria, B.C., to nominate to the Department in Ottawa a qualified and experienced teacher to take the place of Miss Lovick at the Tsartlip Indian Day School.\n\nI do not think that there is anything more that you should do pending the receipt of instructions from Ottawa, or the receipt of the Department's approval of the appointment of the teacher nominated by the Catholic authorities.\n\nThere are one or two available teachers and names are being forwarded to Msgr. Baker to aid him in his selection. I understand he has other candidates as he mentioned to me at least one teacher when I saw him by appointment a week or two ago in the matter of the nomination for a teacher at the Songhees School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI am forwarding herewith a copy of a letter of resignation addressed to Indian Agent Graham, Cowichan Agency, by the present teacher of the Tsartlip Indian Day School, Miss Gertrude Mary Lovick. Copies of other letters with regard to this matter are also attached for information.\n\nOn behalf of the Indian Commissioner who is away I would recommend that under the circumstances the resignation of Miss Lovick be accepted.\n\nAs there is not much time I have asked the Right Rev. Msgr A.G.Baker V.G. 740 View Street, Victoria, B.C. who is acting for His Excellency Bishop Cody, to forward direct to you the name and qualifications of the teacher he wishes to nominate to fill the position left vacant at Tsartlip through Miss Lovick's resignation.\n\nI hope that you will approve of the action which I have taken in this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nAugust 4th, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th ultimo, the Department accepts the resignation of Miss Gertrude Mary Lovick as teacher of the Tsartlip Indian Day School.\n\nIt is noted from your letter that you have requested the Right Reverend Monsignor A. G. Baker, V.G., to write direct to the Department nominating a teacher to take charge of this school on September 1st. Your action in this regard is approved.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division\n\nGerald H. Barry, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.,\nP. O.

Miss Kennedy holds a first class B.C. certificate and  \ntaught successfully last term in the Palmer Bay, Indian School  \nclosed due to lack of sufficient pupils. Her application has been  \nwarmly recommended by Inspector of Indian Schools, Capt. G. Barry.  \nMiss Kennedy is a young Catholic lady of this parish and diocese  \nwith considerable experience in Provincial School work as well.  \nI therefore consider that she will fill the appointment to the  \nTsartlip Indian Day School, Cowichan Agency, with credit if you  \nwill be so kind as to approve her nomination.\n\nYours very sincerely\n\nRt.

As far as I know, the present teacher, Miss O'naugh V. Kennedy, will remain in charge of the school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nTsartlip Indian Day School\n\nThis school was last inspected by me on April 12th 1940, when there were 35 children on the school roll and 10 present.\n\nThe present teacher is Miss Oonaugh V. Kennedy age 24. This teacher has greatly improved the academic work at this school during the past year.\n\nThe school building is a very small one and belongs to the department. There are several children who might attend here from other Saanich Indian reserves were the department to provide a small consolidated school and a school bus service. A large automobile would probably be sufficient. These matters were reported on in my Saanich survey report and later on Page 5 of my survey report on Small Indian Day Schools, dated January 8th 1940.\n\n| Month     | 1935-36 | 1936-37 | 1937-38 | 1938-39 | 1939-40 |\n|-----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| September | 5.5     | 6.8     | 5.2     | 13.0    | 13.4    |\n| December  | 15.1    | 11.8    | 11.2    | 11.8    | 10.4    |\n| March     | 11.2    | 10.4    | 11.1    | 15.0    | 12.5    |\n| June      | 11.2    | 11.2    | 6.8     | 12.0    | ?       |\n\nIn my report on Small Indian Day Schools mentioned above I recommended that this school be operated on a nine months basis from September 1st yearly. I showed that the Indians are away fruit picking in the U.S.A. in June.\n\nUnder present regulations this school will reopen on October 1st 1940. I would recommend that the academic year at the Tsartlip Indian day school, whether the consolidated school suggested be erected here or not, be one of only eight months from October 1st to May 31st yearly.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Cody, Bishop of Victoria, has taken up with this office the question of the provision of a second classroom at the Tsartlip Indian Day School to relieve overcrowding and also to provide a separate teacher for the higher grades, suggesting the parish hall which is situated a short distance from the school for this purpose.\n\nThirty-three pupils were enrolled at this little school at the time it was inspected by Inspector Gamble last fall of whom 28 were present. The Inspector's report shows that twenty were in grades 1, 2 and 3 and thirteen in grades 4, 5, 6 and 7.\n\nThe matter of the repairs necessary to make the Parish Hall suitable for classroom purposes was referred to Mr. Indian Agent Moore who has estimated the cost at approximately $325.00, which amount does not include the necessary blackboards and fuel.\n\nI understood from Bishop Cody that he would be visiting Ottawa shortly when this matter would be discussed with the Department.\n\nIt is quite true that the existing accommodation is much too small and I am inclined to agree with Bishop Cody that the use of the Parish Hall until a new school can be provided would considerably improve matters for both teachers and pupils. The proposal submitted would in addition to the cost of repairs and equipment, etc., involve the payment of a small monthly rental for the use of the building and the appointment of a second teacher at a salary of $90.00 per month plus bonus.\n\n/KT\n\nD.M.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nI desire to refer to that portion of your letter of the 27th ultimo which mentioned the request you had received from Bishop Cody for a school at West Saanich.\n\nI had an opportunity of discussing this matter with Bishop Cody on Saturday afternoon and he feels that there is a necessity for this school and that it should be operated under the general direction of the present teacher of the Tsartlip School. I understood from Bishop Cody that the proposed new room is a comparatively short distance from Tsartlip. It has been decided to recognize this second room as an adjunct of the Tsartlip School. Bishop Cody will nominate a qualified member of the Order to which the teacher at the Tsartlip School belongs. Salary will be allowed at the rate of $90 a teaching month, plus bonus.\n\nDuring the course of our conversation Bishop Cody stated that he understood from Inspector Coleman that surplus desks were available at some other schools and consequently it would not be necessary to purchase new ones. If this is correct, you may arrange for the transfer of these surplus desks, but, if you have to purchase new desks, you may do so.\nThe Department also approves an expenditure of approximately $200 for minor alterations to the parish hall and we will allow a nominal rental of $10 a month for this building. I presume that arrangements will be made to open this extra room in September and no doubt you will advise me as soon as Bishop Cody nominates the teacher.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nExtract from letter dated July 24, 1944, received from Rt.

Of course the department would have to provide the few desks required, improve the lighting somewhat, provide the fuel and possibly make a few minor alterations but I feel all this could be done for about $200.00 or less. Please let me know if you approve of this arrangement. My address in the East will be 184 Bayswater Avenue, Ottawa, Ontario, in case you may wish to contact me.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Some of us are inclined to think that a complete change of teaching staff is needed in that school, for although we have no direct evidence to substantiate our opinion, the fact remains that the children do not like their present teachers who might be alright in a Residential School but quite unsuited in a Day School. There is certainly a marked difference in the spirit existing in the Tsartlip School, where we have Rev. Sisters teaching also, than there is in St. Catherine's although the facilities and conveniences at the latter school are very much greater. I am of the opinion that if a change could be made in this school, that all the teachers should go there at present, for certainly we are not getting results now, even with the Truant Officer.\n\nR.H.

The cheque for September has not yet been received, and I would suggest that payment of it be cancelled and another one issued in favor of Sister Maureen Regan, as it is not likely to turn up at this late date and is not in the Post Office at Saanichon, B.C.

This particular school has shown what can be done with a good teacher, which we have now in Sister Maureen Regan. The Indians are all cooperating, which is something new for that particular Band. The Nurse has paid bi-monthly visits to the two Day Schools in Saanich and also to the schools on the Cowichan I.R. It is intended to have Miss Hayward also make a monthly visit to the Sonchees School commencing this month. A system of card index on each school child attending school is being inaugurated by the Nurse in co-operation with the teachers. These cards are the same as those used in the Provincial Schools and put out by the Dept. of Public Health. If the scheme is carried out far enough it will eventually mean that we will have a complete medical history of every Indian on the Agency. The Nurse also plans to have a card on every child of pre-school age which can be given to the school to which the child is eventually sent. The plan will also be inaugurated in the residential School as soon as the children all return.\n\nR.H.

I am very pleased to nominate in her stead Sister Maureen Regan of the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. She holds a B.A. degree and the California Teacher's Credential but to my mind has the practical qualifications of disposition and experience which are even more important where work among the Indians is concerned. I believe she has had several years previous experience part of which was among the Mexican Indians with whom she was very successful.

Her salary belongs to the Institute and is deposited with the Procurator of the convent in which she resides. The salary is administered by the Procurator under the direction of the Superior, to provide for the material, physical, and educational needs of the community to which Sister belongs.\n\nThe above statements being true, I believe that Sister Mary Corita Kent is according to the Canadian Law exempt from taxes. The law reads, according to a quotation taken from a letter of Mr. Norman Lee, Income Tax Inspector, as follows:\n\n\"When a contract is entered into by individual members of a religious institution, by virtue of which remuneration is paid directly to the contracting incumbent and the member receiving such income belongs to a religious institution, order, or community which requires him to take a vow of perpetual Poverty, the income of such a person is not taxable.\"\n\nI trust that this statement may serve to clarify any doubt in the minds of those concerned as to the identity of Sister Mary Corita Kent and the ground on which she claims tax exemption.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nSister M.

However, I discussed this letter with Mr. Hoey today and we feel that some further action on the part of the Department is indicated. I am, therefore, forwarding the letter to you with a view to ascertaining if there is any institution in which you consider the boy could be placed.

Sister Elizabeth Marie Brady, I am forwarding herewith the usual forms duly completed by Sister Brady.\n\nA separate communication has already been forwarded to the Department with respect to the exemption of the various Sisters employed as teachers in Indian Schools in the Cowichan Agency from income tax and consequently it is presumed that TD 1 form attached will not be required nor the cost-of-living bonus form as it is understood that if exemption from taxes is claimed, cost-of-living bonus is not paid.\n\nD.

Both these teachers hold California State Teachers' Certificates. Would you please have Inspector Davey check with the Provincial Department of Education to ascertain if there is any way in which these certificates can be converted to provincial teaching certificates, as required by our salary schedule.\n\nEncl.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour Files 152-14-1 (W T)\n152-15-1 (W T)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letters of June 4th and 9th, District School Inspector Davey's memorandum of July 17th in connection with the conversion of California State Teachers' Certificates held by Sister M. Socorro, teacher at the Seaniich Day School, and Sisters Elizabeth Maria Brady and Mary Ethel, teachers at the Tsartlip Indian Day School, to Provincial Teaching Certificates, is enclosed.\n\nYou will note that applicants for conversion of such certificates require Canadian citizenship and possibly attendance at one of the Provincial Normal Schools. It is doubtful if the teachers concerned would care to follow this procedure and under the circumstances I concur in Mr. Davey's recommendation that Sister Mary Ethel and Sister Elizabeth Maria Brady be classified as Grade 3. I would also recommend that, pending an inspection of her work by Mr. Davey, Sister Maria Socorro be classified as Grade 3 too.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nJuly 17, 1947.\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nTo: Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nFrom: Inspector of Indian Schools.\n\nI refer to Mr. Neary's letters dated June 4th and 9th, 1947, covering the possibility of converting the California State Teachers' Certificates of Sister M. Socorro, Sister Elizabeth Maria Brady and Sister Mary Ethel to provincial certificates. The Registrar of the Department of Education for B.C., has informed me that his Department will not consider a conversion until the teacher has Canadian citizenship. After that the teacher's academic qualifications would be referred to the University of British Columbia for classification. If the University gave credit for Senior matriculation standing or better, the applicant would then be required to attend one of the Provincial Normal Schools.\n\nI agree with the remarks of Mr. Indian Agent Moore that both Sister Mary Ethel and Sister Elizabeth Maria Brady are doing successful work. These teachers show evidence of sound training, and I rank them among the better teachers in our schools. I would recommend them for Grade 3 classification if the regulation of the Department permitted.\n\nI have not inspected the work of Sister Maria Socorro and cannot comment on it but I note that she has similar professional and academic training.\n\nR.F.

HEGY\n\nAmerican School Teaching Certificates\n\nAs you are probably aware, we have three excellent members of a religious Order teaching in our Saanich Day Schools.\n\nThe question of converting their American junior high school teachers' certificates to Canadian teachers' certificates was referred to Inspector Davey for consultation with the Provincial Department of Education. His answer hereunder is self-explanatory. Our salary regulations in this regard read as follows:-\n\n\"Time spent by a duly certificated teacher as a teacher in the public schools in any part of the British Commonwealth, or as an Instructor in a University in any part of the British Commonwealth, shall be regarded as time spent in teaching in the schools of the Indian Affairs Branch, provided that the maximum period of such teaching service to be regarded shall not exceed five years. Such teachers must also have attended one professional or academic session at a Summer School Course recognized by the Indian Affairs Branch in order to qualify for the increments described above in the Regulations for grades of teachers.\"\n\nYou will note that this does not specifically define the actual certificate necessary for classification on our schedule. Elsewhere in the Bulletin we have said that special consideration would be necessary for teachers holding English and other teaching certificates.\n\nI would appreciate hearing your views upon this problem.\n\nBernard N.

The purpose of today's letter is to identify Sister M. Ethel Swain, teacher at Tsartlip Indian School, Saanichon, B.C. that she may claim tax exemption.\n\nI wish to state that Sister M. Ethel Swain is a member of the California Institute of the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary of which the undersigned is the Superior General.\n\nFurthermore, I wish to state that Sister M. Ethel Swain as a member of the Institute of the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, cannot by virtue of the vow of Poverty which she has taken, use the salary which she earns personally. Her salary belongs to the Institute and is deposited with the Procurator of the convent in which she resides. The salary is administered by the Procurator under the direction of the Superior, to provide for the material, physical, and educational needs of the community to which Sister belongs.\n\nThe above statements being true, I believe that Sister M. Ethel Swain is, according to the Canadian Law, exempt from taxes. The law reads, according to a quotation taken from a letter of Mr. Norman Lee, Income Tax Inspector, as follows:\n\n\"When a contract is entered into by an individual member of a religious institution, by virtue of which remuneration is paid directly to the contracting incumbent and the member receiving such income belongs to a religious institution, order, or community which requires him to take a vow of perpetual Poverty, the income of such a person is not taxable.\"\n\nI trust that this statement may serve to clarify any doubts in the minds of those concerned as to the identity of Sister M.

Sister Elizabeth Marie who started this project asked the J. Paul be given more strawberry plants this fall but I pointed out to her that, since he had planted 1500 plants last spring, he would be able to get sufficient new plants off his own patch to plant any additional acreage that he could handle. In future when projects such as this are contemplated, I would recommend that not more than 500 plants be given and only to those who have land that was cultivated the previous year.\n\n(Sgd) W. J.

I do not understand why money is wasted in having a well dug and then no simple method of making use of the water for the school supplied. This partial carrying out of my recommendations is of course quite useless to the school children and results in an expenditure of Public Funds that could not possibly be justified.\n\nThe toilets are in fairly clean condition. I noticed paper flying about the vicinity of the boys' toilet, the seat of which should be kept dry. Chloride of lime will be needed during the summer. I asked the teacher to keep these toilets under constant inspection.\nOttawa, April 11, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools, in a report on his recent visit to the Tsartlip Indian Day School, states that no pump was installed in the well which was dug last year, and that this partial carrying out of the work in connection with the well is quite useless to the school children and has resulted in an expenditure of public funds that cannot be justified.\n\nThe Department understands that this well was completed early last summer. If a pump has not yet been installed, it will be necessary to supply same, and I have to request that you will furnish an estimate of the cost of supplying and installing a pump and any pipe, etc., required. This matter should receive your prompt attention, as it would appear that this well is useless without pumping facilities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\nDuncan, B. C.\nApril 18th, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have Departmental letter of April 11th, in connection with installing pump in the well that was dug last Summer for the Tsartlip Indian Day School. I very much regret the delay in this, but it was left on the advise from the late Commissioner. We had great difficulty in locating a site for this well, and after it was dug we did not strike water and had to wait until it filled up with surface water last winter, and we felt that we should wait and see that this water was good.\n\nI have price a pump with pipe connection, and it will cost approximately $15.00 to instal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, April 27, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, regarding the installing of a pump in the well that was dug last summer at the Tsartlip Indian Day School, and giving an estimate of the cost of the pump with pipe connected.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase of a pump of a type that would be satisfactory and for any pipe required in connection with the installation of same. I enclose herewith Encumbrance Certificate authorizing funds for the purpose. The expenditure should not exceed your estimate, viz., $15, for the pump installed.\n\nPlease obtain an account, in triplicate, covering the cost, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. You should state on each copy of the voucher that the expenditure is incurred under authority of Encumbrance Requisition No. 316.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH.

Mr. Barry suggests that the floor should be washed at least once a month or that it should be oiled and Dustbane used daily in sweeping.\n\nYou will remember that this matter was brought to your attention by official letter of April 27, 1932. Subsequently you forwarded a voucher for $3.00 for labour in washing, cleaning and oiling the floor. Apparently the floor was cleaned at that time but, as mentioned in the first paragraph of this letter, the Inspector considers that it again requires attention. I would point out that payment of $2.50 a month is made to the teacher for janitor services. It is considered that, from this amount, she should expend sufficient to have the floor washed regularly.\n\nYou may purchase a small supply of Dustbane to be used for sweeping.\n\nThe Department trusts that you will give this matter your immediate attention, in order that there may be no further complaint. You should also advise the Department when you have taken action in the matter.\n\nMr. Perry is being authorized to purchase and forward to the school the three new desks recommended by the Inspector.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE. R. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\nOttawa, December 5, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your 15/32029 of the 25th ultimo, enclosing Inspector Barry's report regarding his recent visit to the Tsartlip Indian Day School.\n\nMr. Agent Graham is being written with reference to the floors.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and forwarding to the school of one No. 2 Crown desk and two No. 3 Crown desks. It is noted that these three desks can be secured at a cost of approximately $21.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst.

He further states that the present little stove burns wood but is not protected and is badly placed in the room.\n\nPlease let me have a recommendation from you in connection with the above matter and if you consider a new stove is necessary you should give full particulars and an estimate of its cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nR.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease refer to your letter of July 31st last, File No. 152-14-5 relative to the report of Inspector Barry on the Tsartlip Day School. I did not reply to that letter owing to the fact that just the day before your letter was received I wrote Major MacKay recommending the kind of a heater that would be suitable for the school, the cost of which would be $32.00 wholesale, F.O.B. Victoria. The present heater is most unsuitable for this, or any other, school building.\n\nI also asked in the same letter for a small grant of $15.00 to erect playground equipment, consisting of swings, teeter-totters & basketball boards & hoop.\n\nI spoke to the Commissioner afterwards about the letter and he said that he sent on my letter to Ottawa with his recommendations. However, to date no authority has been received to purchase the heater neither have I received the necessary authority for the playground equipment.\n\nWhile on the Tsartlip School question I would respectfully direct your attention to my letter of July 4th last with attached requisition for school supplies for this school, some of which were authorised in Mr Hoey's letter of July 15th. File # 152-14-5. However, a soft-ball and two bats were not authorised and I would respectfully ask that I be given authority to purchase these locally.\n\nKindly take the various matters mentioned above into consideration and advise as soon as conveniently possible.\n\nYour obedient servant;\n\nThe Secretary;\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nMines & Resources.\nOttawa.\n\n(R.H.Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 22, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant Commissioner MacKay has been authorized to purchase a heater for the Tsartlip Indian day school.\n\nYou may expend $15.00 in the purchase of playground equipment and you may also purchase a playground ball and two bats.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

If the Department would be kind enough to allow a small monthly grant for cocoa, milk and sugar amounting to $5.00 I am sure that it would be a great blessing to these children, especially some of those who take their lunch\u2014such as it is\u2014to School. While some of the others who go home for their lunch, and don't get much, could take what little they do get to school and augment it with Cocoa. This will also mean that 26 enamel cups and half a dozen tea spoons should be supplied which the teacher could procure very reasonable at the 15\u00a2 store in Victoria.\n\nIf the Department can see their way clear to approve of this suggestion, I will then try a further step which I hope will eventually prove a success, and that is to have each child bring a couple of raw potatoes and some raw vegetables each day to school which could be prepared and cooked by the bigger girls under the supervision of the teacher and then divided up among the children in the form of a hot vegetable dinner at noon. This I feel would be a distinct benefit to the children and would not take any of the responsibility of caring and feeding the children away from the parents or guardians.
