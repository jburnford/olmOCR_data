Christmas, with all its joyous associations of bygone years, seems to be more in summer climate, as upon us once; more and more the reason why so much of what is now done in these northern latitudes, should not enjoy ourselves as much as our more favored brethren in other lands, who have the holy and the musical to grace their Xmas festivals.\n\nThe great religious feature of Christmas is the universality of its observance. Not only wherever the English language is spoken, but wherever the Christian religion is known, the bitter day of winter is observed. In every quarter of the globe, the doctrine of peace on earth goodwill toward men, at this joyous season of the year is acknowledged and celebrated. From the farthest regions of the north, to the languishing lands of India, the same glad tidings of great joy, as were told by the angels to the shepherds on the plains of Judea, eighty-three hundred and eighty-two years ago, are proclaimed and welcomed by Indians and aborigines.\n\nWhat attracts our attention? But observe their rapt attention.\n\nThe glorious feature of Christmas is celebrated, and so may it, until time shall be no longer.\n\nBut it is not only its religious aspect that Christmas should be welcomed, as the most joyous season of all the year. As a season of social reunion, and reunion, when every man must meet his fellow, and forgetting the cares of present anxieties and belongings, extend to him the hand of fellowship and brotherly love, who would be willing to forego the softening influences of Christmas?\n\nLet us then, one and all, endeavor to make our homes, our friends, and neighbors, bright merry Xmas, not forgetting, on this, the threshold of the natal day of Him, who hath said, \"the poor ye have always with you,\" even in the favored town of Prince Albert, then, by whose scarce Xmas fare, we can replenish out of the plenty with which we have been favored.\n\nAbove all let us make it a happy day for the little ones. Let them be happy, and let them have the full fill of mirthful jollity, and all manner of good things. Care and sorrow will come soon enough in this weary world. Let them then, for one day in the year at all events, forget their troubles, and hearts content. Do not allow all things destroy their abiding belief in the reality of all the associations of Xmas, hallowed as they are by the traditions of centuries. Do not abuse, those absurdities of old ideas that old Santa Claus, in corporeal presence does actually descend the chimney, to fill the expectant stockings, bestowing his blessing upon the sleeping innocents the while.\n\nAnd we the elders with whom the stem and stern of life, have somewhat blunted our keen enjoyment of Xmas festivities, cannot we live over again our childhoods days, in witnessing the joys of our children, and by taking part in their fun and trimmate efforts, cheer up the young agers. There are some among us, who have lately taken up their abode here, who will spend their Xmas, thousands of miles away, from the loved ones at home, and whose feelings will necessarily be somewhat tingled with sadness. They will look forward to the future, from the anticipation of happy days, and of the happy Christmases they have spent in their boyhood's home. In the happy time, after, also I'm sure they will wish they could have been amongst us on our dear island, to see our Xmas.\n\nLet us then, one and all, enjoy ourselves in our own way, in our joyous Xmas, and give our thoughts to our dear friends, our patrons, subscribers and readers, and the good people of Prince Albert generally, we wish them all a Merry Christmas.\n\nThere is no doubt that an express line of stages, for the conveyance of passengers and carriage of light goods, between this place and Edmonton, would be a great convenience to the enormous rise in the quantity of mail wagons are sometimes obliged to refuse to take passengers, which was the case on the last trip. We think this would be a great benefit to the travelling public and to business men in Prince Albert, if a line of stages were run say once a week, in summer, and fortnightly in winter. Who will start it?\n\nAmongst the many wants of Prince Albert there is one more pressing than any other, a town hall or building of some kind suitable for public meetings, holding of courts, etc. The Dominion Government should build a suitable Court House, and provide a suitable place for the use of the public in this respect. A joint stock company should be organized to purchase a suitable building and no doubt it would prove a popular concern.\n\nLEARNER'S CATHOLIC MISSION.\n\nIn our last number we mentioned how the mission was now being carried on, and the importance of the mission work of the order of Oblates, an order prominent in the North West. We are informed that the mission has been very successful from the proper sources. The work so far has been mainly amongst the Indians, who have been visited extensively, and the Indians are the interior, and extends from the men of Mass., and the Indians of the interior, and the members of the order are still there, devoted to their work, and many of them have been converted, and others have been educated, and sent back to their tribes of the North West to convert others. They have been probably, and they have been very successful in their work. They have been in the country of the Indians, and the Indians have been very successful in their work. They have been very successful in their work.\n\nMISS MACK & CO.\n\nHardware!\n\nChains,\n\nRope,\n\nGlass,\n\nPotatoes.\n\nPotatoes.\n\n$15 REWARD\n\nLOST\n\nTwo Ponies\n\non the Ride, back of the Farmer's Home.\n\nLost on the Ride, back of the Farmer's Home.\n\nMichael Dumas\n\nLowest Prices\n\nJ.

During the last week a large stack containing ten or twelve tons, was totally carried away by the wind. Mr. Taylor, of that vicinity, and we have heard of others who have suffered in a similar way. This is a case which should be looked into by the police and the guilty parties as possible brought to justice.\n\nThe recent appointment of the Rev. Dr. O'Brien, a priest of a small country parish in Prince Edward Island, to the recently created archiepiscopal position of Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Halifax, N.S., has given great surprise to secular and religious circles in this province. On a visit which he paid to this province, it was evident that an admirable case of an obscure country parish, is presented over here by his eloquence and learning, which is in the highest estimation in his archiepiscopal position in his archiepiscopal see. Dr. O'Brien is a native of Prince Edward Island, but has been educated abroad, but has already attracted attention by his abilities as an author and preacher. He will still be remembered as the author of such books as \"The Priest,\" and \"The Bishop,\" and about 200,000 pages.\n\nWe would call the attention of the Superintendent of the Meteorological Service in Toronto, to the importance of establishing a station here. We consider that the climate of this country is very suitable for the service at John's College, Winnipeg, and certainly we are entitled to have a full report of the weather, that they would furnish, the necessary meteorological observations, but the annual grant was not sufficient to meet the expenses of the observatory. The idea that they could do would be to keep a small room for taking the observations, and under the best conditions that during these times, they would be taken voluminously. If this can be done, it will be a great advantage to the people of this part of the country. Meteorological observations should be taken in the North West Territories.\n\nTO THE PUBLIC.\n\nWe have made arrangements to have papers at J. Agnew's hardware store, the Post Office, T. M. Campbell's news store and Hinkley & Co.'s dry goods store. Those living outside of the town of Prince Albert may have their newspapers delivered. Also at this store.\n\nJ.

The company will be known as the \"Prince Albert and District Agricultural Company,\" and will be located at Prince Albert and will be engaged in the business of farming and raising cattle and will make every effort to promote the welfare of the people of the district.\n\nSPINK & MAVETY,\n\nPROPRIETORS.\nTOWN NEWS.\n\nMr. Geo.

Range 200 yards, open small bores. Pipes can be seen at Mr. Robertson's.\n\nOn January 1st, Sunday school entertainments will take place in the Methodist Church, at 7 p.m., when a collection will be taken up for the benefit of the Sunday School and the Orphanage. Do not forget it.\n\nThe fall of snow has been very heavy, and the crops are now being gathered in the vicinity of Prince Albert. Between three and four feet has already fallen on the average, and every other day or two more falls are expected. The crops have been cut, and the fields are already covered with several inches of hard dry snow.\n\nThe salesmen have been taking advantage of the fine weather and good ice, but few days ago, a mob led by Mr. Johnston, who lives opposite Mr. Johnston's store, and every day the knights of the ice, came out to try and drive the snow from the streets. It was a very amusing sight.\n\nNotwithstanding the delays and inconvenience caused by the snow, the navigation of the river this autumn, there is a larger stock, and greater variety of goods in Prince Albert than was ever known before. Some of the stocks are very valuable, ranging from $500 to $1,000.\n\nMr. Nicholas Bond, owner of the Toronto Globe, is making arrangements to establish a newspaper in the new town. He hopes to be able to order material, and in a short time there will be another addition to the literature of Prince Albert. We understand that a house of $5,000 has been erected by the inhabitants to start the enterprise.\n\nBy referring to our advertising columns it will be seen that a rifle shooting match will also be held on New Year's Day, open to all comers. The prizes of which there are twenty-five, are given by the merchants of Prince Albert, and are well worth shooting for. Particulars can be had by applying to D. R. Pender, Jas. Knowles, of Macintosh & Knowles, or Mr. Bond.\n\nA. Hobbs has just put his new first class hotel in running order, which is doing a very brisk business. He has fifty regular boarders, and does a large business with travelers. The hotel will be known by a Union Jack displayed at the top of the building. His friends in town will be glad to hear of his success in the rising town of Prince Albert. He also has a saloon attached, stable in connection with the hotel.\n\nIn reply to a circular from the Post Office Department, we have received the following statistics, as regards the Town of Prince Albert: Population of town, 3,600; number of houses, 400; denominations 8; schools 3; and Emmanuel College, now mills 2 steam; flour mill 1; lumber yard 1; stores 23; hotels 6, including boarding house, value of real and personal estate, about $2,500,000. We shall soon publish a list of the new buildings erected in Prince Albert this year with their cost.\n\nThe district Judge had some difficulty getting horses after having been as appear from the latest news from the Saskatchewan Herald of November 11th. \"Col. Richardson returned on Friday last from a visit to the officials of the eastern divisions of the Saskatchewan District. On his way from Prince Albert horse was stolen, and although he tried to get the horse back, he could not go off to walk, until the last day he met relief teams that had been sent out to meet Col.
