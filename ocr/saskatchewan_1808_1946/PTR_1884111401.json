To go into an examination of the causes which have produced this state of public sentiment, and separate such as the people may blame themselves for from those which may not unreasonably be laid to the charge of the Government would be a work of time. We content ourselves at present with the assertion that the causes are of the two kinds indicated. We are of the opinion that the policy of the present Government is attributable to ignorance on the part of those in authority of the amount of feeling engendered by things which may pass unnoticed by them at the moment, but which are thought about, at all times, as being of no real moment. We infer from the fact that many of the things which cause intense irritation here, cannot possibly be of any importance to them, to induce, by instance, the risk of the alienation of the good will of the people generally. We believe it to be acting the part of true friendship to the Government to do as we are pleased to point out that in matters of what we have referred to, as may from time to time occur. It has fallen to us on several occasions when writing in our columns to call attention to what must be clearly kept in view, with regard to the peculiarity of the bearing upon our circumstances of the building of the C.P.R. Once more we put on record the fact that this undertaking is not near enough to us to lessen by a fraction the cost of freighting in our necessaries, while by putting places hitherto affording us a market for our surplus produce in easy communication with the town below, that market so vital essentially to our welfare has been developed. This advantage, however, does not actually seem to entitle us to special consideration at the hands of the Government, the more so when the amount of perseverance and endurance displayed by the company during its development under such circumstances is remembered. Now surely it is not asking much to demand that such supplies as are required by the Indians be purchased from us, instead of maintaining the Indians, which can be done by purchasing from us. Supposing we by no means admit the purchase of these supplies, then should not a little more thought be given to the matter than just to incur the slight extra expense in order to foster those settlers who have given up so much and endured so much in opening up this country, to valuable a country land as this vast territory? Beyond dispute this must be not only the most generous, but in the long run the best paying policy. That the Government will not do this, we do not deny, but hope that an extension of the policy will give us the much required enlargement of our markets. We must point out that the Government has acted with great distinctness, whatever the direction we receive, and that directions can only be made of real value to the community at large by the adoption of the only fair system by which competition is permitted to exist. That this policy must be the best for the Government requires no demonstration, and we may assure them it is the only one that can be acceptable to the people. If they desire that the contractors for their money may purchase must be made from the people, but it should be a part of the Government's policy to lend its aid and increase the wealth and power of any one who at the expense of others. We want to open competition, without favor, or if any be shown, that it be to those who will keep and circulate their money in the community. In a competitive field merchants must take much of their pay in produce, it is of the last importance that one should have as good a chance of converting the produce so taken into cash, as another, and that the money be given by mutual partiality to one, must necessarily end in the creation of a monopoly, with the most disastrous results to every member of the community. That in days gone by, the most important thing was the favor of one large interest in the Territories has been made with respect to land and money is the strong opinion of many, and any further extension of privilege in the same direction will be jealously watched for and most bitterly resented.\n\nG.

LOUIS, MISSOURI, U.S.A.\nOUR COURTS.\n\nOne of those causes at work to produce strong dissatisfaction with and irritation towards the Government of this district is to be found in the lamentably defective nature of the arrangements made for the administration of justice, civil and criminal. The inconvenience, delay, loss and miscarriage of justice which may necessarily result from the irregularity and uncertainty\u2014under the present system apparently unavoidable\u2014with regard to holding courts by the stipendiary magistrate whose course bears with equal hardship on all sections of the community, although the force of contrast may render it peculiarly offensive to those who have, under their arrest herebefore where the legal machinery works with the utmost regularity.\n\nThe amount of detriment to the public interest pointed out very clearly in our columns at an earlier time, which happened last year, between the crises in the interval between the removal of Col. Richardson and the appointment of Judge Robson, was borne out by the fact that there was no impression that, with a little trouble and foresight on the part of those responsible, the annoyance might have been avoided.\n\nThis summer's matter of the telegraph operator, caused no need of inconvenience to the law-giving part of our community, and now again have we been most seriously deranged by what, surely, must be supposed to be the probable contingencies and with a just appreciation of the public interests at stake, to have allowed him reasonable time to complete his journey from Battleford to Regina, but by too late advertised for the holding of court, we must attribute to a visitation of Providence in the shape of snow storms, which deferred the opening from Monday until Friday last. With regard to legal perfunctoriness, impertinence, despatch in business, accompanied by patience in investigation, and personal dignity, in fact to all the elements which constitute a good court, we should certainly think so when we have Judge R. Dean on the Bench, whose tact is nothing left to be desired, but none the less may his usefulness be greatly impaired by want of promptness whether validable or not. This, which under any circumstances could not fail to be the case, is especially so when owing to the distance he must have as a rule to travel and the unusual difficulty in securing the attendance of sailors and their witnesses in a population to a considerable extent migratory, the miscarriage of justice must be in consequence of the impossibility of those at great sacrifice have put in an appearance at the appointed time hanging on to the neglect of all their other interests indispensable to their livelihood, even at the time when those intending to leave here desire to start, and those intending to stay here to fix up for the approach of winter, and in many cases owing to the absence of thoroughbred steers, it is peculiarly unfortunate. To catalogue the individual cases of hardship would be a lengthy process, and it must suffice to say that an inadequate availability of the services of the keeper of things is simply intolerable. The fact of the matter is that our district's present amount of law business\u2014steadily on the increase imperceptibly during the administration here of a resident stipendiary magistrate\u2014that such an appointment need entail upon the Government a cost, in proportion to the interests at stake, ridiculously small, is easily demon-\n\nDRY LUMBER.\n\nMOORE & MACDOWALL\n\nWish to inform the Public that they have on hand and for sale a Half Million Feet of Dry Lumber, consisting of Matched, Dressed and Undressed.\n\nDresseed Flooring, $48\nUndressed do., 42\nDressed Siding, 48\nUndressed do., 42\nSheeting, 30\nCommon Lumber, 35\nDimension do., 40\n\nLath, 75 cts. per bundle.\nShingles, $6 50 per M.\n\nWe are prepared to Contract for Buildings as cheaply as any firm in Town.\n\nBuilders paying Cash or giving good security for LARGE Orders will have a reduction made.\n\nTHE PRINCE ALBERT TIMES AND SASKATCHEWAN REVIEW.\n\n$2 50 PER ANNUM.\n\nThe Times is the best medium in the Territory to advertise your business in.\n\nAdvertise in The Times and you are certain to succeed in your business.\n\nSubscribe for The Times and get the latest news and happenings around town.\n\nJOB PRINTING\n\nOf all descriptions done neatly, quickly and cheaply.\n\nSPINK & MAVETY, - PROPS,\nRIVER ST., PRINCE ALBERT, SASK.\n\nFIRE I FIRE I FIRE I PUMPS!!\n\nMade and always on hand at greatly reduced prices.\n\nWaggons, Rockboards and Bogies paired with mowers and dispatch.\n\nWILLIAM CROSS,\n\nOwner London's blacksmith shop.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06", "created": "2025-10-06", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_sask_test/PTR_1884111401.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 4, "total-input-tokens": 5996, "total-output-tokens": 8301, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 17532, 1], [17532, 25189, 2], [25189, 29264, 3], [29264, 33829, 4]], "primary_language": ["en", "en", "en", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false]}}]
