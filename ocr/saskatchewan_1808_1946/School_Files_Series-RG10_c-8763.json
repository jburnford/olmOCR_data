Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for any quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CARIBOO INDIAN RES.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

(RG 10, Volume 6437, file S78-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CARIBOO INDIAN RES. SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: Michael Murphy\n\nDated July 7th, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at William Lake\n\nJuly 7th, 1942\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CARIBOO INDIAN RES. SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1942.\n\nPrincipal: Michael Murphy\n\nDated July 31st 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at William Lake, B.C.\n\nthis July 7th 1942\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

(RG 10, Volume 6437, file 878-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**William's Lake, B.C.**\n\n**Agency**\n\n**REPORT OF the Cariboo Indian Residential School at 150 Mile House**\n\n**on Reserve for Quarter ended Sept. 30th, 1942**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OF STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTERING TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 0334            | Lucy D.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................School for the Quarter ended..................................................19......\n\nPrincipal ...........................................................................\n\nDated ..........................................................19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent ...........................................................................\n\nDated at ..........................................................this ..................................................19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 409\nReo.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ......................................................

(RG 10, Volume 6437, file 878-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The annual per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nthis [Date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFone No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

(RG 10, Volume 6437, file 878-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ......................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2; and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Location]\n\nthis [Date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. L.A. 106\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cariboo Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1944.\n\nPrincipal: John W. Hennessy\n\nDated: October 1st 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: W. Christie\n\nDated at Williams Lake this 20th October 1944\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of boys pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cariboo Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 1st, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this ........................................... 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cariboo Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th 1944.\n\nPrincipal: John W.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2 and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cariboo Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: John W.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended 19\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 19\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cariboo Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1945.\n\nPrincipal J. M. Smith\n\nDated July 5th 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Williams Lake, B.C.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: April 5, 1942.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Williams Lake, BC.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days pupils are listed on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended 19 .\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 19\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cariboo Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: Oct. 11, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at Williams Lake this October 21, 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

(RG 10, Volume 0437, file 878-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the return and is a running total, adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nIN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

(RG 10, Volume 6437, file 575-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Gariboo Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 20, 1948.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Williams Lake, B.C., this October 20th, 1948.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cariboo Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 20, 1948.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Williams Lake, this October 22, 1948.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in quarter for all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cariboo Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 20, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Williams Lake, this October 22nd, 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFoun.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days pupils in residence pupils enter into the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 4, 1949...\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this ........................................... 19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. IA. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Williams Lake Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the Cariboo Indian Residential School at 150 Mile House, B.C.**\n\n**Reserve for Quarter ended March 31, 1949**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | SEX | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE ON OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 372             | Percy Hink      | 10  | M   | Stoney         | Grade 1           | Farming & Carpentry     | Nov. 1-45                   | 90/72      |\n| 373             | Augustine Tenele| 13  | M   | Canoe Creek    | Grade 1           |                         |                             |            |\n| 374             | Edward Archie   | 12  | M   | Ganim Lake     | Grade 1           |                         |                             |            |\n| 375             | Charles Gilbert | 10  | M   | Win's Lake     | Grade 1           |                         |                             |            |\n| 376             | John D.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall any adjustment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 372             | Percy Hink     | 10  | 1   |      | Stoney         | 1                 | Farming & Carpentry     | Nov. 1-46                   | 91/72      |\n| 373             | Augustine Tenalo | 13 | 1   |      | Canoe Creek    | 1                 |                          | 1-45                        | 13/8       |\n| 374             | Edward Archie  | 12  | 1   |      | Canim Lake     | 1                 |                          | 1-45                        | 91/72      |\n| 375             | Charles Gilbert| 10  | 1   |      | Win's Lake     | 1                 |                          | Sept. 1-46                  | 91/72      |\n| 376             | John D.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in which all pupils enter the Return and is entered by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertainable by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended 19 .\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 19 .\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19 .\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Williams Lake Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the Cariboo Indian Residential School at 150 Mile House, B.C., on Reserve for Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1949**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|---------------|------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 321            | Robert Gilbert  | 16  | 1   |      | Williams Lake | 1                | Farming & Carpentry       | Sept. 1-41                  | 62         |\n| 332            | Stanley Peters  | 16  | 1   |      | Soda Creek    | 1                |                          | 1-42                        | 87         |\n| 334            | James F.

When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, may payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return, and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cariboo Indian Residential School School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 19...\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated Oct. 19...\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this... 19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Williams Lake Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the Cariboo Indian Residential School at 150 Mile House, B.C.**\n\n**Reserve for Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1950**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 388             | Freddy Samson         | 12  | 1   |      | Canoe Creek    | 1                 | Farming & Carpentry     | Sept. 7-47                  | 74/11      |\n| 390             | Frank Peters          | 11  | 1   |      | Soda Creek     | 1                 |                          | 10-47                       | 62/18      |\n| 391             | James Kalalst         | 11  | 1   |      | Canoe Creek    | 1                 |                          | Oct. 2-47                   | 62/18      |\n| 392             | Isidore Kalalst       | 9   | 1   |      |                | 1                 |                          | 2-47                        | 62/18      |\n| 393             | Noel Frank            | 9   | 1   |      | Canim Lake     | 1                 |                          | 3-47                        | 83/18      |\n| 394             | Henry Frank           | 9   | 1   |      |                | 1                 |                          | Nov. 11-47                  | 88/23      |\n| 395             | Wilfred J.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will any credit be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the... Cariboo Indian Res. School... School for the Quarter ended... Sept... 19...\n\nPrincipal... [Signature]\n\nDated...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the rate of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included, on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cassiar Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated Oct. 2, 1950.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at Williams Lake this 5th October,

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 3, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will allowance be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered for the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Gariboo Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 1, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. IIA. 403\nReq.No. 2752\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Willams Lake Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the Cariboo Indian Residential School at 150 Mile House, B.C., on Reserve for Quarter ended March 31, 1950**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 388             | Freddy Samson   | 11  | 1   |      | Canoe Creek    | 1                 | Farming & Carpentry     | Sept. 7-47                | 90/72       |\n| 389             | Frank Peters    | 10  | 1   |      | Soda Creek     | 1                 |                          | Oct. 2-47                 | 90/72       |\n| 390             | Freddy Christopher | 14 | 1   |      | Ganim Lake     | 1                 |                          | Oct. 2-47                 | 90/72       |\n| 391             | James Kalalst   | 10  | 1   |      | Canoe Creek    | 1                 |                          | Oct. 2-47                 | 90/72       |\n| 392             | Isidore Kalalst | 8   | 1   |      | Canoe Creek    | 1                 |                          | Oct. 2-47                 | 90/72       |\n| 393             | Noel Frank      | 9   | 1   |      | Ganim Lake     | 1                 |                          | Oct. 2-47                 | 90/72       |\n| 394             | Henry Frank     | 9   | 1   |      | \"              | 1                 |                          | Oct. 2-47                 | 90/72       |\n| 395             | Wilfred J.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 20th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Canadian Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Jan. 5, 1945.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this ........................................... 19 ...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Williams Lake Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the Gariboo Indian Residential School at 150 Mile House, B.C.**\n\n**Reserve for Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1949**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 386             | Freddy Samson  | 11  | 1   |      | Canoe Creek    | 1           | Farming & Carpentry      | 207 Sept. 7-47              | 92         | 71                                                                                               |\n| 389             | Frank Peters   | 10  | 1   |      | Soda Creek     | 1           |                          | 207 Oct. 10-47              | 92         | 71                                                                                               |\n| 390             | Freddy Christopher | 14 | 1   |      | Ganim Lake     | 1           |                          | 157 Oct. 10-47              | 66         | 49 returned late, Oct. 27, unauth.                                                              |\n| 391             | James Kalalst  | 10  | 1   |      | Canoe Creek    | 1           |                          | 197 Oct. 2-47               | 87         | 67                                                                                               |\n| 392             | Isidore Kalalst | 8   | 1   |      |                | 1           |                          | 197 Oct. 2-47               | 87         | 67                                                                                               |\n| 393             | Noel Frank     | 9   | 1   |      | Ganim Lake     | 1           |                          | 207 Mar. 3-47               | 92         | 71                                                                                               |\n| 394             | Henry Frank    | 9   | 1   |      |                | 1           |                          | 207 Mar. 3-47               | 92         | 71                                                                                               |\n| 395             | Wilfred J.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent [Signature]\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Williams Lake Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the Cariboo Indian Residential School at 150 Mile House, B.C.**\n\n**Reserve for Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1949**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASSES | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0410            | Dora Johnson   | 12  |     |      | Alkali Lake    | 1                   | Domestic Science       | 207 Sept. 1-46           | 92         | 71                                                                                           |\n| 0413            | Irene Archie   | 10  |     |      | Canoe Creek    | 1                   |                       | 207 \" 1-46              | 92         | 71                                                                                           |\n| 0414            | Angelina Hink  | 10  |     |      | Anaham         | 1                   |                       | 207 \" 1-46              | 92         | 71                                                                                           |\n| 0415            | Margaret Wyott | 10  |     |      | Wm's Lake      | 1                   |                       | 207 \" 1-46              | 92         | 71                                                                                           |\n| 0416            | Catherine Boyce| 11  |     |      | Canim Lake     | 1                   |                       | 207 \" 1-46              | 92         | 71                                                                                           |\n| 0417            | Marie L.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Place]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cariboo Indian Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cariboo Indian Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cariboo Indian Res. School School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1951.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated April 5, 1951.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at Williams Lake this April 6th, 1951.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cariboo Indian Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cariboo Indian Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CARIBOO INDIAN RES.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered in the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CARIBOO INDIAN RES.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CARIBOO INDIAN RES.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cariboo Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended January 31, 19...\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: January 31, 19...\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at:\n\nthis:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cariboo Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended 31st December 1951.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 31st December 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this date 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cariboo Indian Res. School School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1952.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 7, 1953\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cariboo Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended 19...\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: 19...\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Williams Lake, B.C., this October 31st, 19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND OR RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|-----|-----|------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 400             | Samson Wyotte         | 11  | 1   |      | Alkali Lake     | 1 4 4 7 2 1 1 | 1                 | Farming & Carpentry    | Sept. 6-48                   | 88 16 late - unauth.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cariboo Indian Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per pupil, rent day per quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cariboo Indian Res. School School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1957.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated October 9, 1957.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Williams Lake, BC,\n\nthis October 31, 1957.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cariboo Indian Res.

RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cariboo Indian Residential School School for the Quarter ended April 30th, 1952.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: April 30th, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cariboo Indian Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ...............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the........................................................................................................School for the Quarter ended.................................................................19......\n\nPrincipal...................................................................................................................\n\nDated..................................................................................................................19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n....................................................................................................................Indian Agent\n\nDated at................................................................................................................this.................................................................19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND OR RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENROLLMENT TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|-----|-----|------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0518            | Victorine Jack        | 11  | 1   |      | Canoe Creek     |                |                  | Domestic Science       | Sept.9-52                     | 544        | Late arrival                                                  |\n| 0519            | Matilda R.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of grant payable per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cassiar Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended January 31, 1933.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: January 31, 1933.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cariboo Indian Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereon.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cassiar Indian Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the........................................................................................................School for the Quarter ended..................................................................................................................19......\n\nPrincipal...........................................................................................................................\n\nDated.........................................................................................................................19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n............................................................................................................................Indian Agent\n\nDated at....................................................................................................................this.........................................................................................................................19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the.................................................................School for the Quarter ended..................................................19......\n\nPrincipal..................................................................\n\nDated.................................................................19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at.................................................................this.................................................................19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. IA. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Williams Lake Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the Cariboo Indian Residential School at 150 Mile House on Reserve for Quarter ended December 31, 1952**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND OR RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STARTING IN | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 475             | Daniel Abel Harry | 9   | 1   |      | Alkali Lake 1    |               |             | Farming & Carpentry       | Sept.1/52                    | 92/65      |\n| 476             | Frank (Rocky) Michel | 6   | 1   |      | Williams Lake    |               |             |                          | 1/52                        | 92/65      |\n| 477             | William Alphonse  | 10  | 1   |      | Williams Lake    |               |             |                          | 1/52                        | 92/65      |\n| 478             | William Sulin     | 10  | 1   |      | Anahim Lake 1    |               |             |                          | 14/52                       | 92/65      |\n| 479             | Antoine D.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for whom grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

M. Daly\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nI humbly beg to state that two years ago I undertook to carry on an industrial school for the Indians of William's Lake Agency at the Roman Catholic Mission William's Lake, the Federal Government granting an annual capitation of $150.00 for each of fifty pupils and I devoting to said purpose the actual school buildings of the Mission, consisting in two separate houses, one for the boys and the other for the girls.\n\nThere are today at the said Industrial School 24 Indian Boys and 18 Indian girls.\n\nBut it has happened that the building for the girls needed be repaired and enlarged and I had to expend last year four thousand dollars in said building. And now I receive a letter from the Revd. Father Lepage, Principal of the Industrial School, stating that the school-house for the Boys is becoming old and is also too small, so new building is required. It will necessitate a considerable outlay which is entirely above my means.\n\nI humbly beg that the Dominion come graciously to my assistance.\nin granting once for all the sum of five thousand dollars and so enable me to erect said new construction.\n\nShould such grant appear too large, I would humbly bring to your notice that I have already expended four thousand dollars in repairing and enlarging the Girls' building, I had to make a big outlay in providing beds and beddings and other furnitures for the two Departments, and I have still to lay out a good amount of cash in erecting the necessary workshops to train the boys in blacksmithing, carpentering, shoe and harness-making, besides the buying of the tools and various implements for such trades.\n\nI feel confident that you will take my demand in due consideration and grant it.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nDear and honorable Sir,\n\nyour humble servant\n\nPaul Durieu, O.M.I.\n\nP.C.

In the meantime, I must apologize for taking such liberty.\n\nI came from British Columbia, at the request of His Lordship, Rt. Bishop Macdonald, to ask you, Honorable Sir, to give your kind attention, first to Williams Lake Industrial School, and next St. Mary's Mission School (the latter in my charge) both for the exclusive education of Indian children.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6437, file 878-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUE CANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nI have remitted to your private Secretary, a letter from the Bishop, explaining what is needed at Williams Lake. Last summer, at the time of your official visit to British Columbia, I had the honor to meet you, Honorable Sir. I then spoke to you about the insufficiency of my school at St. Mary's Mission, for our Indians (Catholics) of the Fraser River Tribe.\n\nWe have obtained from your kindness, an allocation of $2 per capita per annum, for 75 pupils. Needless to state that we had, under the able Mr. Denney, obtained a part of your said allocation, that is $100.00 for 75 pupils. I am glad to say that the Indians wish more earnestly for, and understand better the advantages of education. And consequently, Indian children benefit far more by what they learn in school.\nIn conclusion of all this, I apply for more, \"that is to raise the number of our pupils to one hundred at the rate of $60.00 per Capita per annum,\" and that to commence 1st July 1844.\n\nConsidering the great needs of our Fraser River Indians, improving their condition, the application in giving satisfaction to those vested with power over them; consider the large number of children in age to go to school; I hope that you will not find their request unreasonable and you will be able to correspond with their just desire.\n\nHoping to hear from you,\n\nI remain, your humble servant,\n\nP.M.O.

(RG 10, Volume 6437, file 878-5, part 1)\nSt. Joseph's Industrial School\n\nThis was handed in by Mr. Williams, B.C., 16th July 1896.\n\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby apply to the government for some help toward raising the girls' department so as to have plenty room and proper accommodations for the girls. I will state that the boys' department and the girls' department are two separate buildings; these buildings were put up by the missing long ago and used for many years as boarding schools for boys and girls. When an Industrial School was granted to them, William John Wilson, the government offered his Lordship William Duncan to take charge of the school, he took charge of the said buildings for the purpose. At these buildings were old and not quite up to the mark, we made application to the government who saw the justice of our case and granted us a loan of $250 towards the boys' department; thanks to the kind donor, we have been able to put up a fine school house for the boys. It is two stories and a half high; the building is considered as the finest in the Cariboo District and is a credit to the country. Now we request we are confident that the government seeing what good use we have made of the first loan, will grant us a second bonus of $250 to enable us to finish the girls' department so that it will look as the counterpart of the boys' department; this is what we want to do.

You gave me hope, may you make me feel sure that I would get the sum of $2,000.00 supplied for a much needed purpose. A few days after the receipt of your letter, a person connected with Mr. Scott wrote me that he had received a letter from Mr. Scott dated October 25th, and of his letter under the latter's signature came up last night, and included in the same was an amount of $2,000.00 for the Industrial School at William's Lake. This will be satisfactory and that you will kindly inform the people interested for me.\n\nHelping on that many fronts ahead, I finished the girls' department according to the plan specified in my application of the 16th July 1896. That for the girls' dormitory and I am paying 5% interest on these. It would look altogether unfair if the Department, after inducing me into an expense, refused to come to my aid and uphold that sum of 2,000 dollars voted for William's Lake Industrial School on the night of the 25th Sept. 1896. I am confident the Department will be true to its promise and will release the funds named sent me by Mr. Scott, M.P.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Finding the water closet was the wood shed and near the harness shop, they had to be sacrificed. We had scarcely time to save anything; in less than a half hour, the whole shop was a mass of flame.\n\nAccording to the statement read us and signed by the teacher, instructor, the loss is as follows:\n\nClothing (coats, blankets, handkerchiefs) is $125.00; besides, the instructor lost his gold watch $15.00; we lost our letters $3.00, our weight $30.00, our clock $6.00, and drapes $10.00. So here, so far, these articles were thrown away under the wood shed near the water closets. Total $1006.65.\n\nBearing in mind, providence and also confident that the Department will be coming to my help, I took immediate steps to replace what had been consumed by the fire. In order to comply with the wishes of the Department, who complained was not taking an except opportunity, I now put up a new building 30x40, two stories; on the ground floor will be the wood shop 20x40, and the office 10x10; on the second floor the instructor will have his lodgings and ladies' rooms, and the store room, his wood although the building is not quite finished yet to the present date, there is still the sum of $1006.65, which makes a total of losses together $2006.65.\n\nI hope the Department will meet me halfway and grant a loan of $1000.00 to help me out of my difficulties.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6437, file 878-5, part 1)\nFrank Pedley, Esq.\nDeputy Sect. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt through Indian Agent, Isaac Ogden, of your answer to my request dated Jan. 14th last, of a grant to help paying off a debt incurred through the necessary installation of furnaces and toilets for the pupils of this school.\n\nThis your answer is a simple refusal of all financial help. With all due respect I must say that I am very painfully surprised and with me the members of my staff. We trusted too much to the Department's sense of justice and equity as well as to its solicitude for the welfare of all Indian children in all the schools.\n\nBut as nothing in your letter indicates that this answer is final and as on the other hand I might not have sufficiently well explained the case I beg leave to again renew my request. I shall be pleased to give all and every explanation that the Department might need in order to adequately judge our case on its merits.\n\nIn my letter dat. Jan. 14th, I think, I have sufficiently well explained the absolute necessity there was for changing from small box stoves to furnaces. As this letter may not be on file any more, for convenience sake I enclose herewith another copy of it. On its perusal you will notice that I mention also as an important reason for the change: reducing to a minimum the danger of fire. First, we have reduced the number of chimneys to be watched from nine to two. Then without furnaces it is impossible to keep the water from freezing over night with the best possible care as has been\ndemonstrated again and again. Because we tried to follow the Department's rule: have pails filled with water always ready\u2014we have lost them nearly all through frost in one night splitting them. But now, with a little more improvement to the water works we can have a stream of water in any story of every building should fire break out there.\n\nAnother very necessary point that the furnaces have allowed us to improve is: sanitation and sanitary precautions. We have new toilets and bathtubs in the boys' and girls' department. We could not think of these before putting in the furnaces.\n\nIt may be objected that we did all this without first asking the Department's approval and submitting plans. I beg to answer that I had been told that the Department could not give financial assistance before knowing that the undertaking would be a success. I could not possibly give this assurance without first trying. But we were so confident in the final success that we made a loan in the hope that the Department would come to our help in an improvement so very necessary and so very successful just as it has given financial support to other schools in undertakings not less necessary than this one. In my letter of Jan. 14th last I wrote: \"Since a little over two months the furnaces have been burning practically day and night; the thermometer has registered already 23 below zero, but the children say: it is always warm in our school.\" I should think such a test is quite sufficient to prove the complete success of the work.\n\nIn further thinking of the possible motives the Department might have had in turning down my request it has come to my mind that perhaps the XXXX Department does not consider the results of this school sufficient to warrant the expenditure. I do not know in what this school might be (if it\nWilliam's Lake Industrial School\n\nis at all) inferior to such as have received special grants now and then. But I know that the inspector of Indian schools, A.R. Green, has always pronounced himself pleased with what we do and the way we do it. His reports in the blue books speak for themselves. I therefore fail to see why our efforts and our work should not meet with the same appreciation and encouragement as do other schools. During these nine years that I have been at the head of this institution we have received, as extraordinary grant, only twenty new school desks for the girls' department; total cost was not to exceed $122.10 This, of course, was not sufficient to pay for all, transportation costs included.\n\nI cannot well conclude without transcribing here from my yearly report what is said there of the pupils' health. \"Under this heading (HEALTH AND SANITATION) I have been happy to say since a number of years that the children of this school always enjoy excellent health. Indeed, our inspector of schools, Mr. A.R. Green, in 1906 already declared that in no other school he found the children as healthy as here. (Cf. Blue Book, year 1906, p. 488). This good record has been kept up again as we have no contagious disease, no serious case of any kind, no death to deplore. Not surprising then to hear Indians here saying when presenting their offspring for admittance: \"I'm afraid he'll die if I keep him.\" Hence the Department ought to feel relieved in knowing that any help extended to this institution produces more than a transitory benefit.\n\nIn order to still better explain the merits of our case I cannot pass over the fact that the school keeps on its own charge seventeen pupils above the allowed number (50). This number will be still more increased next July if I am able to purchase more beds.\nAgain it must be borne in mind that we are 135 miles from the nearest railway point and that goods are moved slowly at great expense by teams.\n\nOn account of all these reasons I pray the Department with all due respect to reconsider its answer and to give us the necessary help. I shall be pleased to give all and every explanation on any point you might call for.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nH. Boening\n\nPrincipal.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to submit to your earnest and kind consideration my humble request for a special grant as help in the payment for improvements that I was obliged to make in the heating apparatus and the sanitary condition of this school. These improvements have taken place principally in the girls' department. In the past years ordinary box stoves were the only means of heating at this institution. But in such a severe climate these could never give satisfaction. Besides, what a great and continual danger of fire, not mentioning the trouble in cleaning chimneys at least once a month and the cost in fuel and repairs. In the girls' school alone sixteen stoves were sometimes burning at the same time. So we decided to make a test. In the fall of '08 we put up in the boys' department a hot air McGlary furnace No. 316. The test was a severe one as the thermometer last winter registered as much as 54 below zero. Without being very comfortable in such unheard off cold the boys, however, found themselves in warmer quarters than the girls. Impossible for the latter to work in the schoolroom or sewing-room. We decided then to do away with the stoves in the girls' department also and put in two hot air furnaces. But much excavating had first to be done as there was no basement. I am happy here to seize this occasion to bring to your knowledge with what extraordinary good will and zeal both boys and girls helped in this work. During the months of August, September and October a basement was made nearly the whole length of the girls' school. The exact measurements are: 110 x 18 x 7 ft. No other tools but picks and\nshovels and buckets were used. Then we put in two hot air McClary furnaces No. 417, one with sixteen and the other with fifteen pipes. This work, too, was done by the principal with the help of the boys. We are all very pleased with the results. Since a little over two months the furnaces have been burning practically day and night; the thermometer has registered already 22 below zero but the children say: it is always warm in our school.\n\nWith the furnaces we have now also the great advantage of a never failing supply of fresh water without the fear of frost.\n\nThen these two very valuable improvements have allowed us to make a third one: up-to-date toilet-rooms in boys' and girls' department.\n\nAll these very necessary improvements, XXXXXXXXXX, of course, could not be paid for out of the per capita grant as this does hardly cover the running expenses of this school, situated 135 miles from the nearest railway station with 67 pupils at present. As may be seen by the enclosed receipts we have paid $600.00 for the two furnaces complete and $450.50 for sanitary improvements. These figures do not include transportation and installation costs. I trust therefore to the sense of justice and generosity as well as to the solicitude of the Department for the advancement of the Indians and hope to receive a substantial grant as a help in paying off this debt that, as I have shown above, was very necessary.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nyour obedient servant,\n\nH.

Unfortunately these had been mislaid and in order to gain time I asked Mr. John R.

He states that at present the Sisters and pupils are doing the washing in this institution, by hand, using the old fashioned wash board. Mr. Cairns states that, upon enquiry, he finds the four hand machines and four wringers would cost approximately $120.\n\nI have therefore to request that you will purchase these hand machines and wringers and have them forwarded to the principal. It will be necessary to obtain competitive prices and the purchase should be made from the firm quoting the lowest price. Please forward certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred, also a memo showing the names of the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted. The purchase of this equipment should receive your early attention. We are informing Mr. Agent MacLeod that you have been authorized to procure the articles.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nChief Inspector,\nIndian Agencies,\nVictoria, B. C.\nI visited the laundry and found the Sisters and pupils doing the washing of this institution by hand, using the old fashioned wash board. This is very heavy work. I desire most respectfully to recommend to the Department that 4 washing machines be procured for the school. After enquiry I find that 4 hand machines and 4 wringers would cost approximately $120.00.\nSir,\n\nI beg to confirm my night-telegram of today which reads as follow:\n\n\"Regarding Cariboo Industrial School heating plant Principal advises that he made personal investigations in Vancouver and decided on expert advice that the Robertson-Godson Co. supplied the only suitable warm-air furnace known as Pease Economy Heavy Duty Furnace. Two are required costing $670.00 each F.O.B. Vancouver, freight and installing by competent Heating man would increase cost considerably. Principal further advises that Department has already granted $5000.00 for this school's improvements. I have no instructions to this effect from you.\n\n(Signed) E. MacLeod, Indian Agent.\"\n\nI may say that the only instructions I have had from you was your telegram of August 17th as follows:\n\n\"You are authorized to build new chimneys and foundations under school for two hot-air furnaces Cariboo Indian Industrial School by day labor or by competent Contractor on a proven cost plus a ten percent basis. (Signed) A. F. MacKenzie.\"\n\nOn receipt of this telegram I sent a copy of it to the Principal of the school and I visited the school soon after and found that the Principal was in Vancouver looking over similar buildings to the Cariboo School and getting advice as to what was required in the furnace line. He has since let the contract to construct the chimneys and foundations to a contractor after getting figures from other contractors, a copy of which I enclose herewith.\nThe Principal claims that the Pessi Economy Heavy Duty furnace is the only suitable kind available for his institution and I have had correspondence with the Vancouver agents of this company in which they state prices as follows:\n\n| No. | Capacity   | Price |\n|-----|------------|-------|\n| 70  | 75000 feet | $670.00 |\n| 80  | 100000     | $820.00 |\n| 90  | 135000     | $992.00 |\n\nThey further state in their letter that they recommend No. 90 for the Cariboo School. However, the Principal states that since two are required, two No. 70 will do. I am advised that the Provincial Architect, Mr. Whittaker specifies these furnaces for all the Government buildings requiring a heater of these capacities. The company advises strongly that a competent heating man be placed in charge of installing the furnaces, and since this is the case, we must get such a man from Vancouver. His pay, together with the freight on furnaces and cost of brick at Williams Lake will bring the cost of the furnaces to about $1000.00 each.\n\nThis appears to be what the Principal of the School wants and as I have nothing better to offer I do not see any reason for any other recommendation.\n\nTrusting that this will meet with your approval,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(E.

Welch, O.M.I., Provincial of the Oblate Fathers in British Columbia, the following communication:\n\n\"Dear Father Guy:\n\nFather Maillard from the Cariboo or William's Lake School was down here last week and he assured me that the building of the chimneys this summer was imperative. The miserable pipes now in use are worn out and consequently are a perpetual menace to the school throughout the winter. Last winter, they were the occasion of two fires in the buildings. Luckily they were discovered in time and a serious calamity averted. I need not insist on the gravity of the situation. All that is necessary, I am sure, is to bring the matter to Mr. Scott's attention.\n\nYours very sincerely\n\n(Sgd) J. Welch, O.M.I.\"\n\nI leave the matter to your consideration and I hope that action will follow.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I would highly recommend that those requests be included in the estimates as they are a necessity and would help the school authorities to continue their work with greater success.\n\nJoseph [signature]\nOttawa, Oct. 26, 1922.\n\nDear Father Welch:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, concerning the pressing needs of the Cariboo Industrial School. I am favourably disposed to assist this institution, which has not received the special consideration of this Department for some years.\n\nIn a few days the first draft of the Estimates for 1923-24 will be prepared, and I will urge upon the Minister the advisability of presenting to Parliament an item which would cover some of the improvements enumerated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nVery Rev. John Welch, O.M.I.,\n59 Blackwood St.,\nNew Westminster,\nB. C.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nWe have never to my knowledge, certainly not in recent years, applied to the Department for any extra aid to maintain our Indian School in the Cariboo. I consider it my duty to do so now.\n\nThe Cariboo School was established in 1867. The enclosed photo shows the relative positions of the main buildings as follows:\n1- Boys' School\n2- Dining Rooms, Kitchens, Laundry, Bakery and Electric Plant.\n3- Girls' School.\n4- Barn etc.\n\nThe Boys' and Girls' Schools are a full block apart. Needless to say we have during the past sixty-five years spent much money on the Cariboo School; Repairs and improvements are constantly being made. In 1919 we installed a Delco Electric Lighting Plant at a cost of $2,200.00. In 1920 we spent $2,000.00 on a new sewer system, and about five years ago about $2,000.00 on a laundry and bakery.\n\nOther repairs and improvements are now urgently needed, and to these I now particularly wish to draw your attention.\n\nA. Two new hot-air furnaces.\n\nB. Six brick chimneys, at present we merely have stove pipes which are a constant menace to the safety of the buildings.\n\nC. A barn for the cattle. There is a small barn for the horses but none for the milch cows. In Winter and Summer the cows are milked in the open. Winters in the Cariboo are very severe, and as a consequence the cows yield practically no milk or butter for six months in the year.\nD.C.S.\n\nThe Girls' School should have foundations. In Spring and the early Summer the basement is flooded making it impossible to heat the furnace.\n\nLastly the water system is defective. Water for the School is brought from a lake a mile and a half away. What is required is a dam at the intake to enclose a greater body of water and to give greater pressure. Some days there is not enough water for the laundry, and when the laundry is being operated, there is an insufficient supply of water for the domestic purposes or for the barn and dairy. Probably $500.00 would be needed for the erection of a suitable dam.\n\nIf the above improvements were made we should be able to carry on for a number of years. We have not the funds to make the improvements ourselves.\n\nYou may wonder how we have succeeded in doing so much during the past few years. Allow me to explain; It was due to the high price we received for our cattle during the war. Then again we formerly had a ready market for our surplus hay, but since the construction of the P.G.E. Railway teamsters have deserted the Cariboo.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. Welch. O.M.\nExtract from Inspector's Monthly Report on the Williams Lake Industrial School dated May 12, 1915. Original on file 117123-6ty.\n\nFIRE PROTECTION.\n\nThere is not much force so it would not help much in case of fire. However the buildings are heated by furnaces, and the roofs are covered with galvanized iron. Then there are plenty of fire pails and some twelve Pyrene fire extinguishers. It will be seen that the protection from fire is fairly good.\n\nSgd. R. H. Cairns,\nInspector of Indian Schools.\nOFFICE OF\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES,\nSOUTHEASTERN INSPECTORATE.\n\nVERNON, B.

D. McLean,\n\nChg. Dept. I.A.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th September in which you inform me that the Reverend Principal of the Cariboo Industrial School had requested the Department to reimburse him to the extent of $450.00 to replace the cost of two chimneys in the girls' building following installation of two furnaces early this year.\n\nIn reply to your inquiry as to why it was necessary to tear down the two new chimneys authorized in August, 1923, and replace them, I beg to say that the explanation of this is that the two chimneys which were authorized in August, 1923, were erected for the two old furnaces in the school at that time though the management had been promised two new furnaces. Before the new furnaces were purchased I sent me it was deemed expedient to have a heating expert sent to the school to see just what was required and in Mr. Crane's report he made mention of the two new chimneys which had recently been erected but stated that they were not of sufficient area to accommodate the new furnaces, the old ones only having an area of 64 square inches (6\" square) each whereas the new flues would require to be 15\" X 20\" inside measurement. Evidently it was a mistake on the part of the management of the school to build any chimneys at all until they had ascertained the dimensions required for the new furnaces which had been promised, but I am inclined to think they did the best they could under the circumstances and that the Department should take a favorable view of the case and reimburse the Principal for his outlay.\n\nThe Principal tells me that he also had to go to the expense of $92.86 for some further smoke pipes which were sent to the school afterwards, but possibly he has rendered an account for this already.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

The Company replied that Mr. Crane had done considerable work for them and would have him send in a report, after the receipt of which they would order the furnaces from the East.

I have noted that the Principal will have to let this activity stand over until the Department can authorise the complete work. I am pleased to state that the desirability of providing this improvement will not be overlooked when our Estimates are being prepared for the coming fiscal year.\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Inspector Fragnell's report on the Cariboo Indian Residential School. He has mentioned the fact that there are no fire escapes and recommends that rope ladders and hooks be placed at the windows of the different dormitories. You should bring this matter to the attention of the Principal, without delay, and have him take action on Inspector Fragnell's suggestion immediately. I regret that the Department cannot authorise you to incur any expense in this connection. The Principal should finance the rope fire escapes from the per capita grant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\nOttawa, Nov. 15, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to that portion of your report, dated the 23rd ultimo, relative to the Cariboo Indian Residential School. I have noted that there are no fire escapes, and the Department is writing Mr. Indian Agent MacLeod, so that instructions will be given to the principal regarding a supply of hooks and ropes from the dormitory windows.\n\nYour remarks, with reference to the need for a dairy barn and the large number of children in this agency, have been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

C.\nKamloops, B.C., October 23, 1928.\n\nREPORT ON WILLIAMS LAKE AGENCY.\n\nSCHOOL - S. WILLIAMS LAKE AGENCY. SUPERINTENDENT:\n\nIn company with the Principal, Rev. Father Mailiard and the Agent, Mr. MacLeod, I thoroughly inspected this Institution. I find things on a whole most satisfactory, and everything is kept very neat and clean. However, there are not enough quarters for the boys, being only four, and quite away to be used. This is most unsanitary. I should suggest a supply of rope ladders and hooks under the windows, or a canvas chute in each dormitory.\n\nThe washing up arrangements in the kitchen to say the least of it, are ridiculous. There being only one sink for the boys' use at school. I consider the sister in charge took no notice on strike. I thoroughly recommend this as justified, if only on humanitarian grounds. During my visit, work was being done in replacing the foundations of the girls' wing on stone and cement foundations.\n\nFARM: The grounds appear to be very well farmed, but there is no dairy farm, and one should be erected, as the milk supply is most necessary for the well being and health of the children.\n\nGENERAL: Altogether, the Principal, Father Mailiard is to be congratulated on the excellent condition of the school and grounds. I am of the opinion, however, that more attention should be required in the practical training of the children, apart from actual chores. The school was practically full during my visit, and I mention this to draw attention to the fact that so many of the children in this agency are not getting any education whatever. This particularly applies to the children in the Okanagan Valley, Anahams, Riske Creek, Neskonlith and others, and something will have to be done in the near future to rectify this.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) C. S. Freeman,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Department letter No. 117123-5 dated Ottawa October 18th. I have visited the school since and owing to the frost nothing can now be done to the dam.\n\nThe Rev. Principal advises that we must let the matter stand until we can get enough funds from the Department to finish it in a proper and workmenlike manner. He claims that nothing can be done without hiring outside labour; cement will have to be purchased, some tools and scrapers as well as one or two wheel-scrappers, etc.\n\nI would suggest calling for tenders for this work some time next summer after the crops are planted in this district and before haying commences. I think we could get it done cheaper and better at that time. In any case we cannot do anything now as the matter has been delayed too long.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(M.

I realize that it is advisable for the Indian agent's office to know just what has, and what has not been, supplied; and in this connection I wish to draw your attention to the fact that you were informed as soon as the authority was granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE. MacLeod, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nClinton, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI am advised by the Principal of the Cariboo Indian Industrial School, also by R.A. Leonard of Quesnel, that the contract to repair the school basement and build chimneys is now completed; in fact, I examined this work in company with the Principal and the contractor on the 19th instant. I find that six new single and one double chimney have been constructed on the various school buildings, also a good substantial stone and cement foundation has been built under the girls' quarters, all done in a workmanlike and thorough manner. The contract price for this work was $2175.00.\n\nThe principal of the school has advanced the contractor over $300.00 on the work and he wishes to get a cheque for this sum. I think the proper course would be to send a cheque in my care to the Bank of Montreal, Williams Lake, and when I have instructions from Mr. Leonard to pay the Rev. Principal the amount due him I shall do so, also pay Mr. Leonard the balance. I am satisfied that all this is in order.\n\nThe only other bid on this contract was for the sum of $4350.00.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

I visit the school quite often and am always willing to investigate the need of any equipment and report on same to the Department. If the principal is to demand certain things from each of the Indian Department officials in connection with the school none of us will know just what has, or has not, been supplied. I would therefore humbly ask the Department that all requisitions for this school be sent originally through this office or at least through one channel.\n\nTrusting that I am in order in making this suggestion,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nIndian Affairs.

If any material or labour other than that of the school is required, the Department will, as mentioned in our night telegram, assist to the extent of $300. In the purchase of any material required, competitive prices should be secured; all purchased to be made from the firm quoting the lowest price.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you as to what outside labour would be required other than can be carried out by the staff and pupils of the school. It will be necessary, where outside labour is employed, to keep time sheets in duplicate. A supply of these forms is enclosed herewith.

You will be further advised.\n\nI regret that there are no funds available for the erection of a refrigerator plant. Please inform the Rev. Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. MacLeod, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nClinton, B. C.\nOttawa, May 27, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 15-5106 of the 16th instant, with reference to the construction of a cow barn at the Cariboo Indian Residential School. I am pleased to inform you that plans are being prepared and tenders will be called in due course. I note your recommendation that advertisements be placed in the Vancouver papers as well as in local publications.\n\nThere are no funds available for the erection of a refrigerator at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVictoria, B. C.\nHaving reference to your letter of the 20th April dealing with the question of the construction of a barn for the Cariboo Residential School, in the Williams Lake Agency, to which you attached a copy of your letter addressed to Mr. Indian Agent MacLeod, I beg to say that I have just received a communication from the Agent on this subject in which he states that he met the Rev. Father Welch and Rev. Father Millard, the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church, at the school and they informed him that they wished to have a barn similar to those which the Department built at the Kamloops and Lillooet Schools, also a refrigerator plant similar to that at Kamloops. The Rev. Principal stated that the barn should be large enough to stall thirty cows and calves, with feed rooms attached. Both the School Authorities and Mr. Indian Agent MacLeod are of the opinion that the barn should be built under the contract system, tenders to be called for through advertisements in the Ashcroft Journal and Kamloops Sentinel.\n\nWith regard to repairs to the mechanical plant, the Agent states the Rev. Principal did not make any mention of this point, and he feels that if any repairs were necessary the Principal would not have failed to say so.\n\nTo the above recommendation I concur, but think it would be also well if the barn is to be built by contract that the tenders should also be advertised in the Vancouver papers.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nMay 9th, 1925.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General Of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have just paid a visit to the Cariboo Industrial School, and am pleased to say that the institution in all departments is progressing most favourably.\n\nMr. McLeod the Agent happened to be there at the same time, and agreed with me that the cow barn and refrigerator should be erected without further delay. In this connection he has no doubt written you.\n\nLast year you were good enough to authorize two new furnaces and a stone foundation for the girls' school. These improvements were much appreciated last winter. Though the weather was severe the children and Sisters for the first time suffered no discomfort.\n\nI would now respectfully ask you to confer on us a similar favor in the building occupied by the Fathers and Brothers. The foundations are crumbling, and the furnace which has done duty for twenty years is nearly worn out and should be replaced immediately by another one at least a size larger.\n\nMr. R.A. Leonard who gave us entire satisfaction a year ago, has submitted to us an estimate and is prepared to put in a new stone foundation for $525.00. A certain amount of excavating will have to be made, but this can easily be done by the bigger boys.\n\nThe cost of a new and larger furnace will be\n\n$450.00\n\nI trust you will not consider these further demands unreasonable. Indian Agent McLeod without a doubt will readily endorse them.\n\nMay I take this opportunity to say how grateful I feel for the favor you have bestowed on Mr. Grimshaw.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6437, file 878-5, part 1)\nWhile at the Cariboo Residential School recently I was shown a telegram from the Department in reference to the proposed cow-barn and repairs to the mechanical plant of that Institution. Rev. Father Walsh Q.M., and the Rev. Principal of the School informed me that they require a barn that will stall thirty cows and calves with feed-rooms and hay-loft, and a refrigerator plant similar to that build for the Kamloops Residential School.\n\nIf it is decided to proceed with these buildings, it is essential that steps be taken without great delay as the seasons are short. Plans and specifications could be forwarded to this office and to Commissioner Pitblurn, Victoria. Contracts could be advertised in \"The Sentinel\" Kamloops, and \"The Ashcroft Journal\" Ashcroft; if necessary in one of the Coast papers also. I wish to point out that we have had previous correspondence over this matter and refer you to Department letters No.160-0-5, May 27, 1923 and No.117123-5, August 24th, 1923. I do not know of anything further to suggest in this matter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M. MacLeod)\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, April 30, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to confirm official telegram to you of today's date, as follows:\n\n\"Reference Father Welch's telegram to Father Guy, submit proposal for erection cow barn to Agent MacLeod, also indicate in detail with estimate of cost what repairs to mechanical plant at Cariboo School are urgent.\"\n\nIn view of the situation of the school, it is considered that the erection of a cow barn on a day labour basis might be advisable. However, I will await your proposal before making a decision in this connection. I am writing today to Mr. Indian Agent MacLeod, informing him that you are submitting a proposal for a cow barn and the details with an estimate of the cost in connection with the mechanical plant repairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. E. Mailhard, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nCariboo Indian Res. School,\n150 Mile House,\nB. C.\nOttawa, April 30, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that one of the Roman Catholic Church authorities, who is visiting the Cariboo Indian Residential School, has telegraphed to Ottawa with reference to the erection of a cow barn and repairs to the mechanical plant at that institution. I have replied by telegram, suggesting that the Rev. Principal submit to you a proposal for the erection of a cow barn and also a list in detail showing the mechanical plant repairs that are necessary and an estimate of the cost. I should be pleased if you, upon receipt of this communication from the school, would attach your recommendation and forward it to Mr. Indian Commissioner Ditchburn, who is receiving a copy of this letter.\n\nWith reference to the building of a cow barn, you should indicate whether you believe a day labour basis would be the most economical and satisfactory or whether it would be advisable to call for tenders.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE. MacLeod, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nClinton, B. C.\nOttawa, April 30, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing, for your information and guidance, a copy of my letter of today's date to Mr. Indian Agent MacLeod with reference to capital expense at the Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Maillard, Principal of the Cariboo Residential School.\n\nI obtained the copies of the receipts direct from Firm of McLennan & McFeely Co., Limited, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI trust that you will be able to find this Voucher now in order.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(E. Macleod) Indian Agent\n\nThe/\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSealed tenders addressed to the undersigned and endorsed on the envelope \"Tender for the Barn for the Cariboo Indian Residential School, at Williams Lake Agency, B.C.\", will be received up to noon of the 29th day of July, for the erection of the above mentioned building.\n\nPlans and specifications may be seen at the office of the Indian Agent at Kamloops; the Post Office at Salmon Arm; the office of the Indian Commissioner at Victoria; and at the office of the Indian Agent at Clinton, B.C., and at the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa.\n\nEach tender must be accompanied by an accepted cheque on a chartered bank of Canada for ten percent of the amount of the tender, payable to the order of the undersigned. (War Bonds of the Dominion or Canadian National Railway Bonds will also be accepted as security, or bonds and cheque if required to make up an odd amount), which amount will be forfeited if the person or persons tendering decline to enter into a contract when called upon to do so, or fail to complete the work contracted for.\n\nThe lowest or any tender not necessarily accepted.\n\nDUGAN G. SCOTT,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, 23rd July, 1925.\nDear Sir:\n\nAttention Mr. Orr.\n\nWith further reference to the matter of the construction of a cow barn at the Cariboo Indian Residential School, Williams Lake Agency, I beg to say that recently I received a letter from Mr. Indian Agent MacLeod stating that Reverend Principal Maillard had informed him that he was satisfied that Brother G. Lajoie, O.M.I., the carpenter, was fully qualified to superintend the erection of the barn. By this I take it that he considers there will be no necessity to appoint a building inspector.\n\nI note in your letter of the 27th ultimo that you say that funds will not be available for the refrigerator at this school. However, in connection with this refrigerating system, the Principal has stated that he believes the \"Kelvinator\" electric system would suit his school better than the system installed at the Kamloops School, because the \"Kelvinator\" could be operated from the Delco plant and it would cost less. The system, he claims, can be installed at the School for $975, whereas the style of electric plant for the refrigerator at the Kamloops School would cost $1,400 and the power would have to be purchased. This information I am conveying to you in the event of it eventually being determined to install a refrigerating plant for the Williams Lake School, which, to my mind, is as essential at that place as at Kamloops.\n\nI have asked Agent MacLeod to notify the Principal that there are no funds available for the erection of a refrigerator at this School, as noted in your letter of the 27th ultimo.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.

In case you have not received these, I am enclosing herewith a copy of the letter which was sent addressed to Mr. Holmsing by mistake.\n\nRegarding the cow stanchions the contractor was advised on the 23rd ultimo to install 30 cow stanchions. I note your remarks that you are not in a position to give an estimate of the cost of the changes asked for by the Rev. Principal. You should, therefore, obtain a price from the contractors for these changes and submit same to the Department with a full explanation of the extra work asked for. It is not considered necessary for you to employ an inspector to supervise the erection of this building. In a plain and simple building like a barn it is not thought that the expenditure would be warranted, and I would ask you, with the assistance of the Reverend Principal, to see that the building is built in accordance with the plans and specifications and to issue progress certificates to the contractor for payment on his contract.\n\nIt is regretted that the original letter of instructions was sent to Mr. Holmsing by mistake instead of to yourself.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I think we can get around that, Mr. MacLeod, in this way; we will quote you the regular school price as in the past. When you receive the machine you can place the White machines in the same crates, ship them in here and we will fix them up in as good shape as we can and sell them, refund you the proceeds, less actual cost of fitting them up. I think I would be safe in saying we could get you from $30.00 to $35.00 for the four. It may seem small but not knowing what they may be like we have to go on the safe side. I personally have to become good for the net amount of the Singers you get.\n\nI might say there is a slight change in the price since you last got a new machine from use. It came into effect October of this year. The machine which the Department always buys, known as 127-3-2 oak, 5 dr., was $38.40 net. The last price is $42.84 net.\n\nI don't know that we have had any orders from the Department since the new price went into effect.\n\nWe should not allow any more than $25.00 for the four old machines but if it will assist in getting the order through we would undertake to make it between $30.00 and $35.00.\n\nTrusting you will be able to favor us with your order, we remain,\n\nYours truly,\nSINGER SEWING MACHINE CO.\nL.W.

I am today placing an order with the Robertson-Godson Company, Limited, of Vancouver, for the furnace required for the boys' building. It will be shipped, freight prepaid, to 150 Mile House; but the account, in duplicate, with freight receipt attached, will be forwarded to you for your certificate.\n\nI note you will report, later, regarding the other needs of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

You should prepay freight to 150 Mile House. The shipment should be addressed to the Principal, Cariboo Indian Residential School. Please forward your account in duplicate, with freight receipt attached, to Mr. E. A. MacLeod, Indian Agent, Clinton, B. C. He will certify to it in due course and send it to the Department for payment. You will remember that in December, 1925, you supplied to this institution a similar furnace and the Department wishes to duplicate the order at this time. Please allow whatever discount is given in the case of a government department.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nF. H.

I shall also advise you regarding the other improvements you inquire about, as early as possible.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(E. MacLeod)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, May 19, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that certain funds are available for improvements at the Cariboo Indian Residential School. The Department wishes to repair the foundation of the boys' building and to install a suitable furnace. Please let me know, without delay, if you consider a Pease Economy No. 70 Heavy Duty Furnace, as lately supplied for the staff residence there, would be suitable. You should also state if you can arrange to have the foundation and walls of this building repaired, by day labour.\n\nThe Rev. Principal has lately urged the immediate provision of a larger kitchen range. You might look into this question, also, and advise me just what size is required. It is also represented that 160,000 shingles, 8 kegs galvanized shingle nails and 16,000 square feet of building paper are required for the proper protection of the different buildings at the school. Please inform me concerning the urgency of this improvement and give an estimate of the cost. If the Department supplied the materials, would the school management be responsible for the labour in this last connection?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE. MacLeod, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nClinton, B. C.\nOttawa, May 19, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the need of a suitable kitchen range at the Cariboo Indian Residential School. I am pleased to inform you that certain funds have been allowed for improvements at your institution and I am today writing Mr. Indian Agent MacLeod, asking him for his recommendation as to how these should be expended. The Department intends to repair the foundation of the boys' building and to supply a furnace. Mr. MacLeod will report concerning the urgency of the shingles and building paper, which you have requested. I am writing him particularly for his recommendation as to how the work should be undertaken. You will, no doubt, receive word from him in the near future concerning these matters. He will enquire into just what kind of a kitchen range is needed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. V. Rohr, C.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nCariboo Indian Residential School,\n150 Mile House,\nB. C.\nDear Sir,\n\nA week ago I wrote to Colonel Pragnell, our Inspector in connection with a magnificent bull which is for sale. I suggested the department to buy it for us for our milch herd.\n\nThe prize is rather high.\n\nThere are other things more needed than a bull. The number of our pupils has been increased and it is a very difficult task for our good Sister to prepare the food on the same range. A larger one is required which would cost over $600. As domestic science plays an important part in the education of the Indian girls, I am appealing to you...\nagain for assistance. I know if you were here, you would not refuse my request, and rather than fail, you would decide to give us a good range. Our children are well. No measles yet and I hope we keep them away from our doors. But it is cold\u2014every morning the thermometer is below freezing.\n\nI am yours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nprincipal.\nFebruary 1, 1927.\n\nDear Father Rohr:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, with reference to general conditions at the Cariboo Indian Residential School. I am very grateful for the photos of Indians of the Lillooet district.\n\nI was very grieved to learn of the epidemic of flu and the death of two pupils. I have directed that an item be placed in our Estimates for the coming year, so that something can be done to arrange for better heating facilities. A note will be taken in connection with the infirmary requirements. The appropriations for Indian Education are so limited each fiscal year, that I regret I cannot be hopeful concerning an automobile for this school. I trust that you will have a very useful career at Cariboo.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. V.

In the name of the Indians of this agency I extend to you my thanks.\n\nUnder the same cover I am sending you a little collection of photos of some Indians of my former district in Selkoot. I hope you will like them.\n\nThis new year has been very trying for our school. More than once I felt discouraged.

It was impossible to heat up the school buildings.\n\nSomething must be done as it would be criminal to let both staff and children suffer as they did this year.\n\nThere is no infirmary here\u2014neither for boys nor for girls. The hospital is 12 miles from here. To remove them there we have to hire each time a closed car.\n\nI promised the staff, especially the good sisters, that I would appeal to you.

O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C., Oct. 30, 1925.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Indian Education\n\nIn connection with my report on the Estimates for the Fiscal Year 1927-28, I dealt only with the item for General Administration, leaving out anything pertaining to Indian Education.\n\nAnother Pease Economy Furnace is required for the boys' building of the Williams Lake School. Necessary repairs to the walls and floors in the basement are much needed as the children feel the cold in the winter very severely.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) W. E. DITCHBURN,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report further in reply to your letter of May 19th, No.160-45 that I examined the basement of the boys' building at the school on May 31st. I find that it is necessary to do considerable excavation work in order to do the work properly. It is 32 by 64 ft size and is now about half excavated. When finished it should be 8 feet high.\n\nWith Rev.V.Rohr, Principal of the School, I visited Williams Lake in order to interview contractors and others re doing the work. The only man there who could do the work wanted $2.00 per day for himself; $4.50 for his helper and said he would require two or three others to help him while excavating at $3.00 per day each. I thought this too high. Rev. Father Anthony who has had experience at this sort of work has offered to perform the labour at $6.00 per day and would need from one to three labourers at $3.00 per day each. The Department would buy the materials, namely, lumber, (about $100.00 worth) cement, etc. The basement that Rev. Father Anthony would put in would have a concrete floor. The complete basement is necessary for a recreation room for the boys during the winter cold spells and also for the furnace and wood.\n\nAfter examining the buildings I am of the opinion that they should be painted and papered in order to make them warmer. This should be done before the winter sets in again. The present is about the best time of the year to do the work, before the haying season commences. If the Department approves of the repairs and improvements I would suggest that the authority to proceed be wired to me.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, June 13, 1927.\n\nE.

Revenue stamps to the value of $1.30 were purchased, leaving a bank balance of $49.25. The enclosed cheque will be sent to the Department in due course.\n\nRev. Father Anthony, foreman of this work, has just sent in his Time Sheets for the month of August. These total $386.75. There is also an account for the fields and house lumber which amounts to $8.10.

MacLeod, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nClinton B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nDuring your last inspection of our school, you drew my attention to the worn out condition of the different floors of our school and the urgent need of fire escapes.\n\nRev. Fr. Anthony and myself took the measurements of the different rooms in all the school buildings where new floors are needed and we estimated it would take 18,000 feet of flooring.\n\nWith regard to the fire escapes, there should be at least one for each building, rather two for the convent.\nThe Cariboo Indian Residential School\nPost Office: 150 Mile House\nBritish Columbia\n\nThanking you for the great interest you always have taken in our institution; and the strenuous work you have done in this agency for the welfare of the Indians.\n\nYours very devotedly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nI would suggest wooden stairs, built outside of each building and connected with the dormitories. It could be done easily if we had the means. This must be done, otherwise I will not be responsible for the lives of the little children.\n\nAs you know the conditions of the Cariboo, I appeal to you, dear Sir, to explain the matter to the Department. We have no complaints to make. The officials of the Department have always been kind to us and never refused us any assistance when in need.\n\nWriters is the most appropriate room to do repair work here\u2014inside. Also it would give some useful occupation to the older boys under the direction of Brother Lafrie. If possible, or if funds are still available for the Cariboo Indian School, I would earnestly beg you, dear Sir, to ask the Department not to hesitate to let us have at once 18,000 feet of flooring and $500 feet of stopping & 10 pieces 2x3x50\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith original letter received from the Principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School which speaks for itself.\n\nAs you know, the Department has not advised me what funds are available for this School. If funds are available or were appropriated sufficiently large to permit the proper repairs being made, undoubtedly the floors should be replaced. They are in a very bad condition. There are several holes and patches on them and it is difficult to keep them clean. To place linoleum on these floors in their present condition would be a waste.\n\nThe occupiers should have been provided years ago and should a fire occur in one of these buildings loss of life would be certain.\n\nNot having actual cost figures of flooring lumber before me I am not certain as to the cost but I find it costs in buying it would come to approximately $50.00 per M. delivered to the nearest station, owing to the high freight rates on the C.G.R.R. from the Coast where the lumber would be purchased.\n\nIt is evident that the management is willing to do the work if supplied with the materials.\n\nAn early reply will oblige me, while\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n**GOVERNMENT OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA**\n\n**Department of Indian Affairs, British Columbia**\n\n**AGENCY**\n\n---\n\n**FORM 130**\n\n**FREIGHT BILL\u2014PREPAID CHARGES**\n\n**M.

Principal of the Okanagan Indian Residential School, 12 Mile House, B.C., has been talking to me about hot-water boilers to be attached to the furnace ordered by the Department from Morrison, Robertson-Godden Co., some time ago; also thirty feet of additional piping is required.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of my letter to the Robertson-Godden Co. in this connection for your information and trust you will approve of my action in the matter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nDear Sirs,\n\nIn reference to your letter of August 26th, I have again been in communication with the Principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School in regards to the furnace which you shipped recently and he states, \"we did not yet receive the two boilers for the boys' school furnace and we also need about thirty feet of piping for the furnace.\"\n\nI cannot understand what he means by two boilers for the furnace unless, since this order was given by the Department direct to you and since I have no copy of the Department's instructions in the matter and I do not know what was ordered or should have been ordered, he expected to get two hot-water boilers to be attached to the furnace for the boys' bathroom, etc.\n\nIf you have the necessary piping for the furnace and these hot-water boilers, please ship at your earliest convenience to Onward Siding, via P.G.E. Railway so as to get this installed before the frost comes.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(E. MacLeod)\nIndian Agent\n\nMessrs.

You should correspond with the Rev. Principal as to exactly what is needed. In his letter, which you enclosed, he mentions 600 ft. of stepping and ten pieces 8\" x 8\" x 20 ft., and it is possible that this has reference to the fire escapes. You may purchase also, 6000 ft. of edge grain fir flooring and arrange for shipment to the school. Competitive prices should be secured on this lumber, if possible. I regret that I cannot authorize the entire quantity of flooring requested, as the funds for repairs and replacements at this institution this year are now exhausted. Another year, it may be possible to complete the reflooring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE. MacLeod, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nClinton, B.

D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMcLeod, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nClinton, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report that I visited the Cariboo Indian Residential School on the 29th ultimo particularly to examine the progress of the repairs to the buildings.\n\nI found that the four walls of the basement to the boys' quarters were completed and also an outside entrance of concrete and about a forty foot closed-in approach from one end, consisting of concrete walk from six to eight feet high was almost complete.\n\nThe location where the new furnace is located on the floor is built about eighteen inches lower than the level of the floor and has a large concrete airshaft from the base of the furnace to the ground foundation of the nearest new concrete wall, thence to the surface of the ground along the outside wall. This is for the purpose of supplying cold fresh air from the outside to the bottom of the hot air furnace and thence throughout the building.\n\nIt was necessary to build two new chimneys, one for the new furnace and one for the new kitchen range. These two chimneys required a lot of cement as did also the side and end entrances to the buildings and as a consequence the cement ordered is not sufficient to complete the flooring in the basement. I am requested by the Rev. Principal to supply another fifty sacks of cement in order to complete the flooring. This cement will cost more per sack than the last we got owing to the local freight rate charge instead of the carload rate we got on the first lot. May I please be advised of the Department's pleasure in this matter?\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nYour obedient servant,\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

In this connection I beg to say that, if this equipment has not already been procured, you should consult the Principal and arrange for the purchase of two boilers of approximately 30 gallons capacity each and have them attached to the furnace. Please forward a properly certified voucher in the usual manner covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE. MacLeod, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nClinton, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, File No. 160-0-5, in the matter of equipment to be attached to furnace at the Cariboo Indian Residential School. It would appear that application for the furnace was made to the Department by the Rev. Principal direct. When this furnace arrived at the School the Principal informed me that the boilers for the hot water supply had not arrived and I understood that this was ordered at the same time as the furnace and that it was an omission on the part of the shipping firm in not sending it. The Rev. Principal says he applied for the boilers through me but I have nothing on my files except where he states \"the boilers have not yet arrived.\"\n\nThe boilers, or tanks, are certainly necessary to heat water for the boys' bathroom. There should be two, containing thirty gallons each, and these will be attached to the furnace.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(E.

It is a real pity that our application should be too late for consideration. We need greater accommodation for the ever increasing number of our pupils. Also in case of an epidemic we would again be handicapped. We are far away from doctors. Only twice or three times we had a medical man to visit us last year. A few weeks ago we had the smallpox scare. Fortunately the doctor advised me over the phone that it was only chickenpox. It lasted three weeks and through the care of our devoted staff and especially Almighty God's protection, I am glad to tell you that every vestige of the dreaded disease has disappeared.

A receipt for the amount of the freight charges should be attached to the voucher. It is understood that the work of laying this flooring will be performed by the school authorities without expense to the Department.\n\nRegarding the ice house, I would refer you to official letter of the 13th instant, asking you to state whether the Principal would rather that the account covering the cost of the materials used in painting the school building be paid or the ice house be erected. If the erection of the ice house is more urgent, please state whether this is required for the storage of ice only, or whether a cold storage chamber for the storage of meat and other supplies should be included. In the latter event, the cost would be considerably in excess of the erection of a house for the storage of ice only. Particulars should be given as to the dimensions of the building required. When we have a reply to our letter of the 13th instant, referred to above, and particulars as to the type of ice house, consideration will then be given to authorizing having this work carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. E. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nClinton, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to reply as follows to your letter of the 31st May last, relative to new flooring and ice-house required for the Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nSince receiving your letter, I have visited the school and personally inspected the floors. I find that a lot of the flooring is in exceptionally poor condition and badly needs replacing.\n\nLast year, the school principal requested 18,000 feet of flooring, and of this amount, 6,000 was supplied by the Department.\n\nThe principal now requests the remainder, 12,000 feet of edge grain fir flooring, and I have no doubt that it will be put to good and immediate use. The price paid last year, F.O.B. Vancouver, was $40.00 per thousand. I understand that it is not possible to get good flooring in this district. They have tried it at the school before, but it is too soft, and does not wear well. It would therefore be advisable to purchase the flooring again in Vancouver.\n\nWith regard to the ice-house mentioned in your letter, I found, when at the school, that there is no provision for keeping meat etc., during the summer months, except one small electric refrigerator, which accommodates only a negligible quantity of food.\n\nQuantities of ice are obtainable from close to the school, in the winter time, and I would recommend that authority be granted for the material for erecting a suitable ice-house.\n\nOnly two weeks ago, a large quantity of meat was spoiled at the school, through lack of proper storing facilities.\n\nThe school principal has requested me to inquire whether the Department have on hand any plans for ice-houses, as the staff have no knowledge of the correct way to build. If such information can be supplied, the lumber needed could be included in the order for flooring, thus keeping down the freight cost.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E. Taylor\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 13th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School, together with an account covering the cost of the material used in the painting of the school building, and requesting that same be paid.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of May 31st, last, certain repairs were required to the floors, and an ice house was also requested. If the Principal considers that he would rather the Department would pay the account covering the cost of the materials used in the painting than erect the ice house, this will be done, but we have no funds available to provide for the cost of the materials used in the painting and to erect the ice house. I am returning the account which was submitted, and if the Principal desires to have payment of same made and let the question of the ice house stand over until next year, you may prepare a certified voucher, in duplicate, covering the cost of the materials used in the painting, and submit same to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Fr MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. E. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nClinton, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith triplicate account and letter received from Rev. V. Rohr, principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School, in regard to the purchase of paint used for the school.\n\nI might state that I have recently visited the school and seen the painting that has been done on all the buildings, and there is no doubt that it has entailed a considerable amount of labour, and has greatly enhanced the appearance and durability of the buildings.\n\nI am unaware of the policy of the Department in regard to assistance of this nature, but his school appears to be functioning very efficiently, and I believe that Rev. V. Rohr would be entitled to any consideration in this matter that you feel inclined to give.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E.

The department has been kind enough to supply the shingles to cover the walls of the buildings and we promised to do the work. The stringing and the construction of the three fire escapes cost me over $500 dollars. For over two months now three men and two school boys have been busy painting. This means another $4 or $500 dollars. The buildings are looking beautiful and the children and staff...\nThe Cariboo Indian Residential School\nPost Office: 150 Mile House\nBritish Columbia\n\nhad more comfort than ever during the long\ncold winter of the Cariboo. I wish you would\nrecommend the work done and ask the depart-\nment to help me again to pay at least\nfor the material used in the painting.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nV. Rohr O.M.S.,\nprincipal.\nOttawa, May 31, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to your l-8 of August 31st, last, concerning repairs to floors that are incomplete at the Cariboo Indian Residential School. I should be pleased if you would ascertain just what is required and let me have a recommendation with estimate of the cost without delay. You should intimate if the school management are prepared to do the laying.\n\nSome time ago, an ice house was requested for this school. You might make enquiries in this connection, also, and let me have a report.\n\nI regret there are no funds available this year for an addition to the main building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

In this connection, I beg to say that, in May 1926, the Department supplied new desks sufficient to accommodate 55 pupils. At that time, it was stated that there were 49 Preston single school desks on hand which were in good condition. This would provide a total seating accommodation for 104 pupils and, as the pupilage allowed is only 90, the Department does not see the necessity for supplying the quantity of new desks now asked for by the Reverend Principal. After you have had an opportunity to visit the school, you should forward a further explanation as to the necessity for an additional supply of desks.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary\n\nH. E. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nClinton, B.C.\nSir:\n\nHerewith I beg to submit report upon the Williams Lake Agency No. 8.\n\nI visited the school twice, and stopped the night there. Rev. Father Mohr, the new Principal seems to have greatly improved the appearance of all the buildings; there is much in improvement. The school looks greatly improved and almost like a new building, with the new paint on it. Much improvement in the basement of the boys' wing has been done by a certain Father Anthony, who has cemented the same and placed the building on cement pillars. He has done a most excellent job, as the place was a veritable fire trap before. Possibly, the same may be done to the girls' buildings. He has also replaced the flooring in various places and has done a lot of work. He must be of great service to the Principal. The matter of screening against flies, should, however, be seen to as I am sure it cannot be sanitary as it is.\n\nThe crops on the school farm are excellent this year, but it is to be hoped that the scheme of raising lac le lache and thus ensuring no water for the school and the adjacent sugar cane reserves will be undertaken. I have recommended this before.\n\nWhile the children are being well fed at the school the school is somewhat short in its milk supply. Some more good cows should be purchased.\n\nWe now come to the matter of fire protection for these buildings. Great improvement has been made by the erection of fire escapes at the end of each building, even though these are merely a system of gently graded wooden stairs. However, some form of fire alarm should be installed. This would not be expensive and would lead to a system of fire drill. Further, there are no chemical fire extinguishers. Two or three large ones and several smaller ones should be placed at various strategic points. Finally too, fire axes, in glass cases, one at each door of the fire escapes should be placed. This is necessary on account of the possible danger of the doors freezing against their sills in winter. Cheap ones as were fixed up locally for the Kamloops School could be used.\n\nG. S.

He recommends that a number of fire extinguishers be supplied. An order is being placed today with the Pyrene Mfg. Co. of Canada, Ltd., to ship freight charges prepaid, addressed to the Principal, Onward Siding, B.C., (Pacific Great Eastern Railway) the following:\n\n4 - 5 gal. pump tank extinguishers complete with accurate non-freeze charge.\n\n6 - 1\u00bd qt. Pyrene extinguishers complete with non-freeze charge.\n\nThe above firms have been requested to forward their account to you in duplicate covering the cost with receipt for freight charges prepaid attached. When these extinguishers arrive, you will be good enough to certify the account in the usual manner and send it to the Department for payment. Please inform the Principal of the order placed for these extinguishers and he should arrange to see that they are distributed at strategic points throughout the buildings. I enclose herewith two copies of a description of the extinguishers ordered which will explain the purpose for which they are intended. You might hand one copy to the Principal.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and delivery at the school of two firemen's axes to be placed one at each door of the fire escapes and you should forward a certified account, in duplicate, covering the cost.\n\nThe Inspector further recommends that some form of electrical fire gong be installed in each building. He states that this would not be expensive and would lead to a system of fire drill and would also be of great assistance in case of fire. I have to request that you will obtain a price for the installing of a suitable fire gong or bells in the buildings. The price should include the cost of all materials as well as the installation or gong. A description of the gong which you recommend be installed should be given. When we have this information, consideration will be given to authorizing the installation of this equipment. You might consult the principal in the matter and your early reply, giving the information asked for, is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. E.

There is no doubt that a coat of oil, when the floor is new, will preserve the wood, and add considerably to its life.\n\nThe kitchen and bath and dining rooms undoubtedly require a coat of light paint, to cover the grime, and make these rooms more cheerful.\n\nI note that the Rev. Principal estimates $350.00, but any assistance at all that could be given would eventually mean economy in preserving the floors etc., as this is an old lumber building, and it is difficult to make it look much.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E.

The dining rooms and class rooms look beautiful, but the carpenters tell me if the oiling is not done, the floors will not last very long.\n\nAlso the kitchen, bathrooms - dining rooms need a good coat of paint. As the girls spend some of their training time in the kitchen, we must do all we can to make it attractive for them and the good cooks.\n\nI am sure if you ask the department to supply the necessary oil and paint you will get it for us.\nThe Cariboo Indian Residential School\n\nPost Office: 150 Mile House\nBritish Columbia\n\nI do not think the expense to be more than 365 dollars, and we will supply the labor.\n\nI wish also to extend to you and to the department my sincerest thanks for the work already done.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nprincipal\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Ferrier\n\nIt was reported to me that the William's Lake residential school needs greater fire protection.

It would appear that the extra seating requested, is really required, in order that the school function efficiently, and I would not consider the request unreasonable.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department has noted the Principal's reason for his request for more desks, which request was forwarded under cover of your letter of August 4th, last.\n\nIt is considered, with the desks that have already been provided, that a further number of 20 single desks, with rear and front seats, should provide ample seating accommodation at this school. It is noted that the Principal requests that Preston single ball bearing desks be supplied. The western representative for the Canadian Office & School Furniture Co., who handle these desks, is E. G.

I also enquired from the Gurney Foundry Co. if they could furnish an oven similar to the one supplied to the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School but they replied that they wired their Eastern principals and found that this particular oven was no longer made.\n\nOf the other firms I invited quotations from, two replied that they did not carry bake ovens, one quoted the \"Embrith\" oven at $700.00 plus freight, which is the same oven quoted by the Gurney Co., in my previous letter to you of April 28th last.\n\nThe McQuarrie McFeely & Prior Ltd. firm quoted on some new and second-hand ovens, the only one of which appears to come within our requirements being a \"White Star\" (second-hand) of 140 loaves capacity or $150.00. Beyond stating that the oven is a wood burner and in good condition, no particulars were given, and I would not recommend the purchase of a second-hand oven.\n\nI received a letter recently written from Ottawa by Rev. W. Rehn, the School Principal, who is away on holidays, and he spoke of purchasing from the Daoust Co. of St. Boniface, Man., supply ovens to any of our schools. They appear to have an oven priced at $800.00 plus freight from Winnipeg - 140 loaves capacity. Although the freight charges will be heavy from Winnipeg, it would seem that this oven would be more satisfactory than anything we can get from Vancouver, and cheaper.\n\nI would request to be informed of your pleasure in this matter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6437, file 878-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, May 3, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School and correspondence by him relative to the bake oven required for the use of his school. It is noted that the oven quoted on by the Gurney Foundry Company, of Vancouver, and which the Principal desires, will cost $700. f. o. b. Vancouver, with additional freight charges of approximately $85.\n\nThe Department has never supplied ovens of this cost to residential schools. The oven supplied the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School, Lejac - the type the Principal of the Cariboo School requested in his communication forwarded under cover of your letter of February 25th, last - was supplied in 1921, at a cost of $460. It is considered that an oven that would be quite suitable to meet the requirements could be obtained at much less cost than the one on which the Principal has now received a quotation. Either you or the Principal should get prices from other manufacturers or dealers in British Columbia for an oven of the capacity absolutely necessary, and the quotations received should be forwarded for the consideration of the Department. It may be that the Gurney Foundry Company could supply another type of oven at a much lower cost, which would be satisfactory in every respect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. E. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nClinton, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to forward particulars regarding the bake-oven required for the Cariboo Indian Residential School, as requested in your letter of March 8th last.\n\nThe school principal has had considerable correspondence with the Gurney Foundry Co. of Vancouver and I enclose letters received lately by him from this firm. He states that the No.18 Pendrith Oven seems an ideal one for the school requirements.\n\nA specification of this oven is contained in the attached letter and it is noted that the oven is portable and is shipped knocked down to facilitate admission through the door.\n\nThis oven is quoted at $700.00 with additional freight charges of approximately $55.00.\n\nI would request authority to order this oven from the Gurney Foundry Co. at Vancouver B.C. for shipment to the school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E. Taylor\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnd:\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe Cariboo Indian Residential School\nPost Office: 150 Mile House\nBritish Columbia\n\nApril 22nd 1929\n\nH. E. Taylor Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVancouver B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReceived another letter from the Guernsey Foundry Co., which I am sending to you. The letters seem to be pleased with it - as the new oven is a little bit over twice the capacity of the present one. So if you could make the purchase we all will be grateful to the department and to you.\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nV. Robins\nPrincipal.\nApril 15, 1929\n\nRev. Father Rohr,\n150 Mile House,\nBritish Columbia\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWe wish to thank you for yours of the 11th instant, relative to Bakers' Oven.\n\nWe are of the opinion, judging from the volume of work you have on hand at your Institution, that an Oven of heavier weight and larger dimensions would be more suitable for your requirements. In addition to the small size Ovens manufactured by ourselves we are marketing what is known as the \"Pendrith\" Oven which is becoming very popular in this Western territory where Ovens of larger dimensions than our own are required. In looking over the various sizes we are of the opinion that the #18 Pendrith Oven would best meet your requirements. Specification of this Oven is as follows:\n\n#18 Pendrith Oven - 2 Decks.\nDimensions of each deck 50\" wide x 73\u00bd\" deep.\nFloor space 6 feet x 7 feet.\nEquipped with Pyrometer or Heat Gauge and Oven Lights in each deck. $700.00\nF.O.B. Vancouver.\nShipping weight approximately 5000 pounds.\nThese Ovens are all of rugged construction and are portable, i.e., they come \"knock-down\" and are very easily assembled and require the minimum of repairs. The weight of this Oven is in the neighborhood of 5,000 lbs. and as we presume you would take delivery at Williams Lake Station the cost of freight from Vancouver to that point would be approximately $85.00. This Oven is in stock at Vancouver and shipment can be made promptly.\n\nWe regret that at the moment we have not got an accurate cut of this Oven to send you but are mailing you one from our Eastern Office which will reach you in the course of the next week. The attached cut gives you a very good idea although not an accurate one of the general appearance.\n\nWe shall be very glad indeed to hear from you further in connection with this equipment and can assure you that your order will have our very best attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE GUANNA FOUNDRY CO. LIMITED.\n\nR.P. Gay:RS\nSir;\n\nI have the honour to inform you, in reference to the attached account, that I inspected and tested this fire alarm system at the Cariboo School during a visit there last week.\n\nAuthority was given by you to the school authorities to install the system for $150.00 and it appears to be satisfactory in every respect. There are three large loud gongs located in the boy's, girl's and staff quarters, respectively, and the turning on of any one switch operates the three gongs. They are operated from dry cell batteries. I emphasized the need of regular fire drill and outlined a system of drill to the teaching staff and informed them that on my next visits I would test the efficiency of their drill and ascertain the length of time it took to empty the buildings. I also intend to carry out a night test after the children are in bed, as owing to the wooden construction of all the buildings I consider fire drill of the greatest importance.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.E.

I note they require one similar to that in the Fraser Lake institution at Lejac.\n\nWhereas the school will wait for their ice house until 1930, the Department will have funds for the bake oven and all the batteries required for the electric plant. Please inform the Rev. Principal that the one at the Fraser Lake School is a Burnham Oxford Portable Bake Oven No. E. 138 with capacity 156 two pound loaves. Have the Rev. Principal get a price on this from the British Columbia representatives of the manufacturers and submit it to the Department for our consideration. The Principal should carefully examine the description of this oven so as to be sure that he has space for it and that he can get it into the building. The oven is narrower than most doors and windows. If he is satisfied that it is suitable for the Cariboo School, he may forward his application to you again, indicating the price. You should then communicate with the Department.\n\nI have also your letter of the 25th ultimo, with reference to new batteries for the lighting plant. As this is urgent, I have to authorize you to place an order for the set required for the school with the Bruce Robinson Electric Company, of 544 Howe St., Vancouver. Their account, in duplicate, properly certified by yourself, with freight receipt attached, should be forwarded to the Department when the batteries have been found satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. E. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nClinton,\nB. C.\nSir;\n\nI have the honour to inform you that when on a visit to the Cariboo Indian Residential School on the 22nd inst., I was requested by the Principal to ascertain if the Department could supply a set of new batteries for the school Delco lighting plant.\n\nThe present batteries have been in use nearly four years and are now worn out and the resultant poor light necessitates the use at times of lamps and candles, which constitute a fire hazard and cause much inconvenience.\n\nA set of batteries consists of sixteen. The Delco plant is of thirty-two volts and thirteen-plate batteries are required. If possible, one battery should be fitted with a pilot-ball which shows a reading of the condition of the batteries.\n\nDelco batteries are supplied in Vancouver by Bruce Robinson Electric B.C. Ltd., 544 Howe Street, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nIf it is possible to meet the wishes of the school Principal in this matter, there will be a considerable improvement in the school lighting system.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.E. Taylor)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI have the honour to inform you that I visited the Cariboo Indian Residential School on the 22nd inst., and whilst there, the principal stressed the need for a larger oven for the school bakery.\n\nI inspected the bakery and find that the school authorities have enlarged it to double the previous size, and have installed bread racks.\n\nThe present oven has a capacity of fifty four loaves, and the daily consumption at the school is thirty six loaves, which means almost continuous baking.\n\nThe oven at present in use is the Oxford Portable Oven made by the Gurney Foundry Co., Toronto. The Principal informs me that the oven at the Lejac Mission School is of the size they require, that oven being of a capacity of around one hundred and eight loaves.\n\nThe Principal stated that there was more immediate need for a larger oven than for an ice house, which the Department intimated some time ago that they might be able to supply this year.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.E.

In this connection, it is noted that a member of the school staff is prepared to install a system similar to the one mentioned in your letter of October 29th, last, using cheaper material and smaller gongs, the work to be completed at a cost of $150. The Department will approve of this arrangement being carried out and you may authorize the school authorities to proceed with the work. The cost of all material and labour should not exceed the sum mentioned above, viz., $150. It is hoped that a satisfactory fire alarm system will be installed.\n\nWhen the work has been completed, please forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

LaJoie of the School staff is prepared to install a system similar to the one I suggested, for a total cost of One Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($150.00). In order to get the cost down cheaper material will be used, and much smaller gongs than originally proposed.\n\nOwing to the distance between the three buildings to be equipped, and the need for poles and wire to connect the buildings I do not see that any effective system could be installed for less than $150.00, and would request to be informed if you consider this satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.E.

LIMITED.\n\nJEL/B.\n\nCredit Department.\nOttawa, November 16, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from Marshall-Wells B.C. Limited, Vancouver, in which they advise that they are holding to the credit of the Principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School the amount of $402.16. This was caused by the fact that the Department sent the above firm a cheque for $447.54 in payment of an account which you submitted under cover of your letter of the 13th ultimo for paint, oils, etc., supplied for the floors of the above named school. It would appear that the Principal paid the account for this material, and, if that is so, when forwarding the voucher for payment, you should have made it in favour of the Principal, attaching, at the same time, receipted accounts to show that the various items had been paid by the Principal. If the Principal has already made payment, it will be necessary for the above firm to forward to him their cheque for the amount that he has paid them, viz. $402.16. You should ascertain from the Principal if he has already paid the account of the above firm, and you should so inform them and request them to reimburse the Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. E.

These accounts were in your name, and the Department was not aware that the Principal had already paid same. We are requesting our local Indian Agent, Mr. H. E. Taylor, Clinton, B.C., to enquire into this matter and to communicate with you. If the Principal has already paid these accounts, it would appear that you should make a refund of the amount due him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

This was caused by the fact that the Department of Indian Affairs sent us their cheque for $447.54, taking care of August and September invoices and which you had already paid.\n\nWe have liquidated the October account with their remittance, leaving the balance as shown.\n\nWe are forwarding a copy of this letter to the Department and will hold this money pending instructions as to its disposal.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMARSHALL-WELLS B. C. LTD.\n\nJML/R.\nEnd.\n\nCredit Department.\nOttawa, November 9, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, relative to the installing of an electric fire alarm system in the Cariboo Indian Residential School, and giving particulars regarding the system which you would recommend be installed and the cost of same.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the cost is much higher than the Department anticipated. Our funds would not provide for the installing of a system such as mentioned in your letter. Would it not be possible to install a fire alarm system that would be satisfactory at much less expense? I have to request that you will give this matter further consideration, and, in consultation with the Principal and an electrician, endeavour to specify a much less expensive type of fire alarm system.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear further from you regarding this matter in order that a fire alarm system can be installed at an early date and at the least possible cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. E. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nClinton, B.C.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of August 20th last, in which you gave instructions for the obtaining of a price for the installation of an electric fire alarm system in the Cariboo Indian Residential School, I have the honour to report as follows:\n\nThere is only one electrician in Williams Lake, which is the only settlement near the school. This is Mr. Keith Caverly, and in September last I took him to the school, and, in consultation with the staff, asked him to report upon a system of fire alarm, together with a price for installing same.\n\nI have only recently received his report, and submit the following particulars for your consideration:\n\nThere are three school buildings which need to be equipped with fire gongs. Of these, the boys' and girls' dormitories are more than one hundred yards apart, which will necessitate a considerable quantity of wiring.\n\nGoing to the main building, and their consequent installation, it is considered advisable to have all wiring enclosed in metal conduit, for safety.\n\nThe system would be operated off the Delco light plant at present used by the School.\n\nA six inch gong would be installed in each of the following places: the boys' dormitory, the girls' dormitory, and the staff quarters.\n\nThe gongs would be rung by means of breakable glass alarm boxes, which would be placed conveniently as follows: two in boys' dormitory (one upstairs and one down), two in girls' dormitory (one upstairs and one down) and one in staff quarters.\n\nIn addition, there would be a three way alarm installed in the staff quarters, by means of which a general alarm could be sounded in all buildings, either for practice fire drill, or in case of real fire. Thus, three way alarm is to constituted so it can be operated without breaking the regular boxes, and will ring the bells in any or all of the three buildings separately or simultaneously.\n\nAs the large gongs cost in the neighbourhood of $65.00 each, I asked that small gongs be specified, as I am informed that they are sufficiently loud for ordinary buildings of this size. I have requested that nothing unnecessarily expensive be used in the way of material, but that durability and safety receive consideration.\n\nThe price submitted by Mr. Caverly for material, and all labour of installation is $375.00.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSIR,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E. Rylof\n\nIndian Agent.\nNov. 8, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to the contents of your report of the 25th ultimo, advising me of the bad condition of the drinking water supplied to the school at William's Lake Mission, B.C., I should like to be furnished at your earliest convenience with a report and estimate of providing a safe and reliable water supply for this institution.\n\nAs soon as this report is received the matter will be given due consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nLt. Col. G. S. Pragnell,\nP.O. Box 752,\nKamloops, B.C.\nKamloops, B.C.,\nOctober 25, 1928.\n\nInspection Report, Williams Lake Agency No. 3,\nContinued.\n\nSir,\n\nI stopped the night there. I have little more to add to my report of August 6th. I, however, have to report that the drinking water is terrible. Apparently the school has only a small reservoir, and the water is very stagnant, full of vegetation and the remains of dead fish. I understand a sample has been sent to Victoria for analysis. It certainly seems awful water for children to drink, and one would think, liable to be contaminated.\n\nG. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOffice of the Williams Lake Indian Agency,\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos.

The results of this investigation, together with proposed improvements, are discussed in detail below.\n\nGENERAL\n\nAs shown on key plan attached, St. Joseph's Mission is situated on the San Jose river, about four miles upstream from the head of Williams Lake.\n\nThe Mission is owned by the Order of Oblates of Mary Immaculate, which conducts boarding schools for Indian children, and carries on farming and stock raising operations on a large farm surrounding the school buildings.\n\nThe number of pupils enrolled in the boys' and girls' schools is about 100. In addition to these are the teaching and administration staffs, and the farm workers. The total population of the Mission is approximately 125.\n\nThe Mission buildings include a chapel, boys' and girls' dormitories and schools, barns, outhouses, etc., as shown on Plan No. 1. These are all of frame construction, and the main administrative buildings are of two stories.\n\nEXISTING WATER SUPPLY, RECORDED RIGHTS AND ANALYSES OF WATER.\n\nThe supply of water for domestic use in\n\nC.E. Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDom. Water Power & Reclamation Service,\nVancouver, B.C.\nthe Mission is at present derived from the San Jose river. The water is directed by ditch into Yellow Lake (shown on Plan No.1), and from this storage, is conveyed through a 4-inch wood stave pipe to the Mission, under a head of about 40 feet.\n\nThe right to use water for domestic purposes is recorded under C.L. 8799, with priority January 26, 1927, which grants the use of 25,000 gallons per day. Storage rights for 100 acre-feet per annum are held on Yellow Lake under C.L. 8668. Analysis was made of the water supply from Yellow Lake, in October, 1928, and it was pronounced to be polluted and unfit for domestic use. Copy of analysis is attached as Appendix \"C\". A further analysis shown in Appendix \"D\", made in December, 1928, of water from the same source, shows it to be safe for domestic use though of poor quality. This sample was taken when there was a large diversion from San Jose river into Yellow lake, and was practically a sample of river water.\n\nThese analyses would seem to show that contamination of the water came largely from Yellow lake, and that it should be discontinued as a source of domestic supply. The investigation, therefore, is to determine the most feasible means of providing an unpolluted domestic supply.\n\nSAN JOSE RIVER SUPPLY\n\nAs previously stated, a conditional licence is held granting the daily use of 25,000 gallons from San Jose river for domestic purposes.\nThe maximum feasible gravity head available from the San Jose is about 40 feet. This is sufficient for ordinary purposes but is of no use for fire protection which is most necessary.\n\nBy use of a ram and reservoir, however, a sufficient supply for both domestic and fire protection purposes could be obtained, and a system from this source will be discussed later in the report.\n\n**SPRING SUPPLY**\n\nThe only discoverable source of water supply other than the San Jose river was found in a spring lying, as shown on Plan No. 1., about four miles to the south. The elevation of this spring above the Mission is about 400 feet.\n\nAnalysis of the water from this spring, copy of which is attached as Appendix \"E\", shows it to be of fair quality, free from animal contamination but containing a small amount of decomposed vegetable matter. By thoroughly cleaning out and covering the spring it is thought that vegetable decomposition may be eliminated. At the time of inspection, 6th November, 1928, the flow in the spring was pretty well down to its minimum. The discharge at that time was 3/4 cubic feet per second.\n\nAlthough the absolute minimum flow is not definitely known, from information received locally it is estimated to be not less than 1/4 second foot. This is equivalent to more than 125,000 gallons per day, which is in excess of all requirements as discussed below.\nREQUIREMENTS OF ST. JOSEPH'S MISSION\n\n(1) Domestic Supply.\n\nAs previously stated, the population of St. Joseph's Mission is about 125. Assuming a daily consumption of 40 gallons per head, the requirement for domestic supply would be 5000 gallons per day.\n\n(2) Fire Protection.\n\nThe buildings comprising St. Joseph's Mission are of wood frame construction, and are not equipped with any system for protection against fire.\n\nThe present water system cannot supply the pressure necessary for fire protection, but this would be amply provided by a pumping system from the San Jose river direct, or by a gravity system from the spring mentioned above, and in view of the large number of children housed in the buildings, adequate fire protection is considered necessary. For this a supply of not less than 600 gallons per minute should be available for three fire streams.\n\nPOSSIBLE SYSTEM FROM SAN JOSE RIVER\n\nTo adequately supply the demands of St. Joseph's Mission for domestic and fire protection purposes, a system from the San Jose river would consist of the following units:\n\n1. Hydraulic Rams.\n\nThis unit of the system would include a small intake in the San Jose river, about 400 feet of 4\" drive pipe, and a double ram installation. The latter is necessary in this isolated locality in case one ram should go out of order.\n2. Ram Delivery Pipe.\n\nTo deliver water supply from the site of the ram to the site of storage reservoir near the Mission would require about 3000 feet of 3-inch pipe.\n\n3. Storage Reservoir.\n\nTo ensure an adequate supply of water for fire protection, a reinforced concrete, covered storage reservoir would be necessary near the Mission, and at an elevation of about 170 feet above the buildings. The reservoir capacity should be 56,000 gallons to make available an hour's supply for three fire streams. Design of this proposed reservoir is shown on Plan No. 3.\n\n4. Filter.\n\nIn view of the analyses of San Jose river water (taken from Yellow lake) shown in Appendices 2 and 3, and owing to the fact that the river above the ram site meanders for fifteen miles through swampy and meadow lands, it is considered altogether undesirable to use the river water for cooking and drinking without filtration.\n\nA mechanical filter, therefore, is recommended, either a Paradon Chlorinizer or a filter of a similar type, that will treat a domestic water supply of 5000 gallons per day. This filter would be located near the storage reservoir, at an elevation low enough to provide operating head.\n\nFor treatment of water for domestic use a small tank of about 5000 gallons capacity would be built below the filter. Water supply to this tank would be provided by a small pipe from the main...\nstorage reservoir, and service pipes would lead direct from the tank to the various buildings.\n\nThe filter and treatment tank would have to be covered for protection against frost.\n\n5. Reservoir Discharge Pipes and Distribution System.\n\nFor fire protection service a length of about 1500 feet of 10\" pressure pipe would be necessary to serve the fire hydrants, as shown on Plan No. 2. From this main, service pipes could be run to the laundry, etc.\n\nTo accommodate overflow, about 2500 feet of 2\" pipe would be required between the reservoir and the river at the Mission.\n\n6. Fire Fighting Equipment.\n\nFor adequate fire protection the following equipment is considered necessary:\n\nFive outside hydrants housed in small shelters, and equipped with 150 feet of 2\u00bd inch hose, hose bracket, and standard nozzle.\n\nSix inside hydrants, placed one on each floor of the three main buildings, and equipped with hose bracket, 50 feet of 2-inch hose and 5/8 inch nozzle.\n\nCOST OF SYSTEM\n\nEstimate of cost is shown in Appendix \"A\", and amounts to approximately $16,100.00.\n\nPOSSIBLE SYSTEM FROM SPRING\n\nA gravity system from this source to St. Joseph's Mission would include the following:\n1. Concrete Intake at the spring.\nThe spring should also be fenced to prevent contamination from ranging stock.\n\n2. Pipe Line from Intake to Storage Tank.\nThis would be low pressure 3\" pipe about 15,000 feet in length.\n\n3. Storage Reservoir.\nThis would be of the same size as specified for the system from San Jose river.\nThe elevation of this tank above the buildings would have to be about 185 feet to allow for friction losses in discharge pipe.\n\n4. Reservoir Discharge Pipes and Distribution System.\nFrom the reservoir to the fire hydrants about 3000 feet of 10\" pressure pipe would be required.\nService pipes to all buildings could be run direct from this main.\nAbout 2000' of 2\" pipe would be required to carry the overflow from the reservoir to the river.\n\n5. Fire Fighting Equipment.\nThis would be the same as specified for the system from San Jose river.\n\nCOST OF SYSTEM\nEstimate of cost is shown in Appendix \"B\", and amounts to approximately $25,500.00.\n\nSUMMARY\nSan Jose River System.\nTo fill the requirements of St. Joseph's\nMission with respect to domestic water supply and fire protection, a ram system would be necessary to pump the supply to a storage reservoir. For domestic use, owing to the poor quality of the water, a portion of this supply should be filtered.\n\nThe ram, storage, and filter units would need regular supervision and periodical cleaning.\n\nThe cost of this installation is estimated to be $16,100.00.\n\nSystem from Springs.\n\nThis is a gravity system over three miles in length. Analysis of water from this source shows that no filtration is necessary. This system would require the minimum of attention.\n\nThe estimated cost of installation is $25,500.00.\n\nRecommendations.\n\nFrom an analysis of the two systems summarized above, it is considered that, though costing $9500.00 more, the gravity system from the spring would ultimately be cheaper and more satisfactory.\n\nThe reasons advanced for this conclusion are:\n\n1) The gravity system would need no expert mechanical supervision as would be the case with the ram and filter on the San Jose system.\n\n2) The gravity system is derived from a pure source, and the water supply could be delivered direct without filtration.\n\n3) The gravity system offers greater assurance of regular and uninterrupted supply.\nIn the case of the San Jose system, the intake for the ram is located below the irrigation ditches intakes, and there is a possibility, though it is believed to be a remote one, that, during a summer of abnormally small flow in the San Jose river, the water supply passing the irrigation ditch intakes might be reduced below the quantity required for efficient operation of the ram.\n\nIn view of the above, the installation of the gravity system from the spring is recommended.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.

Archibald, Div. Hydroelectric Engineer\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith a report received from Mr. Webb on an investigation of a water supply system for the St. Joseph's Mission in the Williams Lake Agency, B.C. This report was prepared at the request of Mr. Indian Commissioner Ditchburn in a letter to Mr. Webb dated October 15th last.\n\nTwo alternative schemes are set out in the report. One, a water supply from the San Jose river at an estimated cost of $16,100; the other, from a spring three miles distant from the mission at an estimated cost of $23,500. As you will note from the report the gravity system from the spring is recommended for reasons stated therein.\n\nWhile the cost of these schemes is considerable it is recommended by Mr. Webb that the expenditure is warranted in view of the fact that every precaution should be taken to protect the lives of the inmates of this institution from a sanitary standpoint as well as to afford fire protection. Should it be found that there are not sufficient funds to carry out either of the proposals outlined in the report, it is recommended that immediate steps should be taken towards the purification, as far as possible, of the domestic water supply from Yellow lake.\n\nI shall be glad to have your instructions in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In company with the acting principal, Rev. Father Patterson, I went over the institute. I found things in excellent order with the school filled to capacity. It was glad to note that there were several children from the Chilcotin entered at the school, and they seemed happy and contented.\n\nIt is to be hoped that the prejudice of the Chilcotin Indians against the school has at last been overcome. With this field added and recruiting elsewhere accommodation for 50 more children at least will be required in the near future. This would be more economical than building in the Chilcotin. There is of course still no pressure water system for fire purposes, though I understand planned. Dependence there should be placed upon chemical fire extinguishers. I could find no large chemical extinguishers, anyone in position, and the acting principal could not inform me whether any had been supplied. If not this should be attended to immediately. Fire Drill has been started in the school and the children well trained. I went over the manual training class room and am told the boys are working well at this work. The school would well do with two or three foremen for blacksmith training. I also accompanied Principal to the intake of their irrigation system on St Josephs Creek, this matter will be dealt with in my remarks upon the Sugar Cane Reserve.\n\nGeo. S.

From this report you will note that the Father in charge of the Mission was not in favour of any work being done at the present time on the existing water supply system and Mr. Archibald, the Engineer who made the investigation, felt that in view of the attitude of the Mission authorities he was not justified in undertaking any improvements at Yellow Lake. I shall be glad to have your further instructions in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nA. F. MacKenzies, Esq.,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSir: Re - St. Joseph's Mission Domestic Water Supply\n\nAs instructed in your letter of July 3, 1929 investigations were carried out to determine what compulsory measures could be adopted to purify the supply of domestic water from Yellow Lake to St. Joseph's Mission. Detailed below is the result of these investigations and of their discussion with Father Patterson, acting superintendent of St. Joseph's Mission.\n\nYellow Lake is an artificial reservoir filled by flow through a ditch from the San Jose River, and used for the storage of irrigation supply for use on lands lying west of the river, and of domestic supply for St. Joseph's Mission.\n\nThe bed of Yellow Lake, for some distance from the shore, was found to be thickly covered with an under-water weed growth, which appeared to attain its densest growth at the lake outlet where the intake pipe for St. Joseph's Mission domestic water supply is located.\n\nThis weed growth seems to be the only source of pollution in and immediately surrounding the lake. There appears to be very little danger of nearly pollution from animal matter, as the lake is in a cultivated area that is very well fenced.\n\nThe pipe intake is located about 100 feet from the shore at the lake outlet, but at a depth of only between three and four feet below the lake surface, so that though the plant growth on the lake bed is very dense, the pipe intake is above it.\n\nAt the time of investigation there was a large flow both into and out of the lake, and if this condition could be maintained it is believed that the danger of pollution would be minimized, as the pipe intake is located at the lake outlet and the water drawn through the pipe is not stagnant but running water drawn from the San Jose River. Extension of the pipe intake into the lake for another two or three hundred feet would also lessen the danger of pollution as that would remove it from the dense area of weed growth on the lake bed.\nWhen discussing the matter with Father Patterson, it was suggested that the plant growth be removed from the lake bed, that the intake pipe be extended farther into the lake, that chemical treatment, say with copper sulphate, be given the lake water, and that a chlorinator be installed in the existing storage tank above the Mission buildings.\n\nFather Patterson was not in favour of anything being done at the present time, stating that in his opinion the present water supply was as pure as could be obtained from the San Jose River, and that the removal of plant growth would stir up bacteria that would pollute the supply for some time to come.\n\nWith respect to the extension of the intake pipe, Father Patterson stated that the Mission authorities proposed to do this themselves later in the season, when the lake surface was lowered.\n\nThe installation of a chlorinator in the storage tank did not find favour with Father Patterson as he considered that anything of a drastic nature done at the present time would be prejudicial to the later installation of a combined domestic supply and fire protection system. At present the storage tank is regularly treated with lime and periodically flushed.\n\nFather Patterson stated that he and others of the Order at the Mission, were strongly in favour of the proposed gravity system, and opposed to any system that drew its supply from the San Jose River. In addition to the objections of inferior quality of supply, and the necessity for supervision and maintenance of mechanical pumping and purification units, he spoke of an objectional practice that had not been brought to his attention. He stated that when the flow in the river was low, and the demand for purification thereof at its peak, the owners of meadows bordering the river between the Mission and Lac La Hache were in the habit of dumping manure therefor back-flooding purposes, and that to do this large quantities of manure were used. This of course might create a dangerous condition and unless it can be stopped is a very strong argument against the use of the San Jose River as a source of domestic water supply.\n\nIn view of the attitude of the St. Joseph's Mission authorities as stated above, it appears that no immediate steps can be taken with respect to improving the domestic supply to the Mission.\n\nFather Patterson informed me that Father Rohr expects to call at the office of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs on his return from Europe, and intends to argue as forcefully as possible for an early installation of the gravity system to provide both fire protection and domestic water supply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

Hydrometric Engineer.\nOttawa, April 3, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nIn February, last, Mr. Inspector Pragnell drew attention to the need of more fire extinguishers for the use of the Cariboo Indian Residential School. The Department placed an order for the supplying of six (6) Thermene extinguishers with the Pyrene Mfg. Co. of Canada Ltd., Toronto, but, in error, they were asked to ship these to the Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School, Cranbrook, B.C., instead of to your school.\n\nThe Department is communicating with Mr. E. H. Small, Indian Agent, Cranbrook, and requesting that he make shipment of these extinguishers to you, Williams Lake, B.C., and it is hoped that they will arrive at an early date. When received, you should see that they are placed at strategic points throughout the school building, where they will be readily accessible in case of fire. These extinguishers can be used in the case of a fire started from any cause, whether oil, grease or electricity, and are non-freezing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

I have to request that you will arrange to have them reshipped addressed to Rev. V. Rohr, O.M.I., Cariboo Residential School, Williams Lake, B.C., via P.G.E. Railway, freight charges prepaid, at the earliest possible date. You may forward an account, in duplicate, together with receipt attached for the freight charges prepaid. We are informing the Principal of the Williams Lake Indian Residential School that these extinguishers are being shipped to him.\n\nThe account covering the cost of these extinguishers has, no doubt, been sent, and, if you have same, you should certify it in the usual manner and send it to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Webb, District Chief Engineer of the Dominion Water Power Branch, that you have authorized the construction of the domestic and fire protection water system for the Cariboo Indian Residential School, in the Williams Lake Agency, as outlined in the report of Engineer Archibald dated 15th May, 1929, the estimated cost of which is stated to be $25,500.00.\n\nAs the water is to be taken from an unnamed spring about four miles from the School, an application has been filed with the Comptroller of Water Rights to divert 25,000 gallons from the spring per day, by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, but the Comptroller of Water Rights has pointed out that as the water is to be used on the property of the Order of Mary Immaculate, (Lot 22, Cariboo District), it is felt that the application should be amended to read \"the Order of Mary Immaculate\" instead of \"Superintendent General of Indian Affairs\". This matter may, however, be adjusted satisfactorily, but the policy which I have in mind is in connection with the future security of the Department of the amount expended on this undertaking in the possible event of the school property being sold at some future date, and therefore, it appears to me that the Order of Mary Immaculate should give a lien on their property to the extent of the expenditure which the Department is going to, the same as was done by the Oblate Order when we erected the barn in connection with the St. Mary's School, New Westminster Agency.\n\nIf you concur in my views I would suggest that you write to Reverend Father Victor Rohr, Principal of the School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nRe Water Supply, St. Joseph's Mission School, Williams Lake Agency.\n\nIn connection with the above project we have made application on behalf of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs for a water right from the springs which are the proposed source of supply.\n\nI have recently been requested by the Comptroller of Water Rights to advise him as to why this right should not be in the name of the Mission as they are the registered owners of the land where the water is to be used. Mr. Ditchburn feels that the Department should obtain this water right in their own name in view of the large expenditure to be made and it was for this reason that we made application in the name of the Superintendent General.\n\nI have discussed the question with the office of the Comptroller and they advise that without a legal hold on the land we cannot obtain a domestic right on the water. It was suggested we might obtain the right-of-way from the School and by doing so control the works even if the school had the license to the water. This, however, is a point which is open to question in my mind. I suggest that the granting of a Class \"C\" license which is the kind issued for water works purposes, where a toll is charged, but they pointed out that while possibly the Water Act might permit the granting of such a license, such was not the intention of the Act, even if it is so worded. In this connection Sec. 11 (4) of the Water Act states:\n\n\"A Class C license may be acquired by any municipality, company, association, or body corporate whose undertaking in respect of such license has been approved under this Act.\"\n\nYou will note a \"body corporate\" may acquire a Class C license and in this connection would you please advise if the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs or the Department of Indian Affairs are legally a \"body corporate\".\n\nI have advised Mr. Ditchburn as to the standing of this matter and understand he is strongly pressing his Department to obtain a legal hold on the school property as a means of protecting their investment in this proposed water supply system.\n\nIn the meantime we are preparing to advertise for tenders for the installation of the proposed system and hope to have the question of the licence settled by the time the tenders are received so that work may be completed before winter sets in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston, Esq., C.E.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nC.C.: Mr. Ditchburn.\n\n(Sgd.) G.H. Webb,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nper G.H.Whyte.\nSir,\n\nYour file number: 160-0-5.\n\nRe St. Joseph's Mission School.\n\nIn further reference to your letter of June 24th regarding the installation of a new water system to supply the St. Joseph's Mission school in the Williams Lake Agency, I enclose herewith copy of a letter received from Mr. Webb regarding obtaining a water license from the province to cover the domestic supply.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Webb asks to be advised if the Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs or the Department of Indian Affairs are legally a body corporate to come within the provisions of Section II, Subsection 4 of the British Columbia Water Act. Whether this is so or not, however, does not appear to materially change the situation. The basis of the Provincial Water Act is that licenses are appurtenant to the land on which the water is to be used and are issued in the name of the owner, as defined in the act, of the appurtenant land.\n\nIf it is desired that the license should be issued in the name of the Superintendent-General it would appear necessary that the Department should own an interest in the land on which the water works are constructed, or on which the water is used.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I intended to discuss this question with the church authorities, with a view to having the property there transferred to the Crown. In a few years at most, the old buildings will have to be demolished and a modern school erected, and, before that could be done, it would be necessary for us to have title to the property. It is possible that the Oblate Order will be glad to make the transfer now.\n\nIn the meantime, I see no reason why the application for water rights should not be made in the name of the Oblate Order. At a later date, when the property is transferred to the Department, any licenses appurtenant to the land on which the water is used would be part of the title.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

He states that the whole matter is being investigated and will be reported on more fully at a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nVANCOUVER, B.C.,\nJanuary 31, 1951.\n\nSir:-\n\nRe: Domestic Water Supply,\nSt. Joseph's Mission School.\n\nWith reference to the proposed domestic water supply system for St. Joseph's Mission school at 150-Mile House, tenders for which were called in the fall of 1920, I have to inform you that some question has arisen with reference to the available water supply from the springs which have been chosen as the source of supply for this project.\n\nIt appears that when Engineer Archibald made out the application for water he knew no name for the spring upon which application was made. It now develops that this spring is the source of a small creek known as Felker creek, upon which a water licence has been in existence since 1899 for irrigation purposes and while no water has been used under this licence for some years the holder of the licence, Mr. Felker, received on May 15, 1929, Conditional Licence No. 9961 from the Provincial Comptroller of Water Rights, this licence being a renewal of the old licence and the predecessor from the 20th December 1899, for 70 acre-feet of water from Felker creek for irrigation purposes on 50 acres of land on Lot 33, Group 1, Cariboo district.\n\nMemorandum in duplicate by Mr. Archibald dated January 20th on this subject is enclosed for your reference, from which you will note there is sufficient water to satisfy both the Felker and the Indian school record provided the irrigation record allows a continuous flow during the irrigation period. This however we do not think is possible due to the small volume of water. An irrigation head is necessary and the 70 acre-feet held under licence will be drawn as irrigation needs demand. No rate of flow is specified in the conditional water licence.\n\nThe whole matter is now being investigated. The Comptroller of Water Rights is being consulted in the matter, and the Felker licence will be reviewed, following which we will be in a position to definitely determine if there is sufficient water available to satisfy both licences. The\n\nJ.T. Johnston, Esq., C.E.,\nDirector,\nDom.Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nIndian School licence is, of course, second to that of the irrigation licence in priority.\n\nIn the meantime, in view of the large expenditure involved, I do not think it would be advisable to proceed with the domestic water supply project for the Indian Residential school, until we are satisfied that there is sufficient water to serve both licences without any possible future controversy.\n\nThe matter will be reported more fully at a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.E. Webb,\nDistrict Chief Engineer\nMemorandum to Mr. Webb.\n\nRe your memo of the 10th inst. respecting the objection of Mr. Felker to the diversion of water from the south branch of Felker Creek, for domestic use in St. Joseph's Mission.\n\nAt the time of investigation of the springs, requested in your letter of October 6, 1928, I was informed that they were nameless, and the pre-emptor's map in my possession at the time gave no name to the creek that they formed.\n\nI found traces of old irrigation works from both spring channels, and on inquiry was informed that they had not been in operation for many years. This was evident from their condition. I was also told that the property formerly irrigated from these springs had long been abandoned. Water notices were accordingly posted, on 15th July, 1930, and application made for right to divert water from an unnamed spring, which is now recognized as the source of the south branch of Felker Creek, and which, according to my report of May 15, 1929, was estimated to have a minimum flow of 0.25 c.f.s., a flow still in excess of the requirements of St. Joseph's Mission.\n\nFollowing are tables showing the measured flow in the north and south branches of Felker Creek during 1929 and 1930.\n\nFlow in North Branch, Felker Creek.\n\n| Date   | C.F.S.       |\n|--------|-------------|\n| May 21 | 0.05 Temporary weir. |\n| June 7 | 0.035 \"       |\n| July 8 | 0.05 \"        |\n| Aug. 7 | 0.05 Permanent weir. |\n| Oct. 11| 0.05         |\n\n| Date   | C.F.S. |\n|--------|--------|\n| May 19 | 0.034  |\n| Oct. 4 | 0.04   |\nFlow in South Branch, Felker Creek.\n\n1929\n\nJune 7 0.25 Temporary weir.\nJuly 8 0.31 \" \"\nAug. 7 0.40 Permanent weir.\nOct. 11 0.34\n\n1930\n\nMay 19 0.362\nOct. 4 0.324\n\nFlow in Felker Creek\nSummation of flows in north and south branches\n\n1929\n\nMay 21 0.30 Temporary weir in main creek.\nJune 7 0.285 Temporary weirs in branches.\nJuly 8 0.34 \"\nAug. 7 0.45 Permanent weirs.\nOct. 11 0.39\n\n1930\n\nMay 19 0.396\nOct. 4 0.364\n\nThe above tables show the minimum flow recorded by temporary weir measurements to be 0.285 c.f.s. in June, 1929.\n\nMr. H. E. Taylor's letter of January 10, 1930, states that an old licence of 1669 on Felker Creek was renewed on May 15, 1929, shortly after investigations were made by us. This new C.L.No.9961 is for 70 acre-feet, which corresponds to a flow of 0.195 c.f.s. during the irrigation period April 1st to September 30th.\n\nThe application of the Order of Oblates of Mary Immaculate asks for the right to divert 25,000 gals. per day, which corresponds to a flow of 0.0464 c.f.s.\n\nThe combined requirements are, therefore, 0.2414 c.f.s., which is less than the lowest recorded flow of 0.285 c.f.s. in Felker Creek, as stated above.\n\nIn view of the above facts, it would seem that there is no good grounds for any objection to the application for St. Joseph's Mission.\n\nF. R. Archibald,\nDivision Hydrometric Engineer.\nSir,\n\nRe St. Joseph's Mission School.\n\nWith reference to the proposed water supply system for the St. Joseph's Mission school which it is understood will be authorized next year, Mr. Webb advises me that an enquiry has been received from the Kamloops Plumbing and Heating Company asking if they may tender on this work if the tender has not yet been awarded. In view of this Mr. Webb suggests that it might be advisable to call for new tenders early in the spring, say about April 1st.\n\nWill you please advise me in good time when it is intended that these tenders should be called for.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nJanuary 5, 1931.\n\nMR. ORR:\n\nKindly note that when tenders are being called for the water-supply system for St. Joseph's Mission School, Williams Lake Agency, B.C., the Cameron Construction Company is to be given an opportunity to tender.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nDecember 11, 1930.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. Buskard,\n\nWith reference to memorandum of the 28th ultimo, regarding the water supply system for St. Joseph's Mission School, Williams Lake Indian Agency, B.C., I have to say that I see no reason why the Dominion Water Lower Branch cannot be authorized to invite tenders for this work on the dates mentioned. The Estimates for the current year provide an item for this work and I intend to recommend re-vote for this for the year 1931-32. If the Minister approves, I will invite tenders and send a copy of the specifications to Mr. Fraser.\n\n[Signature]\n\nWe will invite tenders ourselves after estimates approved.\n\nD.C.\nOttawa, December 9, 1930.\n\nWith further reference to memorandum of the 11th ultimo, regarding the papers to advertise for tenders in connection with the water supply system St. Joseph's Mission School, Williams Lake agency, which it is proposed to undertake in the spring, kindly note that the advertisement should appear in the:\n\n\"Kamloops Sentinel,\" .......Kamloops,\n\"Carihoo Observer,\" .......Quesnel, and\n\"The Province,\" .......Vancouver.\n\nD.

S. G. I. A.\nOttawa, November 7, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 2543-W \"A\" of the 28th ultimo, with reference to renewing the plumbing at the Cariboo Indian Residential School, near Williams Lake, B.C., before installing the new water supply system. I note that the cost of plumbing replacement will be $637. When the installation of the water supply system is authorized next year - please see my letter of the 13th ultimo - the repairs to the plumbing will be included in the improvement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau,\nDept. of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nSir:-\n\nRe St. Joseph's Mission School.\n\nIn further reference to my letter of the 15th instant regarding the proposed water supply system for the St. Joseph's Mission School, we are advised by Mr. Webb that the present plumbing in the Mission buildings, owing to its age, will in all probability not withstand the pressure in the new water system. It is therefore considered advisable to renew the plumbing throughout the institution at the time when the new water supply system is constructed. An estimate of the cost of the replacement of the plumbing amounts to $627.00. A summary of the material required for this purpose upon which this estimate is based is attached hereto.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA.F.

A note has been made for next year's Estimates and this item will be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to refer to the matter of the domestic water system in connection with the Cariboo Indian Residential School at St. Joseph's Mission, 150-Mile House, B.C., as dealt with under Departmental File No. 450-23, and beg to report that on September 29th ultimo Reverend V. Rohr, C.M.I., principal of the school, drew my attention by letter to the belief which he held that the proposed water supply system will have much greater pressure than the present supply; that a large part of the school plumbing had been in use for quite a number of years on which account he was afraid that it could not stand the pressure of the new system. He therefore suggested that, if possible, all the plumbing of the school buildings should be renewed at the time the new system is installed.\n\nThe matter having previously been brought to the attention of the Dominion Water Power and Hydroelectric Bureau District Chief Engineer in Vancouver, an estimate of the proposed cost of new plumbing had been solicited.\n\nI have now received a letter No. 27984-31, dated October 20th, from the District Chief Engineer, covering an estimate as sent to his Director at Ottawa and dated October 20th, which have been carefully examined. Copies of these communications are sent herewith for the Department's perusal, and will be self-explanatory.\n\nI would like to be advised in due course as to what may be the pleasure of the Department in regard to the proposed installation of plumbing at an additional cost of $637.13, in the event of the installation of the new water supply being proceeded with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Ditchburn\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing for your information, copy of a letter which I am today addressing to our Director with reference to the renewal of plumbing in the St. Joseph's Indian Mission at 150-Mile House, the estimated cost of which is $637.00.\n\nI think it would be advisable to have this plumbing installed when the new domestic water supply system is being constructed.\n\nI am today in receipt of advice from my Director that the Department of Indian Affairs have decided to postpone the installation of this water supply system for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"C.

Ltd. 42,000.00\nForsyth & Blair 46,095.00\nHarrison & Lamond construction co. 51,173.00\n\nIn connection with the specifications sent you under date of September 16th, I have had further advice on September 15th from Mr. Archibald as to length of pipe etc. Immediately on receipt of this information I forwarded copies of the enclosed letter to all firms who had received specifications. You will note that in addition to certain additional valves, etc., the main pipe has been increased in length by 3500 feet. These additions would, therefore, increase the cost over and above our original estimate by three or four thousand dollars. The tenders received above all include this additional pipe etc.\n\nAs stated in my lettergram, I recommend the lowest tender, that of Messrs. MacLennan Bros. be accepted. I have looked this firm up and find they have recently installed the water system at Sechelt for the Union Estates Ltd. to the satisfaction of the engineers Messrs. Hawkins & Horle. You will note this firm propose to use British Hannsmann steel pipe but no doubt would use Canadian made pipe at a slightly higher price.\n\nIf Messrs. MacLennan Brothers tender is not acceptable I would recommend that of B. Boe as I am confident that this firm would carry out the work to our entire satisfaction. Mr. Boe has done considerable work in the Williams Lake District and is familiar with the type of work proposed.\n\nMany cases as mentioned in my lettergram I would recommend that the successful bidder be required to post a bond of ten per cent of the contract price and if this is agreed to, would you kindly supply me with the necessary forms duly filled out and ready for signature.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

I have ascertained that the approximate cost would be 10\u00a2 per pound at Victoria. There would be freight to pay thereon which, no doubt, would be met by the school authorities.

MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDepartment of the Interior\nCanada\n\nDominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau\n\nVancouver, B.C.,\nFebruary 16, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nRe: Domestic Water Supply,\nSt. Joseph's Mission School.\n\nFurther to my letter of the 31st ult., with reference to proposed domestic water supply system for St. Joseph's Mission school at 150 Mile House, from a spring which is the main source of Felker creek, I have to inform you that the matter of water rights has been thoroughly reviewed.\n\nI am informed by the Comptroller of Water Rights that the old water licence No. 2121 of H. A. Felker, taking precedence from 13th December, 1889, has been cancelled as it was imperfectly issued and a licence No. 9961 has been issued in lieu thereof, taking precedence from the same date. The purpose for which the water is to be used is irrigation and amounts to 70 acre-feet per annum.\n\nThe area and description of the irrigable land are an undefined 50 acres, comprising part of Lot 33, Group 1, Cariboo District. Under Board Order No. 3124, irrigation improvements are to be completed and water put to beneficial use on or before the 1st of November, 1931.\n\nI have had conferences with Mr. Indian Commissioner Ditchburn and Rev. Father Rohr, head of the St. Joseph's Mission and both agree with me that it would not be advisable to proceed with the construction of the domestic water supply system for the school until we are assured of an adequate supply of water without any possibility of litigation with the holder of prior water right on Felker creek, which is the proposed source of supply for the Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is quite possible that the Felker interests will not do any work on their irrigation system this year. If no work is done by them before November 1, 1931, we will be in a position to ask for the cancellation of Conditional Licence No. 9961, due to non-compliance with conditions set out in Board Order No. 3124, and I feel confident that the Comptroller of Water\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq., C.E.,\nDirector,\nDom. Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6438, file 878-5, part 3)\nRights will give favourable consideration to such an application. If and when the licence for the Indian School is given priority over the other licence then we will be in a safe position to proceed with the water supply project.\n\nShould the Felker interests proceed with their improvements during the coming summer it may then be necessary to approach them with a proposal to allow us to obtain the small supply needed for our requirements at the school. The Felker interests would no doubt demand some compensation for any such arrangement.\n\nIn the meantime I think it would be advisable to leave the matter in abeyance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) C. E. Webb,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\nJune 16, 1931.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nVery Rev. Father Byrne Grant, O. M. I., has discussed with me this morning the proposal to erect two outdoor classrooms at the Cariboo Indian Residential School. This would permit of using the present classrooms on the first floors as dormitories and would mean safer conditions in the event of fire. Further, the accommodation would be increased by 40 and the Chilcotins, who are now favourable to sending their children to school, could thus be assisted. I have made a note for Estimates of a $4,000 grant towards the cost of these outbuildings and also an increase in pupilage of 40. It should be kept in mind that these outbuildings could be used as carpenter shop or implement shed, or gymnasium, after the proposed new building is erected.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOffice of the Inspector of Schools.\nVictoria, B.C., August 28, 1931.\n\nW.M. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith regard to the attached letter from Mr. Indian Agent Taylor, dated August 17th in which he submits a list of repairs and improvements necessary at the Cariboo Indian Residential School, and in view of the fact that economy is necessary, I wish to recommend that:\n\n1. The painting of the implement shed might be left over for another year. The painting of the Boys' Washroom should be done this year.\n\n2. The cement floor and drainage pipe for the Dairy Room is necessary now.\n\n3. The Firebricks for the firebox in the Laundry are very necessary.\n\n4. The repairs to the taps in the Laundry should in my opinion be carried out by the School from Per Capita Grant.\n\n5. The 'New Grates' for heating of water tank in Laundry are now very necessary.\n\n6. The 'New Grates' for heating furnace in Girls' Building are not mentioned in my report on the school. They might have escaped my notice, and are recommended now, as it is very necessary that the furnaces be kept in good working order. The temperature in winter is often 40 to 60 degrees below zero at this school.\n\n7. The playroom fittings for the boys, boxing gloves, etc., should be provided out of Per Capita in my opinion.\n\nThis total estimate might well be reduced by \u00a375.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"Gerald H. Barry\"\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit the following list of repairs and improvements necessary at the Cariboo Indian Residential School, and which the Principal states have been suggested by Mr. Barry the Schools Inspector, who will, I understand, recommend the expenditure. On a recent visit to the School, I went carefully into these matters, and there is no doubt but what they are very necessary.\n\nPaint for implement shed and boy's washroom. This shed has never been painted and is more or less an eyesore amongst the painted buildings. The boy's washroom must be painted to keep it in a sanitary condition. Estimate: $30 plus paint.......................... $75.00\n\nCement floor for Dairy Room with a 30' drainage pipe. ........... $40.00\n\nFirebricks around firebox in Laundry. This is a distinct fire hazard as at present used. A sheet iron stove is used to heat water in a tub receptacle for laundry purposes. The stove is broken in many places, and I would suggest replacing it with a brick firebox which can be built by the school staff. Estimate: brick & cement........ $25.00\n\nRepair Laundry taps and pipes. The taps only require new washers. This should have been done by the staff long ago, and much water leakage thus prevented. Estimated cost .................................. $10.00\n\nNew grates for heating furnace (water tank in laundry). Three 12\" grates required for No. 1000 furnace. No estimate obtainable.\n\nNew grates for furnaces in girls' building. Three 12\" grates required for roller type for No. 1001 Economy Muffle furnace. No estimate.\n\nPlay-room fittings for boy pupils. It is desired, in addition to the above recommendations by Insp. Barry, to convert a building into a boy's play-room and gymnasium. Netting to cover the windows is required and a set of boxing gloves. Estimated cost.......................... $20.00\n\nTotal estimated cost of above is $105.00, and I would be glad to know what is your pleasure in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"H. E. Taylor\"\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6438, file 878-5, part 3)\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. INSPECTOR G. H. BARRY,\nDATED JUNE 16, 1931, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE\nCARIBOO INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\n---\n\nLAUNDRY:\n\nThere are 24 wooden laundry tubs. These are also used for the boys' baths. The boys get a bath each week, and the girls have a bath once in two weeks. There is one small electric washing machine. This is used only by the Sisters. All the ordinary laundry work is done by hand. There is no proper drying system. The clothes, in winter, are hung in the Indian parlor, a room used for the reception of Indian visitors.\n\nThe water used in the laundry is heated in a small tank, placed on a rather primitive iron fire box. This box is worn out, and I recommend that it be discarded, and a proper fire box built of brick. This could be done at the school by the boys under instruction of one of the staff.\n\nThere is a Gurney hot water heater and a tank for the domestic hot water. The heater appears to be in very good condition, but the water in the tank will not heat. This is due, I believe, to the arrangement of pipes leading from the heater to the tank and to the tubs. These pipes appear to be to be very badly arranged. A qualified plumber should be employed to examine the system and to report if anything can be done. The Principal will try to remedy the poor condition noted, but if he fails help will be required.\n\nThe Principal is anxious to have a fairly large washing machine. He spoke of one of the semi rotary type. I have seen these machines work in a satisfactory manner with steam, and at Alberni Indian Residential School off an ordinary 115 Volt alternating circuit attached to a motor. The system at this school is a 32 Volt direct current, and would not have the sufficient amperage to work a large washing machine. The Delco at the Cariboo develops 3 K.W. To do the washing in a proper manner I believe that some sort of gas engine would be required. If the Department can see its way to do so, I would recommend that this matter be taken up with the school, and some form of fairly large washing machine be supplied. This is not a very urgent matter.\n\n(Over)\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. INSPECTOR G. H. BARRY,\nDATED JUNE 16, 1931, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE\nCARIBOO INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\n---\n\nKITCHEN:\n\nThe kitchen is kept in spotless condition. The water front in the kitchen range needs to be taken out and cleaned. The pipes from it to the hot water tank require cleaning inside. At present the water does not heat properly in this tank. The boys, under direction of the staff, ought to be able to do the required work.\n\nICE HOUSE:\n\nI should like to recommend that an ice house be approved for this school.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\n\nI wish to recommend that a substantial building be constructed to contain two large classrooms, and two cloak rooms. If this be done the present classrooms could be used for dormitory accommodation for about 40 extra children. The building of the manual training shop was so successful that I see no reason why the school could not, through the manual training class, erect the classroom building mentioned above. It would not be in any sense a temporary building.\n\nI understand that a number of children from the Chilcotin country are very anxious to attend the Cariboo Indian Residential School next term. Without the extra accommodation recommended above, there will be room for only about ten new children next term. The Chilcotin Indians are now anxious to send their children to the Cariboo. A number have applied through their missionary, Father Thomas.\n\nI am assured by the Principal of the school that if the Department will expend $3000 on these new buildings, the Oblate Fathers will make up the difference, probably another $1000. I hope that the Department will give serious consideration to the above recommendation.\nSANITARY CONDITIONS:\n\nThe dairy room requires a new cement floor. If this were put down so that there was a good slope to one corner and about 25 feet of drain pipe supplied, the floor could be properly washed out. The boys could do the necessary work if the material was supplied.\n\nWATER SUPPLY:\n\nThis originates in the San Jose creek. A ditch from the creek takes water into an artificial lake known as Yellow Lake. This lake used to be a meadow, but was dammed by the Oblate Order years ago. The water from the lake is taken to the school in wooden pipes.\n\nYellow Lake is very shallow, from 1 to 3 feet deep, and a number of weeds grow in it. During the months of June, July and August, when the hot sun shines on the shallow water, the lake becomes renoid. It is then difficult to drink this water, but the school has no other option. In addition the fall from this lake to the school is so little that no pressure sufficient for fire fighting is generated.\n\nAbout three miles from, and above, the school there are springs in the rock. This is known as the Felker spring. This spring gives abundance of excellent water, at present goes to waste. If this water was piped to the school, the fall to which is about 250 feet, there would be a pressure of about 100 pounds to the sq. inch in the pipes at the school. This would be excellent for fire fighting. I understand that this water has been filed on by other interests; but if it is not used in another year or so, the school might well be able to file on it. There are other springs nearer to the school which might well be investigated. I do not think they would produce as great a flow as the Felker springs, and if the water were piped to the school the pressure in the pipes would not be as great as 100 pounds to the sq. in.\n\nWater is also brought from San Jose Creek direct. This comes through an open flume. This flume runs through the playground at the back of the girls' home. At this point it is about 2 ft. by 3 ft. and is sunk in the ground so that the top of the flume is level with the surface of the ground. This water is used for irrigation. The girls also bathe in the flume in the summer.\n\nOn several occasions, and twice this spring, the ice breaking up produced a jam in the flume. This caused the girls' basement to become flooded. I inquired why this water could not be used for domestic purposes, as it did not come through Yellow Lake. I am informed that the fall is so slight that there would be no pressure to force the water through the pipes.\n\nI think that the whole question of a proper supply of water for fire fighting and domestic use may well be left over for another year.\nOttawa, September 4, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your 15/16/2282 of the 29th ultimo, with reference to certain repairs required at the Cariboo Indian Residential School. It is noted from the enclosed report of Inspector Barry that the following repairs can be made at a cost of approximately $120:\n\n1. Cement floor and drainage pipe for the dairy room.\n2. Fire bricks for the firebox in the laundry.\n3. New grates for heating furnace (water tank in laundry).\n4. New grates for furnace in girls' building.\n\nYou may authorize Mr. Taylor to proceed with the above mentioned repairs at as early a date as possible and request him to keep the cost within the estimate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

BOX 668\nVICTORIA, B.C., September 15, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to transmit herewith copy of a letter dated September 10th instant, received at this office from Mr. Indian Agent Taylor, of Williams Lake Agency, in which a grant of One Hundred Dollars is sought from the Department wherewith to purchase lumber for the necessary repairs of flooring which is reported to have become insecure in the dormitories of the Cariboo Indian Residential School. This letter will be self-explanatory, and I am submitting the request to the Department with a view to obtaining its instructions as to whether or not the proposed work may be proceeded with. It will be noted that the amount asked for is for the purchase of lumber only, the labor is to be taken care of by the school Manual Training Class under the supervision of their instructor.\n\nEnclosure:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Dittrich,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOffice of Indian Agent,\nWilliams Lake, B.C.\nSept. 10, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to inform you that I am in receipt of a request from the Principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School, for lumber to make safe and solid dormitory floors, which are now sagging and in an unsafe condition.\n\nI have inspected these floors, and am satisfied that the repairs requested are necessary\u2014there is certainly an element of danger in the present insecure state of the floors which sink under the weight of the pupils when they enter the rooms.\n\nThe various beams and posts required amount in all to 350 linear feet of beaming and 300 feet of studding posts. Second grade fir, which is obtainable locally, would do for this work, and the estimated cost is $200.00.\n\nThe actual work would be done by the boy pupils under the Manual Training Instructor, thus deriving a practical lesson from the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. H. Taylor,\nIndian Agent.\n\nW. W.

(RG 10, Volume 6438, file 878-5, part 3)\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter #1-15 dated Feb. 24th.\n\nMr. Taylor, local Indian Agent, was here yesterday, and I think that he is satisfied that we are doing all we can for fire prevention. I was going to ask the Department for more fire extinguishers, but the Indian Agent believes that by placing what we have at more strategic points, we have enough. It was Colonel Pragnell who suggested the present number.\n\nAs the Department is aware, we have no fire hoses and no water with which to fight fire. We keep water in pails in the dormitories and other places but we can do nothing more as we have no pressure. On laundry days, we are frequently without water on the second stories of our various buildings. Moreover, at present we have a very limited supply of domestic water. The wooden pipes, which bring our water from Yellow Lake, an artificial reservoir, were laid twenty years ago (1917). They sprung at least two leaks recently with the result that a great deal of water is lost. We can do nothing in this regard until the ground thaws out. I fear that a great deal of expense will have to be incurred as the whole pipe line, after twenty years of service, may be in bad condition.\n\nIn so far as fire drills and a night watchman are concerned, there is nothing to worry about; the case is far different when it comes to our great lack of water.\n\nI beg to remain yours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Scott\nMEMORANDUM\n\nFebruary 11, 32\n\nDR. SCOTT,\n\nIn connection with your further memorandum of the 9th instant regarding the purchase of galvanized iron laundry tubs for the Cariboo Indian Residential School, the Ministry would like to know if these are standard articles and if they can be procured locally. If not standard, is it possible to have them made by a local tinsmith or plumber?\n\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is not perfectly clear, but I think that the quotation was obtained by the Reverend G. Forbes, the Principal of the school, without any authority from the Department. It may have been obtained by the Indian Agent, Mr. H. M. Taylor, but judging by the papers I think the Principal must have obtained it. I could of course ascertain this by communicating with Agent Taylor, and will write him if the Minister would like me to do so.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

A quotation has been received from Crane Limited of Vancouver. This firm is a wholesale concern and I believe a saving would be effected if purchase were made from them but I am unable to find the name on the Vancouver list. May I have your instructions?\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nSir;\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st inst. relative to a request received by you from the Rev. Principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School, for new laundry tubs.\n\nThere is no power laundry in operation at this School - the wooden laundry tubs which are ranged around the walls are, as the Principal states, also used by the girls as bath tubs, owing to lack of bath house facilities.\n\nHot and cold water is piped to the tubs which are at present made of wood, very old and now beyond repair. Galvanised iron laundry trays are required to put the laundry into proper workable condition and I have a quotation from Crane Limited, Vancouver B.C., as follows:\n\n| Item                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total   |\n|-----------------------|----------|------------|---------|\n| One 7 section tray    |          | $115.00    |         |\n| One 5 ditto           |          | $4.00      |         |\n| Two 6 @ $98.50 each   |          |            | $197.00 |\n| **Total**             |          |            | $396.00 |\n\nThis quotation is F.O.B. the School station at 145 Mile but does not include waste pipe. For pipe and fitting another $25.00 may be allowed.\n\nWe have recently had the laundry overhauled and new fire grates and heating tank installed for the heater which supplies the hot water, and with the installation of these iron tubs the laundry will operate as efficiently as conditions in this old building will permit. I would recommend that consideration be given to the Rev. Principal's request if funds are available.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nThe Secretary\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E. Taylor\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith my report of inspection of the Cariboo Indian Residential School for December 1931, the school being visited on December 21st.\n\nI consulted with Rev. Father Grant of Ottawa re the matter of increased accommodation for children from the Chilcotin Indian Band, and I gather that he has some agreement with the Department in this regard.\n\nThe question of a proper and pure water supply is still a very vexed one. The only water for fire protection is useless on account of lack of pressure, and the fire extinguishers are all we have to rely upon in case of an outbreak.\n\nENGL:\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E.

Principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School requesting that new tubs be supplied for use in the laundry. He states that the tubs at present in use are old and leaking, and are used both for laundry purposes and as bath tubs by the children.\n\nThe Department does not appear to have any definite information as to the laundry equipment required, and I shall be pleased if you will forward your recommendation, together with an estimate of the cost. You should also furnish particulars as to the power that would be used in operating any new laundry equipment and what would be required in this regard, also the cost of same. Please take this matter up with the Principal and inform the Department as soon as possible regarding the requirements and the approximate cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.

C.\nThe Cariboo Indian Residential School\nPost Office: 150 Mile House\nBritish Columbia\n\nJan. 12th /32\n\nTo Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to thank you for your Cheque # 5492 for $92.28. This was to pay for bricks, cement etc. to build a fire box in our laundry. The old one, a tin affair, was badly cracked, cracked open in places and was very dangerous especially in our case as our buildings are old and wooden and we have absolutely no water with which to fight fire.\n\nThis was the most needed but not the only alteration needed in the laundry. Mr. Taylor, local Indian Agent, has applied for new tubs at present we have old, leaky ones made out of wood. On Mondays they serve as laundry tubs and on Saturdays they become the children's bath tubs. I took our Provincial Superior, Father Grant,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6438, file 878-5, part 3)\nTo see the boys taking their bath. He admired their docility as the beds are so small that they have to draw their knees up to their chins to sit in the water. And at the same time they have to take care not to sit on the wooden planks at the bottom of the bed.\n\nI know that the Department is hard put for money, but I trust that a way will be found to help us out in this matter. In order to keep down the Department's expenses, I have bought seven more bed jerseys and some blankets, eating the Oblate Fathers' money and have asked for no compensation for this or for expenses incurred in taking children to an eye specialist in hamilton. We are keen now in the neighborhood. I am glad to be able to say that the children are all well.\n\nAgain thanking you for your cheque.\n\nRemain sincerely yours,\n\nG. J. Wilson\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6438, file 878-5, part 3)\nThe Cariboo Indian Residential School\nPost Office: 150 Mile House\nBritish Columbia\n\nJan. 18th/32\n\nMr. Wm. C. Agar\nDepartment of General Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt was very kind of you to answer the Children's Christmas letter. The telegram came just as we were about to begin our Christmas Concert and I read it and letters from the Archbishop of Vancouver and from Mr. Mitchell just before Father Grant gave out the presents.\n\nI wish to thank you also for getting us the money to build a fire box in the laundry & to make other repairs. They were greatly needed. The former fire box, of tin, was old, cracked and had several holes in it. There was constant danger of fire even though we kept good watch. You can realize what a fire would mean here as the buildings are old and we have no water with which to fight fire.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6438, file 878-5, part 3)\nAlthough the Department is hard pressed for money, I hope that Mr. Taylor, the local Indian agent, will be successful in getting us some funds. At present we have four wooden tubs divided into about six compartments, each about 2' x 2' x 2', in which the girls do the washing on Mondays and all the children, in turn, take their baths on Saturdays. These tubs are old and, though they have been repaired again and again, they leak. I had Dr. Grant watch some of the boys take a bath. He was amused to see how they could bath in the smallest tub\u2014they had to draw their knees up to their chins and lean over where they bent at the waist in the bottom of the tub, so in the centre it projects a couple of inches. He said I had done well in asking for something better.\n\nAs I have pointed out to the Secretary, I have been at considerable expense to give the children what milk and butter they require. Although we own pure bred Jersey & some Holstein cows at no good deal, I did not ask any help in this matter from the Department. I have spent other money for the children and have asked nothing in return so as to help them down the Government expenses. I hope, however, that a way may be found to give us a few other things which we really need and which Mr. Taylor approves.\n\nAgain thanking you for the five-box and for lumber and other materials for necessary repairs.\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nGeo.

E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosure:\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 29, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, informing the Department that the services of a night watchman have been engaged by the Principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School for the winter months, and requesting that a grant at the rate of $20 per month be provided towards payment of his salary.\n\nIn this connection I have to inform you that the Department will allow the Principal a grant at the above rate towards the salary of the night watchman during the present winter months, viz., November 1, 1932, to March 31, 1933. You should prepare a voucher for the amount due at the above rate to the end of the present year. This voucher should be in triplicate and should be made in favour of the Principal and should read as follows:\n\n\"To grant towards salary of night watchman at the Cariboo Indian Residential School for .... months, from ....... to ......... at $20 per month.\"\n\nThe second voucher in payment should be forwarded at the end of March, next. Please advise the Principal of the grant allowed towards the night watchman's salary.\n\nI have also your letter regarding the fire equipment at this school. You will arrange for the purchase and delivery of six dozen fire buckets of a suitable size, forwarding your account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred. The Department will place an order with the Pyrene Mfg. Co., Toronto, to forward refills for the 6 Thermod and 6 Pyrene fire extinguishers. The above Company will be requested to forward their account to you covering the cost. When the refills are received and in addition, you should certify the account and forward same to the Department for payment. When the refills are received, the Principal should arrange to have them placed in the extinguishers and see that the extinguishers are put in thorough repair and ready for use in case of emergency.\n\nIt is hoped that, with the services of the night watchman and the exercising of proper care in the handling of the furnaces, there will be no danger of fire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. E. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWilliams Lake, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6438, file 878-5, part 3)\nSir:-\n\nI beg to inform you that the Reverend Principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School states that, in accordance with the wishes of the Department, a night watchman has been installed at the School during the winter months, as a precaution against outbreak of fire.\n\nThe Principal wishes to know if the Department will consider contributing $20.00 per month towards the wages of this watchman, from November 1st, 1932 to March 31st, 1933.\n\nThe Principal states that night watchmen in some of the other schools are paid in part by the Department. Not knowing the general practice in this regard I am forwarding the request for your consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.B. Taylor\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nIn regard to fire prevention measures at the Cariboo Indian Residential School, the Reverend Principal informs me that there are no fire buckets on hand in case of emergency. He requests to be supplied with one dozen suitable buckets.\n\nA new furnace has been installed in the new wing built to accommodate the increased pupilage at this School and the Principal requests an additional Pyrene Hand Fire Extinguisher for placement beside the new furnace. He also states that they have six more hand extinguishers requiring re-fills, in addition to the six which were supplied by the Department three years ago, and for which refills are supplied yearly.\n\nAs stated before, we have no water pressure at this School and no method of combating fire except by the Pyrenes and by a bucket brigade.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E. Taylor\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, November 29, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, regarding the purchase of a new set of batteries for the Delco lighting plant at the Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of the supplying of a new 13 plate Ironclad battery, with a five year guarantee. It is noted the price of this new and stronger set of batteries, delivered at the school, is $273.50. The installation of this battery should receive early attention. A voucher in payment should be forwarded as instructed in official letter of October 5th, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nH. E. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWilliams Lake,\nB.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of October 5th last authorising purchase of a new set of batteries for the Delco lighting plant at the Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nFollowing your instructions prices were requested from the three firms mentioned, letters being mailed on Oct. 11th last. Only one firm responded to the request, the other two being very remote from here with difficult shipping facilities and may not have thought it worth while to tender.\n\nThe one quotation received was from G.L.Wain of Kamloops B.C. who quoted as follows:\n\nF.O.B.143 Mile Station, less sales tax & IOE........$206.94\n\nAfter receiving the above quotation a representative of the Delco people called at the office, stating that the above Mr.G.L.Wain was their agent, and quoting on a new 13 plate Ironclad battery with a five year guaranteed warranty of the usual three year guarantee. The price of this new and stronger set of batteries F.O.B.143 Mile Station is.....$275.80.\n\nIt would seem that money will eventually be saved by purchasing a longer lived battery; these new Ironclad type are claimed to be suited to cold climates and the increased in cost is more than overcome by the two years of longer life.\n\nIf funds are available I would recommend the purchase of the Ironclad batteries at $275.80. Awaiting instructions in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nH.E.Taylor\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

Wain, Kamloops, B.W. Irwin, Fort Fraser and Richards & Black, Vanderhoof, B.C.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nSeptember 30, 1932.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HUSKARD,\n\nA new set of batteries is required for the Delco lighting plant at the Cariboo Indian Residential School in the Williams Lake Agency, B.C. The last set of batteries was supplied in March, 1929, and the Indian Agent states that these are now worn out. The set required comprises sixteen cells, at a cost, delivered at the school, of approximately $300. Funds for the purpose are available in the Appropriation for Indian Education. The batteries supplied in 1929 were obtained from Bruce Robinson Electric (B.C.) Limited, 5th Howe St., Vancouver, B.C. It is considered that Vancouver is the most available source of supply.\n\nI should be pleased to be advised of the name of the firm from whom the batteries should be obtained. The Cariboo Indian Residential School is located at 145 Mile Station, on the Pacific and Great Eastern Railway, and in the electoral district of Cariboo.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that I am in receipt of a request from the Reverend Principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School for a new set of batteries for the Delco Lighting Plant in operation at the School. In March 1929 the Department purchased a set of batteries for this purpose at a total cost of $294.20. These are now worn out, their usual life being apparently from three to four years.\n\nThe Reverend Principal points out that he has lately expended considerable money in School improvements. Apart from a large addition to the buildings he has expended $200.00 in steel pipe to replace an open ditch conveying water behind the girls' building, and now has additional expenditure to re-arrange the hot water boiler above the furnace in the boys' building, the present system having been found dangerous on account of too much steam developing in the pipes.\n\nWill you kindly inform me if funds will allow of the purchase of the batteries requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.R.

It appears that these batteries have been purchased from the John Redden Company, 1294 Granville St., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nIn official letter of October 5th, last, you were given the names of three firms from whom you were instructed to obtain prices for the supplying of these batteries. In your letter of November 16th you stated that you had received a quotation from Mr. C. L. Wein, being the only one of the three firms that had quoted a price. Official letter of November 29th authorized you to make the purchase at the price quoted by Mr. Wein, viz.: $273.80.\n\nIn view of the instructions contained in the letters mentioned above, the Department cannot understand why the batteries were purchased from the John Redden Company. Please let me have a full explanation regarding your action in this matter. Consideration of payment of the account will be withheld until your reply is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. E.

They came two weeks ago and they were set up immediately but I did not wish to write before I could assure you that they are very satisfactory. They were really needed as the old set was almost useless.\n\nIn this connection I think that I should point out that, according to what I am told, our Delco plant is too powerful for one set of batteries. Our engineer says that, if the plates in the old set were renewed, the life of the new set, which is guaranteed for five years, would be prolonged. I am going to submit this to Mr. Indian Agent Taylor so that he can investigate and advise you accordingly to what he finds.\n\nAgain thanking you for the batteries and for other favors,\n\nI remain very truly yours,\n\nGeo. Foster, O.M.\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that I am in receipt of a request from the reverend principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School, for a quantity of cement, tile pipe, and iron pipe to put the school laundry room into a sanitary and more efficient condition.\n\nThis laundry room has been the subject of previous correspondence at different times. The waste water drains into an open receptacle which has always been a source of infectious danger, and the floor is always wet and dirty.\n\nI do not know what funds are available this year for such work, but am forwarding the reverend principal's request for your consideration.\n\nPrices of material obtained are as follows:\n\nCement and vitrified tile pipe f.o.b. Williams Lake $215.00\n\n300 ft. iron pipe, couplings, unions, tees, taps and elbows f.o.b. Vancouver $115.00\n\nTotal $330.00\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E.

This salesman apparently called at the request of C.Lwain and Son who are the Kamloops agents for the John Redden Co. of Vancouver. The order for the batteries was placed by letter with the C.Lwain firm in Kamloops, and they wired me when they were shipping the batteries to the School. Apparently C.Lwain & Son forwarded the order to their Vancouver people and collected their sales commission, and asked the John Redden Co. to do the actual shipping.\n\nI should have forwarded a letter with the voucher, explaining the change in the name of the supplying firm, but it did not occur to me to do so.\n\nI enclose a copy of my letter to C.Lwain & Son, ordering the batteries, which I trust makes the matter clear.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E.Taylor\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncl.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept.of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nCOPY\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nCanada.

(RG 10, Volume 6438, file 878-5, part 3)\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise you that I am informed by the Reverend Principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School, that several bad breaks have occurred in the pipeline conveying their water supply to the school. These have been repaired but others are showing. The pipe has been in the ground over twenty-five years and it is evident that the whole pipeline requires renewing.\n\nYou will recall that, as a result of adverse analyses of the water used at the school, the Department intended to put in a new system utilizing water from another source. The proposed cost was high and funds have not been forthcoming to enable the scheme to be proceeded with.\n\nThe present supply of water comes from Yellow Lake, being conveyed through wooden piping for a distance of approximately 4,600 feet, to a storage reservoir, from whence, by gravity flow, it supplies the domestic requirements of the school.\n\nThere is a lot of offensive smelling vegetable matter in Yellow Lake and it has been necessary to clean out the storage reservoir at least once each month for the past two years. The whole pipeline must also be exceedingly foul, judging from the condition of the storage tank each time it is emptied. For drinking purposes water is now being packed by the pail from a small spring near the school, but there is a very limited supply available there. Fortunately the children have left for their summer holidays; otherwise a serious situation would have developed, probably necessitating the closing of the school.\n\nActing upon a suggestion of mine, the school authorities dug a pit beside Yellow Lake and it is claimed that the water will seep into this pit, cleaning itself out the process and rendering the water much more suitable for use. It will be of no avail to convey such purified water through the present foul pipeline even if the pipeline was in good condition. The school intend to enlarge the pit, and erect a sand and charcoal filter. If the resultant supply of water is then conveyed through new piping, the storage tank will remain clean and the buildings will be provided for the first time in many years with good water.\n\nUnless the pipeline is renewed immediately there appears to be no guarantee that there will be a supply of water available for ordinary daily requirements in the school buildings.\n\nI have obtained prices on 2\" pipe from various Vancouver firms, and the cheapest and best type appears to be a solid-drawn steel pipe, coated and wrapped. The cost would be:\n\n5,000 ft of 2\" pipe @ $226.50 per M. . . .$1132.50\n\nLabour for ditching and laying pipe\n5,000 ft. at .20\u00a2 per ft. $1000.00\n\nTotal $2132.50\nThe labour cost is based on $2.00 per day per man. The Rev. Principal states that he can obtain labour at $1.25 per day plus board which is estimated at $.75 per day per man.\n\nI would be glad if the Department would advise me at their earliest convenience if they are prepared to render assistance to renew the pipeline. It may be possible to continue patching any leaks that develop, but there is always the possibility of the supply ceasing for several days at a time, especially in the winter time when locomotives and railway breaks could be much slower and more difficult. With 120 pupils in the school the cessation of the water supply would mean closing down operations.\n\nI would not recommend the renewing of this pipeline unless there was a reasonable assurance of the water being cleaner and purer than heretofore, but I believe it will be.\n\nThe only alternative is the previous scheme which ran into many thousands of dollars.\n\nThe question of boring for well water has been gone into, as has also the possibility of lifting water from the San Jose Creek by means of a ram, but both schemes would be costly and there is no guarantee that a sufficient supply would always be available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E.

Taylor, Indian Agent, Williams Lake Agency, B.C., together with the original of a covering duplicate letter sent therewith in which the Agent states that he is making no recommendation on the request of the Reverend Principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School to be supplied with lumber and other material for certain buildings and repairs at the Institution, at a total cost of \u00a3260.94, the details of the required material being shown in the requisition.\n\nIt should be pointed out that no provision was made by the Indian Agent in his Estimates for the fiscal year 1934-35 for the above mentioned expenditure, but it seems to me that this should be no reason why the requisition should not be approved provided the proposed work is necessary for the proper maintenance of the Institution either from per capita grant or from the Educational Vote. Perhaps the Department will be good enough to refer to the previous reports of Inspector Barry as to the need for such improvements at this Institution and to advise me for the information of Agent Taylor if the Department is in a position to grant the Reverend Principal's request. I have approved the requisition subject to the Department's pleasure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP/KD.\n\nEnclosures:\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAsst.

The material listed, with the exception of the tools and the panels of fir and cottonwood veneer, are for the construction of a new toilet for use of the girl pupils of the School. The remaining material is required for use in the manual training school.\n\nThe girls' toilet building is certainly in a very decrepit condition, but I am unaware what funds the Department have at their disposal for assistance of this kind, and in view of the pressing need for economy am making no recommendation.

No provision for this was made in our Appropriation for the current fiscal year, and it is therefore regretted that authority cannot be given for this work.\n\nHowever, the Department can provide funds to the amount of, approximately, $200 for making necessary repairs to the present pipe-line.\n\nThe necessity for the expenditure mentioned in your letter will have further consideration when the Estimates for 1935-36 are being prepared.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Father Forbes, at the Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nWe have a further letter from Father Forbes indicating that the matter will not be proceeded with at present.

(RG 10, Volume 6438, file 878-5, part 3)\nDear Sir:\n\nYou may have been bothered recently with a number of tenders for water pipe to be supplied to this school. In case you haven't, I wish to inform you that, in so far as I remember, I have authorized no one to submit these tenders to you.\n\nSome time ago we had serious trouble with our water system and, for three or four days, it was doubtful whether or not it could be repaired. We were finally able to patch it up at least for the time being and it is now in as good condition as it has been for some time. I believe that the Department is aware that this water system is not entirely satisfactory. In the first place, it has never had sufficient pressure to afford fire protection. In the second place, there is an evil smell and taste to the water especially in the warmer months. The old pipes are, I believe, saturated with this taste and odor besides being so old that they take a good deal of looking after. Fortunately, there is a small spring of good water nearby from which we are able to haul drinking water when necessary. The old wooden pipe, after being about 30 years in the ground, will soon need renewing unless another plan can be found. I think that a better and cheaper plan can and will be found before long.\n\nMy main object in writing is to assure you that the people who sent in tenders were authorized by me to send them only to the Indian agent and to myself. Mr. Taylor wished to have these estimates before taking the matter up with the Indian Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6438, file 878-5, part 3)\nOttawa, September 7th, 1934.\n\nGentlemen,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, enclosing copy of quotation supplied by your firm to Rev. Geo. Forbes, O.M.I., for galvanized iron pipe at the Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nThis Department has not authorized Father Forbes to incur any expenditure for galvanized iron pipe and, consequently, if he intends to purchase same, he must propose to pay for it from school funds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nMetals Limited,\n578 Beatty Street,\nVancouver, B. C.\nAugust 31st., 1934.\n\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs:-\n\nAttention of Dr. H.W. McGill - Assistant Commissioner\n\nWe are taking the liberty of attaching a copy of a quotation which we are making to rev. rather sorbes of the Cariboo Indian School. In case our tender might be late we have thought it advisable to forward a copy of our tender direct to you and trust that this will meet with your approval.\n\nIt would give us very great pleasure indeed to be favored with your order.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMETALS LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\n\nManager\n\nIndian Affairs.

As the time is limited, Mr. Higgins has suggested that it might be advisable for us to send a copy of our tender direct to Ottawa, and we are therefore taking the liberty of doing so today.\n\nWe are very glad to quote as follows:\n\n6000 ft. of 2\" Standard Galv. Pipe with couplings $22.36 per 100 ft.\nThis price is F.C.B. Vancouver. Terms 2% for Cash paid by the 15th. of the month following delivery.\nThis would work out as follows:\n6000 ft. of 2\" Galv.

Under the heading of Water Supply (Continued) in my last report on this school, and in the portion of the last paragraph marked (2) I mentioned the existence of some small springs near the school. On my present tour of Inspection I found or rather had my attention drawn to some unnamed springs which are located nearer to the school than those mentioned in my last report.\n\nThese newly discovered springs are about 600 yards from the school buildings. They are located on the hillside quite close to and on the opposite side of the San Jose Creek to that occupied by the school buildings. This creek water comes from Lac Le Hache and does not flow through Yellow Lake. I am informed that the water of the creek itself is polluted during part of the year, as farmers place manure dams across the creek higher up, and thus use some of the water for irrigation.\n\nI feel fairly confident that the springs I now draw the attention of the Department to are worthy of investigation. They should be dug out well above high water mark of the adjoining creek. A large cement tank here might be joined by a new pipe line to the existing large tank on the hillside above the school, and the water pumped into this tank so that it would flow by gravity through an existing pipe line to the school.\n\nI recommend that the Department request a full report on the above mentioned source, and pumping proposal. I do not know the exact state of the existing pipe lines or of the present large tank on the hill over the school. I am suggesting this solution to the water problem at the school, as I feel confident that it could be made a success at a fraction of the sum suggested for the Felker Springs project. I am not doing more than this, as it may prove when examined by the Department's engineers to be an impossible project for some technical reason. I think it a good enough proposal to warrant the expense of investigation. I may say that I have had a very brief talk with Mr. Webb with regard to such a project, and am anxious that his advice should be sought in the matter.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. G. H. BARRY ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE CARIBOO INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ON SEPTEMBER 25, 1934.\n\nFire Protection:\n\nThe exit to the new fire escape from the new dormitory on the girls' side of the school had not been used when I visited the school. The door was still nailed or locked up, and the children for whom this escape was erected were making use of the old escape at the back of the convent. My objection to this is that these children have to cross one of the greatest fire hazards, the top of an open stair-way, on their way from the new dormitory to the old escape. This new escape should be placed in use at once. This has no doubt been done long ago, as I spoke strongly about it at the school, and later to Mr. Indian Agent Taylor. There is no expense attached to my recommendation. The Manual Training Class could have this door ready for use in a couple of hours.\n\nThere are now four wooden escapes, one being attached to the boys' building, and the remaining three being located at the rear of the convent.\n\nThe wooden platform at the back of the convent is in a very dangerous state of repair. There are broken planks and holes, and children might easily be hurt if they ventured on to this platform. I previously asked that this platform be repaired. The school does not appear to have the necessary lumber. Only rough boards would be required. The children are not permitted to venture on to this platform. I should like to see it replaced by one on which it would be safe to walk.\nPyrene Manufacturing Company\nOF CANADA LIMITED\n91 DON ROADWAY\nToronto\n\nNOVEMBER SIXTEENTH\n1935\n\nOffice of the Purchasing Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nWe acknowledge with thanks yours of November 7th, also order attached covering five 2-Gallon Pyrene Extinguishers for shipment to schools in B.C.\n\nShipment has been completed on the size specified by yourselves, and therefore it does not appear necessary to supply you with any further data on a type which might be substituted.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPYRENE MANUFACTURING COMPANY\nOF CANADA LIMITED\n\nGCB:AP\n\n\"Fortify For Fire Fighting\"\nOttawa, November 7th.,1934.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nI am requested to provide five Pyrene fire extinguishers of the vaporizing liquid type for one of our schools in British Columbia.

He states that the exit to the new fire escape, from the new dormitory on the girls' side of the school, was not in use. The door was nailed or locked up and the children for whom this escape was erected were making use of the old escape at the back of the convent. This new escape should be placed in use at once, and it is possible that the Principal has already arranged the matter. You should inspect this fire escape, and, if the door is not in use, you should see that it is kept unlocked and ready for use in case of fire. The Inspector states that there would be no expense in connection with having the exit placed in a satisfactory condition, as the manual training class could have this door ready for use in a couple of hours.\n\nThe Inspector also draws attention to the wooden platform at the back of the convent, which, he states, is in a very dangerous state of repair. There are broken planks and holes and the children might easily be hurt if they ventured on the platform. Only rough boards would be required in carrying out the repairs. I have to request that you will arrange with the Principal to have this platform repaired and placed in a good condition, as soon as possible. Should any boards be required, you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the quantity necessary. The labour, however, should be performed by the school staff, without expense to the Department.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you regarding the action taken in having the door of the new fire escape placed in a serviceable condition and stating whether it is kept unlocked.

The Reverend Principal states that a member of the school staff can install the bell if the necessary wire is supplied.\n\nI have found, from time to time, fire extinguishers to supplement the inadequate fire fighting facilities at this School, where we have always been handicapped through lack of any water pressure to fight fire. We are dependent upon the present electrical alarm, and hand extinguishers and fire buckets. The buildings are old and detached, fire bells being now installed in the boys' building, the girls' building and the main staff building. A night watchman is also employed during the winter months.\n\nIn view of the ever present fire menace I believe the additional bell would be a further precaution which is much needed.\n\nThe cost of an adequate bell with the extra wire would not exceed $35.00 and I would ask that this be approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E.

The water would have to be lifted from the river direct. The School authorities have water licenses on San Jose river which include a domestic water allotment. They have a dam on Lac La Hache from which the river runs, and the Principal is satisfied that there would be a sufficient supply of water from this source, if it could be lifted from the river. This would involve about two thirds of a mile of pipe line from the river to the first tank and about one third of a mile of pipe line for the remainder. A water pump would also be necessary.\n\nI would ask that an engineer of the Dominion Water Branch be instructed to examine this proposal and estimate the minimum cost.\n\nI know of no other alternative satisfactory scheme, but do not feel competent to recommend any expenditure on such a scheme without an engineer's advice, as there are so many things to be taken into consideration to ensure a satisfactory delivery of water.\n\nI do not think such an installation would be very expensive and the engineer could perhaps be requested to bear in mind the need for an economical estimate which would give an adequate water supply without any expensive works.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E.

(RG 10, Volume 6438, file 878-5, part 3)\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise that I am in receipt of a letter from the Reverend Principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School, asking that some extra refills be supplied for the fire extinguishers supplied, in order that they may be available when any of the extinguishers have been used and emptied. He states that they had two small fires this spring, one in the blacksmith shop and another which threatened an outbuilding when a brush clearing fire threatened to get away. No damage was done, but it necessitated emptying some of the fire extinguishers, which had been recently refilled with the refills supplied as a result of inclusion in my Estimates for this year.\n\nAs it is advisable that the used extinguishers should be refilled and available for use, I would request that the following further refills be sent to the Reverend Principal, to be kept on hand by him, for that purpose:\n\n5 gallon Pyrene - 3 refills.\n1 quart Pyrenes - 5 \"\nThermene - 3 \"\n\nThe Reverend Principal also sent me a broken part from the inside of one of the Thermene extinguishers.

From this you will note that to provide this school with an adequate water supply will cost a very considerable amount of money. I shall be glad if you will give me an answer to the question which Mr. Webb asks in the last paragraph of his letter, namely, how much money the Department has available for this project.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJune 5, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nYour letter of the 31st ultimo is acknowledged wherein you make a request from the Department of Indian Affairs for a report on the possibilities of a new domestic water supply system for the Cariboo Indian Residential School, Williams Lake Agency. It is noted the department have very limited funds available for this project and ask that consideration be given to the most economical system possible. This matter will be investigated at an early date and report submitted in due course.\n\nA report on a water supply system for this school by Mr. F.R. Archibald dated May 13, 1929 was forwarded to Ottawa on June 7, 1929. This report outlined two schemes both of which required an enormous outlay of money. One from the San Jose river at an estimated cost of $16,000; the other from springs (Falker creek) three miles distant, at $25,500.\n\nIn 1930 tenders were called for the water supply system from springs (Falker creek) but the contract was never awarded due to the fact that some question of priority of water right developed on the springs from which the water was to be taken and we did not feel justified in proceeding without the Indian Department holding the first right on this limited supply. As the situation now stands the first right is held by Mr. Falker, the Indian Department's licence being second.\n\nIn any event the cost of bringing water three miles to the Indian School is high. On the other hand subsequent investigations have failed to disclose an favourable source of supply in closer proximity to the school. We will however keep the matter looked into as stated above and report made, having in mind that funds are very limited at the present time.\n\nYou might let me know how much money the Department has available for this project.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. E. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWilliams Lake, B. C.\nMay 30, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIt has been reported to the department that a new domestic water supply system is required for the Cariboo Indian Residential School, at Williams Lake, B.C. Would you kindly instruct your District Engineer in Vancouver to make an inspection and report, together with an estimate of the cost of this system. I would ask you to particularly impress upon him that funds are very limited and consideration should be given to the most economical system possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nDominion Water Power Branch,\nOttawa.\nSir;-\n\nI beg to refer to my letter of April 4th last in answer to yours of March 28th last regarding the domestic water supply for the Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nI have this date again taken up the matter with the Reverend Principal, but he has no definite suggestions as to what should be done.\n\nRenewal of the existing pipe-line, as was suggested, will still entail the use of water from Yellow Lake which is partly stagnant during the hot months, and which is now used from storage tank which is cleaned out monthly to ensure fresh water.\n\nA pipe line from San Jose river could be run to this tank which could be converted into a filter tank, and the water then pumped to a second unused tank above the buildings. The water would have to be pumped from the river directly. School authorities have water licenses on San Jose river which include a domestic water allotment. They have a dam on La La Hache from which the river runs, and the Principal is satisfied that there would be a sufficient supply of water from this source, if it could be lifted from the river. This would involve about two thirds of a mile of pipe line from the river to the first tank and about one third of a mile of pipe line for the remainder. A water pump would also be necessary.\n\nI would ask that an engineer of the Dominion Water Board be instructed to examine this proposal and estimate the minimum cost. I know of no other alternative satisfactory scheme, but do not feel competent to recommend expenditure on such a scheme without an engineer's advice, as there are so many things to be taken into consideration to ensure a satisfactory delivery of water.\n\nI do not think such an installation would be very expensive and the engineer could perhaps be requested to bear in mind the need for an economical estimate which would give an adequate water supply without any expensive works.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E.

Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nVancouver, B.C.,\nAugust 21st, 1935\nREPORT\n\non\n\nWATER SUPPLY\n\nfor\n\nSt. JOSEPH'S MISSION SCHOOL\n\nby\n\nW. C. WARREN\n\nVancouver, B.C.,\nAugust 21st, 1935\nSir:\n\nSt. Joseph's Mission School\n\nWater Supply\n\nAs requested I made an investigation of the available source for a suitable supply of water for domestic use for the above institution and wish to submit as follows:\n\nPresent Source of Supply.\n\nThe present source of domestic supply is from Yellow Lake, which prior to 1881 was a slough. This slough was found to be conveniently situated and was used for irrigation purposes by diverting the San Jose River into it. Yellow Lake was not used however for domestic purposes until 1912 when a spring which up to that time had been the source of supply went dry, and a new pipe line was laid from Yellow Lake to the school.\n\nIn 1922 the low ground between Yellow Lake and Trout Lake broke away. A dyke was then constructed across the east end of what is now Trout Lake and the diversion ditch from San Jose River brought into it.\n\nYellow Lake is situated at an elevation of about 50 feet above the school site. It is about 15 acres in extent and has a maximum depth in excess of 13 feet. A flow of about 4 cubic feet per second normally takes place from the San Jose River through the lake and when not used for irrigation purposes finds its way back to the river.\n\nThe water system consists of a two inch wood-stave pipeline from Yellow Lake to a small tank of about\n2000 gals. capacity near the school buildings from which distribution is made to various points of use. Service pressure varying from 5 to 15 pounds. There is no provision for fire service.\n\nProspective Sources of Supply.\n\nThe available sources of supply are:\n\n1.- San Jose River or Yellow Lake\n2.- Felker Spring\n3.- Ground water.\n\nThe first and last only of these sources were examined by me as Felker Spring is already the subject of a report by Mr. F. R. Archibald dated May 13, 1929, who estimated the cost of developing that source at approximately $29,000.00.\n\nThe San Jose River water diverted either directly from the river or by way of Yellow Lake would provide an abundant supply of water for all uses of the school, although the water in its natural state is of poor quality, and is sometimes unfit for human consumption. Material improvement could be effected by filtration, and if necessary it could be sterilized.\n\nRegarding a supply from below ground, several small springs show along the bank of the San Jose River in the vicinity of the school. It is probable their source is irrigation water. The available ground supply appears to be limited although the quality as represented by the sample analyzed is fair. See Appendix IA.\n\nI have accordingly made up estimates of the cost of developing the above mentioned sources of supply which are attached hereto - Appendix #2.\nSchool Requirements:\n\nThe domestic requirements of St. Joseph's school are probably the lowest per capita of any of the residential schools in the province, being about 25 gals per day. This is in part due to the poor quality of the water, but more particularly to the limited facilities of the schools. In addition to about 2,500 gals per day for domestic use an amount of about 500 gals per day is necessary for stock watering.\n\nGround Water Development:\n\nThe accompanying plan shows a possible development of a small spring on the bank of the San Jose River, the flow of which at the time of my visit in July was six gals per minute. I have been informed that this spring has been flowing for at least 10 years, which would indicate that it was of a fairly permanent character, as during the past ten years some of the driest periods on record have been experienced in that locality. However as it is probable the source is from irrigation water, the supply should continue so long as irrigation is carried on in that vicinity. While it might be possible to secure a ground water supply from wells closer to the school, it is not to be considered, due to the possibility of contamination.\n\nOwing to the situation of the spring mentioned, care would be necessary in developing it for use in order to exclude the San Jose River at freshet period. Protection against extremely cold winter conditions would be necessary for pumping equipment as it is not possible to provide an underground pump house at the spring.\n\nThe estimated cost of developing the spring to provide for domestic requirements, exclusive of laundry, flush toilets,\noutbuildings, etc., is $2,625.00.\n\nThe system would comprise a 1250 gal. pressure tank with pump equipment, capable of supplying approximately 12 gal. per minute from a collecting well at the spring of about 800 gals. capacity. The distribution system would parallel the present system and supply all services in the school buildings except those noted, which would be served from the present system so long as it is possible to keep it in repair.\n\nThe system outlined above while it would fill the immediate requirements for a supply of water of fair quality for domestic purposes would not appear to completely solve the problem in regard to this school, as in all probability the present pipe line from Yellow Lake would have to be renewed in the course of a year or two.\n\nSan Jose River Supply:\n\nTo develop a water supply system for St. Joseph Mission from the above source for domestic purposes only would require an ultimate outlay of $11,059.00 and to provide for fire protection as well would require approximately $20,220.00 by making use of Yellow Lake. The cost of diverting directly from the San Jose River would exceed these figures by a substantial amount and would not be advantageous in any way.\n\nThe system contemplated would require the renewal of the present two inch pipe line from Yellow Lake, now almost at the end of its life, by a three inch pipe line capable of delivering a supply of 25 gals per minute to two pressure filters, connected for a series or parallel operation and delivering to a storage reservoir of 7,500 gals capacity. Distribution to points of use to be made through the present\nsystem until such time as the existing pipe is renewed. It would be necessary to improve the condition of Yellow Lake materially if it is to be used for the purpose of a water supply.\n\nIt is suggested in this connection that Yellow Lake be separated from Trout Lake and a new ditch constructed to Yellow Lake from the San Jose River, also that the vegetation in Yellow Lake for the greater part should be removed and the lake treated occasionally for algae. I have been informed that since the two lakes have been joined the growth of weeds in Yellow Lake has increased considerably as has also the unpleasantness of taste and odor of the water.\n\nAs there does not appear to be facilities for drawing off the lake near the bottom, I would suggest that a 12 inch culvert be installed at a depth of 6 feet or greater if possible, and that all irrigation and excess water be drawn down through it in order to prevent present stagnant condition, and reduce the percentage of decayed vegetable matter in the water used.\n\nAlso that the intake pipe be extended to a distance of 250 feet into the lake when being renewed.\n\nThe improvements suggested may be carried out as funds become available, and need not all be considered an immediate necessity. It would be desirable to carry out a program of development in the following order.\n\n1.- Filter system and storage tank.\n2.- Separating the lakes, new diversion ditch, cleaning and treating.\n3.- Renewing intake pipe and provide deep draw off culvert.\n4.- Renewal of pipe line lake to school.\n\nShould it not be possible to keep the pipe line in repair until such time as replacement can be made it might be necessary\nto interchange 3 and 2 in order of precedence.\n\n**Felker Spring:**\n\nI am informed by the Mission School authorities that the prior licensees on Felker Spring is prepared to relinquish priority to the school to the extent of their domestic requirements should the school be prepared to develop that source of supply.\n\n**Fire Protection:**\n\nIt is not possible to provide a supply of water in sufficient volume (500 g.p.m.) for fire protection purpose from any other source in the immediate locality than the San Jose River. As the pressure head provided by Yellow Lake is insufficient for purposes of fire protection, it will be necessary to install a booster pump on the fire line to produce the necessary pressure.\n\nThe cost of providing a fire protection service is estimated at $13,075.00 if installed separately and if provided in conjunction with the domestic water supply from the same source $9,165.00.\n\nThis installation could be carried out as an extension of the suggested progressive development for the domestic supply, the additional outlay for the third step would be $2,930.00 or a total of $6,650. for installation of the larger pipeline from Yellow Lake. The fourth step would be the addition of booster pump and fire stations at a cost of $6,425.00\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\nWhile the development of the spring water supply may be carried out at a minimum cost and with some assurance that it is of fair quality, the supply is definitely limited, although it may reasonably be assumed that the source\nis irrigation water, there is no assurance that the flow may not decrease beyond the point of usefulness at some time during the year.\n\nOn the other hand should the spring continue to flow at its present rate, all of the requirements of the school would have to be pumped from this source within a year or two at a probable cost of $20.00 to $25.00 per month as the renewal of the pipeline from Yellow Lake would not likely be undertaken.\n\nThe San Jose River is an unfailing source of supply, even in the driest years experienced there has not been a shortage of water from Yellow Lake for domestic purposes. The quality of the water however is definitely not good although it can be improved by treatment to compare favorably with that from the spring above referred to.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nI am of the opinion that the present source of supply, the San Jose River by way of Yellow Lake is most likely to provide a permanent supply of water for use of the schools, and for that reason should be developed as means become available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

As a temporary measure only the spring referred to may be tapped, but in view of the uncertainty of the supply from this source I am loathe to recommend it.\n\nUndoubtedly Felker Creek would give the most satisfactory water supply but it seems to me its cost is prohibitive, on the other hand it is estimated a satisfactory supply from Yellow Lake will cost something over $20,000.00.\n\nIt is unfortunate that there is no satisfactory water supply in close proximity to this institution, but if the school is to remain in its present site for the next 10 or 15 years the department would be well advised to develop a satisfactory water supply system from the San Jose River or Felker Creek even though the cost is expensive relative to the value of the buildings at the institution.\n\nCopies of this report are today being forwarded to Ottawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\nBox 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\n\nC. E. Webb\nDistrict Chief Engineer\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of August 20th regarding domestic water supply system for the Cariboo Indian Residential School, I enclose herewith copy of a report by Mr. Warren, dated August 21st, together with a copy of a covering letter from Mr. Webb to Mr. Perry, dated August 27th.\n\nFrom this you will see that a temporary supply of water may be obtained from a spring near the school at an estimated cost of $268.00. This appears to offer a temporary solution of the difficulty and would seem capable of improving the water supply until a permanent solution of the difficulty is decided upon. I shall be glad to have your further instructions in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nV.

Mr. Warren's estimate for the domestic supply from the spring (Appendix 2) was based on using this tank; it will therefore be subject to correction due to the necessity of purchasing a new tank. The revised estimate will be forwarded at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nBem. Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nC. H.

The report of the engineer has now been received. He states that the installing of a fully adequate system for the domestic water supply and also for fire protection would cost approximately $15,000. He states, however, a sufficient supply for domestic purposes, exclusive of laundry, flush toilets and outbuildings, can be obtained from a small spring, at a distance of 1250 ft. from the school, and that this supply would meet the immediate requirements for several years. He estimates the cost of supplying material, equipment and labour to be approximately $2,625.\n\nThe sum of $2,500 is provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year, to improve the water supply at this school. As this work should be carried out this fall, before the extreme cold weather sets in, I would recommend that I approve of the expenditure required - approximately $2,625 - and that the work be carried out by the Dominion Water Power Branch, under the supervision of their engineer.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to my letter of the 4th instant regarding domestic water supply system for the Cariboo Indian Residential School, I enclose herewith copy of a letter from Mr. Webb dated the 9th instant regarding the pneumatic pressure tank at the Kamloops Industrial School which he had proposed to use as part of a new equipment at the Cariboo School. A copy of this letter has been also sent to Mr. Ferry.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSeptember 9, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nRe: Department of Indian Affairs Equipment.\n\nOn May 1st last I forwarded a copy of a letter from Fernie Brothers, Kamloops, dated April 27, 1935, in which they offered $100 for the pneumatic storage tank at the Kamloops Industrial School. Your letter of May 16th advising that the disposal of the tank was being turned over to Col. R.H. Beer, Dominion Salvage Officer, was received. Since that time we have heard nothing in the matter although we wrote Fernie Brothers advising them of what had taken place and suggesting that they get in touch with us in the course of a week or so if they did not hear from Col. Beer.\n\nI am now advised by Mr. Corbould under date of September 3rd that tenders were called for the sale of this tank in July last and the bid of Mr. F.W. Gale of Kamloops of $15.00 was recently accepted by Ottawa.\n\nSo far as I can gather notices covering the proposed sale of this tank were forwarded by the Salvage Officer to Mr. Indian Agent Ferguson at Kamloops. Mr. Ferguson knew nothing of the Fernie Brothers offer the matter having been handled by this office, it being Indian Department material under our charge. Mr. Corbould was aware of such matters at the time but it was not possible for Mr. Ferguson to contact him before distributing the notices and it so happens Fernie Brothers were not called on for tenders by Mr. Ferguson.\n\nIt appears that Mr. Gale's bid of $15.00 was accepted and he now wants to remove the tank alone with several valves. Certainly he should receive nothing more than the tank and as a matter of fact it now develops that the tank will come in useful in the construction of a domestic water supply system at St. Joseph's Indian Residential School near Williams Lake. I am given to understand that Mr. Gale is refusing to accept the tank without the valves. If this is so I would suggest that the sale be cancelled and thus leave the tank, valves and\n\nJ.T.

Webb, District Chief Engineer, Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau at Vancouver, has furnished me with copy of a letter dated October 4th, instant, sent by him to his Director at Ottawa in regard to the additional cost of installing a water system from a spring to serve Cariboo Indian Residential School. If you will refer to my letter covering the estimates for the new fiscal year, it will be seen that I pointed out that Mr. Webb could not recommend this project. For this reason it is my opinion that before the expenditure is undertaken, Mr. Webb should be asked to make a definite recommendation in support of the engineer's report recently submitted.\n\nIn an interview with Mr. Webb whilst considering the new estimates, he informed me that he could not support the proposed development from the spring referred to.\n\nA copy of Mr. Webb's letter of October 4th is sent herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOctober 4, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nYour letter of the 30th instant is acknowledged wherein is quoted a letter of September 26th from the Department of Indian Affairs authorizing the construction of a domestic water supply from a spring to serve Cariboo Indian Residential School, as outlined in Mr. Warren's report of August 21, 1935, at a cost of $2625.00. You will note from my letter of September 26th which no doubt had not been received at the time your letter was written, that it is estimated an additional $375.00 will be required for this project making a total of $3000. instead of $2625.00.\n\nWhile Mr. Warren's time is very fully occupied at the present time we will endeavour to have the work undertaken at as early a date as possible, bearing in mind that Indian labour should be employed as far as possible but if any white labour is required the instructions to consult with Mr. John A. Fraser, Quesnel, will be complied with.\n\nI will therefore advise you later when the project is to be undertaken so that the advance of $3000. may be applied for.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. E.

As the tank at Kamloops is not now available, this expenditure will not be incurred.\n\nI note from your letter that the new pressure tank will cost $375.

MACKENZIE.\n\nCHG. DEPT. I.A.\nMr. Ph. Phelan,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nThe Very Reverend Father Scannell has written to me saying that you wish me to write to you in connection with the new domestic water system which the Department has kindly agreed to install in this school. First, however, I wish to thank you for Mr. J.M. Bennett's \"Catechetics\" and for the donation towards painting some of the buildings. You suggested that some inside painting be done. I am pleased to report that, thanks to your suggestion and the cheque, the boys' dormitory, toilet, playroom and clockroom look much cleaner and brighter. The exterior of the manual training shop also was painted.\n\nMr. Warren, the Engineer, sent by the Department, spent about a week here and went into the question thoroughly. I have not a copy of his report and, so, cannot go into it thoroughly. Mr. Indian Agent Taylor lent me his copy and I believe that it, the report, is accurate. I am not, however, convinced that the water now used is as dangerous as suggested. I have used it for over four years and have felt no ill effects. Two or three years ago, when the weather was very warm in the summer and the water low, the smell and the taste of the water were unbearable. Since then, in the warm months, the taste and the smell have been very unpleasant but, except for a week or two, bearable. However, on several occasions, this water has been analyzed by the Provincial Analyst and has been pronounced unfit for human consumption so that if any illness or epidemic were occasioned by the use of this water the school and, perhaps, the Department might be held responsible. A new water supply, for domestic purposes, is, therefore, at least highly advisable.\nBut the Indian Department knows all this and appreciated it to the extent that for the last five or six years it has been seeking a solution to the problem. Five or six years ago it sent engineers upon whose recommendation it had $25,000 appropriated to install a new system and that system would have been installed had not Mr Felker refused to give up his first rights on the source of supply. (May I here remark that three or four years ago Mr Felker agreed to give up his rights in our favor? Unfortunately the Department had no longer the funds to avail itself of Mr Felker's offer). Quite recently, the Department sent an engineer and was prepared to install a new domestic water supply system. Why oppose it?\n\nI did not oppose it. After Mr Warren's survey, things moved more quickly than I had anticipated and one morning Mr Indian Agent Taylor informed me, as did also a letter, that the work was to begin, at least as I understood it, immediately. I telegraphed to my Superior asking him to have the work held up until he received a letter from me. In this letter I said that the proposed work called for the installation of an engine and a reservoir in an O.M.A.T. building besides the installation of pipes, etc., in other Oblate buildings. I believed that I needed his permission for this. I also put both sides of the question before him. The ultimate solution is the more costly plan of Mr Warren\u2014the bringing of the water through purifiers, from Yellow Lake or from the San Jose river. As Mr Warren pointed out, the source he suggested would supply only domestic water (and he suggested this only as a second best) so that the most of the water would still have to come from Yellow Lake. He pointed out, furthermore, that the pipes from Yellow Lake, which are wooden and about 30 years old and, in the past 3 years, have broken so repeatedly that they cannot last more than a year or two longer\u2014he pointed out that these pipes would in all likelihood have to be replaced next year or the following year and he added that, on that account, unless the School would not be rebuilt within ten or fifteen years (and it would then be built, quite likely, on another location) it would be better to install the costlier system which would be\ncheaper in the long run, I might add that the plan recently adopted affords no fire protection. I cannot speak officially but I have reason to believe that, if the Department considered a new school, very satisfactory arrangements with regard to land would be made.\n\nTo sum up, the costlier scheme or the bringing of the water from the spring contemplated about six years ago would be the best solution. That would cost a great deal but would be the better solution if the money is available. If it is not, then, as a second best, the cheaper plan should be followed. So far, no evil effects have been felt, except for the taste and the odor, from the present source but this source has been condemned by the Provincial Analyst to whom the engineers and, under instructions, I believe, Inspector Barry sent samples.\n\nAs I am more than busy, I would ask you to excuse the haste with which this has had to be written.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Boulthbee Ltd. of Vancouver, that firm being then the agents for Delco equipment. The cost of this armature was $120.00 as per my Voucher No. 7397.\n\nIn November last the Principal of the school informed me that this armature was defective and that the lighting plant was operating unsatisfactorily. I ascertained that Messrs. Boulthbee Ltd. has given up their Delco agency and that it had been taken over by the MacKinnon Sales & Service Ltd. of Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI took up with this firm the matter of replacing the allegedly defective armature and they stated that it was probably burnt out owing to electrical faults in the switchboard of the Delco plant. They offered to send a man up from Vancouver to check over the plant for the sum of $60.00 plus cost of any necessary parts.\n\nAs I had no authority to incur this expense I referred the matter to the School Principal who sent for the repair man. After examination the repair man reported that the armature supplied by Boulthbee Ltd. was defective and that a new one also some other parts, and the Principal paid him $120.00 and asked me to submit this account to the Department for payment. I have held this account pending a possible adjustment with Boulthbee Ltd. who, I think, should make a rebate for the defective armature purchased by the Department. I am still corresponding with them.\n\nThe service man from MacKinnon Sales and Service recommended that, in view of the age of the plant, which is fifteen years, that a new automatic plant be installed and the present one kept for emergency. He stated that there was no guarantee that the plant would continue to operate satisfactory as many parts were worn out and were in need of replacing.\n\nShortly afterwards the Principal advised me that the cylinder head in the plant engine was cracked and might cease to function at any time. Another engine was borrowed for a while but had to be returned.\n\nThe present plant was purchased by the Oblate Order but the Principal stated that he had no funds to replace it and requested me to ascertain if the Department could supply a new plant.\n\nA quotation was submitted by MacKinnon Sales & Service as follows:\n\n- A 2 kilo 32 volt Model 20 A.B.3 Delco Lighting Plant at $960.00 F.O.B. the School.\n- A set of Ironclad Batteries for $85.00.\n\nThis plant is made in the U.S.A. and if admitted into Canada as a farm machine there would be a reduction of $100.00.\non the lighting plant and $35.00 on the batteries.\n\nThus the total cost would be either $1241.00 or $1026.00.\n\nThe Principal states that the fire hazard is greatly increased by having to use lamps and matches when the light fails. At the time of writing, the plant is still working but the Principal advises me that the cylinder head is only just hanging together and that the engine valves are also going and that the plant may quit at any time. I understand that the MacKinnon Sales & Service of Vancouver are the British Columbia distributors for Delco plants and that any sales would go through them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E.

Mr. Webb's attention has accordingly been directed to the necessity for avoiding increased cost; if he finds that winter conditions have set in, in that district, in which case he is to consider the advisability of deferring the matter until next spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 28, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to previous correspondence - your File No. 2543-A - regarding the domestic water supply system for the Cariboo Indian Residential School, I shall be pleased if you will advise Mr. Webb to proceed with the work, as stated in our letter dated September 26th, last. Mr. Webb should arrange for the purchase of the materials, from the best available sources of supply; and also for any extra labour that may be required, over and above that which can be carried out by the staff of the school. An accountable cheque, to the amount of $2,815, has been sent you for this purpose.\n\nItemized accounts, in triplicate, should be obtained, covering the cost of all materials, and proper time sheets, in triplicate, covering the labour employed. The labour returns should show the number of days or hours the men were employed and the rate paid, and they should be receipted by each individual labourer at the time payment is made. The bills for the material and labour should be forwarded in accounting for the expenditure of the advance mentioned above. It is hoped that the entire sum can be kept within the amount provided. We understand that winter is set in in the Cariboo district, which may involve a greatly increased expense in carrying out the work. If Mr. Webb considers it is too late in the season to have the work completed for the amount provided, it might be advisable to defer the matter until next spring. I would request that you advise Mr. Webb, by wire, accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6438, file 878-5, part 3)\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt this date of your telegram of the 4th inst., requesting particulars regarding the request of the Principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School for a new Delco lighting plant complete with an extra set of batteries.\n\nIn February last the Department paid for a new armature which was supplied for the present lighting plant by Messrs. Boultbee Ltd. of Vancouver, that firm being then the agents for Delco equipment. The cost of this armature was $100.00 as per my Voucher No.7387.\n\nIn November last the Principal of the school informed me that this armature was defective and that the lighting plant was operating unsatisfactorily. I ascertained that Messrs Boultbee Ltd. has given up their Delco agency and that it had been taken over by the MacKinnon Sales & Service Ltd. of Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI took up with this firm the matter of replacing the allegedly defective armature and they replied that it was probably burnt out owing to electrical faults in the switchboard of the Delco plant. They offered to send a man up from Vancouver to check over the plant for the sum of $40.00 plus cost of any necessary parts.\n\nAs I had no authority to incur this expense I referred the matter to the School Principal who sent for the repair man. After examination the repair man reported that the armature supplied by Boultbee Ltd. was defective. He put in a new one also some other parts, and the Principal paid him $125.40 and asked me to submit this account to the Department for payment. I have held this account pending a possibly adjustment of Boultbee Ltd., who, I think, should make a rebate on the defective armature purchased by the Department. I am writing corresponding with them.\n\nThe advice I received from MacKinnon Sales & Service recommended that in view of the age of the plant, which is fifteen years, that a new automatic plant be installed and the present one kept for emergency. He stated that there was no guarantee that the plant would continue to operate satisfactorily as many parts were worn out and were not worth replacing.\n\nShortly afterwards the Principal advised me that the cylinder head in the plant engine was cracked and might cease to function at any time. Another engine was borrowed for a while but had to be returned.\n\nThe present plant was purchased by the Oblate Order but the Principal stated that he had no funds to replace it and requested me to ascertain if the Department could supply a new plant.\n\nA quotation was submitted by MacKinnon Sales & Service as follows:\n\n- A 2 kilo 32 volt Model 20 A.B.3 Delco Lighting Plant at $960.00 F.O.B. the School.\n- A set of Ironclad Batteries for $211.00.\n\nThis plant is made in the U.S.A. and if admitted into Canada as a farm machine there would be a reduction of $120.00.\non the lighting plant and $35.00 on the batteries.\n\nThus the total cost would be either $1241.00 or $1026.00.\n\nThe Principal states that the fire hazard is greatly increased by having to use lamps and candles when the light fails. At the time of writing, the plant is still working but the Principal advises me that the cylinder head is only just hanging together and that the engine valves are also going and that the plant may quit at any time.\n\nI understand that the MacKinnon Sales & Service of Vancouver are the British Columbia distributors for Delco plants and that any sales would go through them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E.

However, I should be pleased to receive a report from you as to the absolute urgency for supplying a new lighting plant at the present time and stating if the present plant would not be serviceable for a further period. As this school is the property of the church authorities, could they not, themselves, obtain a new lighting plant of a type that would be satisfactory and provide the cost of same.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th inst., with reference to the provision of a new Delco Lighting Plant for the Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nThe present plant is still functioning although the Principal advises me that it may fail at any time, but if it carries on for the remainder of the winter it may last for some months.\n\nWhen the matter of a new plant was first discussed I asked the Principal if it could not be provided by the church authorities, in view of the fact that they own the property. The Principal stated that he was operating at a loss and could not find the money.\n\nThe school operates an extensive ranch in connection, for which much of the labour is provided free by the school pupils, and I have often thought that they should be in a position to provide many of the things for which we are continually asked.\n\nI hesitated to express an opinion in this regard in the absence of any definite knowledge of the Departmental policy, and in view of the fact that in the past assistance has always been most generously given.\n\nThere is undoubtedly a growing tendency for the school to look to the Department for every need, and if it is not provided by us, ways would doubtless be found to procure.\n\nThe Rev. Father Forbes, the principal, is now on the prairies and may go to Ottawa, in which case the matter might be taken up with him in person.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.B. Taylor\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, March 21, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 10th instant and to previous communications, regarding the supplying of a Delco lighting plant, to replace the one now in use and which is worn out, at the Cariboo Indian Residential School, I have to confirm the following night lettergram to you of yesterday's date:\n\n\"Arrange purchase, from MacKinnon Sales and Service, Vancouver, Delco lighting plant and set iron-clad batteries for Cariboo School, per their quotation; your letter December fifth, last, namely, nine hundred sixty dollars for lighting plant and two hundred eighty-one for batteries. F. O. B. school. Have order placed and account covering cost dated previous to thirty-first instant; in order payment can be made this year's appropriation.\"\n\nThe Honourable the Minister has approved an expenditure of $1,241.00 in supplying the lighting plant and batteries - this being the place located f. o. b. the school, by MacKinnon Sales and Service, Vancouver, as stated in your letter of December 5th last. The Department will be unable to obtain any reduction in duty on this equipment.\n\nIt is hoped that you can have the order placed and, if possible, the plant and batteries delivered before the end of the current month, so that the payment can be made from the Appropriation for the current fiscal year, before our accounts are closed. If actual delivery has not been made, it will be satisfactory if the account covering the cost is dated previous to the 31st instant. The account, properly certified by you, should, if possible, reach the Department not later than the middle of April. It is to be definitely understood that the school will be responsible for any costs in installing the equipment. Please advise the Principal of the School that authority has been granted to purchase the above mentioned lighting equipment.\n\nI have also your letter of the 10th instant, regarding the request of the Principal for further assistance towards the completion of the new laundry building. As you were informed, the sum of $400 was allotted towards the cost of this work, and accounts have been received for materials covering part of the sum provided. You are advised, on the 18th instant, of an outstanding account in connection with the work. When this account has been certified by you and forwarded, it will utilize practically the balance of the funds that were allowed for the work. I regret that we will be unable to provide any further amount than the sum mentioned above, towards the cost of the laundry building.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. E.

Turgeon, M.P., relative to a communication he received from the Principal of the Cariboo (St. Joseph's) Indian Residential School, 145 Mile Station, B. C. (Electoral District of Cariboo), in which the request is made that the Department provide the funds to complete repairs to the laundry and supply a lighting system.\n\nOur Appropriation for the current fiscal year provided the sum of $400 for repairs, and, in August, last, authority was granted to incur an expenditure not exceeding this amount in the purchase of materials for repairs to the laundry. It was agreed the labour would be performed by the school pupils and the manual training instructor, without expense to the Department. Accounts have been received and paid, to the amount of $386.00, covering the cost of materials.\n\nRegarding the supplying of a lighting plant, to replace the present old plant, which is unfit for further service, I would refer to my memorandum to the Honourable the Superintendent General of January 7th, last, requesting approval for incurring an expenditure of approximately $1,241.00, in supplying a Delco lighting plant and batteries, and to your reply of the 13th of the same month, in which you stated as follows: \"The Minister thinks that this matter should be allowed to remain in abeyance for the time being.\"\n\nI would point out that the Cariboo Residential School is church-owned and is not the property of the Department.\n\nI can only add that, should the Minister give favourable reconsideration, there are funds available, as stated in the memorandum referred to above, to provide the expenditure required in supplying new lighting equipment.\n\nAs requested, I return Mr. Turgeon's letter.\n\nEncl.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMarch 10th, 1936\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am obliged by the Reverend Principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School, Mr. Smith, to request further assistance for the completion of the new laundry building. The sum of $400.00 was allotted by the Department this year towards this building.\n\nIf any funds are available from which assistance can be given there is no doubt that a new laundry is badly needed and that the pupils now at present working under unsanitary conditions in washing in the present laundry quarters.\n\nAs washing is all hand done it is essential that a well-lighted place be available, with proper plumbing and facilities for disposing of waste water. The new building which is being erected by the school boys as a part of their annual training instruction will be suitable in every way and should be completed as soon as possible.\n\nWhen recommending expenditures for this School I always have in mind the fact that the property does not belong to the Department and that, should a new school be built by us it would undoubtedly be upon a different site. Nevertheless, it is necessary that we consider that it is very difficult to get along with old buildings and equipment, and that unsanitary quarters may cause an epidemic sickness which would prove more costly than the required buildings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E. Taylor\nIndian Agent\n\nDr. M.M. McGill\nDeputy Supt. General\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Reverend Principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School has asked me to write to you with reference to the supplying of a Dalco Lighting Plant to replace the one now in use and which is worn out.\n\nThere has been some previous correspondence between this office and the Department in the matter, and under date of January 15th, last, in reply to a letter from the Secretary, I mentioned my views regarding the question of whether the new plant should be purchased by our Department or by the School authorities.\n\nI understand from the Principal that he has written you urging that the new plant be purchased with a portion of the unexpended allotment for providing a domestic water supply for the School. There is no doubt that such a purchase would be an investment, and if the Department intends to continue making the repairs to the old plant it would be cheaper to purchase the new one. The total cost of a plant and batteries would be \u00a3241.00 or, if shipped into Canada as a farm machine, $1025.00.\n\nProviding that the Department is satisfied that the cost of a new plant should be borne by them, there is no doubt that the present plant is unsafe and liable to fail at any time. Should that happen some weeks might lapse before a new plant could be installed. In the meantime there would be a grave fire hazard from use of candles and lamps, as there is no water pressure for fire fighting at the School, dependence being entirely upon hand extinguishers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E. Taylor\nIndian Agent\n\nDr. H.W. McCallum\nDeputy Surveyor General\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nCARIBOO INDIAN SCHOOL\n145-MILE STATION, B.C.\n\nMarch 7th, 1936\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI think it my duty to call your attention to our pressing need of a new Delco plant. You may recall that, owing to its having outlived its natural life by five years, the present plant broke down twice last Fall and caused great inconvenience to say nothing of the heavy costs for repairs which the Department was kind enough to meet. The mechanic, finally sent by the Vancouver Delco Agents, warned us that, although he had done his best, the plant was an old one and that we might expect more trouble at any time.\n\nAs the Delco Agents have only one service man for B.C., it was ten days after our trouble that we were able to get him. We were lucky at that as he was about to start out on a three months tour of the southern part of the Province. During that time we were without electric light and had to use lamps and candles. (We were able to borrow a generator but it proved too small.) As we are in a valley and the hill to the east is high, the classes starting at 4 p.m., had soon to be called off as the strain was too much on the pupils' eyes. The kitchen and other departments also suffered. The greatest cause of worry, however, was the fire hazard. Naturally, we exercised the greatest caution but the danger was there as our 120 pupils are only children after all and an accident might easily have happened during those ten days. The danger is very great here as our buildings are old, dry frame buildings and, except for water buckets...\nand fire extinguishers, we have no fire protection. The Department recognized this fact when, in 1930, it had $25,000.00 appropriated for the installation of a water system as this was the only system that would give us sufficient pressure for fire hoses. (As you may be aware, this system was not installed because the man who had water rights on the source of supply refused to give them up at the time. Shortly after my coming here, I made representations to him, stressing the fire hazard, and he consented to give up his rights in our favor, free of charge, but the money had then reverted to the Treasury).\n\nI do not think it necessary to say more except that I was not the only one to get very little rest during those ten days. Especially as I have done my best to ask for as little as possible, I would ask you to do your utmost to get a new Delco plant for us out of the money which was appropriated for the installation of the domestic water system surveyed and suggested by the Engineer whom the Department sent here last Fall. I know that the Department is at least as anxious as I am to do its utmost to avoid a holocaust in any Indian school.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Taylor, whom I am going to ask to support my request, has, I believe, the quotations on a Delco plant. If I am not mistaken it is about $800.00. I do not know whether or not this includes batteries. If the Department could have the tax taken off, a saving would be made. The Delco man said that there was no tax on Delcos for farm use. Our plant is so old that only $90.00 was offered for it on a \"trade-in\". In that case, it might be well to keep it for emergencies, spare parts, etc.\n\nWhen Mr. Phelan was here, he visited everything on the place. I do not know whether he remembers our laundry. If he does, he will back me up in my statement that there is probably not another like it in any Indian School. In the first place, we have no machinery and I am glad of that as the fact that the girls have to do all the washing by hand is an excel-\nlent training for their lives at home. With this training, washing at home will not seem so hard and the girls will do it regularly as the former schoolgirls now do it on their reserves. However, the floor, being rotten in places, the room dark, somewhat small and not very well ventilated, the plumbing requiring frequent repairs, I decided (and Mr Phelan agreed with me) that all the money appropriated for repairs to the school would be spent on a new laundry. As there were only $400.00 to spend, we were unable to do more than put up the building although nothing was paid out in wages as the boys did the work as part of their manual training. Shingles or siding must still be bought for the outside of the walls, cement for the floor, bricks for the chimney and plumbing fixtures. Besides that, new tubs are required. Metal ones would be best but wooden ones would cost less. Could you please try your best to have the balance of the $2500.00 spent on finishing the laundry which will be big enough, well lighted and properly ventilated? This would greatly lessen the laundry work and, perhaps, benefit the children's health. If Mr Phelan remembers what he saw, he will assure you that I am not exaggerating.\n\nI am pleased to say that things have gone on well this year. Inspector Barry said that he was satisfied. I am pleased to say that the former school children are doing well and show that they have benefited by their stay here. One of them broke into a liquor store but he is one of those whom I sent away.\n\nThanking you for former favors,\n\nI remain yours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S.

Turgeon, M.P., relative to a communication he received from the Principal of the Cariboo (St. Joseph's) Indian Residential School, 145 Mile Station, B. C. (Electoral District of Cariboo), in which the request is made that the Department provide the funds to complete repairs to the laundry and supply a lighting system.\n\nOur Appropriation for the current fiscal year provided the sum of $400 for repairs, and, in August, last, authority was granted to incur an expenditure not exceeding this amount in the purchase of materials for repairs to the laundry. It was agreed the labour would be performed by the school pupils and the manual training instructor, without expense to the Department. Accounts have been received and paid, to the amount of $388.00, covering the cost of materials.\n\nRegarding the supplying of a lighting plant, to replace the present old plant, which is unfit for further service. I would refer to my memorandum to the Honourable the Superintendent General of January 7th last, requesting approval for incurring an expenditure of approximately $1,241.00, in supplying a deluxe lighting plant and batteries, and to your reply of the 13th of the same month, in which you stated as follows: \"The Minister thinks that this matter should be allowed to remain in abeyance for the time being.\"\n\nI would point out that the Cariboo Residential School is church-owned and is not the property of the Department.\n\nI can only add that, should the Minister give favourable reconsideration, there are funds available, as stated in the memorandum referred to above, to provide the expenditure required in supplying new lighting equipment.\n\nAs requested, I return Mr. Turgeon's letter.\n\nEncl.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMarch 7, 1936.\n\nDR.

The Principal stated that he was operating at a loss and could not find the money.\n\nThe school operates an extensive ranch in connection, for which much of the labour is provided free by the school pupils, and I have often thought that they should be in a position to provide many of the things for which we are continually asked.\n\nI hesitated to express an opinion in this regard in the absence of any definite knowledge of the Departmental policy, and in view of the fact that in the past assistance has always been most generously given.\n\nThere is undoubtedly a growing tendency for the school to look to the Department for every need, and if it is not provided by us, ways would doubtless be found to procure.\n\nThe Rev.

Although it has been temporarily patched up, it is considered undesirable, and there is a prospect of the school being deprived of water for domestic purposes at any time.\n\nA report of the Dominion Water Bureau, dated August 21st, 1935, and prepared by Mr. W. C. Warren, deals with the question of water supply for this school, including the matter of renewing the pipeline in question.\n\nMoney was voted last year to install a drinking supply system, as recommended by Mr. Warren, from springs on San Jose river, at an estimated cost of $2325.00. Owing to some confusion regarding an alternative scheme proposed, I believe, by the School Principal, the work was not proceeded with, and the supply from Yellow Lake has been used up to the present time.\n\nThe drinking supply system mentioned above would not provide sufficient water for laundry and other domestic uses, and therefore would not solve the whole water supply question, as noted by Mr. Warren on page 4 of his report, where he also observes that in all probability the present pipe line from Yellow Lake would have to be renewed in the course of a year or two.\n\nMr. Warren estimates the cost of a domestic supply from Yellow Lake at $11,055.00. This provides for new storage tank, filters, new pipe etc.\n\nThe only other alternative appears to be the renewing of the present pipeline to the present storage tank, utilizing the existing pipe line, and cleaning out and chlorinating the tank now in use, at regular intervals. This has not been estimated upon by an engineer. The Principal considers that, with Indian labour, he could replace the same for approximately $2500.00.\n\nAs stated, the use of the springs on San Jose river would not give the School water for all domestic purposes, so that the pipeline from Yellow Lake would need replacing in any case. If it is renewed so as to ensure a supply of water, the matter of new storage tank, filters, etc., could be dealt with as money became available.\n\nIt would, of course, be more desirable to carry out the full scheme from Yellow Lake, as proposed by Mr. Warren, but if the amount required is not available this year, something will need to be done without delay, to ensure water being available when the school returns in September.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6438, file 878-5, part 4)\nWilliams Lake, B.C.\nAugust 19th, 1936\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise that the Principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School reports that the pipeline from Yellow Lake to the school storage tank, upon which the present water supply for the school depends, broke down recently.

I would point out that this school is the property of the Church authorities. The Department feels that they should accept responsibility for supplying and installing the water supply system for the school.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. E. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWilliams Lake, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer to the report of Dr. A.L. McQuarrie, the Asst. Director of Medical Services for B.C., under date of the 16th inst. and to that part of the report which deals with the latrines in the boys section of the Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nWhen this new outside latrine was built, with the assistance of the Department for lumber used, it was anticipated that the trench would be kept properly flushed out during the summer months. This was not done during the last summer vacation, with the result that it was in very unsanitary condition when viewed by Dr. McQuarrie.\n\nOwing to the extreme cold weather in the winter time, flush toilets would not be practical. The alternatives are a proper septic tank or very deep earth pits which could be filled in when full up, and the building moved to another location.\n\nI have discussed the matter with the school Principal who is prepared to dig a septic tank. If this is done, the accumulated matter which will freeze in the pit during the winter months, would have to be flushed down a large pipe inlet into the septic tank in the spring. This may present difficulties. In looking at them I also discussed the matter, thinking that they could be dug ten or twelve feet under the latrine building would be sufficiently dark to prevent any danger from flies during the warm weather. As an additional precaution, covers could be hinged to the seats.\n\nI will discuss these proposals further with the Principal with a view to having one or the other system installed before freeze up.\n\nThis school is handicapped by not having the water and interior facilities for proper flush toilets. In the girls quarters there is a septic tank outlet which functions satisfactorily, but it has been found easier to keep things sanitary in the girls buildings than in the boys.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E.

R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Director of Indian Affairs.\n\nEnclosure.\nJuly 12th, 1937.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. MacInnes,\n\nWith reference to your inquiry of the 10th instant regarding the Cariboo Indian Residential School, the pipeline from the school to Yellow Lake was constructed in 1912. Our records do not show that the Department contributed towards its cost. However, in 1922, the low ground between Yellow Lake and Trout Lake broke away.

In this memorandum the Acting Director mentions that according to an estimate received in 1935, it would have cost approximately $2,600 to replace the present pipeline with new iron pipe and place the new pipe 4 feet underground for the approximate distance of a mile.\n\nThis matter has been looked into by our Engineering and Construction Service and the Indian Affairs Branch has evidently misunderstood the application of this estimate. The figure of $2,600 had nothing to do with replacement of existing pipe but merely covered the cost of a new auxiliary gravity system from a spring to augment the existing domestic supply.\n\nMr. Warren's estimate on replacing the existing 2\" pipe of the present system with new 3\" wood stave pipe is $3,720. This provides for a length of approximately 4,500 feet. This will effect immediate repairs to the domestic supply, it being understood that the 2\" pipe has practically collapsed in several sections.\n\nIt will not, however, cover other necessary work required on the domestic water supply, as soon as funds can be obtained, and which is as follows:-\n\nDr. Charles Camsell, C.M.G.,\nDeputy Minister of Mines and Resources.\nStorage in Yellow Lake, filtration of water and new intake. The estimated cost of this additional work is placed by Mr. Warren at $11,055.\n\nIt should also be pointed out that the 3\" wooden pipe replacement will not, of course, provide fire protection for the School. (The present line does not provide fire protection.) Due to the low head between the source of supply and the School, an 8\" pipeline would be required to carry enough water for fire-fighting purposes and a booster pump would have to be installed. The cost of the 8\" pipeline would be about $6,300.\n\nFrom the Acting Director's memorandum, it appears that the Indian Affairs Branch can only spare $2,000 for the present essential repairs so that $1,720 will be required in addition. It is consequently recommended that the Indian Affairs Branch advise what funds will be available from the management of the School so that we can prepare specifications for the Purchasing Agent covering the amount of pipe that can be bought.\n\nAs mentioned in a telegram recently received in the Indian Affairs Branch, the Principal of the School is very anxious to have the pipeline replaced at the earliest possible date because the ground is becoming hard and Indian labour will soon scatter for the haying season.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n(Sgd.)

I told him that I would mention the matter, but had no idea if there would be any additional funds to take care of any such expenditure.\n\nA further break occurred in the pipeline two days ago but whilst irrigation is in progress, water can be diverted from the irrigation supply through an auxiliary pipe system to supply clean water to the school. This water will not be available after irrigation ceases. Repairs are now being effected at the new point of leakage, but there will always be a recurrence of the trouble until a new pipeline is laid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E. Taylor\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOTTAWA\nOttawa, June 2, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER,\n\nFor the past three or four years, the pipeline which conducts the water from the source of supply to the Cariboo Indian Residential School has been giving considerable trouble. This pipeline was originally installed about 30 years ago. Frequent repairs have been made, but recent reports indicate that, in order to insure a reasonably adequate water supply for the Cariboo Indian Residential School, it will be necessary to replace the pipeline.\n\nThe present pipeline is 4 feet underground and nearly one mile long. It will be necessary to dig up the old pipeline and replace with new iron pipe. The cost of this work will be approximately $2,600.00, which was an estimate given in 1935 by Mr. Warren, of the Dominion Water Power Branch.\n\nIf the Department allows the sum of $2,000.00, the management of the Cariboo Residential School is prepared to pay the balance. All work will be done by Indians, some of whom are on relief at present, but, if given work in this way, can be removed from the relief list.\n\nThere is available, in our appropriation for the current fiscal year, a sum of $2,000.00 which could be used for this purpose, and I would appreciate receiving your approval to authorize the work proceeding. It is important that it should be commenced immediately.\n\nThe Cariboo Indian Residential School is in the electoral district of Cariboo, B.C.\n\nActing Director of Indian Affairs\n\nT.R.L.M\nTHE SECRETARY\n\nDEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA ONT\n\nYOUR OFFER TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR PIPELINE CARIBOO SCHOOL\n\nACCEPTABLE TO PRINCIPAL UNDERSTOOD REPAIRS TO BE DEFERRED\n\nH E TAYLOR INDIAN AGENT.\nWilliams Lake, B.C.\nMay 20th, 1937\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer to my letter of October 26th last with reference to the report of Dr. A.L.

The flushing out into the adjacent field has been done away with and twelve-foot deep pits have been dug on a fresh site, with a suitable top structure. The pits are deep enough to exclude light and flies and the building above has been built on skids so that it can be moved to a new location when fresh pits are necessary.\n\nIn the absence of sufficient water pressure to allow of water closets being installed, this would seem to be the most satisfactory arrangement that can be made, and should prove satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E.

I.A. Branch,\nDept. M. & R.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes.\nST. JOSEPH'S MISSION\nCARIBOO INDIAN SCHOOL STATION P.G.E.\nBRITISH COLUMBIA May 14th, 1937\n\nThe Very Reverend Father Provincial,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nVery Reverend and Dear Father:\n\nOur water pipe line between Yellow Lake and the reservoir, a distance of about 4800 feet, has burst or has been plugged and, although I have had three or four working on it since last Saturday, the trouble has not been found and, from this source, we have had no water in the School for almost a week. We can carry on for about a month as the irrigation water has been piped to our buildings but after about June 15th, when the irrigation water will have to be turned off, we shall have no water and will, I think, have to close the School unless the trouble is located and the pipe repaired or the pipeline renewed.\n\nUnless we are very fortunate, we may have to dig up a great deal of the pipeline before locating the trouble. If it were a leak and if it happened in the dry season, there would be signs to go by. As it is, the land is sopping wet in many places owing to irrigation and other causes. If we had to dig up most of or all the pipeline, it would pay, in the long run, to put in a new pipeline as the present one is, I believe, about 30 years old and, being wooden, is just about rotten.\n\nOn and off, since I came here over six years ago, this pipeline has been giving trouble but up until now we have been able to find the trouble and remedy it. I have called this matter to the attention of the Indian Department on several occasions and, a couple of years ago, they were good enough to have Mr Warren survey and report upon the matter as well as upon a less costly scheme. The Department was willing, I believe, to go forward with the less costly scheme but I did not think it advisable. In the first place, this scheme would have given us only enough water for domestic purposes but none for the laundry, baths, toi-\nSt. Joseph's Mission\nCariboo Indian School Station P.G.E.\n\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nLet us, etc., and I did not feel justified in having the Department spend this money (about $2500.00, I think) when I foresaw that the necessity in which, sooner or later, we should be of asking to have the pipeline from Yellow Lake renewed. There were indications of trouble less than a year ago and I asked Mr. Indian Agent Taylor to apply for money to install a new pipeline. The Government was short of money and the Department, then, replied that they thought that the Church authorities should pay for this. As you know, the Church authorities would mean the Oblate Fathers and these have not the $6000.00, if I recall the figures, which would be required.\n\nThe Department's view appears to be that this is not a Government school but Oblate buildings used as such. Might it not be urged that this is true and that the Oblate Fathers, besides supplying men to civilize the Indians, have, without charge, put these buildings and spacious grounds at the disposal of the Department for the education and the physical and moral welfare of the Government's wards and have thus saved the government from sinking $250.000.00 in buildings?\n\nWould you please approach the Department and ask that, in view of the children's staying here until July 21st, permission be granted to install a pipeline immediately and that they put a competent man in charge? I would suggest that the digging and whatever other work possible be done by the Indians. Many of them have asked me for work. This would cut down on relief.\n\nThe Department most likely has Mr. Warren's report, i.e., I think, took a straighter and shorter line from Yellow Lake to the reservoir. That would cut down on the pipe required and on the digging unless, for the latter, by the time we receive a reply we have dug up most of the pipe\u2014which is 4' down.\n\nI do not think that I have over-stated the case. Either the Department or we will have to spend the money, unless we can remedy the trouble or close the school. Of course, we could hire a couple of men and have them haul water from the creek but you will realize what that would mean. Moreover, neither the...\nST. JOSEPH'S MISSION\nCARIBOO INDIAN SCHOOL STATION P.G.E.\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nDepartment nor we would like to put ourselves in such a position that, in the event of a fire and of children burned, the Press would be able to tell the country that, for the sake of $6000.00, the Department and the Oblates had sacrificed these children.\n\nI am aware that the fire protection here, even with a new pipeline, is inadequate but the Press might miss this but would not overlook our having no water piped to the buildings.\n\nShortly before I came here, the Dept had twenty-five thousand dollars appropriated for a new water system for us but, at the last moment, the man who had water rights on the source refused to cede his rights and the thing fell through. I was able to help that man, later on, and he willingly agreed to cede his water rights. I informed the Indian Agent immediately but the Department no longer had the money.\n\nThe water in Yellow Lake has been examined and found unfit for drinking purposes unless boiled. I have made a point of drinking plenty of it daily, as have others, and have felt no evil effects although I have done it for more than six years. In the really hot weather, the smell and taste are bad but we have a small spring nearby where we can and do get drinking water.\n\nWe will keep looking for the trouble. If there are any results, I will telegraph, but after a week's work at the problem I am not at all optimistic.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nP.S. Mr. Indian Agent Taylor was asked to come here today to study the situation but was unable. There are serious objections to beginning the holiday before July 21st. Sept. 18th is the earliest we can get the children back and some of them will not be able to be here on that date.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, May 5th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd ultimo, you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of twelve (12) single beds for the Cariboo Indian Residential School.

Taylor\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines & Resources\nOttawa\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\n\nI am returning herewith Mr. Jackson's memorandum of October 22nd and also draft recommendation to Council with respect to construction of a new pipeline at the Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nI may state that the desirability of providing an adequate water supply for the Cariboo Residential School has been under consideration by the Department for a number of years. The matter was thoroughly investigated by Mr. W. C. Warren, of the Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau, who furnished the Department with a report on August 21st, 1935. Mr. Warren in that report estimated that it would cost approximately $11,065 to provide the residential school with an adequate supply of water for domestic purposes and that it would cost at least $20,220 to provide a supply of water sufficient for domestic purposes and fire protection.\n\nIn view of the fact that the financial resources at our disposal at that time were limited, it was decided to make a further investigation with the object of determining if a water supply could be provided at a reduced cost to the Department and the church authorities. Mr. V. Leek, Assistant Director of the Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau, in a letter to the Department dated September 4th, 1935, expressed the view that a temporary supply of water, that might be sufficient for a number of years, could be obtained by the construction of a pipeline from a spring comparatively near the school, and he estimated the cost of this construction at approximately $3,000.\n\nA number of memoranda have been sent forward to the Minister's\nthe Minister's office with respect to this project and the best ways and means of proceeding with the construction.\n\nMay I refer particularly to a memorandum dated July 8, 1937, addressed to you and signed by Mr. T. R. L. MacInnes, Acting Director, in which Mr. MacInnes asked for your concurrence for the payment of a grant of $2,000 toward the cost of this work. This memorandum was approved by you and later returned to this branch. The officials, having obtained your approval for this expenditure, wired H. E. Taylor, Indian Agent, Williams Lake, B. C., on July 15, 1937, authorizing him to inform the Principal of the school that he (the Principal) could proceed with the work. This grant was made on the understanding that the church authorities would contribute at least $2,000 in the purchase of supplies and in making provision for labour costs.\n\nWe are now in receipt of accounts from the Pacific Coast Pipe Company, Limited, the firm from whom the pipeline supplies were purchased, asking for settlement of the account.\n\nThe Cariboo Residential School is the property of the church authorities, although certain improvements, including the construction of a barn at the school, have been undertaken and paid for by the Government from time to time. The last Auditor's report, signed by Mr. Wey, indicates that the cost per pupil per day at this school amounts to 46.7\u00a2 and that the per capita grants paid last year by the Government amounted to 43.6\u00a2. It would appear from this report that the Principal of this school has in recent years been borrowing money from the Oblate Order but has succeeded in reducing this loan until at that date it amounted to only $365.01. It is only fair to point out, however, that the Oblate Order did not at any time during the life of the loan impose any interest charges.\n\nI am of the opinion that, in view of all the circumstances, a division of the costs necessary to provide the water supply necessary is fair and reasonable. Requests for fire fighting apparatus or for an adequate water\nsupply have always been given very sympathetic consideration by the Government. Repairs have been undertaken at church-owned schools when the appropriations at our disposal enabled us to undertake such repairs when such were considered necessary and urgent. Suggestions have been made from time to time that the per capita grant to church-owned schools might be increased and the church authorities requested to maintain their own buildings. However, no definite decision has been reached in this matter.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum\n\nMINISTER'S OFFICE\n\n22nd October, 1937.\n\nDr. McGill\n\nI am returning herewith the draft recommendation to Council which accompanied your memorandum of the 5th instant with respect to the construction of a new pipeline at the Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nI understand that the cost of operating this school is covered almost entirely by the per diem allowance now made for Indian pupils. It would seem on the face of it as though the school might bear the total cost of the pipeline. However before coming to any decision you might let me have a more comprehensive report for the Minister's information.\n\nC. W.

A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nH. E. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWilliam Lake, B. C.\nDear Sir;\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter received from the Principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School, asking that the money expended by him to purchase paint be refunded by the Department.\n\nThe letter is self-explanatory, but I would point out that at the time the Department offered the $2,000.00 for the water system, the Principal agreed to the suggestion, and was apparently prepared, at that time, to pay for the paint already purchased.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E. Taylor\nIndian Agent\n\nEncl:\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines & Resources\nOttawa\nOct. 25th, 1937\n\nMr. H.E. Taylor,\nIndian Agent,\nWilliam's Lake, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Taylor:\n\nAs you are aware, the Dept. of Indian Affairs surprised me by granting $1200.00 for the finishing of the laundry, for painting and for repairs. As it was specified that some painting be done (and this was really needed), I bought and used $277.08 worth of paint. It was only after this paint had been bought that our domestic supply pipeline broke down. In response to my appeal for help, the Dept. replied that I should use the $1200.00 already granted and that, if I did so, the Department would add another $800.00 to make up $2000.00 for this work. I was to pay the rest. I was able to buy new pipe very much cheaper than had been estimated by the Gentleman sent to examine the situation. By employing exclusively Indian labour, I was perhaps able to cut down on relief to Indians. However, the thing cost me a pretty penny.\n\nAs I bought the paint under the impression (not to say by the orders of the Department; it being specified that part of the $1200.00 be for paint) that this would be paid for out of the extraordinary grant, would you please ask the Department if they would refund this money? The reason for which I make this request is that I need about that sum to buy a second set of batteries for our Delco. The Department was good enough to buy us a Delco and one set of batteries. I should have asked for two sets but, to cut down expenses, I asked for one set as our old set was then fairly good. It is now dead and, unless we wish to ruin the remaining set, another must be purchased immediately. I do not think that I have wasted a cent but I cannot pay my bills. For beef, pork, vegetables, salaries and wood (we burn no coal), I owe over $4000.00, for this year, to the Oblate Fathers. The $150.00 advanced on the Sept Grant is spent.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6438, file 878-5, part 4)\nOttawa,\nApril 22, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant enclosing voucher covering the cost of the three toilets and septic tank at the Cariboo Indian Residential School. In connection with Church owned schools we are now required to secure an Order-in-Council and in securing this we only provided an amount of $155.00 for the Cariboo Residential School as we knew that this amount slightly exceeded the estimated cost. As the Order-in-Council only authorizes $155.00 this is all we can pay and the school authorities will have to be responsible for the balance, namely $1.39.\n\nI regret that owing to the fact that our appropriation for the fiscal year 1937-38 is now exhausted it is not possible to pay from that Vote for the cement and freight charges. However, the accounts for these might be submitted and if it is found possible to provide funds in the current year's appropriation payment will be made. Possibly the best way to handle the matter would be for the school to pay these accounts and have them receipted, then, if funds are available, repayment will be made to the Principal.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nH. E. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWilliams Lake, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI thank you for your letter of March 25th and for the fire-extinguishers which are to come.\n\nEvidently I misunderstood and was misunderstood. I understood that of the grant of $700.00, $500.00 was to be spent on the laundry and the balance on repairs and improvements. My plan was to use the $200.00 on renewing some stair cases and floors and on paying half the cost of a flume behind the girls' building. This flume is needed as, at present, the girls' basement is often flooded and the walls undermined. I think that the stair cases and floors can wait until next year and that, if all the $700.00 is spent on the laundry and fire-escapes we can build the flume out of the per capita grant especially as the Oblates will bear half the cost. I had no idea that the $200.00 was for fire-escapes. That money, I fear, will not suffice.\n\nI am making out (or, rather, have made out) a list of what is needed to complete the laundry. You will note that plumbing fixtures are almost entirely omitted. That is because we have them on hand, bought out of the money already granted in past years. You will note, also, that no request is made for machinery. I do not want machinery; first, it is costly; secondly, the girls are used to washing by hand and this is excellent training for their future life. It would be hard to go from the school machinery to the home tub but it is easy to go from the school tub to the home tub. I am very pleased to say that, whenever I have chanced to visit a reserve on washday, I have found, with very few exceptions, that the married ex-schoolgirls were busy at their washing. I might add that even the Sisters do their share at the tubs and this is good example for the girls.\nST. JOSEPH'S MISSION\nCARIBOO INDIAN SCHOOL STATION P.G.E.\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nA week has elapsed since I finished page one. In the meantime, I have made out a list of all material required for the laundry and have sent it to the Indian Agent. He has just called and we have been able to cut down the costs considerably by deciding to use plain shiplap instead of v-joint and by other changes. He had quotations from local firms but these appear quite high for some items. He will get quotes for most of the building material and for the fire escapes from the Coast. I am trying to make arrangements with other people so that, if the material is supplied, we can get a carload between us and reduce the heavy freight costs.\n\nWhile it does not matter to me who gets the order, I think that I should point out that, after a few experiments, I have found McLennan, McFeely and Prior, Vancouver, give greatest satisfaction in the hardware line. Their prices on fire-escapes might be high and Mr Taylor will write directly to a foundry. Mr C. Anderson, whose mill is near us, will supply lumber, as in the past, at \u00a316.00 per M. That price, lumber delivered, cannot be beaten. It was he who suggested \"finishing\" the interior in shiplap instead of the more costly v-joint. It will not look so well but it will be just as good and far cheaper. With the \u00a3500.00 I had not expected to complete the laundry this year.\n\nYou may have noted, in my recent report, that we have done a great deal of building and repair work. I forgot to mention the great improvement made on our water reservoir. It is now far more sanitary.\n\nMr Indian Agent Taylor confidentially told me that he had suggested to the Department that relief supplies might be bought wholesale at a great saving and although he did not suggest it allowed me to add a word. From what I hear, the Indians are getting a great deal of dried fruit and sugar which they turn into rather powerful home-brew. Whether they buy this or get it as part of their relief, I do not know. If Mr T's suggestion were adopted, they would not get it in their relief rations. Of course, local store-keepers might howl but if one wholesale order were bought and the store-keepers were told, their prices might come down.\nMoreover, I do not know whether it is or is not the case\u2014if, to make money, the store-keepers were suggesting to the Indians that they apply for relief, your relief costs would decrease when the profit to the store-keepers was nil. At present, with so vast a territory to cover, your Agent cannot tell what the Indians are being given.\n\nA story: A former Principal told me that years ago, certain store-keepers used periodically to telegraph to the Dept., saying that the local Indians were starving and asking permission to save them from death by giving\u2014or rather selling\u2014food to the poor Indians. Finally, the Dept. telegraphed to this Principal saying that it was reported that the Indians at---- were starving and asking him to investigate. He did not investigate but replied immediately \"Indians at---- not starving. Plenty to drink.\" Whether there is anything in certain suspicions or not, I cannot say. Mr. Taylor's suggestion, if carried out, might show you.\n\nI am pleased to say that the toilets for the boys' x*x*x*x have come. It will be a great improvement and far more sanitary. Our plumber quoted on the toilets and some pipe only, neglecting to mention tiles from the septic tank. I have informed the Indian Agent. The tile, of course, is necessary.\n\nYou have, no doubt, heard of Archbishop Duke's Indian exhibition to be held in Vancouver. We expect to send in some really good beadwork and buckskin work. The local Indians do no carving and very little basket work. As for the prizes, they mean nothing to me after what I saw in Kamloops.\n\nWith sincere wishes for a happy Easter,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I beg to advise that this expenditure is for the three toilets and septic tank at the Cariboo Indian Residential School. A letter from the Supt.of Welfare & Training, dated the 15thult. authorised the purchase at an estimated cost of $154.26. The estimate of the Rev.Principal was low, however, as, in addition to the enclosed account for $156.39 there is an additional $25.00 for cement and also the freight charges on the material from Crane Ltd. This firm were instructed to include freight charges in their account and support them with receipt, but they have not done this and the cost of the freight is not yet known.\n\nWill you please advise me if the Department has sufficient funds to pay for the cement and freight, or whether these charges should be referred to the School Principal for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E.Taylor\nIndian Agent\n\nEncls;\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept.of Mines & Resources\nOttawa\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\nVeuillez exp\u00e9dier la d\u00e9p\u00eache suivante aux conditions mentionn\u00e9es au verso auxquelles je consens par les pr\u00e9sentes\n\n160-0-5\n\nAPRIL 12 1938\n\nH E TAYLOR\nINDIAN AGENT\nWILLIAMS LAKE B C\n\nPLEASE FORWARD AT ONCE ACCOUNTS FOR EXPENDITURE AUTHORIZED\nIN OFFICIAL LETTER OF MARCH EIGHTEENTH STOP YOU WILL\nREMEMBER THAT ACCOUNTS SHOULD BE DATED PREVIOUS TO MARCH\nTHIRTY FIRST\n\nR A HOEY\nSUPT OF WELFARE & TRAINING\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept.

However, as our School consists of four units, not including the \"usual\" training shop, \"warehouse,\" etc., and as the buildings are frame constructions and, also, as we have no water pressure against fire, it would be in the interests of the safety of the pupils to have even a dozen more fire extinguishers and two larger extinguishers on wheels.\n\nLast year, in order that we might install metal fire escapes in place of the present wooden ones, you kindly increased our extraordinary grant from $600.00 to $1200.00. As you are aware, you had later to instruct me to use this money (a good deal of it had already been spent) to install a domestic water pipeline. The result was that the fire-escapes could not be installed. The pipeline, as you and I were aware, cost a great deal more than the money you could spare. As a result, the school owes the Oblate Fathers over $5000.00 for salaries, meat, fuel, etc.\n\nYou kindly granted $700.00 this year. All this money will be required for our laundry which we greatly need as the Indian Agent and the Inspector will tell you.\n\nI am pleased to say that the Inspector appeared very satisfied after his recent inspection. The pupils are in good health.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

As three toilets are needed, the quotation on bends ($2.31), and on closets ($22.43 less $1.01) should be multiplied by three.\n\nMaterial for a satisfactory Septic tank would amount to $90.00.

We have not very much information to go on, but we have figured standard fire escapes construction to conform to the regulations of the Provincial Fire Marshall. We understand your letter & sketch to mean that you required four fire escapes balconies, 3'0\" wide x 6'0\" long x 3'0\" high with two fixed stairs and railings 3'0\" high all round, one 9'6\", one 12'0\" from the ground line to platform of balcony.\n\nThe other two escapes to be the same, except that they are 14'0\" and 14'6\" from the ground and to have counterbalanced stairs to lift 7'0\" from the ground.\n\nWe offer to make the four balconies and four stairs as above, painted and delivered to the P.G.E. freight shed in Vancouver including 8% sales tax for $626.00 (SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX DOLLARS) This would include all necessary bolts to fasten the parts together, sheaves, sheave brackets and pins, counterweights, galvanized cable, thimbles, and cable clamps. The shipping weight would be 5,200 lbs and the P.G.E. freight rate on this class of material, knocked down, is $1.34 per 100 lbs.\n\nThe following is a specification of the material we have figured on using:\nBalcony frame 4\" x 2\" x 2\" angle iron.\nRailings 4\"x 1\" mild steel bars welded to top and bottom angles.\nFloors 4\"x1\" mild steel gratings on edge.\nKnee brackets - each balcony would have two angle iron knee brackets bolted through the wall as required.\n\nStair stringers, two 4\" channel irons, treads four 4\"x1\" bars on edge, bolted to angle iron clips riveted to stringers.\nStair railings 3/16\" x 1\" x 1\u00bd\" angle iron with \u00bc\"x1\" bars electric welded.\n\nWe trust that this is what you have in mind and that our quotation will be satisfactory.

The children were outside the building from the class rooms within a reasonable time, but apparently the bell in the corridor of the main building is not sufficiently loud to be heard in some of the class rooms when the doors are closed. This is being remedied by the addition of a bell close to the class room doors. There are 36 fire extinguishers placed in position ready for use. Also 19 fire buckets. The emergency exits were inspected and the doors were found to open freely, and were free from snow and ice.\n\nThe epidemic of bronchial colds at the school has entirely cleared up, and good progress is being made with weekly treatments for trachoma.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E.

In this connection I be to refer to my letter to you of July 14th last advising that this firm had revised their quotation for the fir flooring which they quote at $75.00 as against their original quotation of $58.00 per thousand. This firm advise that owing to frequent market fluctuations it is very difficult to secure a price for future delivery.\n\nI would therefore suggest that to avoid further delay authority be given for the purchase of fir flooring to the value of the $232.00 mentioned in the Purchase Order at $75.00 per thousand. The Reverend Principal of the school advises me that this would be suitable for their present purposes as it would provide sufficient flooring for the boys' recreation room and the flooring of the girls' room could be postponed until some other time.\n\nWill you please advise me at your earliest convenience if this arrangement is suitable.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nH.

(RG 10, Volume 6438, file 878-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nNovember 15, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn your letter of March 11 you requested refills for the fire extinguishers at the Cariboo Indian Residential School. An order was placed with the Pyrene Manufacturing Company last March and it is presumed the refills were supplied to the school. However, the Principal did not submit any account.\n\nThis is a Church-owned school and although a certain amount is provided each year for repairs, maintenance and purchase of new equipment, present regulations do not permit our exceeding the amount specifically provided. If the Principal had carried out the instructions which have been issued to all Principals on several occasions to the effect that all accounts must be certified and forwarded to the Department as soon as the goods are received the account would have been paid from the appropriation for the fiscal year 1940-41. However, as he did not carry out these instructions it is not possible to pay the account from that fiscal year.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation an amount of $300.00 was provided for repairs and improvements at this school. We have already expended approximately $255.00 and there is only $45.00 left. The account of the Pyrene Manufacturing Company which is attached shows the total cost of the refills as $124.30. You should have this account.\n\nMr. H.E. Taylor,\nIndian Agent,\nWilliams Lake, B.C.\ncertified by the Principal and you should advise him that the Department will only be able to pay $45.00 of the amount and that he will have to issue a cheque to the Pyrene Manufacturing Company for the balance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nCariboo Indian Res. School,\n150 Mile House, B.C.\nNov. 23, 1941\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI received yesterday a copy of your letter of the 15th.\nto H.E. Taylor Esq., Indian Agent, William's Lake, re. the Pyrene\nRefills sent in March 1941 to the School.\n\nI did not report receipt of these goods to the Department\nas I considered that this would be done by the Agent, as is the\ncase for the lumber supplied for Manual Training and all supplies\nfor repairs. The Agent asked me over the phone if I had received\nthese Refills and I told him we had, so I left it at that. There\nwas no request as in the case of Drugs and Stationery, to report\nthe receipt of these Refills to the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nI have the honor to remain\n\nYours truly,\n\nMichael Murphy O.M.I.\nPrincipal\nOttawa,\nDecember 11, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn March 28 last purchase order 6471 was issued to the Pyrene Manufacturing Company, Toronto, covering the cost of refills for the fire extinguishers at the Cariboo Residential School. The firm was instructed to forward their account to you in order that you could certify it. I wrote to the Principal about this matter and in a letter dated November 29 he advises that you asked him over the phone if he had received the refills and he told you that he had. However, the account covering the cost of the supplies has not yet reached us. In view of the Principal's statement that the supplies have been received you should certify the account and forward it to this office at once.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.
