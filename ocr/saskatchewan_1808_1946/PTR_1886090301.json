Mr. Mercer on the election of the House of Commons. We are aware that Mr. Mercer is a writer of fiction, but he can utter fiction with an ease and elegance only equaled, if fanged, by Mr. Mercer, and if he has the luck to see his prose, he will be forced to broken form he will hang quite an extensive work of fiction to hang his name down to posterity. But while Mr. Mercer excels in fiction, he excels in truth, which is the most necessary to disturb his peculiar turn of mind-in the pathetic, and we have no doubt many hot tears must have trickled down the cheeks of the French habitants whom he has both in his letters addressed to the churches and Chambly during the last few weeks. Yes, see that he excels in fiction, and it is because of our fear that strong minds may grow weak and forget who they are as we are suddenly plunged into a dark denseness that we have taken this somewhat tedious way of bringing this wonderful full part of fiction to your notice.\n\nThe evening service in the chapter is Bateher, and the author or whatever else you may call them our neighbours the Mets, and a Cockney, and is intended to illus- trate how the religion was brought about.\n\nA young Cockney brought from Eng., land came along, with two or three hairs of hair and a child or two to the un- tame Metes. \"Nice people,\" said Mr. Cockney, \"but you are my property, and you must be good enough to get out.\"\n\n\"Hello, who are you?\" says the Matso.\n\n\"I am an Irishman and a person from London, the son of a lord, or a noble- man of the House of Commons, or a big boy of some sort, and my father has purchased this land from the Canadian Govern-\n\nment.\"\n\n\"My boy, you come at me,\" replies the half-breed. \"This is my farm, my children were raised here and I was raised here myself, and I intend to re-\n\nmain here.\"\n\n\"But I told you you must go out.\"\n\n\"I'm there a man in this meeting who won't get sick of doing that? Put up arms, it will do the trick.\"\n\nAnd whilst he speaks, the stranger comes to take it away from him by means of a sword and pistol the latter, nor can be expected upon the Canadian soil, and not to feel his heart being broken in two pieces.\"\n\nHere a loud cheer. \"No wonder if they would fly to arise, for if there be anything in this world calculated to make a man put up to fighting pitch, it is the appearance of a Cockney with a sword and pistol in his hand.\"\n\nBut the Cockney, like Macdonald's New Zealanders, has yet to learn that Batoche, or any other man or set of men, in the character described by Mr. Mercer, those of you, however, who are familiar with this district, are acquainted with the Lakes connected with it, will doubtless be able to ap-\n\npreciate Mr. Mercer's excellences or wonders. If you did not go to the Lakes' post, he will show himself to be utterly lacking the prime characteristic of prac-\n\ntically\u2014for whom\u2014there seems to be no imagination himself in another country upon which he may be at home as one other. He perhaps imagined himself at Connell, and that was not addressed the peoples of Kerry.\n\nWhat a pity that falsehood can always be made to serve the ends of the demagogue among an intelligent people.\n\nTHE HARVEST\n\nFrom the reports we have received, we are convinced that Prince Albert's crop has suffered less from the drought during the past season than any other portion of the Northwest. The yield of crops, owing to the drought, has not been as high amongst ourselves as that which, but the quality of the crops, particularly owing to the absence of frost, will compare favourably with that of any other part of the terri-\n\ntory. So much so, that some people believe it has been quite some time since Prince Albert has had such a good harvest. But suppose we must look for the reason of the small area of wheat being sown in the fact that many of the former ones were of the common kind. If it had been supplied them by the Government instead of as good quality as it should be. But whatever doubts crops are not as good as they should have been. Of our farmers more care was taken than others, gave the seed the benefit of the doubt, and the conse-\n\nquence is that they are able pay back their loan and sell a good surplus of wheat at a reasonable price. We wish the success continues, the future of the colony must therefore, not be able to repay the amount called for without selling their surplus. In any case there will be a scarcity of seed of good quality next season.\n\nWith regard to the barley and oats we cannot give as favourable a re-\n\nport. The seed barley while it may have been good, does not seem to have been marketed in sufficient quantity, and all we can say now the seed should be this. For this fact, which was caused by the drought, the effect rather barely what it would have been. But with barley, as with the\n\nwhats, though not so generally, some of the farmers were tolerably suc-\n\ncessful. The same remarks would seem to apply to oats. The yield and the quality of the oats and barley, as a whole, therefore, is not nearly as satisfactory as that of wheat, and we are not too surprised if many of the farmers would find themselves unable this year to repay the seed advanced by the government.\n\nAs to the yield of potatoes, we can safely say that there is no likelihood of a shortage.\n\nFARMING.\n\nIt will not, we trust, be considered out of place on our part if we make this suggestion regarding farming in general. To become a successful farmer a same knowledge of details, the same perseverance, is required as in any other business. Show us a successful farmer and we shall show you a patient, painstaking man. We do not say that he can control the climate. He has to take his chances with regard to that; but, he prepares to re-\n\nceive the gift in such a way as to make him, barring the natural draw-\n\nbacks, the greatest possible yield. He does not allow weeds to choke out his grain, absorb the moisture which should go towards nourishing it, and eat it as they are growing, burying them to draw out the soil and the grain to thrust through on the field for days after he cuts it. He wastes nothing, saves everything. We heard a farmer in this district who had six acres of Tynan's oats in entire de-\n\nprived, his wall, and the common consensus was that notwithstanding the drought he had a good crop off the land on which he utilized it. This shows that the location makes all the difference, as also the chance you have of a good turn for your labour. We notice that some farmers do not take proper care of their farming imple-\n\nments, but leave them unshoed, unpolished and neglected. The conse-\n\nquence is that in a short time they are cracked and rusted, and look as if they had come out of the Ark. This is to be regretted, as farming impli-\n\nments run very low. Our advice to the farmers is whatever they use to maintain let it be so done as to assure you the greatest possible reward for your labour.\n\nEDITORIAL NOTES.\n\nThe North-West Council meets on the 3d of October.\n\nThe Chicago Anarchists have been arrested.\n\nThe promoters of the Regina and Long Lake Railway expect to complete the line to Prince Albert by next fall.\n\nThe Manitoba Legislative Council, the leading Liberal papers of Canada, Montreal, and other Liberal papers of the province, declare in support of the Rider proposition.\n\nSir John saw Victoria is only the ter-\n\nminal of the C.P.R., the Canadian Pacific Railway, which covers the distance between that point and Vancouver.

What a splendid achievement!\n\nThe U.S. Congress is fast becoming a reflection of Prince Albert College has brought in a bill which provides for abating American ports against all the privileges enjoyed by Canadian non-\n\ncommercial vessels. Yet he says the S.S. has no more use for a treaty with Can-\n\nada than he has for the French Navy, as he would use it in war, whereas it is arranged both by treaty. The genera-\n\nlized American commercial interests are pressing for a wider application of the terms on which Canadian ports on the territory of the U.S., but a denial of like privileges to Canadian American ports or of some sort and to valid purchasers\n\nArrangements are being made by the publishers of THE MANITOBA SUN for the publication of a Weekly Edition at an early date.

The quantity now on hand, as a rule, small, and the return, also, is the same, though the former is more abundant which makes it suitable for seed next season.\n\nNow, in regard to the terms. The Government charges us one hundred per cent., for the seed, whereas they tell me that, if the public accounts against the Government bear no interest, why the Government does not charge the public one hundred per cent., and that not in an ordinary way of business, but for the sake of the people, who are treated unfairly. As far as I know, in times of distress in other British colonies, where public works have been started, the other side was treated to assist the people, so such terms were enacted. And mark you, the farmers do not urge the Government to give each pack of grain to each pack of seed, but each pack of grain took hand to give the farmers their harvest. Could it be better bargain than the Government has offered? In fact\u2014and I speak as one of them\u2014the farmers would never have accepted such terms had they been in a position to refuse.\n\nThe freighting of the grain was a deal done by many, and a great number of farmers were thrown into debt by the demanding of two bushels in return for one grain must necessarily fail, such a demand being unreasonable.\n\nWhen it was first suggested that the Government would supply seed for all at cost price, the farmers exclaimed: \"How generous and thoughtful of Sir John!\" But they did not know at the time how the security he was creating.\n\nLet us hope that they will yet come down a great deal on their original terms, and allow the farmers a free hand to accept bushel for bushel, and at least pay many\u2014a myself among others\u2014who will be obliged to sell at a loss, and will not much more than see their farms ruined.\n\nJ. B.\n\nStoney Creek, August 21st, 1886.\n\n[We do not suppose for one moment, that the Government, like Shylock, will exact the pound of flesh; at least, judging by its conduct, we may safely presume that it will, think, be grateful for the opportunity of doing so; those who cannot carry the wheat to market, or the government without distressing themselves will, we have no doubt, get an extension of time, and a little patience will overcome the heribitary, when we take into account the fact that the seed which is demanded by the farmers is worth by costs of the barley 6 cents, and oats 5 cents, and the further fact that two bushels of any other of our seed grain may not bring the price of one bushel, and the farmers do not think it reasonable. In any case the farmers must be asked to contribute towards the costs of the grain, two bushels for one. As to the writer's reflection on the generosity of Sir John, we agree with many patriots of Sir John, but not the least, in very bad taste; but we are in hopes that the government will both serve its purpose and show its own gratitude. From recent information, we are led to believe that his estimate of the yield of the wheat crop is correct, and is far below the mark, though he may be stating his own case correctly. As for the timber, we are sure that it is a free gift, we hardly think it will, and we thank further that no reasonable man would expect it.]\n\nFor the benefit of those who may not have the notice-board in the telegraph office we may state that telegrams must be sent through the telegraph offices for public business between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., and from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., in addition to the above hours, if a customer wishes to send a telegram outside the hours of 8 o'clock a.m. and 5 p.m., and between the hours of 8 o'clock p.m. and 9 p.m., he can do so by making arrangements with the telegraph office, and by paying in addition to the regular rate, the sum of five cents for each additional word, and the sending system, if the message has to be repeated at any station twenty-five cents additional per hour until the operator or station thereof obtains the operator beyond their regular office hours.\n\nTELEGRAPHIC.\n\nTHE VERY LATEST NEWS BY WIRE.\n\n(By Special Telegraph.)\n\nWinnipeg, Sept. 3rd.\u2014Captain Fritschler arrived at Winnipeg today, en route to discover the North Pole.\n\nPangnirtung, Sept. 3rd.\u2014News of Captain Fritschler's discovery of the North Pole, has just arrived.\n\nThere have been important changes made in the cabinet of Manitoba province.
