H. MacDowall.\n\nCaledonian Restaurant\nSaloon\nMeal at all Hours\nHop Beer\n\nGEORGE A. MILLER\nProprietor\nTHE LOCAL CONTENTS.\n\nThe friends of both candidates for the representation of the constituency of Lake in the North West Canada, who have been engaged during the past week in canvassing voters, and a good deal of excitement has arisen about as to the result. Like most other contests of the kind, both sides expect to be successful\u2014each side understands, holds the balance of power, as it were, and whoever is able to secure the electors vote is almost certain, but the electors in that in the endeavor to secure that vote the little interest is centres. But the question now seems to be consider, amongst other questions, which candidate has done the most to advance the best interest of the settlement in the past, and which is likely to do the most in the future. Before making up our minds we should certainly consider these questions. As we said last week, our sympathies, at least, are with Mr. Macdonald, firmly believing that he possesses qualifications, that will make him an excellent imperial candidate than Dr. Porter, and who is better qualified in every way to take a seat in the North West Canadian Parliament. Dr. Porter seems to have nothing to say except that, as he said before, his chance is a few years hence when the tide turns our way. At the present time, however, the canvassing seems somewhat premature, for there is no certainty whatever when the election is to come off. In the meantime, however, we suppose the two candidates will hold their meetings and address their prospective constituents. Nothing like taking things by the forelock might be the making of the future.\n\nOUR ORTONIA DELEGATES.\n\nA public meeting was held in the early part of last week for the purpose of discussing the question of sending delegates to Ottawa to lay before the Government the burdens of the wants and grievances of our district of settlement, and which have been very much felt here in a memorial, very strongly worded, which will soon go out as far as Ottawa, and possibly be disposed to Ottawa in the last mail. As a result of that meeting a committee was appointed to take subscriptions in aid of the expenses of such a delegation. So far we have received until this facility for the collection of funds. Some of them have had sufficient time to make all the charges needed, and lay the point which they have to make.\n\nIt looks, however, from the papers of the House, that the members of that committee allowed them selves to be impressed, if not holding up their thumbs to go to work as was fully expected they would do. It was thought the matter should have ended since, as before the meeting, we would whether or not we would attempt to get into Ottawa by specially appointed delegates. Even now it might not be too late if the matter were carried on in a manner as earnest. The House has been in session for a month and is not likely to be adjourned in haste. There is no telling what might not be done if delegates were appointed promptly to bring the matter before, and who would set out for Ottawa immediately. At this stage of proceedings, however, the matter will not be allowed to drop through in difference or other causes.\n\nRAILWAY SCHEMES.\n\nThere are so many schemes about nowadays of the construction of railways that it is difficult to keep track of them. There must he but one railway route for the new territories and as far as I am aware, at the present time it is more than probable that present and projected applications for charters for railroads reaching Churchill on the Hudson's Bay line, far their object will be accomplished and it may in the course of time. Will he built it is more than probable. And then there remains the matter of applications for charters for several branch lines which may or may not be built.\n\nMr. Smith, at a mass meeting recently held at Regina, said, amongst other things in answer to the question on the part of Mr. Macdonald, held that the Canadian Pacific Railway was bound by its contract to build a branch line from Regina to Prince Albert. This is the first intimation that we have heard of the possibility of such a branch line being built. If certain P.R. authorities will consent their contract this is quite another thing.\n\nI am not in the position of saying when it is the ultimate intention to carry it through. We can say positively we are interested in Prince Albert. The more the merrier.\n\nIt is rumored that there are now greater probabilities than ever that the Canada Pacific and Western Railway Company will push their line through to Prince Albert at an early date, as is reported. That is just reported.\n\nIn connection therewith it is rumored that the possessor of some considerable sum has succeeded in getting the company bonuses the line to the extent of half her line in Goschen. If this cannot be true really it is very good news for us near Prince Albert as far East for the Settlement. \u2014 Perce.\n\nIt is now officially known that Mr. J.D. Hanafin, Vice-President and Manager, Central and Northern Pacific Railways of America, thoroughly tested the South Saskatchewan Valley Railway. He has written a full report of those opportunities, and of the matters that should concern much of importance to the South Saskatchewan Valley Railway.\n\nPRINCE ALBERT\n\nREAL ESTATE AND AUCTION ROOMS\n\nMESSRS.

SMITH.\nA curling match took place on the 24th of February, for the President's medal, between the novices and single men's teams of the Prince Albert Curling Club. The single men won comfortably. The score at the end of the match was 56 for the novices' men and 38 for the singles. The ladies' teams were highly divided over their victory, and agreed on the spot to invite their opponents to dinner. Dinner was held on Tuesday evening.\n\nOn Monday, the two ranks of the single men played off for the medals, the stripes being awarded to Mr. J. H. Smith and Mr. G. T. Brown. This match was a very close contest, but the stripes went to Mr. Smith. This match was also a very close contest, but the stripes went to Mr. Smith.\n\nThe skaters' contest was held on Saturday afternoon. The weather was very cold, and the ice was somewhat sticky, yet very keen at times. The worthy President of the club deserves the greatest credit for the demonstrations he has taken in the club, both as regards the medals and other kind assistance to young players for whom they all express themselves in the warmest terms.
