Stephens of the same city.\n(2) Instructor in Manual Training: August Barlage, age 27; served his full time as an apprentice in Germany;\n(3) Assistant to above: August Olthoff, age 35; holds several certificates and diplomas of courses taken in Germany.\n\n(b) Industries:\n(1) Industries taught: mechanics of gasoline engine & manual training;\n(2) Number of pupils in these classes: 13;\n(3) Number of hours weekly each pupil engaged: about an average of 10 hours, explanation of which is contained in information requested as to how the school is carrying out instructions of March 16, 1934.\n\n(c) General Remarks: Our experience has been that the average pupil is very much interested, realizes the advantage such instruction means to him, and is eager to reap profit from his opportunity. I am convinced that results obtained justify the expenditure that is being made, and I could not help but look upon it as being most unfortunate as far as the Indians of this portion of the West Coast are concerned, should the Department decide to discontinue the course. A relative proficiency in the use of carpenter tools and a working knowledge of the mechanics of the gasoline engine is as indispensable to the male Indian, and, therefore, as necessarily a part of his education, as a knowledge of cooking, housekeeping and sewing are to the Indian women. To teach him to farm would be wasted effort, farming being out of the question for him because of the nature of the terrain and the climate. Even so much as keeping a milk-cow is quite impossible because of his prolonged absence from the village in which he lives the greater part of the time to secure his staple article of food in the inlets where fish abound. But his dwelling must be erected, and repairs to it and to his trolling-launch upon which he must depend to a great extent for his livelihood must be made by himself. The care of, and very frequently the repairs to, the engine in his launch, are details he himself must, because of his poverty, take care of.\nFor the explanation to \"(b)\", and a reply to your inquiry as to the carrying out of the instructions contained in the circular letter of March 18, 1931, permit me to submit the following:\n\nCertain conditions at Christie School were so deplorable, and the need for their correction so imperative, that something simply had to be done about them, and done immediately. During the summer of 1932, on a visit to Ottawa, I presented the state of affairs to the late Mr. Farrier with a view to obtaining assistance from the Department. I was made to realize the financial crises existing precluded for some years hope of assistance in any form. Taking counsel with myself on returning to the school, I decided that the only course left for me to pursue was to strive for a solution of my problems by directing to the task every available bit of energy on the premises, and by economizing to the bone in every department so that funds for materials might not be lacking. I had recourse principally to the teachers of the industries, and gave them instructions to proceed co-operatively in the work to be done with not only the members of their classes, but with all the boys available during the half day period set aside for other than class activities; but so arranging the work that as much compensation as circumstances permitted might be made to the former for the work that would have been done in the training classes. That an idea may be gained as to what form that compensation took, and to what extent, consequently, the plan can merit your approval, a detailed list of the work accomplished follows:\n\n(1) Buildings erected: sheep-shed, bakery and engine house, seating stand and dressing rooms at football field, excavation and concrete floor and walls for coal storage;\n\n(2) Machinery, etc., installed: bake-oven, dough-mixer, gasoline engine;\n\n(3) Repairs made: to roof, floors, steps and stairs; parts of water main replaced and others mended; freight launch caulked, overhauled and painted; engine over-hauled, freight boat overhauled, caulked and painted;\n\n(4) Improvements made: faulty electric light wiring throughout entire building removed (the fire hazard was appalling) and replaced with a system that leads via porcelain tubes and loco through joists between ceilings and floors and within walls and all wire joints welded; remodelling of building: boys' bath room and rain-apparel room, bread-store room, girls' cloak and shoe room, boys' clothing room, boys' class room, chicken house; fire alarm installed; entire incline at front of building cleared of stumps and underbrush (necessary to locate certain sewer outlets); entire drainage system of surrounding grounds inspected and mended; necessary as basement and boys' wash room continually being flooded; concrete floor laid in front of kitchen; all board walks on premises replaced and added to; tubs and clothes wracks in laundry and necessary piping installed; painting: entire exterior of all buildings given a first coat (work interrupted by rain season) and large part of interior (work still in progress); football and play-ground filled in with dirt, evened off, seeded with grass, and draining ditches dug (heavy work previously performed by paid help); board walk at field, drinking fountain, mens' and women's toilets, fencing made from cedar logs and fence therefrom round football field constructed; bread-proofer and accompanying heating system made and installed; fences constructed: around sheep enclosure, chicken run, garden.\nChristie Indian Residential School\nKakawis, B.C.\n(WEST COAST VANCOUVER ISLAND)\n\nThe Secretary Page Three\n\n(5) Cabinets, tables, etc., constructed: Girls' dormitory: 86 feet of lockers, towel racks; boys' dormitory: 16 feet of lockers; private rooms: 5 clothes lockers; sewing room: 2 lockers and large table with drawers; girls' dining room: cabinet for dishes and utensils, combination sink and cabinet, 7 tables; kitchen: elaborate 5'3\" x 8'2\" combination table and cabinet, sinks remodelled; bakery: 2'7\" x 7'7\" combination cabinet and table, dough trough, store room; Sisters' community room: community table with drawers; boys' dinning room: 3 tables, ten benches, combination cabinet and sink.\n\nIn the same manner I propose to do the following: (1) replace hot water boiler in laundry with steam boiler (necessary because with present arrangement impossible to dry clothes); remodel and re-adapt clothes drier; (2) excavate space for a boys' toilet, construct same of concrete and install a range of 6 toilets; (4) lay three to four hundred feet of sewer pipe of a diameter large enough to take all sewage and drain conduits (now finding outlet at several places); (5) repair slip and track, construct freight house at the terminal on beach and house for hoist at upper end; (6) repair workman's house; (7) wrap all main pipes of heating system with asbestos insulation; (8) replace floors of large part of main building; (9) cover with sufficient earth large portions of exposed main water line to provide necessary protection. This we wish to accomplish before the termination of this school year, and our hopes are that routine training classes can be resumed at the opening of school after the summer holidays. Of course, continuing in this manner is contingent on the Department's approval. School inspector Barry has written me his intentions to inspect the school on April 25th. A copy of this letter will be given him and a check-up of its statements invited.\n\nAs regards the girls' department, we feel that, judging from the encouraging manner in which the homes of ex-pupils in the villages are being conducted, the course of instructions and practical work given the girls in sewing, cooking, housekeeping, cleanliness and the rudimentary knowledge of caring for the sick, is quite satisfactory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n(Rev.) Victor Rassier, O.S.B.,\nPrincipal\nOttawa, February 28, 1934.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nAs soon as possible after March 31st next, you should forward to the Department a detailed report regarding the vocational training that is given at the Christie Residential School. This report should contain the following information:\n\n(a) Instruction: Name, age and qualifications of instructor or instructors.\n\n(b) Industries: Under this heading you should specify the industries taught, the number of pupils in each industry, number of hours weekly that each pupil is engaged, and list of work accomplished during the period April 1, 1933, to March 31, 1934.\n\n(c) General Remarks: Under this heading you should state if the pupils are interested, and if you consider the results that are being obtained justify the expenditure that is being made.\n\nIf you feel that the value of the course could be improved, you should state in what manner you believe this could be done.\n\nIn addition to the above, you should let me know what is being done at your school to carry out the instructions contained in circular letter of March 15, 1931, a copy of which is enclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

At present I cannot just see how we can construct the building I have in mind for this amount on money, but we will do the best we can.\n\nI am drawing the plans, but do not contemplate building until some time in June when the boys will have returned to school. It is our intention to use the construction of this building in the practical course of carpenter work for those who are old enough to benefit by it. Our regular working staff will also assist, but, together with this, it will be necessary to employ at least one competent carpenter who can remain constantly on the job. Without this last arrangement the construction would drag on through too long a period of time.\n\nWe have already communicated with Mr. Ashbridge, and we will be pleased to follow your instructions in referring all details to him. Again I thank you very kindly for this material assistance. We only hope that our children will be able to derive the benefits from this development that we now contemplate.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Hildegard Melchior)\n(Rev.)

C.\nApril 7, 1938.\n\nExtract from Inspector Barry's report of March 21, 1938:\n\nAs previously reported Scientific Manual Training is not taught here. The boys just carry out various repairs around the school.\n\nThe present Manual Training Instructor if he may be called this is a Mr. J. P. Leslie, who describes himself to me as a carpenter and farmer from Alberta.\n\nI am informed by the Reverend Principal that the Department has sanctioned the erection of a modern Manual Training Shop. I certainly hope that when this shop is built there will be some attempt at the teaching of Manual Training as far as the construction of those articles which are needed around the school and homes of the Indians. I pointed out to Mr. Leslie that he could at least teach the repair of the broken chairs now in the Manual Training Shed. He did not appear to me to understand what was required of him.\n\nThe statement of the Reverend Principal with regard to Manual Training which I have added to this report as Page 6 would lead the Department to believe that much good work was being done in this Department. This is not so in my opinion. I think the Indian Agent might well keep his eye on the Manual Training at this school and later in 1938 report to the Department what steps have been taken to improve this part of the school activities. I know that he is not at present satisfied with the work being done and I agree with him.\n\nThe girls have a much better course in Vocational Work as they of necessity must learn to cook, wash, iron, mend, darn, patch, sew etc.\n\nGerald Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO:** Christie Indian Residential School\n\n**ADDRESS:** Ekwis, B.C.\n\n---\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| March 31 | Annual Training services during the months of January, February and March 1928. @ $40.00 per month. | 180.00 |\n\n**Authority:** Department Letter 159-0-11.\n\n**April 8, 1928.**\n\n---\n\n**TRIPPLICATE FOR FILE**\n\nVoucher to be detached for Accountant to pay.\n\n---\n\n**TOTAL:** 180.00\n\n---\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n---\n\nFORM No. I.A. 506\n\n**Voucher No.:** 650\n\n**DATE:** April 8, 1928\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ashbridge, Indian Agent for the West Coast Agency:\n\n\"Due to existing conditions on the Coast making it imperative that Indians seek other than their natural source of livelihood, it is respectfully recommended that manual training and domestic science be conducted on more practical lines. At present the girls are taught fancy sewing and are employed in kitchens, both admirable in their way, but they should be taught how to make fishing nets and the operation of canning machinery, also how to wash without the aid of electric washing machines, and the baking of bread without electric bakeries. They should also be taught simple home nursing, hygiene, and kindred subjects.\n\n\"Boys should be taught practical boat building and operation of marine engines. These Indians are natural mechanics and could very easily be taught under a competent instructor. Every year these Indians lose hundreds of dollars owing to shipping furs not properly prepared, and this art could be taught to advantage.\"\n\nI expect that you will give these your careful consideration as their adoption would result in the pupils receiving the practical training that they require.\n\nRev. H. Melchior, O.S.B.,\nPrincipal,\nChristie Residential School,\nKakawis, B. C.\nIt will not be possible for the Department to continue indefinitely paying per capita grant unless we receive definite assurance that the curriculum has been arranged in a manner that will ensure the pupils being taught those subjects which will best fit them for their after-school life.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Every year these Indians lose hundreds of dollars owing to shipping furs not properly prepared, and this art could be taught to advantage.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nOffice of the West Coast Indian Agency,\n\nApril 8, 1938\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 850, amounting to $120.00 in favour of Christie Indian Residential School, Kakawis, B.C., for Manual Training Services during the months of January, February and March, @ $40.00 per month.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 159-0-11 dated April 3, 1929.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nof Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nForm No. 518\nChristie Indian Residential School\nKakawin, B.C.\nMay 6, 1938.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nIn answer to your communication of April 9, 1938-0-11, relative to Manual Training Instructor at Christie Indian Residential School,\n\nI would say that in compliance with your request and on recommendation from Inspector Barry, and also some complaint from the Indian Agent, Mr. Ashbridge, we have, with the close of school, released Mr. Leslie.\n\nHowever I would say for Mr. Leslie that we found him to be a very fine man around the boys and very patient. We believe that he did his work very well with the facilities with which he had to work. Furthermore he was not alone in this work, but others of the faculty bridged it over on occasion.\n\nI am in hopes that our next man will be able to carry on in the new building in a way that will be completely satisfactory to the Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n(Rev.)

Forbes, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nChristie Residential School,\nKakawis, B. C.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant with reference to the vocational training that you are inaugurating at the Christie Indian residential school. Your actions in this regard are in full accord with the wishes of the Honourable the Minister who is continually impressing upon us the necessity of making the courses in Indian residential schools more practical.\n\nI regret that it is not possible to allow a grant toward the salary of two vocational instructors. However, the Department wishes to assist you as far as possible and consequently from January 1, 1939, we will allow a grant of $60.00 a teaching month for the vocational instructor at this school instead of the amount of $40.00 which has been previously allowed.\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to Indian Agent Ashbridge for his information.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nChristie Indian Residential School\nKakawis, B.C.\n(WEST COAST VANCOUVER ISLAND)\n\nDec. 15th, 1938\n\nMr R A Hoey,\nDirector of Welfare and Training,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr Hoey:\n\nAll of us here wish you a merry Christmas and a happy New Year.\n\nThings in general seem to be going smoothly although there is the occasional jolt and bump. The children are in good health and apparently satisfied. If we can keep this up, we should have a full school before long.\n\nWe have had to do a good deal of repair work, to install another boiler, etc., and have been working steadily on our celebrated trail. It is about half a mile long and when it is completed it will help solve some of our freighting problems. We have no tractor, horses or scraper and all has therefore to be done by hand. The work is fairly well advanced. Rain has kept us from doing more.\n\nI am very pleased that the Department has found it possible to give us the necessary materials to put up a manual training shop. It will be divided into two main rooms, the one for carpentry and the other for machine work. The boys need to know a little about carpentry and even more about repairing and adjusting engines. I have been unable to find a man who was both a qualified mechanic and a competent carpenter and have, therefore, had to employ two men. I hope that the Department will be able to grant $40.00 per month towards the salary of each. This request may seem a bit odd but one should remember that we are not in the Cariboo where the boys could and did work both inside and outside during the winter. Here, during the rainy season, there can be no outside work and, so, they have hitherto had to neglect manual training on rainy days or spend the morning and afternoon in the classroom. If we have only a carpenter or a mechanic, he cannot sufficiently supervise and train twenty or thirty boys. The solution is to have both a carpenter and a mechanic and to divide the boys between them.\n\nAnother thing that I hope to do is this: when everything is organized, the Indians could bring their engines, etc., here and work on them under the direction of the mechanic or leave their engine to be attended to by the mechanic and the boys and thus save them money.\n\nI have further plans with regard to fishing and to train the boys along this line but there are certain angles which I wish to discuss with the Indian Agent (who, by the way, has been very courteous and helpful) before mentioning it to the Department.\n\nWe have a small canning machine but our boiler was in such a state that I have not yet set up the machine. I hope to give the girls a little training in canning. I have discussed the question of making nets with the Indians and find that it is not practical. It may be practical to have the pupils learn to mend fishing nets.\n\nAgain wishing you the best of everything at Christmas and during the coming year,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6441, file 879-11, part 1)\nOttawa,\nNovember 30, 1938.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of November 9 in connection with the erection of a vocational training building at the Christie Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Purchasing Agent is being requested to secure the lumber and hardware requested in your letter.\n\nIt is noted that the school management will supply the necessary common labour without cost to the Department.

The balance of the labour is being supplied free of cost to the Department by the school management. I should, therefore, appreciate it if you would let me know as soon as possible whom you desire employed. The Indian Agent advises that the erection of this building should commence immediately in order that it may be completed before the rainy season starts.\n\nThe requisitions for materials are going forward to the Purchasing Agent.\n\nFor your information I may add that P.C. 321 of April 25, 1936, authorized the expenditure of the amounts provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvement and purchasing new equipment at Church owned Indian Residential Schools. The Christie Residential School comes in this class and the amount specifically provided for this school, namely $2,500.00, was included in the Order-in-Council just mentioned.\n\nDirector.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES File No. 159-0-11\n\nNovember 17, 1938\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Christie Indian Residential School.\n\nVOTE 77 Allotment 18-492\n\nSHIP TO Rev.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6441, file 879-11, part 2)\nOttawa,\nJanuary 4, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th instant enclosing quotations for material required for the Christie Residential School I wish to advise you that the woodworking lathe and bench saw table are being ordered by our Purchasing Branch. The balance of the material required may be purchased locally by yourself. I wish to draw particular attention to the following items on the requisition:\n\n1. 250 Ft. 8\" x 8\" - 25' Common Fir\n\nYour requisition did not state whether the school required 250 ft. board measure or 250 lineal feet. All three firms tendering quote on a different quantity.\n\n2. In securing paint a good grade should be ordered.\n\n3. There is some doubt as to whether 250 ft. board measure or oak is needed or 250 lineal feet. The price quoted for this appears high. Possibly a less expensive hardwood would answer the purpose.\n\nWhen forwarding the accounts your purchase orders should be attached.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. R. Hoey\n\nWith further reference to my memorandum of the 27th instant, I may say that purchase order has been issued for the Delta lathe and table recommended by Mr. Doucet.\n\nThe balance of the material required, including the lumber and paint, may be purchased locally by Commissioner Mackay in accordance with your suggestion. I would again call your attention to some of the points raised in my memorandum of the 27th instant, particularly regarding the paint. Quotations should be secured on a suitable grade of paint before the order is placed.\n\nI am returning herewith your file with the quotations on lumber and paint.\n\nW.M. Bailey\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOttawa December 31, 1940.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey\n\nWith further reference to my memorandum of the 27th instant, I may say that purchase order has been issued for the Bolte lathe and table recommended by Mr. Doucet.\n\nThe balance of the material required, including the lumber and paint, may be purchased locally by Commissioner Mackay in accordance with your suggestion. I would again call your attention to some of the points raised in my memorandum of the 27th instant, particularly regarding the paint. Quotations should be secured on a suitable grade of paint before the order is placed.\n\nI am returning herewith your file with the quotations on lumber and paint.\n\nW. M. BAILEYS\nW.M.Bailey\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\n\nWith reference to your requisition of the 20th instant, your file H.159-0-11, with attached quotations on material for the Christie Indian Residential School, Kakawis, B.C., I may say that the following additional data is needed to assist us in placing the order for same:\n\n1. Items 1 and 2 - lathe and table.\n\nThere is considerable variation in the price and kind of machinery offered by the two Vancouver firms quoting. It would assist us in dealing with these two items, and in securing additional competition, if you could send us a description or more exact specification of the type of lathe and bench table needed.\n\n2. 250 feet 8\" x 6\" x 25' common fir.\n\nHow many lengths are required? Do you require 250 feet board measure, or 250 lineal feet? All three firms tendering quote on a different quantity.\n\n3. Paint.\n\nThe firms quoting do not advise definitely as to the brand, grade, or name of manufacturer of the paint they offer. I consider that a good grade, manufactured by a reliable paint firm should be supplied. There is no information on the requisition or tenders as to whether some of the items will be used for inside, or outside, work.\n4. Oak.- Item 3.\n\nOnly one quotation was received on the 200 feet of rough oak, 2\" x 4\" x 16'. Here, again, there is some doubt as to whether 200 feet board measure, or 200 lineal feet, are actually required. The price, $450.00 per thousand feet board measure f.o.b., Kleecoot, B.C., seems rather high. Would a less expensive hardwood answer the purpose?\n\n5. From information available, it does not appear that Commissioner MacKay made any recommendation regarding this proposed purchase. This is regrettable, particularly regarding the lathe and table, which he could have inspected at Vancouver with a view to standardizing, in so far as possible, on machinery of uniform type and make for use in Vocational Training Schools.\n\nIn telephone communication with your office, the question of the advisability of authorizing Commissioner MacKay to make the best possible arrangements for local purchase of the material requisitioned was considered. Before authorizing this method of procedure, however, I should appreciate your views. If the additional information outlined above is supplied this office, I shall be pleased to arrange to complete the purchase.\n\nW. H. Bailey\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith an application and tenders received from Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge, of the West Coast Agency, for manual training supplies and repairs to buildings of the Christie Indian Residential School. The best prices quoted on this material amount to $371.85.\n\nIn the 1940-41 Estimates, Mr. Ashbridge asked for a new track for this School at $615.00, and a gas engine for $150.00. He now states that the new track will not be necessary this year and that, therefore, the $615.00, if available, could be used for the purchase of the above material. The gas engine asked for will be required, but the cost should not exceed $100.00 laid down at the School. I would, therefore, recommend that the above expenditures be allowed in place of the new track requested.\n\nIf the paint in the above requisition is allowed this year, the shingle stain in 1941-42 Estimates amounting to $195.75 desired for this School could be cancelled.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of 25th November in connection with application of Christie School for supplies, and to report that the material requested for track in the 1940-41 estimates will not be required, which would possibly make the amount $615.00 available, no material having been supplied.\n\nA gas engine would be required for operation of lathe and machinery, and the Reverend Principal suggests a 1.5 Briggs & Stratton air cooled, or a Johnson of the same power. Such an engine could be purchased for about $80.00, but am unable to obtain same locally.\n\nRe 1941-42 estimates, items shingle stain and 8 x 8 cedar may be cancelled.\n\nI regret having confused the estimates when making this application.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.

The latter is in the West and is expected home about the end of this month at which time your letter will be brought to his attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

He spoke of the merit of your Mr. Doucet and the courses he laid out in manual training.\n\nHe said that the Carpentry course given by him was excellent. A Carpenter who saw the course said that even without an instructor a boy following that course could become proficient in that line.\n\nWould it be possible for you to send me a copy of this course and one in mechanics. We certainly need all the assistance we can get in this line because it is almost impossible to hire a skilled worker. War work seems to have swallowed all the Mechanics and Carpenters.\n\nIf you cannot secure\nChristie Indian Residential School\nNahanni, N.C.\n(WEST COAST, VICTORIA ISLAND)\n\na copy for me, could you let me know where I could get in touch with Mr. Donald.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nYours truly,\nJ.P. Mulvaney, O.M.\nOttawa,\nAugust 23, 1941.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nYour request of last June has been in my hands for some time and steps have been taken so that you may receive the woodworking course which you have requested. As regards the course in mechanics it is not quite ready at present. As soon as it is I will see that you receive a copy. Along with the courses in woodworking I am sending a suggestive outline for a course of study hoping that this will be of some benefit.\n\nIf there is any other way in which I may be of any help please do not hesitate to write to me.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.J.

The Vancouver office of the Singer Company have been in communication with this office advising that under authority of Purchase Order No. 15149 dated December 4th three additional machines were shipped to the school from Vancouver.

The proposal is covered fully in Mr. Davey's memorandum and it should be unnecessary for me to enlarge on the proposal here.\n\nI would emphatically state, however, that instruction in boat building will be of the greatest value to the West Coast Indian pupils and I feel that we should endeavour to make the funds required available, either from the Education Vote or, if necessary, from the B.C. Special Vote.\n\nW.S. Amos\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nVancouver, B.C.,\nOctober 12, 1949.\n\nMEMORANDUM TO THE INDIAN COMMISSIONER FOR B.C.\n\nRe: Christie Indian Residential School\n\nOn the occasion of my recent visit to the above-mentioned School I discussed with the Reverend Principal the possibility of the establishment of a more comprehensive course for boat building. You are aware that this School has previously constructed three launches, one a deep-sea troller which is now used by the School as a freight boat and two smaller light cabin launches.\n\nThe Principal states that, in order for work of this nature to be carried on efficiently and so that boats of the size required for fishing on the west coast of Vancouver Island might be constructed, a boat shed would be required located so as to give easy access to the water. He has submitted a list of the materials required for this work amounting to $680, a copy of which is attached. This appears to be very reasonable. The present boat shed is too small to permit the construction of the type of boat which would make this project practical. It is also located behind the School some 200 or 300 yards from the water. The finished boats have to be moved this distance down a very steep incline to the water's edge. This is both a difficult and dangerous operation. The construction of the shed will be undertaken by the boys under the direction of the boat builder now in the employ of the School. I believe that this scheme will provide useful instruction and will be self-supporting as there should be no difficulty in finding a ready market for the boats. The Reverend Principal has had considerable dealings with the fishing industry before his\nappointment to his present position. I understand he was primarily responsible for the organization of the Indian Co-operative known as the \"Nootka Trollers\" and supervised its operation during the initial period. He, therefore, knows the requirements and the possibility of marketing the boats.\n\nIn view of the past success of the School in this type of work and the fact that nearly all the boys graduating from the Christie School will either own or operate a fishing boat on graduation, it is recommended that the Department authorize the purchase of the required materials as requested by the Reverend Principal.\n\nI have previously forwarded pictures of the boats constructed at this School but, if the Department so wishes, I can send additional prints.\n\nR.

STATEMENT OF THE PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDED THE DECEASED PUPIL\n\nI attended Clara Andrews from Jan. 1, 1944 to Feb. 14, 1955. The immediate cause of death was pulmonary tuberculosis.\n\nThe contributory cause of death was pulmonary tuberculosis.\n\nDo you consider that the Principal of the School, and the members of the School staff exercised reasonable care and judgment in regard to the illness and death of this pupil?

Jones\nTOFINO, B.C.\n\nOct. 26/19\u2014\n\nMr. P.B. Ashbridge\nIndian Agent\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ashbridge,\n\nFather Hobbs has asked me to make a special report on George Johnson. He seems to be quite worried about the school might be blamed in some way for the deaths that have occurred there. However, as I said in my other letter, Father Hobbs always tries to do everything possible, and he always follows any of my instructions carefully.\n\nWith regard to George Johnson, I first saw him at the school on Oct. 4th. At that time, he was running a temperature, with occasional headaches and vomiting. Physical examination was negative, except for a slight stiffness of the neck, an\nDr. John G. Robertson\nPhysician, Surgeon, B.C.\n\nTopino, B.C.\n\nFinding his head, I made a note on his card, suspecting him of T.B. meningitis.\n\nThe next day the boy further expressed the desire to take him home, and I agreed.\n\nOn Oct. 9th, I was called to attempt to see George, who was complaining of severe pain in the left ear. The left ear drum looked suspicious, although it was not bulging, and he was very tender over the left mastoid. He also had some weakness of the right arm. I examined the ear drum but did not obtain any pus. So I could not make up my mind whether this was a mastoid, a meningitis, or both; I decided to send him to Port alberni. The next you knew,\n\nAs for conditions in the school at present, there is nothing out of the ordinary there to indicate an epidemic of any sort, and it is my opinion that the cases of T.B. meningitis which occurred were entirely unrelated to one another.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nH. Carter\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to inform you of a serious matter in connection with the health of Christie Residential School, and to urgently request your advice as to procedure.\n\nOn September 6th, pupil Andrew Tom died, his case being diagnosed as Tubercular Enteritis. On September 14th, pupil Cecil Williams died, diagnosis T.B. Meningitis. On October 19th, pupil Alice George died, diagnosis T.B. Meningitis. Pupil George Johnson, whom I had brought to Fort Albert hospital, is not expected to live, diagnosis T.B. Meningitis.\n\nIn all these cases, the School authorities have permitted the patient to go home, none having died at the school. While I am satisfied that all due care was taken in each case, I feel that they should not have been sent to their homes, and would appreciate your ruling as to the responsibility of the school, morally and financially.\n\nThe more serious aspect of the case is the possibility of this not being tuberculous meningitis, which is not contagious, but that it may be a different type, say Meningococcus Meningitis, which may be contracted from a \"Carrier\".\n\nWhen on my inspection last week, I endeavored to see Dr. Foster at Tatline to talk over this matter, but was unfortunately unable to do so and was obliged to leave on account of violent weather. I have written him to forward me a complete report on the situation but feel that you should be informed, and that Dr. Macquarie should advise me, by wire if necessary, should he consider an autopsy and pathologic report warranted.\n\nThis series of deaths has naturally caused considerable consternation among the Indians, and may lead to attempts being made to burn the school, as has been done on other occasions. I have informed the Indians that the school is in no way responsible for the disease, but as you know it is difficult to convince them.\n\nD. H. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\n(over)\nD. H. MacKay, Esq.\n\nI may add that in each case enquiry was made as required by the regulations, and name forwarded to Ottawa.\n\nIn the case of pupil, George Johnson, now dying at Port Alberni, I have requested Dr. Jones to make a spinal puncture, and a culture, for future reference.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 4, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo enclosing memorandum of inquiry into the cause and circumstances of the deaths of Alice George, No. 0246, and George Johnson, No. 355, of the Christie Indian residential school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

MacKay and Dr. A. L. McQuarrie, as per copy of my letter attached, and desire to report that Dr. McQuarrie conducted further inquiry into the matter.\n\nHe does not consider that there is any doubt as to its being Tuberculous Meningitis, and that the four deaths occurring were coincidental, and not due to any contagion.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.B.Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nMemorandum of an inquiry into the cause and circumstances of the death of Rose Johnson, Pupil No. 0273, of the Christie Indian Residential School at Nakawis, B.C., who died at The School (place) on 18th April 1941.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nWhen a pupil of an Indian Residential School dies, the Principal is required to inform the Indian Agent at once.\n\nOn receipt of the Principal's notice the Indian Agent shall convene a Board of Inquiry, consisting of himself as Chairman, the Principal of the Residential School, and the Medical Officer who attended the deceased pupil.

Travelling conditions in that area are known here and it seems quite possible that you did not have time to see her between the time you were notified and the time of her death.\n\nIn a case such as this, where cause of death is unknown, and where the patient dies as suddenly as this child did, it would probably be advisable to report the circumstances to the Provincial coroner, who would probably deem it necessary to hold an inquest.\n\nThis letter is not meant as any criticism but rather for future guidance and the Department would be pleased to receive from you as full a report of the circumstances surrounding this death and as to your impressions of the cause of death, as you are able to give us.\n\nYours truly,\n\nP.

The Christie School authorities first called me at around 3:00 A.M. and described the onset of a sudden dyspnea and attendant symptoms which seemed at the time to be on an asthmatic basis. Since such episodes are not an infrequent occurrence among these local Indian children, and since I was not requested to see the child, I asked for a further report should the child not react favorably to small repeated doses of Adrenalin which I had given to the School. Around 7:00 A.M., a school messenger called at my house and asked me to return with him since there had been no improvement. We called (telephone) before starting and were informed that the child had just died. The additional circumstances you are acquainted with.\n\nOn two or three occasions since December 1940 when I first to Tofino, I examined this child and apart from Dental caries and a multiple extraction of deciduous teeth, there was nothing abnormal to be detected. There was no history of illness up to and immediately preceding the sudden onset of this episode. After considering the facts at hand, it would occur to me as reasonably feasible that this represents a possible acute Influenza Pneumonia. During this past winter, there have been several cases in B.C. with similar histories and terminations. The absence of other cases of Influenza at the School must be considered for what it is worth.\n\nI regret my failure to do the necessary thing by calling the Provincial Coroner but can assure you that such steps will be taken in the future when required.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Having heard and read over the statements of the Principal and the Physician, do you consider that all essential circumstances relating to the death of Pupil No. 0891 Lorene Thomas have been recorded? Yes. If not, you are required to add here any further particulars which strike you as essential.\n\nThis enquiry was conducted in the presence of the Rev. Principal, Dr. Karasgaard, attending physician, Hippolite Thomas, father of the deceased, and myself.\n\nI am quite satisfied that everything possible was done for the child, in which all concurred.\n\n2. In this space record any recommendations which the Board consider should be made to the Department in relation to the health or safety of the pupils of this School.\n\nAutopsy was conducted with the consent of father of deceased, copy of findings as hereto attached.\n\nRecommended: That in similar cases where a doubt exists, Doctor should be consulted before applying heat and administering cathartics and enemas.\n\nTofino, B.C., November 27, 1944.\n\nP.B. Ashbridge Chairman\u2014Indian Agent.\nREPORT ON LORENA THOMAS, age 6, of CHRISTIE SCHOOL.\n\nI first saw this girl on Nov. 24th at 10:15 when she was brought into my office. She was complaining every so often of severe abdominal pain which seemed to radiate across the lower abdomen being as bad on the right as on the left. The sister said that she had had some pain in the midline, lower abdomen for 5 days off and on, with vomiting once only. But on the morning of the 24th she awakened and screamed with the pain. Patient said that bowels had moved in the a.m. of 23rd. She had no complaints referable to the respiratory or urinary tract.\n\nExamination: young girl, slightly thin, lying on her back with her knees flexed, skin hot and dry, breathing rapidly, and moving no more than absolutely necessary; pain seemed aggravated by movement. T.101 2/5 oral and 105 (Rectal). R. 65, P. 144. Lungs: clear to auscultation and percussion. Abd.: lower portion held quite rigid, upper portion moved with respiration. Palpation was attempted, but she was so tender that she would not allow a hand to do any more than be placed on the abdomen. Tenderness appeared to extend all over the abdomen.\n\nLAB. Owing to the rapid respirations\u2014simulating pneumonic breathing\u2014and the history of old tuberculosis, an x-ray plate was attempted. The plate was blurred by rapid breathing, but the right lung appeared slightly denser than the left.\n\nShe was admitted to hospital, given sulfonamides, clear fluids only. Her temperature fell to 102 3/5 rectally, but the respirations and pulse remained rapid. The abdomen did not change that day. On the 25th she commenced to vomit dark greenish fluid at intervals. An intravenous of 5% dextrose in Saline was given which alleviated the vomiting for a time, but when it returned she a Wangenstein suction was connected to a Levine tube in the stomach. This stopped the vomiting, and reduced the distension which had begun to appear in the epigastrium. However, at about 9:30 p.m. she began to fail and despite coramine passed away at 10:55 p.m.\n\nPOST-MORTEM: Heart normal. Lungs: considerable adhesions to right upper lung and evidence of healed tuberculosis. Lower lobes of both lung had considerable hypostatic edema. Abdomen: about 1/2 quarts of greenish thin pus flowed out of the cavity on opening. The intestines were matted together by a thick layer of pus, odor definitely faecal. The appendix was found tied down under the caecum, with a hard faecolith in it and a definite perforation in a gangrenous area.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This child had a perforated gangrenous appendix which led to a generalized peritonitis. The appendix had had a smoldering infection all week and apparently perforated.\nFriday morning 24th. As the child had been active enough to take part in a concert on Wednesday night at her own request, and did not complain of severe pain until Friday morning, no blame is to be attached to anyone that medical attention was not sought earlier. When seen she had a peritonitis and her condition was not suitable for operation. Her old history of tuberculosis left her with no resistance to fight the infection.\n\nA. J. Karagian M.D.\nREPORT ON WEST COAST AGENCY FOR MONTH OF NOVEMBER.\n\nChristie Residential school was found in good order. Night watchman has been employed as from November 1st and all fire precautions are being taken.\n\nOne pupil Loreena Thomas died of Peritonitis, following rupture of appendix. A Board of Inquiry was held at Tofino Hospital, at which I presided, and report has been forwarded.\n\nGeneral health of the school is good and vaccinations have been brought to date.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nAttached hereto please find memorandum of enquiry re the death of Pupil No. 0291, Lorena Thomas, of Christie Indian Residential School. I wish to report that I had no Forms 414 with me at the time of the enquiry, and I have therefore attached the reports of the Reverend Principal and Dr. Karsgaard to the form.\n\nOn the recommendation of Dr. Karsgaard, I agreed to an autopsy after obtaining consent of the child's father. I am quite satisfied that the child received every attention and that Dr. Karsgaard made every endeavour to save the life of this child. A study of the report on the autopsy indicates that she was fighting a losing battle. The child's father is quite satisfied with the care and treatment she received.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 5, 1944.\n\nMr. P. B. Ashbridge, Indian Agent, Port Alberni, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, enclosing Memorandum of Enquiry into the cause and circumstances of the death of Lorena Thomas, pupil No. 0291 of the Christie Indian Residential School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| CENTRAL REGISTRY | P.A.

(RG 10, Volume 6442, file 880-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES CANADA\nSIR:\n\nI beg to forward you herewith Agency Voucher No.819 in favour of the Reverend G.H. Raley, Principal at Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, and amounting to $206.26.\n\nThis represents a refund of various sums expended in building repairs at the School.\n\nI am enclosing a letter of explanation, in duplicate, from the Principal, from which it would appear that there was no authority for this expenditure, but that apparently the Department have been paying such items direct, and not through this office, in the past.\n\nI have, therefore, signed the Voucher provisionally, as the expenditure appears to be one, which has heretofore met with the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOffice of the New Westminster Indian Agency,\n\nMarch 10th, 1932\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 819, amounting to $208.26 in favour of Rev. G.H. Baley, Principal, Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, Sardis, B.C., for Building Repairs at Coqualeetza Indian Residential School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. dated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nIn explanation let me say the expenditures have not been authorized by the Department and have been paid out of the school funds. Inasmuch as they are unauthorized the school is responsible.\n\nHowever, there are reasons why I might present the voucher and receipted accounts, trusting the Department for the following reason might consider a refund.\n\nThe reason I would advance is the urgency of the work undertaken. Our repairs which are of a minor character are kept up to date without being allowed to wait or accumulate, thus avoiding general deterioration. The wisdom of this is obvious. The total expenditure in a building of this size by the government (since it was opened) has been below a very moderate estimate generally allowed for such a purpose. The stationary equipment and fixtures of light, water, drainage and power are kept in good repair and not allowed to remain out of order. The accounts represent a certain amount of skilled labour, the bulk however is for material, all used in the school and out-buildings. It was necessary to do a little plastering and to build a cement trough, making the necessary water connections with the barn. The metal partitions, separating the compartments of the shower baths on the boys' side became loose and had to be taken down and rebuilt. This necessitated the employment of skilled labour. On account of the mudroom which was opened in October, in order to provide sufficient isolation, we re-lined the boys dormitory, so that its warmth and comfort could not be questioned; lining also at the same time the top story of the technical building, thus making a room for the manual training instructor. This emergency work was in good order. The carpentry work was done as a good project by the manual training teacher and the senior boys. It has served two purposes, giving us the extra accommodation and practical instruction.\n\nI should like to be perfectly clear that inasmuch as, there was no request sent in to the Department, I do not consider there is any obligation. So I send the voucher and accounts along for consideration. If favourable consideration is given to the payment, we shall be very grateful.\n\nSIGNED:\n\nG.H. Raley,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, April 4, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, relative to the cutting of a door between the boys' infirmary and the boys' corridor at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, in order to give a direct approach to the infirmary on the boys' side of the building. In this connection I have to say that the Department will approve of you arranging to have this door installed. It is noted the cost will be approximately $30. After the work has been completed, please forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nThe account which you forwarded under cover of your letter of the 23rd ultimo for the fire hose purchased will be paid in due course.\n\nThe account which you submitted through the office of Mr. Agent Daunt to the amount of $206.26 in payment for materials, etc., for repairs during the December quarter last, together with your explanation regarding this expenditure, has been received. As our funds are extremely limited, the Department is allowing payment to the amount of $150 only; this being the full amount that can be provided, and a cheque will be sent you in due course. The balance of the expenditure incurred will have to be met from school earnings or other receipts. Owing to recent orders for strict economy, it will be necessary for you to limit all costs for repairs, etc., to the lowest possible point, and in cases where any expenditure of a large amount is contemplated in carrying out repairs, etc., you should report the matter fully to the Department and receive authority before undertaking the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

McInnes, Esq.,\nActing Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter No. 153-0-5 dated Ottawa March 21st, 1931.\n\nWhen the school was built in 1923, the matter of a door being cut between the boys' infirmary and the boys' corridor was fully considered and it was considered undesirable for various reasons. It was not a fault of the architect's plan.\n\nIt was then considered to have as little connection as possible between the boys' and girls' side. The character of the students has changed so greatly in the years that they are not so irresponsible. They have improved morally and are more trustworthy.\n\nWe have discussed the question at a couple of staff meetings and are now unanimous it would be a great convenience, for the following reasons.\n\n1. It would give a direct approach to the infirmary from the boys' side of the building for the visitors whom it was not desirable should pass through the girls' side.\n2. If it was necessary to bring in a stretch case from the boys' side, it could be done more easily than under the present arrangement.\n\n3. In case of fire, it would give an exit to the boys' side from both boys' and girls' wards in the infirmary without having to go through the main corridor to the boys' side.\n\nMy opinion is that it would be better to have the change made. The cost would be about thirty dollars.\n\nThanking you for your interest,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.H. Raley,\nPrincipal.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nMarch 23rd, 1932\n\nT. R. L. McInnes Esq.,\nActing Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Your file 153-0-5 dated March 21, 1931\n\nI beg to enclose voucher and receipted accounts in duplicate, covering fire hose. With reference to this, you will notice I purchased more than was authorized. In my opinion this was justifiable. Last August a neighbor's house was burnt down in the middle of the night. It was situated 200 yards from the barns and 300 yards from the house. Fortunately the night was wet, though sparks and bits of burning shingle were blown over our out buildings. It is the first time a fire has been so near. Watching the barns, we, considering the matter felt we should meet such a situation with more of the larger hose.\n\nWe have only a small pipe leading from the school supply with a small hose and little pressure, so I purchased sufficient of the three inch hose to reach from the main water supply of the school, to the large barn, the little barn and the new piggery. With this attached to the main water supply, we get good pressure.\n\nI submit we are entitled only to the payment of the two lengths authorized, but trust the Department with regard this as a justifiable expense.\n\nIn connection with installing the two extra iron fire-escapes, leading from the small girls and small boys dormitories, we had the iron landings and\nladders from the old building. These being in first class condition we utilized and repainted. A first class job was done by a carpenter and the senior boys at no cost to the Department. Mr. Inspector Barry saw the finished work and was satisfied it was substantial and complete. We now have direct communication from each of the ten dormitories to an iron fire-escape without having to go into a corridor.\n\nI delayed forwarding the accounts in this connection until the fire escapes were completed, thinking it might be necessary to employ a bricklayer. This was avoided. Hoping this explanation is satisfactory\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. H. Raley,\nPrincipal.\nApril 16, 1932.\n\nMr. A.O.N. Hunt\n\nRe: Building & Repair Accounts.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn explanation of these accounts let me state the Farquharson & Eckel account #1, was some very necessary plumbing that required a skilled mechanic.\n\nRobertson Bros., #2, and E.E. Mower, #3, it has been thought necessary for some time we should build an incinerator. The one we had was an open iron work one between the barn and the mail building. It required constant watching insomuch as a gale of wind might take a piece of cloth, which keeps fire a long time, and blow it to some dangerous place. I talked the matter over with Col. Pragnell, Inspector of Agencies, and he told me of the style he thought we should build. An opportune time occurred and we did not delay construction.\n\nTrusting these expenses will meet with your approval.\n\nThese are not the Repair expenses of the school for the quarter but all that we feel we are justified in presenting to the Department for payment. We feel, in these times, that where we can, we should bear as much of the Building and Repair expenses as we can without crippling any other legitimate expenses of the per capita grant.\n\nSigned:\n\nG.H. Raley, Principal\nOttawa, April 30, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nMr. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for the Province of British Columbia, in a report on his inspection in January, last, of the Cogwataletza Indian Residential School, recommends that a hydrant be placed in front of the main building and one at the rear, to complete fire protection.\n\nIn this connection I would request that you state whether you consider these hydrants should be installed or if the present fire protection facilities are sufficient. While the Department is desirous of providing ample fire protection at residential schools, our funds this year are extremely limited. If you are of opinion that it is necessary to install the two hydrants, you should furnish an estimate of the cost, when same will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. G. H. Raley,\nPrincipal,\nCogwataletza Residential School,\nSardis, B.C.\nEXTRACT from Inspector Barry's Report regarding his visit to the COQUALETZA INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL on January 28th, 29th and 30th, 1932.\n\nOriginal on File 153-0-6.\n\nFire Protection:\n\nThere are eight stand pipes with hose, situated in various parts of the building; inside; but no hydrant outside. One new hydrant should be placed in front of the main building and one new hydrant should be placed at the rear of the building. There are four portable fire engines in good condition; there are 15 fire extinguishers placed at various points inside the school building. The pressure in the mains for fire fighting would be about 60 pounds. This is reported by the Principal as sufficient to throw water over the roof of the main school. The water is from the Elk Creek Water Co.\n\nFurther instructions have been received from the Department with regard to fire protection since I made my inspection of this school. A number of details will be taken up with the Principal on my next visit.\n\nExtinguishers were tested in January, 1932.\n\nLaundry:\n\nOver 3000 articles per week pass through the laundry. There is very great need for a drying room or some other method of drying clothes, sheets etc. It is due to the great difficulty of drying articles that such a condition of things as is reported under the heading of Dormitories, can arise. Better provision should be made for the washing and drying of sheets, pillow slips, etc. These should certainly be changed much more frequently than is being done now. The reason given for their rather dirty condition was that the laundry was holding up the articles. In the laundry, the whole difficulty was put down to the lack of proper drying facilities.\n\nI beg to recommend that a drying room with a cement floor, steam heated, and with drying racks, be added to the S.W. corner of the present laundry. If this room were built, there would be no necessity to have a steam mangle, which, in the absence of such a room, is now necessary and should, in my opinion, be supplied. Some sort of steam iron is also badly needed here. All the machines are now guarded. This applies to belts, cog wheels, etc.\n\nEXTRACT from Indian Commissioner Ditchburn's letter of April 6th, 1932, submitting above report. - Original on File 153-0-6.\n\nThere is a recommendation that authorization for the expenditure of $50.00 be given for the purchase of material for the boys' manual training room. In connection with the girls' sewing room, it is recommended that two new sewing machines be provided due to the fact that the machines at present on hand are now pretty well worn out. Outside hoods are recommended to add to the efficiency of the fire fighting equipment. Hot and cold water and a sink should be installed in the dressing rooms connected with the infirmary and also a two-burner electric stove is required for the heating of water.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nMay 27th, 1932\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq., Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter #153/0/5, dated April 30th, let me say we are looking very seriously into the matter of placing the fire hydrants to which you refer.\n\nI have not replied as a new main was being laid in front of the building, which we thought might make a difference in the pressure. The main was completed a few days ago and I have tested out the water pressure which is about the same as before. I am getting estimates of the cost of the necessary fire protection but think considerable money can be saved by installing the Chicago Valve which can be obtained in this country, instead of the hydrants.\n\nI am having a man from Chilliwack and another from Vancouver look over the ground. When I have received a report from them as to the best method to install this additional fire protection at least expense, I will write again.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. H. RALEY\nPrincipal\n\nGHR:hjc\nOttawa, May 4, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th ultimo, enclosing a voucher in favour of Rev. G. H. Raley covering the cost of repairs incurred by him at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the cost of legitimate emergency repairs to buildings and equipment will be favourably considered by the Department on receipt of the usual accounts, properly certified. Before any large expenditure, however, is incurred, the Principal should forward his request, giving full particulars and an estimate of the cost, and receive the necessary authority. The account which you forwarded in favour of the Reverend Principal will be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. O'H.

Raley, and representing repairs at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School.\n\nI have signed the voucher, provisionally, as I do not know what authority there is for the expenditure. It has, apparently been paid direct from the Department until recently.\n\nIf this expense is in order, I should be much obliged for instructions covering the amount allowable, for future reference.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O'N.Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nApril 18, 1932.\n\nMr. A.

H. Raley, Principal\n\nGHR:hjo\nOttawa, July 7, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, with reference to adequate outside fire protection at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School. You may provide this protection for the main building, at a cost of approximately $514.44. The Department notes that this will give protection to the Principal's residence and garage also and even to the manual training building. Do not continue the service to the barns, hogpen and implement shop at the present time. You should purchase the material from indicated sources. If you are not sure who are on the list, please communicate with Mr. Indian Agent Ball, who is informed in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. G. H. Raley,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetza Institute,\nSardis,\nB.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6442, file 880-5, part 1)\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter dated April 30th, let me state that we have made a thorough investigation of the needs of the case in order to give what Capt. Barry might consider adequate fire protection.\n\nHe was here this week and went over the ground thoroughly with me and I showed him the proposed plan of increasing protection, not only from the outside but within the building. The rough sketched plan shows the existing fire lines and main. It shows the proposed line for the school, the proposed line to the barn and outbuildings and also what might be considered good precaution for the future.\n\nThe total cost for material for outside fire protection for the school building is $249.44. The skilled labour, including plumbing would be $65.00, making a total of $314.44. This also gives protection for the Principal's Residence and the garage and until water was laid on in the Manual Training Building with sufficient hose available, it could be used there also.\n\nIncluded in this cost is material to increase the supply of water to the fire lines or standpipe in the boys' wing. At present there is only a two inch pipe to serve three one and a half inch hose lines which is impossible. This is bushed into the main which also retards the flow of water.\n\nBy the time the main supply which enters the building in the boys' wing reaches the fire line or standpipe in the girls' wing, it has had so much drawn from it and has been reduced in size that it is inadequate to supply flow enough to the three hose lines on the girls' side. (It is not, of course, supposed that there would ever be three lines attached and in operation at the same time).\n\nYou will see the plan includes a booster line from the proposed main to this fire line. Everything is covered in this cost of material as shown in figures A.B.C. and D. At\npoint C. provision is made to continue the lines on to the barn. The fire service to the two barns, piggery and implement shop would cost $195.14 for all the material. This line could be used as water service also, thereby keeping the water fresh and eliminating the dead end. The cost of installing this, apart from the digging and excavating, which would be done by the school, would be $20.00 to $25.00. We have water in the barn but this only a three quarter inch pipe.\n\nFittings would also be placed on the line, to pipe over to the cottage and also to the clubhouse, and annex, if found necessary in the future.\n\nCapt. Barry and I did not go thoroughly into the matter of continuing the protection to the barn and annex. The Main Building, however, we were agreed upon as to outside protection being advisable.\n\nIf the Department favours this suggestion, we would have the matter undertaken immediately.\n\nThanking you for your interest,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.H.

It broke the regularity and monotony of school life and gave them the open air for six weeks.\n\nWhen the holiday camp commenced in 1915 a grant of $200.00 was made by the Department annually; that being insufficient, it was increased to $300.00 which amount was paid up till last year. This year I understand the grant is to be cut. I sincerely hope it will not be less than the amount requested as this does not represent one-third of the cost of giving this holiday to the children. Trusting the grant will be made as it is all legitimate expenditure and reduced to the minimum.\n\nThanking you for your interest.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. H. Raley\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6442, file 880-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUE CANADA\n\nFOOR COPY\nOttawa, January 19, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, enclosing a communication which you received from the Principal of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, regarding matters that need attention in the wiring of the various buildings, and enclosing a report received from the Chilliwack Electric Company, Limited, setting forth the repairs required and giving their quotation for the carrying out of the work.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that your letter became mislaid in the Department, and the Principal was therefore written on the 17th instant and authorized to have the repairs required carried out, at a cost for materials and labour not to exceed $62. The Principal was requested, after the work had been satisfactorily completed, to obtain an account, in triplicate, showing in detail the work done, to certify and forward it to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. O'H. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster,\nB. C.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nSIR:\n\nI beg to forward you herewith a communication received from the Reverend G.H. Raley, Principal of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, in which reports having had the wiring system at the School carefully checked by a competent Electrician.\n\nAs a result of the report received by him some changes are advocated, which will apparently amount to $62.00. The Reverend Principal requests that this amount be authorized by the Department.\n\nIf the Department could possibly do so, I would recommend that this request be met, as defective wiring can very easily cause a fire, which would be a serious matter in a large school of this description.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nJanuary 3, 1933.\n\nA. O. N. Daunt Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B. C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSince the fire at an Indian Residential School on the Prairies recently, which the papers said was caused by defective wiring, I have had Mr. Marsh, electrician of Chilliwack, inspect and report to me any defects or necessary repairs which should be attended to without delay, and I herewith enclose his report. The repairs are of a minor character but important. We have been carefully watching and checking our lighting and heating, and every night a double check is made. We fully realize that nothing can be left undone and constant vigilance is the price we have to pay for security of life and property.\n\nA matter that is referred to in Mr. Marsh's report was the collection of the material over the joists of the carpenter's shop. The danger of this was that the boards which rested on the joists might have been pushed aside and have rested on the wire and perhaps broken it. The material has been removed. In the printing shop the motor connections should be permanently wired and the motor will not be used until this is done. The cost of supplies for the work in these changes will be $62.00 and I would advise this expenditure and request the approval of the Department for the same.\n\nI called on Friday with these papers but unfortunately it was the lunch hour and I had to go on to Vancouver. Trusting this may have your approval.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6442, file 880-5, part 1)\nOttawa, January 17, 1933.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication addressed to you by the Chilliwack Electric Co., Ltd., Chilliwack, B.C., setting forth the matters, electrical, that need attention in the various buildings at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, and giving an estimate of the cost of having the work carried out. No covering letter from you appears to have been received regarding this matter.\n\nI may say that we will have certain unexpended funds in our present year's appropriation, and if you can arrange to have the work as mentioned in the list which is being enclosed herewith carried out in time to have the account forwarded to the Department not later than March 20th, next, the Department will approve of you having the work done, at a cost not to exceed the estimate submitted by the above mentioned firm, including materials and labour, of $62. After the work has been completed, please obtain an account, in triplicate, showing in detail the work carried out. This account you should certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. You should see that this account reaches the Department by the date mentioned above, as it may not be possible to provide the funds after the close of the present fiscal year.\n\nIn future, in forwarding quotations which you receive regarding repairs, etc., I would request that you forward same under cover of a communication from yourself as to the necessity for having the work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

In this cottage we did not have the conveniences necessary for the Nurse and we felt it imperative there should be a toilet built adjoining the house and septic tank installed at a proper distance.\n\nIn order to effect this improvement as economically as possible with efficiency, we purchased some of the material at a second hand junk store in Vancouver, and lumber for the lean-to and septic tank in Chilliwack. I obtained the assistance of one skilled plumber who, together with the Manual Training Instructor and boys, made the septic tank and did all the wood work. The total cost of the material and installing the toilet and septic tank and connecting waste pipe was $60.00. The job complete, if by contract and new material throughout, would have cost $100.00.\n\nIt is complete and modern. We have been using this building without this convenience for a couple of years and we just completed it when we had one case of Smallpox which was immediately isolated and the Nurse in charge of the case during the colder months had the benefit of this improvement, which, I am sure the Department will consider a very necessary and legitimate expenditure.\n\nSigned:\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.

The blow down pipe and cold water supply pipe to the boiler, and new fusible plug, etc., renewed, installed and repairs made.\n\nWith reference to Boiler #12369, the new fusible plug has been installed.\n\nRegarding Boiler #43804, the Boiler has been re-tubed throughout as recommended.\n\nWith reference to the Inspector's report on the difficulty in the circulation of the whole plant, I have a heating expert go over the matter and am enclosing a copy of his recommendation for changes in the system. He recommends that all traps on radiators be sent to the factory and the installation of a 2\" P.R. valve with controller and a 4\" P.R. valve with controller, and the installation of an 8000' vacuum pump. He also states that the cost could be cut down by using the Vacuum Sub Atmospheric System.\n\nWith reference to the domestic water supply, it is suggested the installing of a 200 gallon tank, in addition to what we have would be sufficient for the needs of the school. This would be linked up to the High Pressure boiler and\n\nINDIAN OFFICE\nNEW WESTMINSTER\nJAN. 19 1933\n\nIndian Affairs.

MALEY,\nPrincipal\n\nGHR:hjo\nRE: CHANGE OF HEATING SYSTEM\n\nAt COQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, SARDIS, B.C.\n\nTo change to Differential Vacuum System, would require no change in sizes of piping now in use, but whole system would have to be checked over to make it absolutely tight to draw high vacuum necessary.\n\nAll traps on radiators at present should be sent to factory to have bodies inspected and seated; caps and discs renewed.\n\nCost per trap, approximately $3.00\n\nWhere radiators are at present wet dripped with no trap, cost of new traps would be approximately $4.75 each.\n\nInstall 2\" P.R. valve with controller\n\" 4\" P.R. \" \" \"\nApproximate cost $260.00\n\nInstall 8,000' Vacuum pump, approx. cost $800.00\n\nThese are just material costs, not labour.\n\nThis is the ultimate in heating: working on 1# pressure or less with automatic balanced vacuum maintained; low steam consumption; less fuel used.\n\nThe above cost can be cut down by not going so far in changing system, using Vacuum Sub Atmospheric System. Where vacuum is not so great your present traps and piping might be satisfactory and tight enough to save cost of overhauling and trap repairs, thereby eliminating much labour and material costs.\n\nVacuum Pump would be approx. $100.00 less\n\n2\" and 4\" P.R. valves would be the same cost. Any new traps required would be same cost as above.\n\nThis is a good system, just one step removed from the Differential System. Flexible, giving full control from maximum to minimum needs in heating on low pressure.\n\nAt this season of the year it may not be possible to have your heating plant closed down even for a day, to have any changes made, so I suggest you do this:\n\nHave your Engineer check up on any radiators that do not heat, making a note of where they are located; whether they are partially heated, or not at all; if supply pipe to radiator is hot, if not, how far back from radiator before pipe feels hot to the touch. What is outside temperature at this time and positively what is steam gauge pressure at the boiler.\nIf pressure is high, I suggest cutting it down as it is possible that you have developed back pressure on your return line, thereby flooding the Air Eliminator and getting the system air bound.\n\nShould reducing the boiler pressure fail to relieve the system of air, I suggest taking the radiator farthest from the boiler which gives trouble, and venting it. Should there still be trouble, take the next radiator in line, which is not heating, and vent it, and so on until you have proper circulation, only doing one at a time and no more than is necessary. In fact, I want to stress that it is better to get your circulation through manipulation of boiler pressure, keeping it low, rather than by too much venting of radiators.\n\n* A. H.

J. Arnall, Engineer of the Public Works Department. He states that certain repairs and equipment are required in connection with the maintenance and safety of the boilers.\n\nRegarding Boiler No. 12368, the Inspector states that he found it in good condition, with the exception of the blow-down pipes and the cold water supply pipes to the boiler, which should be renewed, and he reports that a new fusible plug must be installed. He found a few small leaks showing around the packing nuts but stated that these would be attended to by the engineer.\n\nWith reference to Boiler No. 12369, the Inspector states that he found this boiler in very good condition but that a new fusible plug should be installed.\n\nConcerning Boiler No. 43804, he states that upon giving the hydrostatic test, when the pressure reached 60 lbs., that 12 tubes began to leak around the top plate. He found that many of the tubes were badly corroded and in places quite thin, and he recommends that this boiler be retubed.\n\nThe Inspector's attention was called to the fact that the circulation of the whole plant was poor - in some parts of the building it was very difficult to get any heat. He made an inspection of the runs and found that the returns were very flat. The boilers were set so high, that there is just sufficient grade to prevent the lower radiators from being flooded. He states he pointed out to the school physician that, if five or six automatic air valves were installed on the slow radiators, it would help the circulation considerably but that the only permanent solution was to install a new vacuum condensate pump in the boiler room.\n\nHe states that his attention was also called to the fact that the domestic hot water was insufficient for the purposes of the school. He recommends that a new water heater be installed outside the tank and steam supplied to it from both the vertical boiler and the steam heating boilers, and by passed with valves so that each could be used when required. I would request that you take this matter\n\nA. O'M. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster,\nB.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I shall be pleased to have a report from you on the present situation in connection with the heating plant at this school. You should state what repairs, if any, were carried out upon the recommendation of the Inspector and also itemize in detail the cost of returning the boiler, improving the circulation of the heating and the installing of a new water heater. It is expected that the school authorities, themselves, will make every effort to carry out the improvements as recommended by the Inspector, paying the cost of same from their per capita allowance or other receipts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Public Works, Canada,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir: Re: Inspection of Boilers and Machinery,\nIndian Residential School, Sardis, B.C.\n\nOn July 11th, 1935, I made an inspection of the mechanical equipment of this school, which consists of:\n\n- Two very large sectional cast iron boilers\n- One vertical tubular boiler\n- A full and complete laundry\n- A wood cutting plant\n\n**BOILER NO. 12358.**\n\nI gave this boiler a careful inspection and found it in good condition except the blowdown pipe and also the cold water supply pipes to the boiler which must be renewed. Also a new fusible plug must be installed.\n\nI gave this boiler a Hydrostatic Test of 25 lbs., and found it quite tight, only a few small leaks were showing around the packing nuts. These will be attended to by the Engineer.\n\nI set the Safety Valves to blow at 6-1/2 full, at 10 lbs. cold water pressure and have issued a certificate allowing a pressure of 10 lbs. and condition good. This boiler was built in 1928.\n\n**BOILER NO. 12360 B.C.**\n\nOn the same day I gave this boiler a careful inspection and found it in very good condition. I then gave it a hydrostatic test of 25 lbs., and found every part quite tight. A new fusible plug must be installed. The steam gauge is 1 lb. tight. The Safety Valves are set for 6-1/2 full, 10 lbs. steam pressure.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure of 10 lbs. and condition good. This boiler was built in 1924.\n\n**BOILER NO. 43864 B.C.**\n\nOn the same day I inspected this boiler which is a vertical tubular and is used to supply steam to the Laundry. This boiler has been well kept.\n\nThis boiler calls for a hydrostatic test of 200 lbs., and a working pressure of 140 lbs. Upon giving the hydrostatic test, when the pressure reached 60 lbs. 12 tubes began to leak around the top plate. I did not increase the pressure, but emptied the boiler and...\ngave it an internal inspection and found that as many of the tubes as I could see were very badly corroded and in places quite thin, so I would recommend that this boiler be retubed.\n\nI did not issue a certificate as another inspection will be required when the repairs are completed. Also a new fusible plug must be installed.\n\nThe whole of this plant is well kept, but the type of boilers is very uneconomical and at some time should be changed to some of a more economical type.\n\nMy attention was called to the fact that the circulation of the whole plant was very poor. In some parts of the building it was very difficult to get any heat. I made an inspection of the main and found that the returns were very flat. The boilers were set so high that there is just sufficient grade to prevent the lower radiators from being flooded. These are placed high on the wall to prevent it happening.\n\nI pointed out to the Engineer that if he installed five or six automatic air valves on the slow radiators that it would help the circulation considerably, but the only permanent solution is to install a new vacuum condensate pump in the boiler room.\n\nAn experiment had been tried to use less coal, which has proven successful in other plants, that is by building a bridge wall across the furnace, but in this case the whole back of the furnace had been allowed to fill up with burnt ashes, which more than defeated the possible saving and which, in this case, I am very doubtful would take place as these boilers are high instead of long and the heat passages have a short travel.\n\nMy attention was also called to the fact that the domestic hot water was insufficient for the school and a proposition had been made to install a steam coil in the large storage tank and supply this coil with steam from the vertical boiler.\n\nI suggested that steam could also be taken from the heating mains and used during the winter months, but upon examining the storage tank I found that it would be necessary to cut a manhole in it to allow for the installation of the coil and as this tank had been installed for some time, I do not recommend cutting into the plates, as if this is done it is quite possible a new tank would be required.\n\nI would recommend that a new water heater be installed outside the tank and steam supplied to it from both the vertical boiler and the steam heating boilers and by passed with valves so that each could be used when required. At present the tank is heated with a cast iron jacket heater.\n\nI then inspected the laundry machinery which I found in good condition. All moving parts are well protected with substantial wooden guards.\n\nThe same also applies to the wood cutting plant.\nI will furnish you with the approximate cost of the alterations in a few days.\n\nThe cost of retubing the boiler should be about: $150.00\n\" \" \" new plugs: 7.50\n\" \" \" new pipes, etc.: 10.00\n\n$167.50\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT.J.

He states, further, that the roof of the laundry needs renewal and that four toilet bowls on the boys' side should be replaced at once. In addition to the repairs required to the roof of the laundry, he recommends that some facilities be provided for drying clothes. The Inspector reports, also, that the water gauge on the high pressure boiler needs to be renewed and he recommends that this boiler be attached by steam coils to the hot water tank.\n\nIn connection with the repairs and alterations at your school, I have to say that there is an item in our Estimates for the current year to the amount of $400, which is all that is available. I would request, therefore, that you inform the Department which repairs, etc., including the supplying of the water gauge for the high pressure boiler, you consider to be the more urgent this year. You should give full details as to any materials, outside labour, and the approximate cost of the work which you recommend be carried out, not exceeding approximately the above stated amount. When we have this information, consideration will be given as to what work can be authorized.\n\nI may add that our Appropriation is so greatly reduced, that the above amount is all that we will be able to provide for your school for carrying out repairs, etc., this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. G. H. Riley, D.D., F.R.C.S.,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetza Residential School,\nSardis, B.C.\nEXTRACT from Inspector Barry's Report regarding his visit to the COQUALEETZA INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL on March 20 & 21, 1933.\n\nOriginal on File 153-0-6.\n\nDormitories:- The dormitories are in very good condition. The bed linen appears to be kept cleaner than was the case last year. Some of the mattresses should be renewed and I would recommend that 125 should be provided before the opening of school in the Fall. The matter of who will pay for these outworn mattresses will of course have to be decided by the Department. All I ask is that they be placed in use as soon as possible.\n\nBuildings:- The floors in the Boys' and Girls' Play Rooms in the basement need renewal. Some sort of lasting material should be used when this is done. The roof of the Laundry needs renewal this summer. After snow comes this roof leaks. About $100.00 will be required for this. A covered playground for the small boys and girls is very badly needed. These children should be out in the fresh air as much as possible, and under cover in poor weather of which there is much in the Lower Fraser Valley. It is most important that the health of these children should be attended to as well as is possible under the circumstances. Please see under Health below.\n\nSanitary Conditions:- Four toilet bowls on the Boys' Side need renewal at once. The general sanitary condition of the school is very good. Repairs to the basement floors mentioned above are very necessary, in fact new floors will have to be placed in these basements and adjoining rooms, if the proper sanitary condition of the school is to be preserved.\n\nLaundry:- In addition to repairs to the roof, mentioned above, some facilities for drying clothes are needed here. I made a recommendation last year, and beg to refer the Department to my report after my inspection of January 1932. Nothing has been done. It is impossible to keep the bed linen in proper condition if there is no proper way of drying sheets after washing them.\n\nBoiler Room:- The water gauge in the high pressure boiler needs to be renewed. I beg to recommend that the high pressure steam boiler be attached by steam coils to the hot water tank. This will cost about $75.00. My recommendation is made after a conference with the Principal and the boiler inspector who were present in the boiler room at the time of my inspection there. Such an addition will give a better supply of hot water for domestic use, at no extra cost, beyond that of the pipes now recommended.\n\nPreservation of Fruit and Vegetables:- I should like to recommend that the school be supplied with a small canning plant of the same make and size as that now in use at St. George's School, Lytton. Of those in use at the school now, one is too old, and one is too small. The cost of such a plant as I recommend is small, and the use to which it could be put is very great.\nI beg to forward you herewith Agency Voucher No. 964 amounting to $64.45 in favour of the Reverend G.H. Bulcy, Principal of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, representing certain building and repair accounts, which he has submitted for payment. An explanatory letter is also attached in connection therewith.\n\nI do not know what arrangements the Department have with this particular School for such charges, so I am forwarding this Voucher provisionally for your consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.O'H.

Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Daunt:\n\nWith reference to your letter #1-9-B, dated April 16th, re painting and redecorating the Principal's Residence, in which you ask for definite and absolutely necessary requirements and a reliable and fair estimate of the amounts of cost. In this regard I have had Mr. Max Wilson, who is an old, established, reliable and competent painter and house decorator, and who has previously done any necessary work for us, make an estimate.\n\nWe found the following to be absolutely necessary:\n\nThree bedrooms to be repainted,\n\nUpper hall front, lower hall and back hall, kitchen and two pantries, also front and porches of the house require paint.\n\nFour bedroom floors and the study floor should be varnished,\n\nWorn spots of woodwork, such as window ledges, should be patched up and renewed,\n\nTwo bedroom floors require a little repairing before being varnished.\n\n$175.00 would cover the cost of this work. This includes repainting of one wall of the kitchen and the repairing of the plaster on the kitchen ceiling.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nApril 30, 1934\n\nThis is really and essentially in order that my successor, Captain Scott and his wife, may have some sense of comfort. There has been nothing spent on the house by the Department for ten years and the charge is very reasonable.\n\nTrusting the requisition will commend itself to your valuable attention,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. H. Raley\nPRINCIPAL\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6442, file 880-5, part 1)\nOttawa, April 9, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, with reference to painting and redecorating the Principal's residence at the Coqualeetsa Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that Mrs. Raley estimates the cost at $250 or $300. However, I would appreciate your making further enquiries with a view to ascertaining definitely the amount that would be required for this purpose. It should be kept in mind that only the painting and redecorating that is absolutely necessary should be done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. O'H. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster,\nB.C.\nSIR:\n\nI beg to forward you herewith a communication received from Mrs. Raley, wife of the Reverend Doctor Raley, Principal of Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, in which she requests the Department to re-decorate the Principal's residence at the school for the benefit of their successors.\n\nI remember that about ten years ago Doctor Scott had the residence done over for Doctor Raley, but, as I do not know what the obligations of the Department are in connection with this matter, I should be much obliged to receive your instructions so that I may reply to Mrs. Raley.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O'N.

Dasset Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Dasset,\n\nYou know we expect to be withdrawing from Coqualeetza after twenty years. I am interested in your success as regard the Principal's Residence.\n\nThe interior of the house should be done up completely. It requires papering, varnishing and some painting.\n\nI feel it will be quite unfair to the new owner if provision is made for the cost altogether. If not, however, I shall have to wait about two years before I could get anything done at all.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nwas distressing and annoying.\nThroughout the twenty years there has been much work done but at no time a complete renovation.\nI do think it would be good if you to give this matter consideration and try to have some grant made, which would be available as soon as Mr. Scott comes to Coqualeetza, $150 or $200 bright set the place in order.\nI really am writing from a woman's point of view.\n\nYours Sincerely,\nRev.

As you are aware, new authority should have been obtained after April first.

Such supplies must be secured by the Department through the Government Stationery Office, and Mr. Haley should have forwarded a requisition to the Department.

(RG 10, Volume 6442, file 880-5, part 1)\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nMr A.O'N.Daunt,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C., NEW WESTMINSTER\n\nJuly 31, 1934\n\nDear Mr Daunt:\n\nMay I present to you a situation which I feel to be of importance both to the School and the Department as well as to myself.\n\nI refer to the contemplated marriage of Mr P.F.Pirie, our Farm Instructor, of whose work Dr Raley, the retiring Principal speaks in the highest terms. I am trying to get along with as little change in the personnel of the Staff as possible, knowing the efficient and loyal group of workers whom Dr Raley has secured over a period of years. As you may know, Mr Pirie has been with the School as Farm Instructor for the last ten years, having joined the Staff in January 1925. He has proved himself to be a loyal and painstaking employee in his particular department, and is splendid in handling the boys both in the period of their work outside, and during those hours when staff duties bring them under his care. In addition he is the Instructor of the Coqualeetza Cadet Corps, and the leader of our Boy Scouts, and I have been depending upon him for the coming year in all these departments of work.\n\nIt will be difficult, however, to continue him as a member of the Staff unless we have some house accommodation for him. He could not continue, when married, to reside in the School building as he does at present, and it would be difficult for him to carry on his duties and live off the School property.\n\nIf the Department could see its way clear to assist us with a small grant, we could build a suitable cottage, and solve the problem of accommodation for such a worker for the present and also for the future. I understand this matter has been before the Department before, and that at one time a suggestion for a grant upon their part, was forthcoming in an amount greatly exceeding that which I beg liberty to suggest.\n\nI have the figures from a local carpenter who has done a lot of work for the School. He offers to build a six-room cottage by superintending the work of our larger boys, and asks only .40\u00a2 per hour, for a maximum time of four weeks, for his own labour. This would be of great practical benefit to our boys, as Mr Mower, the Carpenter concerned, is a fine workman, thoroughly efficient, and would be able to give them instruction in carpentry which would be of real help to them when they go back to their homes upon Graduation. The estimate includes cost of supplying all materials, and doing all work, inside and out, namely: Cement foundation blocks, Dimension and finishing lumber, doors and windows, hardware, lath and plaster-2 coats, bath rooms complete, chimney-16 feet, and painting inside and out. I feel that both the figure itself, and the idea of using the labor of the boys will appeal to the Department, as it practically means they are supplying materials, and wages only for the superintending carpenter. His figure, by the way for his own work in this connection, was 192 hours at .40\u00a2 making a total of $76.80. Personally, it will mean much to me in my first year of service at Coqualeetza if I were able to continue Mr Pirie happily in his position, and I think the Department would agree with me in the solution of a problem which is bound to recur from time to time.\n\nI trust that you may see your way clear to recommend this expenditure, and trust that, even though the financial stringency makes it necessary to scrutinize each item of expense, the Department may be able to grant the request as above. With all good wishes and hoping for a favorable reply, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPRINCIPAL\nOttawa, August 17, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, enclosing communication received from the Principal of the Coqualeetza Residential School, requesting the Department to assist in the erection of a cottage for the farm instructor at the school.\n\nNo provision was made in the current year's Appropriation for this expenditure, and it is therefore regretted that the Department cannot authorise the erection of the building mentioned.\n\nThe Principal's request will receive further consideration when we are preparing our Estimates for the fiscal year 1935-36.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. O'H. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster,\nB. C.\nSIR:-\n\nI beg to forward you herewith a communication received from Reverend R.C. Scott, Principal of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, in which he requests the Department to assist the School with a grant to build a suitable cottage for the residence of their Farm Instructor, who has recently been married.\n\nThis grant you will perceive, from the detail I have obtained, amounts to $250.00.\n\nYou will note from the letter of the Reverend Principal, that the Department have been considering some such proposition in the past, although we have no record of it here.\n\nIf this matter is in order and in accordance with your policy, I would recommend that it receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.O.W. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncs.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs. (Cont'd.) 2.\n\nI trust that the Department may see its way clear to grant us this equipment, as repairs are out of the question, and there is no use of renewing the furnace and leaving the present arrangement of hot and cold air pipes as it is. The weather is liable to turn cold at any time, and I trust that the Department will give favorable consideration as soon as possible.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.C. Scott,\nPrincipal.\n\nP.S. A Copy of this letter has been forwarded to Mr. Indian Agent Daunt, New Westminster, B.C.\nOttawa, Sept. 25, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the report of the Engineer, Department of Public Works, Victoria, on his inspection, in June, last, of the boilers and machinery at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School. He reports as follows:\n\nBoiler No. 12368 B. C. - The Engineer reports this boiler was found in good condition. He suggests that the fusible plug be renewed and states that two new firebars will be required.\n\nBoiler No. 12369 B. C. - This boiler was found in good condition. The blow-down cock was leaking and will need regrounding. The fusible plug must be renewed.\n\nBoiler No. 42804 B. C. - The Engineer reports that he found all rivets, plates and tubes in good condition. This boiler had been re-tubed since previous inspection, but the tubes were too long and not properly headed and rolled which allowed them to leak at the top plate. Since then he states he has received a letter that they have been rewelded and headed and are now quite tight. However, a new fusible plug is required.\n\nWith reference to the auxiliary machinery, the Engineer states that the whole of this machinery is in very good condition, that new guards have been installed and there was a considerable improvement of the whole plant.\n\nThe Department understands that the certificates of inspection have been forwarded to you; and I would request that you will see that they are posted in a conspicuous place in the boiler-room.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. H. C. Scott, B. A.,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetza Institute,\nSardis, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Inspection of Boilers & Machinery,\nIndian Residential School, Sardis, B.C.\n\nBoiler No. 12369 B.C.\n\nOn June 12th, 1934, I gave this boiler a careful inspection and found it in good condition.\n\nI then gave it a hydrostatic test of 25 lbs. and found it quite tight. I set the safety valves to blow off at 10 lbs. water pressure. The fusible plug is to be renewed. The steam gauge is correct. Two new firebars will be required.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure of 10 lbs. and condition good.\n\nBoiler No. 12358 B.C.\n\nOn the same date I gave this boiler a similar inspection and found it in similar condition as Boiler No. 12369.\n\nI gave it a hydrostatic test of 25 lbs. and found it perfectly tight, except the blow-down cock which was leaking slightly and will need regrinding.\n\nI set the safety valves to blow off at 10 lbs. water pressure. The steam gauge is correct. The fusible plug must be renewed.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure of 10 lbs. and condition good.\n\nBoiler No. 42804 B.C.\n\nOn the same date I gave this boiler a similar inspection and found all rivets, plates and tubes in good condition.\n\nThis boiler has been retubed since my last inspection but the tubes are too long and not properly beaded and rolled which allowed them to leak at the top plate, so I could not give it a hydrostatic test. Since then I have received a letter stating that they have been rerolled and beaded and they are quite tight.\nBoiler No. 43804 B.C. (Cont'd).\n\nThe steam gauge is 10 lbs. light. A new fusible plug is required. The safety valve works freely.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure of 130 lbs. and condition good.\n\nWhilst I was there my attention was called to the large amount of fuel which was being used. There are two methods to partly remedy it without installing new boilers; that is to install new electric driven condensation pumps on the very flat returns and to install some type of underfeed automatic stokers where a cheaper grade of coal could be used and a much more efficient and economical operation of the plant acquired.\n\nAuxiliary Machinery.\n\nThe whole of the machinery is in very good condition. New guards have been installed and a considerable improvement of the whole plant is apparent.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT. J. Arnall\nE.S.

NEW WESTMINSTER\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn order to provide room for our boy pupils this year, we are using a Dormitory in the Manual Training building. This adds urgency to the need of proper heating in that building. The instructor informs me that last year the heating was very inadequate and the classes in Motor Mechanics were scarcely able at times, to continue, because of the cold, and the smoke which poured up out of the register. On investigation I found that the furnace was beyond repair.\n\nI had Messrs Parquharson & Eckel Ltd., who installed it, come in and look it over and they reported that it was not worth repairing. I do not feel that this firm gave us a satisfactory job in the first place, because we found the check, which should have been installed on the smoke pipe, lying under the furnace, never having been put in place at all. The cold air leads were quite inadequate, and two of them were brought down out of the one conduit. This made a vicious circle from the furnace up through the conduit and back, so that no fresh air was drawn in, and I feel it was a potent factor in the breaking down of the furnace, as well as rendering it inefficient when in operation. There was no cold air conduit taken off the Manual Training room whatever, and neither hot air or cold air pipes to the Dormitory above it. Heat for this latter had been supplied by use of a stove; I do not feel that this is adequate or safe in a Dormitory like this.\n\nI have had an estimate from Mr. Pooke of Chilliwack, who, I believe has done Government work before, and he will undertake to run hot air pipes through to the Dormitory, and take off cold air pipes from both the Dormitory and the Manual Training room. He will also rectify the vicious circle, mentioned previously, and see to it that the supply of cold air is adequate. He will do all this work, supplying the material, in addition to installing the furnace, for the sum of $115.00. The cheapest way to renew the furnace, which was thoroughly burned out, is to install a similar one, since we would not need to buy casings, or anything more than the bare furnace body itself. This can be done for $25.00. For the sum of $200.00, then, we can install an adequate heating equipment in the Manual Training building, which will take care of the class rooms used for Manual Training, Motor Mechanics and Boat Building, as well as the Dormitory above.\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nto\n\nCougaleetza Residential School,\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nVOUCHER, IN QUADRUPLECTS, FOR THE EXPENDITURE IN CONNECTION WITH REPAIRS (FIRE EQUIPMENT) AT COUGALEETZA INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, SARDIS, B.C.

C. Scott, the Principal of the Coqualeetza Residential School, in which he expresses real distress because of the damage done to the school property and out-buildings by the recent severe ice and rain storm. Is there likely to be any balance to the credit of your Department in the 1934-35 appropriations out of which a sum of money could be granted to Captain Scott for the making of these repairs? Otherwise, it looks as if the Department will have to face a very substantial outlay for repairs during 1935-36.\n\nI realize that the Department has been very fair in its treatment of Coqualeetza, but none of us could foresee the tremendous damage which was to be inflicted upon the whole Fraser Valley by the recent unprecedented storm, and I know that if there is any way in which you can divert five or six hundred dollars to help make good these losses, you will give the request every consideration.\n\nI am hoping that Captain Scott will be in Toronto towards the end of April and that I shall be able to bring him to Ottawa for at least a day, in order that he may meet Dr. McGill and the other members of the Department staff.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKJB.MT\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nFebruary 28, 1935.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Can.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st, Numbered 153-0-5, enclosing accounts for Stanley Brock Limited and Pilkington Brothers.\n\nI am quite at a loss to understand why these accounts were sent, as Stanley Brock Limited account was paid by us early this month. I am taking the matter up with them. Regarding the glass for Pilkington Brothers, it was due to misunderstanding that they sent the account to you. I instructed them to make this particular account out in quadruplicate and send it on to me for endorsement. All glass for repairs, is paid out of school funds, but this particular shipment was for use in the building of the boat, which was authorized by the Department. I regret that Pilkington Brothers misunderstood my instructions, as these accounts are forwarded through Mr. Daunt, Indian Agent, in the regular way. I shall advise them.\n\nHoping this is satisfactory, I am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. C.

(RG 10, Volume 6442, file 880-5, part 1)\nOttawa, April 25, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th ultimo, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, enumerating the repairs and alterations to the various buildings, which he wishes carried out during the coming summer.\n\nThe Rev. Principal visited the Department yesterday, and this matter was discussed with him. The sum of $1,200.00 only is provided in our Estimates for the current fiscal year for repairs, alterations, painting, etc., at this school. The sum of $300.00 has been authorized to carry out repairs occasioned by an ice and rain storm last winter. This would leave approximately $900 still available.\n\nBefore the Department can deal intelligently with this matter, I have to request that, after consulting the Principal, you will state definitely, in order of importance, the repairs, etc., that you would recommend be carried out, to an amount not exceeding the sum available, as mentioned above. It will be necessary, also, to give an estimate of the cost and state what, if any, outside labour would be required and the approximate cost. It is understood that the boys, under the oversight of the manual training instructor, would be able to perform the greater part of the work.\n\nThe Principal was authorized to undertake the work of remodelling the pantries of the kitchen in the basement and to purchase two stoves. He estimated the total cost to be $250. This expenditure will be over and above the amount mentioned as being available for further repairs.\n\nThe Department will arrange, also, to supply a quantity of linoleum for the upper halls and landings of the main building and to purchase a new cylinder for the washing machine.\n\nPlease give the information requested, as soon as possible, when the necessary authority for incurring the expenditure, etc., will be obtained from the Honourable the Superintendent General.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

C.\nstores and\nsomething pantry\nRelish in town\n$250.00\n\nPerfume and soap\nOttawa, March 19, 1885.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, enclosing communication received from the Principal of the Coolaestza Residential School, with reference to certain repairs and alterations which, he states, are required.\n\nFor your information, I may say that, in our Appropriation for the fiscal year 1885-86, provision has been made for the sum of $325, to cover the cost of the erection of a cottage for the farmer, and also $375, for miscellaneous repairs. With reference to the latter amount, I would refer you to official letter of the 16th instant, in which you were informed that $300 of it could be used for repairs to the outbuildings which were damaged by storms during the past winter.\n\nIt is expected that the Principal will visit the Department about the end of next month, and one of the officers of the Schools Branch expects to visit this school in June. Under these circumstances, the Principal's request can be left in abeyance for the time being.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster,\nB. C.\nSIR:\n\nI beg to forward you herewith, a letter addressed to the Department, brought in today by the Reverend Mr. R.C. Scott, Principal of Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, in which he points out many repairs and alterations which he wishes attended to at that Institution.\n\nEstimates of most of these expenses are given, and total approximately $2,700.00, so that including work not estimated for, an outlay of about $3,000.00 is indicated.\n\nIn view of the large sum involved, I hesitate to make any recommendation and am forwarding the letter as it stands for the general consideration of the Department.\n\nThe following brief comments however are, I think, in order:\n\nThe Linoleum generally is in very bad condition, being badly chipped and worn away in many places.\n\nThe windows are draughty and the sashes do not appear to set properly in the brickwork.\n\nThe composite floors in many places in the corridors and play rooms have broken up and certainly need patching. This also applies to the walls in the Junior Boys' room, where the wire netting on which the plaster is set, has also been broken. It is a question here, whether wooden wainscoting would not be more serviceable than the plaster.\n\nThe waste-pipe from the Senior Boys' lavatory has damaged the ceiling of the Senior Boys' class-room by leaking. Both leak and ceiling should certainly be attended to as soon as possible.\n\nMain Roof repairs should, if possible, be attended to, so that possible leaks be averted, and the moss removed, thereby preventing fire hazard. The Shingles should be stained to prevent decay.\n\nIn connection with the electric lighting etc., the repairs indicated should be carried out. I do not like the idea of a high voltage wire crossing the girls' play ground, and this should be eliminated.\n\nThe items, repairs to Heating System, Laundry Room, window screens, dairy wash-room and Farmer's cottage, total a considerable amount, and while no doubt of advantage to the School, do not appear to be as urgent as other repairs.\n\nI would suggest that the Department after perusing the letter, inform me what sum will be available for repairs,\n\nENCL.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\nto this School after the 1st of April, when I can take\nthe matter up with the Reverend Principal, and decide\nwhat estimates in this connection may be submitted for\nyour final approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.N. Daunt.\nIndian Agent.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS:\n\nI beg to apply for the following repairs to Coqualeetza Residential School. In doing so I would point out that the Main Building has been in use for eleven years and has reached the time when repairs are necessary. In addition, the extreme weather conditions and the ice storm in which it culminated, have rendered certain of the repairs, herein set forth, vitally necessary.\n\nA. IN THE MAIN BUILDING:\n\n1. Renew Linoleum in halls throughout. The linoleum has \"perished\" and has become brittle. It is ragged and broken. Not having been cemented down it allows dust and small gravel to get underneath. Recently we had to have it nailed down along both edges for the extreme length of the corridor of the Main floor, as the children were tripping over its broken and curled up edges. Estimate attached. \"B\" quality would be less expensive and might last a good while if rightly laid.\n\n2. Windows: The frames seem to have shrunk away from the sides of the opening, so that when the East wind blows it is impossible to heat the front of the building. The wind blew through around the sash and behind the casings and it will be necessary to have the latter taken off and the space between the frames and the brick filled with some liquid preparation, which will harden. The casings could then be replaced. This should be done, preferably, during the summer vacation. For days at a time, we had to nail blankets over the windows to try and keep out the cold. Even then, with both furnaces going, we had to dismiss the Primary Room the day Inspector Barry was here. The Dormitories were not warm and the Infirmary was cold; it was hard to see sick children in a room so cold, they had to be covered up in bed and electric lights on all day because all windows were covered with blankets. I trust this may be rectified.\n\n3. Repairs to Heating System: Under advice from a Government Heating Inspector, our engineer informs me that an electric vacuum pump installed on the return line, near the furnace would greatly increase the efficiency of our heating system. The size of the Return pipe is too small and condensation takes place, pockets are formed and it is impossible to force steam through some radiators. Results - extreme fuel consumption-cold-and in some instances frozen radiators. Estimated cost of Pump installed not over $250.00\n\n4. LAUNDRY ROOM: New cylinder for washing machine; the present one will not last much longer. Estimated cost, $125.00. A new and larger \"Thor\" Ironing Mangle, the present one is very inadequate.\n\nRemove Electric Motor from ceiling and hang it on wall above washing machine. Bearings are constantly burning out and it is impossible to lubricate them properly with the motor in its present position. A new 3 Phase Motor, installed as suggested would be much the better unit, as compared with the present single phase one.\n\nA drying room is urgently needed and could be economically built into the end of the Laundry Room. This would lessen the work now laid upon the girls, shorten their hours of labor, reduce fuel consumption, and give room for other purposes, now taken up by improvised clothes drying racks. Steam heat is conveniently available. Cost of material the main one.\nBURRITT BROS.\nCarpet and Linoleum Layers\nRepairing and making over by thoroughly practical experts. + + + ORIENTAL RUGS A SPECIALTY\nRear of 570 Hornby Street\nVANCOUVER, B.C., March 5th, 1935.\n\nRev. R. C. Scott, B.A.,\nPrincipal, Coqualeetza Residential School,\nSardis, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe have gone carefully over the halls and landings and find that you will require 232 sq. yds. of linoleum to renew the runners and cover the landings.\n\nWe would recommend A quality, brown, as per sample for quality and color. We recommend that the goods be given a coat of special linoleum varnish in the factory in Montreal, and that we cut and cement down the linoleum and then put on an oak molding as pr. sample. In this way you will have a good looking and finished job.\n\nThis would come to\n\nA Quality 232 yds. $2.16 $501.12\n\nor if we laid the same quality without the varnish and without molding, the order would come to 232 yds. $1.90 $440.80\n\nWe are,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nBURRITT BROS.\n\nPer Edmund Burritt\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6442, file 880-5, part 1)\n(a) Kitchen: Rebuild one kitchen table and cover it with zinc.\n\n(b) Renew zinc covering on Serving Table between kitchen and serving pantry. Cost $7.60.\n\n6. Basement: Boys' Side\n\n(a) Repairs to floors in corridors and Play Rooms.\n\n(b) Renew plaster and put on wainscoting in Junior Boys lavatory. There are large holes in the walls. Renew baseboards.\n\n(c) Renew plaster on broken places in walls in hallways.\n\n7. Ground Floor:\n\n(a) Repair or renew ceiling in Senior Class Room, now rusted through by leak from No. 2 Boys' Lavatory.\n\n8. First Floor:\n\n(a) Renew floors in Boys' Lavatory, No. 2, over Senior Class Room. Composite covering very badly broken-wooden floor exposed.\n\n(b) Overhaul waste pipe leaving Basins. Water runs back and comes up through vent in floor and leaks down into Senior Class Room. Ceiling rusted through-unwighty and unsanitary.\n\n(c) Paint Infirmary - Boys' and Girls' sides. Estimated cost, two coat work, $50.00.\n\n(d) Remove \"slop\" sink from main kitchen, and install same in Infirmary Kitchen. Extend hot and cold water and waste pipes to connect with same. Estimated cost, $45.00. Very essential, as Infirmary has no sink and all water has to be carried up from the basement for washing dishes and carried down to Main Kitchen to be emptied out.\n\nB. OUTSIDE THE MAIN BUILDING:\n\n1. Roofs:\n\n(a) Roof over Laundry and Kitchen needs to be renewed. Tar and sand might repair it for a time, but the roofing itself is in poor shape.\n\n(b) The roof of the Main Building needs to be scraped, to remove the moss and then be stained. The moss creates a fire hazard in dry weather and stain applied now, will insure several years life to the shingles. Approximate cost $65.00.\n\n(c) Window screens on all lower windows of Main Building need new wire. Many frames need repair.\n\n(d) Small building to be attached at wall of cow stable to provide a wash room for the boys before milking, a place for their clothes and milking things. This is very important in view of the conditions of the milk marketing Act, to which we must conform or lose the best price for our milk, sold during Spring and holiday months. It is also, decidedly in the interests of cleanliness and health during the school year. Space for cooling milk would also be provided, by cement trough, and milk for sale would be kept in it until cooled.\nEstimated cost of Wash Room and Dairy:\n\n- 30 Bags, Cement $30.00\n- 6 Loads, Gravel $7.50\n- Lumber $65.00\n- Hardware $5.00\n- Water Pipes $3.00\n- Labor/Overseer Carpenters $32.00 (10 Days)\n  (All other labor to be done by the school)\n- Paint $6.00\n\nTotal: $148.50\n\nPainting:\n\nAll roofs, especially that of the Main Building and of the Principal's Residence should be scraped clean of moss and treated with a stain of some kind to preserve the shingles and prevent growth of moss. During the warm summer months this moss increases the fire hazard, on the Main Building, especially.\n\nEstimates of Cost as follows:\n\n**MAIN BUILDING:**\n- Roof - remove moss and apply stain $85.00\n- Paint walls and trim - one coat $150.00\n\n**MANUAL TRAINING EDLG:**\n- Roof - remove moss and apply stain $16.50\n- Paint walls and trim - one coat $52.50\n\n**BIG BARN:**\n- Roof - remove moss and apply stain $17.00\n- Paint walls and trim - one coat $71.00\n\n**SMALL BARN:**\n- Roof - remove moss and apply stain $10.00\n- Paint walls and trim - one coat $35.00\n\n**PIG PEN:**\n- Roof - remove moss and apply stain $8.00\n- Paint walls and trim - one coat $31.50\n\n**TWO OUTSIDE DORMITORIES:**\n- Roof - remove moss and apply stain $5.00\n- Paint walls and trim - one coat $44.00\n\n**TWO COTTAGES:**\n- Roof - remove moss and apply stain $15.00\n- Paint walls and trim - one coat $55.00\n\n**1 TOOL SHED & 1 CHICKEN HOUSE:**\n- Roofs - remove moss and apply stain $6.00\n- Paint walls and trim - one coat $29.20\n\n**PRINCIPAL'S HOUSE:**\n- Roof - remove moss and apply stain $15.00\n- Paint walls and trim - one coat $50.00\n\nIf only part of this work can be done, I would suggest that the roof of the Main Building be done, as it is very necessary. Then the Manual Training Building, roof, at least and the walls, and following this, the Principal's House, roof; then walls of the Main Building and of the Principal's House. The barn and out buildings could be done later.\nWoodshed:\n\nA lean-to woodshed, attached to the old barn collapsed under the weight of snow during the storm in January. It needs rebuilding badly as there is no storage room for dry wood and in winter time the boiler room is used at times, something which ought not to be, but under the circumstances has to be resorted to. This new woodshed would give storage room for 50 cords of wood, and provide a place for the boys to cut and split wood during wet weather. This has to be done at present, outside, and in bad weather cannot be carried on at all. The motor and circular saw are being installed in the old barn alongside the proposed shed.\n\nESTIMATE:\n- Lumber - 4380 Ft. @ $14.00 = $61.32\n- Shingles - 7\u00bd M @ 2.25 = $17.00\n- Nails = $4.70\n- Labor (Supervising Carpenter only) = $19.20\n\nSize of Shed - 45' X 18'\nHeight of back wall - 8'\nWall at Barn - 16'\n(As per Sketch)\n\n$102.22\n\nElectric Lighting:\n\nCertain repairs were necessary even before the ice storm. The pole upon which the transformers are placed is unsafe. There is little doubt at all that kept it from falling during the ice storm was the heavy iron conduit down one side into the ground. The cross arm to which the transformers are attached, is loosened away from the pole, and the bolts have been pulled into the wood. The B.E. Electric Co. advised moving the transformer back beyond the edge of the girls' playground owing to high voltage wires crossing same. As the pole carries, at least, 700 pounds weight and has to be renewed anyway, the only cost to the school would be the extra heavy wire necessary to carry the low voltage across the playground and into the building, plus the new pole. The company will undertake the actual work of moving the transformers. ESTIMATED COST - labor and materials, to school $125.00.\n\nIn addition to the above all electric light wires were carried down in the recent storm and had to be replaced. This being necessary, two of the poles which were out of line were moved into line, resulting in a much stronger and better looking job.\n\nThe motor for cutting wood, which has up to now, been hung in the large barn, with considerable fire hazard, owing to dust and chaff, I have moved to the floor of the shop contiguous to the new wood workshop. This will allow a roomy and dry place, affording good footing to the boys during wood cutting, as compared with the old position, where the saw was outside, the ground uneven and often muddy and slippery. The saw has been placed upon new timbers and we have now, a much safer unit for the boys to work with. The only cost to the school will be the few yards of extra wire and the time spent in moving and setting up the motor. All other work has been done by the boys under supervision of Staff members.\nFire Equipment:\n\nAll large fire extinguishers have been refilled at a cost of $43.20. Five extra fire lanterns have been provided and two extra fire axes, all of which have been placed in glass fronted cabinets at a cost of $25.45 for labor and materials. I would strongly advocate the provision of two sets of iron steps to be placed on low wheels on the lowest landing platform of fire escapes at the rear of the school on both boys and girls sides. This would more than double the efficiency of present escapes, and it would make possible a continuous exit. At present the delay is caused by pupils having to go down through the opening in this lower platform by a ladder attached to the wall. I am quite sure this affords possibility for tragedy in case of fire.\n\nOn Route No. 1, down the stairway and out the front door we can empty the building in three minutes, but down the above fire escapes it took the boys 9 minutes and the girls 13 minutes owing to the congestion, caused as above. I have plans drawn for this suggested improvement, but have not yet been able to get estimates as I have not been able to locate a firm doing this sort of work.\n\nFarmer's Cottage:\n\nI beg to re-submit estimates for a farmer's cottage as contained in my letter to Mr. Indian Agent Daunt, under date of August 6, 1934, at $820.00.\n\nAs an alternative we have a cottage which, last year, was moved, at school expense and might be re-conditioned for a farmer's residence. It would need re-plastering in some rooms; re-papering, painting inside and out, verandah and roof and chimney repairs. Water laid from barn across to cottage, with sink and bathroom installed. Estimated cost $475.00.\n\nBridge:\n\nThe Bridge over the Lukakuk has sunk down on one side at the west end owing to embankment being undermined by the recent freshet. This resulted in one of the cement pillars being pushed away, out of position, allowing bridge to sag. As this bridge is on the Main Road between the Barns and the back farm and all farm traffic passes over it, I am having it repaired at once. Estimated Cost - Replace cement pillar - Jack up Bridge and repair abutment and under structure. $25.00\n\nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED:\n\nPRINCIPAL.\nLetter No. 3-8-5\n\nOffice of New Westminster Indian Agency,\n\nApril 5th, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 1136, amounting to $45.20 in favour of Reverend R.C.

The delay was occasioned, largely because two of the containers which they forwarded were damaged and had leaked out, and I had to send them back again for others to take their place.\n\nThe last time they were re-filled was in January 1932, so you can see there was need for the re-charging.\n\nSIGNED:\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

You will notice that this is one of the items listed therein. I sent the invoice to the company, asking them to return it to me, receipted, but apparently they went ahead on their own account and sent the invoice to Ottawa for payment. Perhaps they have been in the habit of doing this.\n\nI was not sure that this is one of the items which the Department would reimburse us for, consequently I was holding it over, as I thought. However, I am enclosing the invoice in quadruplicate, herewith, and I would certainly appreciate it very much if you feel that you can recommend it for payment.\n\nThanking you for your interest in the school, I am,\n\nYours sincerely\n\nR.

Mueller Marine Type Closet flush Valves with push button and tail piece @ $10.40 each. sales tax included. $93.60\n\n(As the floors in #2 and 3 Lavatories have been renewed and it was decided that the acid from urine on the floors was largely responsible for the destruction of the previous floors, I trust that the Department will sanction the installation of these urinals. If it is impossible to do the whole job, then I would suggest that the two #12, 3 stall urinals be put in the basement lavatories, and one each in #2 & 3 lavatories upstairs. The installation of the Mueller Valves will do away with the inconvenience and the unsanitary conditions resulting from the poor functioning of the present automatic system of toilet flushing.)\n\n6. To take down and remove transformers from pole outside the Laundry building, to a pole just beyond the girls' playground, estimated cost. $125.00\n\n(This work is absolutely necessary as the cross arm from which the transformers are hung, has pulled away from the pole. The pole, itself, is rotted at the ground and has to be renewed. The cost, as above, is made up of $114.00 for heavy wire to bring the low voltage current in across the girls' playground from the new location of the Transformers and the remaining $11.00 is for labor. When repairing damage from the ice storm of last winter, I had preparatory work done, which accounts for the low labor cost in this estimate. Locating the Transformers as suggested above will remove the danger from high tension wires crossing the girls' playground.)\n\n7. To renew waste pipe in basement lavatories on boys' side from basins to drain, with all connections and labor for same, $18.75. $18.75\n\n8. To building fire wall in the furnaces and cutting clean-out ports in back lower wall, as advised by Mr. Arnould. $25.00\n\n(This change was also suggested by the combustion engineer of the Canadian Collieries and is absolutely essential, if we would increase the efficiency of the furnaces and at the same time save our fuel costs.)\n\nLAUNDRY:\n\n1.

As the total amount was $68.68 there will be $6.30 remaining and coming to the school. As the invoice for the brass was addressed to the school, I have paid it and enclose invoices in quadruplicate. The invoice for the linoleum...\nI have endorsed, and it can be paid to Alexander Murray Co. direct. I beg to say that I have covered the tables with the linoleum and have had the brass cut into strips and bent at right angles. This makes a strong, neat looking job. I have had two coats of flat white paint applied and am giving it final coat of quick drying enamel. In addition, I have had the walls of the dining room re-painted a lighter color and the total result is most pleasing.\n\nAs the above figures, with the exception of the balance of $6.32, are for brass and linoleum only and the school has had to pay for cutting and bending of these strips, soldering of joints and corners, in addition to all painting, the total cost will amount to at least $100.00. If there is any possibility of securing this by the increasing of the authorized expenditure, I would appreciate it very much.\n\n(If you cannot have these authorized at present, kindly have them put on the 1936 estimates, as I am not including them in my report to Mr. Daunt.)\n\nR.C.

Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nJuly 6, 1935\n\nMr. A. O'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Daunt:\n\nI have been wrestling with the matter of repairs to the school building for some time. It has been very difficult to get estimates for the various jobs and has taken much more time than I would have thought possible. There are some I shall just have to let go, after waiting more than two weeks for figures from the parties concerned. I shall have to submit alternative plans, as, if the Department persists in allowing only $900.00 of the $1200.00, it will be quite impossible to have all that really ought to be done, attended to. I shall list only those which are essential and beg to submit the following:\n\n1. (a) Take off present San-san on two boys' playrooms and one boys' cloakroom in basement and re-lay with cement and sand.\n\n(b) Take off present San-san and re-lay with San-san, floors in #2 & #3 Boys' Lavatories.\n\n(c) Patch two girls' playrooms and passage way with San-san.\n\nTOTAL cost of above --------- $ 665.00\n\n2. Renew walls in basement lavatory and patch walls in boys' cloakroom and in hallway in basement. Build up from floor with sheer cement instead of present baseboard finish in basement lavatories and lavatories #2 & #3 on boys' side.\n\nTOTAL cost of above --------- $ 60.00\n\n3. Take out wash basins and toilets in lavatories #2 & #3 on boys' side to enable contractor to lay floors with San-san. Install and raise all connections to waste pipes, toilets and baths above new flooring.\n\nTOTAL cost of above --------- $ 60.00\n\n4. Renew materials for waste pipe to lavatory, basement, boys' side, using galvanized iron piping and re-connect same.\n\nTOTAL cost for materials and labor --------- $ 18.75\n\n5. Construct hood over kitchen stove and carry outlet through the roof and into stack, of galvanized iron, at least 25' high, to insure draft.\n\nTOTAL cost of above --------- $ 60.00\n\n6. Removal of slop sink from kitchen and install same in infirmary kitchen. Extend hot and cold water pipes and connect waste pipe with same.\n\nTOTAL COST of above --------- $ 45.00\n\n7. Scrap moss from roof of main Building and stain same.\n\nTOTAL cost of above --------- $ 85.00\n8. (a) Renew roof over laundry with traffic deck built up of one ply heavy base sheet, nailed to boards. Then mop solid, two layers of asphalt felt on top using 170 degrees melting point asphalt and a heavy mopping of same materials on top. Renew sump in roof also counter flashings at walls, and flashings over division walls.\n\n(b) Repair weak spots and recut roof over kitchen. Install new water hoppers through wall, and head outside of wall.\n\nTotal cost for (a) and (b) $150.00\n\n9. The total of above repairs amounts to $1,143.55 so I have been again in touch with the contractor for the floor job and have asked him to tender only on renewing floors in the Boys' cloakroom, renewing floors in no's 2 and 3 Lavatories on the Boys' side, and patching floor in Junior girls' playroom with San-San and the price for this will amount to --------------$358.00. This will leave the floors in the boys' playrooms for another year, but it seems the best thing to do under the circumstances. Recapitulating then, we have:\n\nNew figure for repairs to floors - $358.00\nCost for walls as in 2-6-60.00\n\" for remove plumbing fixtures-3-60.00\n\" \" renew plumbing, basement boys' lavatories, as in -4-18.75\n\" \" Bond over kitchen store as in -6-60.00\n\" \" Remove slop sink etc as in -6-45.00\n\" \" Surfaces roof, main building as in -7-85.00\n\" \" Renew roof over laundry etc as in -8-150.00\n\nTotal for repairs as per new figure- $836.75\n\nBalance of $900.00 grant for repairs to be used to redecorated dormitories and class rooms etc $63.25 $900.00\n\nI may say that the above repairs are absolutely necessary to my mind. There is a regular flood of water coming down the rear wall of the laundry during a heavy rain, and the roof over the kitchen will not last much longer without extensive repairs or renewal. This list, even if granted by the Department will leave several items to be cared for by the School such as taking off window casings and caulking space between them and the brick wall, and the above figure for redecorating will not much more than cover the cost of materials\u2014 if it does that. I regret that this matter has dragged into July, but it has really been considerable trouble to get these figures. Some that I have asked for weeks ago, I have not received yet, as for instance estimate for recaulking windows. In view of the conditions during the winter, I thought it would be an attempt to take care of this item by making our boat builder being able to stop water entering so well as he does. I think he will make a good attempt at stopping the entrance of these cold winds.\n\nI trust that you will be able to approve these estimates and to forward them to the Department so that we may undertake the work during the holidays. I shall of course, submit exact accounts in quadruplicate for each of the above repair jobs, the total not to exceed the figures as given above.\n\nI hope to be passing through New Westminster\u2014 perhaps on Tuesday of this week and shall call to see you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I had our Boat Builder take off all window casings on the inside and fit in pieces of wood and then smear the whole of these joints with liquid asphaltum. This ought to help, but an expert, who has done many schools declares that it will not keep the wind out. I have had one window caulked with the material listed above, forced in by a gun and the maker guarantees a permanent, air-tight job. As the cost is relatively small I trust the Department will authorize this expenditure in order that we may have the advantage for the coming winter.)\n\n5.

(RG 10, Volume 6442, file 880-5, part 1)\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nAugust 26, 1935.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI am enclosing, herewith, estimates of repairs, which we discussed during your visit to Coqualeetza last month.\n\nI am sorry to be a bit late in sending it in, but it has been an almost interminable job, between finding the best methods and materials and waiting for estimates and then having them revised or re-submitted. As stated on the Repair Sheet, the floors in #2 & 3, boys' lavatories have been renewed with San san, and I have no doubt that the installation of the proposed urinals will safeguard them greatly. I have had these floors treated with raw linseed oil and am taking every precaution to make the job lasting and satisfactory.\n\nI do not know whether you will be able to increase your suggested expenditure for the dining room, but as intimated in the estimates, the cost to the school will be at least $100.00. In addition to this, there will be the extra cost above the amount allowed by the Department for kalsomining, which the school will have to absorb. Then we shall also have to face the cost of laying the linoleum and a good many other items which mean that the school will be carrying its full share of repairs. I have gone very thoroughly into the matter of the improvement of our toilet system and am convinced that some such equipment as these Mueller Valves will have to be installed. They are the most fool-proof and simple of all equipment I have seen.\n\nI want to thank you most heartily for that authorization of $75.00 and only wish you could see the transformation it has worked in the dining room. Any consideration you may be able to give to my suggestion in the estimates now submitted will be deeply appreciated.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. C. SCOTT,\nPrincipal.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nAugust 29, 1935.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nDay before yesterday, I handed to Mr. Daunt, a list of estimates for repairs, and included equipment for the year, 1936. This included estimate for refrigeration plant by Marshall-Wells, B.C. Ltd., which amounted to $852.00 complete.\n\nIt is a job, similar to the one done at Alert Bay, by this firm recently, only somewhat smaller. I am at present negotiating, through Mr. Daunt's office for a supply of dried salmon.\n\nWe find that the smoked fish, which we get from Westminster Distributors, is not relished by the children, in fact a very great deal of it is left on the plates and wasted, and some of it, I know, has not been very palatable. I think Mr. Anfield has found that the native cured fish has a decided advantage as food for these children. If I am successful in getting a supply of it, I will need cold storage for it. Then there is the matter of the care of our milk, which has always been a source of concern to me. We have a dairy drain in the space allotted at present and it is exceedingly difficult to keep it clean and sweet. If we had a Refrigeration plant such as proposed, it would be wonderful for the school and I am quite sure, would pay for itself in saving of food and betterment in the quality of the meals.\n\nIf we decide to put in the dividing wall, in order that we might take care of fish in a separate place from the other food, it would mean an additional $76.00 to the price above quoted. This, however, is just about the same as that submitted by McLennan, McFeely & Prior Ltd., although their box is 2' shorter. We stand to save over $100.00 for the price of the Marshall-Wells, through doing the carpenter work ourselves and this is a consideration. I would be glad, however, to have either one, if the Department saw fit to install it, but it looks as though the Marshall-Wells one would be a little more economical.\n\nI am writing you because I included this in the estimates for next year and if there is any possibility of our getting it in this year, I would certainly appreciate it if you were to help in any way to that end. With all good wishes and thanking you for your interest in the school, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. C.

This would also apply to the other requests involving expenditures as cited by the Inspector.\n\nAs the curricula of the School, as well as arrangements for the medical treatment of pupils, are directed from Ottawa, I can make no suitable comment upon the observations of the Inspector. I would suggest, however, that the Inspector of Indian Schools be consulted should the Department desire advice in regard to the matter cited by Inspector Pragnell.\nOttawa, December 7, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Cogalastna Indian Residential School, reporting the breakdown of the cylinder and case of the washing machine in the school laundry and stating the new parts required in placing the washing machine in good condition and the cost of same.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure, not exceeding the sum of $255.00, in supplying the new parts required and the freight charges on same. The Principal or yourself may therefore place an order with Stanley Brock, Limited, for the supplying of a new cylinder complete without the metal trimmings, and also the outer case woodwork. An account, in triplicate, should be obtained, covering the new parts, with a receipt for the freight charges. This account, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nThe Department will have no funds to purchase a new washer for this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Phelan, when he visited the School, and it was then agreed to make an attempt to carry on for the balance of the year. From the attached report, however, it seems very doubtful if this can be done and as a complete breakdown would be disastrous, I would recommend that if it is at all possible, a new cylinder and case be obtained without delay. The quotation for these, as given by Messrs. Stanley Brock Limited, is $143.50, to which would have to be added $85.00 freight from Toronto to Chilliwack, or $200.00 in all.\n\nKindly advise me at your earliest convenience what action may be taken in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.O.M.

Daunt,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Danny:\n\nRE: NEW LAUNDRY CYLINDER & CASE.\n\nI regret to inform you that our Washing Machine has gone completely out of business. Strangely enough, it is not the end of the cylinder which we expected would go, but the other end, at the left hand side, as you face the machine.\n\nWe tested this end last summer, when Mr. Hutchinson, of the Canadian Laundry Machinery Company was here and decided it would have to be the end on the right hand side which would have to be renewed. I presume the machine had been standing for 4 or 5 weeks and had got thoroughly dried out and had hardened up, which would account for our not realizing the state it was in. Last week, however, it gave out entirely. The wood along the seams in the end is thoroughly rotten. I had to make some sort of shift in order to get along and had our Boat Builder build in a new end, which we have bolted through the old one and have also spiked through the casing. We are getting along after a fashion, but this new end is so heavy, that it throws the cylinder out of balance and increases the load on the gears and the motor and I am in fear and trembling lest we have a mechanical breakdown. We get along by putting in a very light load of washing, and this, of course, means that the laundry is kept working for a much longer period than would otherwise be necessary and interferes seriously with the carrying out of our work time table.\n\nIf you will refer to the Repair Sheet which I sent in last August, you will note that under the Laundry I asked for one new cylinder for the washing machine at a price of $82.00 F.O.B. Vancouver, if made there. I have talked this over with Stanley Brock Limited, and their advice is that we secure a new cylinder and a new case from the Factory in Toronto. The cost for the new cylinder complete, without the metal trimmings, would be $73.00. The outer case, woodwork only, would cost $70.50. The approximate freight on these parts from Toronto to Chilliwack would be $56.50. This is all in accordance with the estimate which I received from Stanley Brock last September. These prices, of course, mean that we would use all our own trimmings, to be taken from the present cylinder. In conversation with Mr. Nowat, representative of the Canadian Laundry Machinery Company, in the Offices of Stanley Brock Ltd., last week, I was informed that the life of one of these cylinders is 5 years. As this present one has...\nbeen in operation continuously for the last 10 or 12 years, you can see that it owes us nothing.\n\nI trust that the Department will authorize the expenditure for the new cylinder and new outer case immediately, as we cannot get along the way we are and it is impossible to finance sending laundry for an Institution like this, to outside concerns. If the machine gives out again, I do not know what we can do and hope that the Department will deal with this with all possible expedition. The main bearings will also have to be renewed. Referring again to my Repair Sheet of last August, there was an item of $15.00 included. There seems to be a discrepancy between the figures as given in my Repair Sheet of August, as compared with the ones I have set down in this letter, but these latter figures, I am quoting from a letter of Stanley Brock Limited, under date of September 21st, over the signature of Mr. D. J. Hutchinson.\n\nThanking you for your kind assistance in this urgent matter, I am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. C. SCOTT,\nPrincipal.\n\nP.S. I have also received a figure on a Champion Cascade Washer, of a size to do the work of our present Globe Wood Washer. It is composed of monel metal and practically without wear in continual service. Some of these machines have been in use in big city laundries, for 10 years or more and do not show any appreciable signs of wear. The cost, I fear, however, is prohibitive, namely $2,440.00 F.O.B. Toronto.\n\nR.C.S.\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nNovember 14th,\n1935.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nI am enclosing part of the correspondence which has taken place between this office and Captain R. C. Scott, the Principal of Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, concerning a bill presented by the British Columbia Electric Railway Co. on July 12th. Will you please be good enough to go through this and discuss it with Dr. McGill and your Solicitor in the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nIt will not be necessary to acknowledge this communication, as I expect to be in Ottawa for a couple of days before the end of next week and we can discuss the matter at that time.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nEnclosure.\nSardis, B. C.,\nAugust 15th, 1935.\n\nRev. K. J. Beaton,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Beaton:\n\nI am enclosing copy of a letter received from the B. C. Electric Railway Co., with references to back charges on our lighting account.\n\nThe letter is self-explanatory. A year ago, when I came to the school, I went to the office in Chilliwack and did my best to get information as to the different meters and the cost respectively, for power and light, in order that I might have some way of checking up and they informed me then that they had no way of telling which bill was for which meter and after a second attempt I had to let it go. You may imagine the shock which this letter gave me. I do not see how they have any legal claim, as we have paid the accounts which they have rendered from month to month. I took the matter up with Mr. Jaunt, the Indian Agent and his suggestion was that I write you, and that if you would take it up at Ottawa, it may be that the Department would make a \"love gift\" or something of that kind.\n\nYou may understand that if we have to pay this back charge, even though it is spread over a considerable period, it is going to mean a considerable handicap, especially in view of the developments I had hoped to undertake here this year. So far as the moral obligation is concerned I feel that such an obligation is much greater on my part, towards our girls, some of whom will be putting in their last year at school this year. If they do not get that training in home economics as planned this year, they will not get it at all, so I have to decide between the moral obligation between them and this company. In the latter case it seems like adding money, which would be found money, to their profits; while in the case of the girls it is a case of personal loss and I think this is the obligation which ought to obtain.\n\nYou will note that the corrected K.W. hours in each case, add practically an amount equalling one month's salary, so that in any case, this year I must, without any back payment at all, provide for what amounts to another member of the staff, then if I put someone in charge of the Home Economics Department it is like adding two members, which you will understand, needs serious consideration. I would be glad if you could do something at Ottawa but I feel that the negligence of the company is quite inexcusable and that the blame rests squarely upon them.\n\nIn talking to the Manager in Chilliwack this week, he said that he would write you and doubtless you will hear from him in this connection.\n\nWith all good wishes, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"Signed\" R. G. Scott, Principal.\n\nP.S. Many thanks for your letter received yesterday in connection with my obtaining a Matron for our Girls' Department. I shall see these people in the order suggested in your letter.\n\nCopied - JGA.\nBRITISH COLUMBIA ELECTRIC RAILWAY CO., LTD.\n\nChilliwack, B. C.,\nJuly 12th, 1935.\n\nRev. R. G. Scott,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetza Institute,\nSardis, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Coqualeetza Institute - Lighting Account\n\nI regret having to advise that a recent check of our electric meter No. 1261180 indicates that you have been underbilled for energy consumed since December 1929 (when a change of meter was made) due to the omission of the multiplying constant 10 in computing the monthly kilowatt hours resulting in our billing only one-tenth of the actual consumption.\n\nAn analysis indicates that over a period of seventy-eight months you have been short billed 107,433 kilowatt hours, value $3,493.93, or an average of $44.80 per month.\n\nWith these facts in front of you I have no doubt you will desire to make some arrangement for the payment of the underbilled amount, which is what the company would have to do had you been overbilled. The effect on your future accounts is illustrated by taking the past two months for example:\n\nMonth ending May 18 - K.W. Hours billed 140 - Amount $7.00\nCorrected K.W. hours 1400 - Corrected bill $70.70\n\nMonth ending June 18 - K.W. Hours billed 130 - Amount $6.50\nCorrected K.W. hours 1300 - Corrected bill $70.70\n\nI shall be pleased to call and discuss this matter with you at your early convenience with a view to arriving at some satisfactory basis of settlement.\n\nYours truly,\n\n'Signed' L. McPhee,\nDISTRICT REPRESENTATIVE.\n\nCopied - JCA.\nRev. K. J. Benson,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nSardis, B.C.\nSeptember 3rd,\n1935\n\nDear Mr. Benson:\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter recently received from the B.C. Electric Railway Co., regarding their account for underbilled consumption of light in Coqualeetza. They have made a substantial reduction. At the same time, I feel that they have no legal right upon us, as we paid their bills from time to time, upon presentation, and the meters are their own property and supposed to be kept in shape by them.\n\nSo far as the moral obligation goes, it seems to me that my moral obligation to these children outweighs any which may exist towards the B.C. Electric. In the one case, if we have to shoulder the extra payment monthly, over and above the increased cost, as per their corrected meter, it means that we shall have to forgo the plans we have in mind for practical instruction for our Senior Girls, and they will be girls graduating this year, who will never have the chance of getting that instruction. On the other hand, it is simply a question of adding to the profits of the Company. It seems to me, as I have said, that my moral obligation to these children would preclude any compromise with the B.C. Electric Co., which would be likely to infringe upon the rights of the children.\n\nAt the same time, I would be quite agreeable, if you can influence the Department of Indian Affairs to make a settlement in this connection.\n\nI am just starting north this evening on a trip to bring in children from the Nass River.\n\nWith all good wishes,\n\nI am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n'Signed' R.

H. Walker, Sales Engineer, I am revising the account on the basis of the present rates of 5 and 2 cents.\n\nThe account rendered was based on the rates existing at the time current was consumed, namely 7 and 5 cents from January 1928 to April 1931 and 6 and 3 cents from April 1931 to December 1933. The present rates of 5 and 2 cents became effective January 1st, 1934.\n\nThis means a reduction in our claim of Nine Hundred, Ninety-five Dollars and Eighty cents ($995.80). The amount we are now billing you is $8,498.13.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned L. R. McPhee,\nDISTRICT REPRESENTATIVE,\n\nCopied - JGA\nSardis, B. J.,\nSeptember 16th,\n1935.\n\nRev. K. J.

In compiling the statement on the basis of the 5 and 2 cent rate, one month was overlooked and I wish to correct that reduction from Nine hundred, ninety-five dollars and eighty cents ($995.80) to nine hundred, fifty-five dollars and ninety cents ($955.90).\n\nThe amount we are now billing you is Two Thousand, Five Hundred, Thirty-eight dollars and three cents, ($2,538.03). I feel this reduction is a very generous one on our part and it is hoped that it may expedite settlement.\n\nYours truly,\n\n'Signed'\n\nL. N.

In consequence, I have been reading the correspondence in connection with the claim made against the Coqualeetza Residential School by the B.C. Electric Railway Co. for power for which they neglected to bill the School in the past. We have heard nothing directly from the Company.\n\nMy judgment at the present moment is that you should take legal advice in regard to the matter. If the Company rendered bills from time to time and they were settled and receipt given in full, I question whether they can legally collect anything from you now. At least, I think we should find out what our legal position is before we open up negotiations with the Company. In any event, I do not think you need to worry about paying the money until you can do so without embarrassing yourself financially. Before any settlement is made, we will certainly discuss the matter with the Department of Indian Affairs and have them make representations to the Company too. If we hear anything from the Company, we will let you know immediately.\n\nWith very kind regards,\n\nBelieve me\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n'Signed' R. E. Cochrane,\n\nCopied - JGA.\nSardis, B.

You will note that our pupilage is down considerably.\n\nFrom the total as indicated herewith, we are asking for discharge for 40 pupils, in addition we have 46 absences and a list of new comers of 31. We have actually in residence at the moment 159 pupils. There will be others coming in no doubt, in fact I have the assurance of 6 more coming in today or Monday.\n\nYou can see that it is going to be impossible for us to do anything in connection with the B.C. Electric light bill for the past 6\u00bd years shortage and must again say that I do not feel that there is any moral obligation extending towards this company, in comparison to the moral obligation to give these boys and girls the very best opportunity possible. If our pupilage does not come up within the next week or ten days, I shall start out on a tour to see what we can do, because we must have at least 200 to break even. The 10% raise is going to help us tremendously and I think we shall be able to get by; we shall do our best. I hope that you will get the best advice possible with regard to the B.C.

Beaton,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Beaton:\n\nReplying to your letter of October 22nd, regarding the B. C. Electric Claim, I beg to say that from all enquiries I have been unable to find any original contract between the School and the Electric Railway Co. Dr. Haley says there was no original contract. I have interviewed the local manager in Chilliwack and he informs me that there could be no original contract, as he has no record of it in his office. In all probability, all that would be between the school and the Company would be the signing of a card requesting service. In conversation with Mr. McPhet, the local Manager, I inferred, very clearly, from his that he felt we were under moral obligation only.\n\nJust to make it clear let me repeat that this claim for back payments rests only, and altogether on the fact that their meter was not registering the full amount of power that we were using. It is not a case of us not paying in full, the accounts they rendered. We paid in full all accounts rendered by the Company upon presentation. The shortage is due to the fact that their meter was not properly registering. The meter was their property and supposed to be kept in order by them. I may also say that I went twice to the local office after I first undertook the Principalship, and sought to find just which meter was for which particular service, in order that I might know how much we were paying for power in the laundry, how much for light in the main building and how much for power to the barn and the manual training building. They were not able to give me any information and said that it was all looked after from Vancouver. It was not until after the meter was found to be wrong that our Engineer and myself were able to get a line on these meters.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of the bills rendered regularly by the Company. These have been paid by cheque each month. We have sent the coupon upon several occasions, along with the cheques, but these coupons were never returned to us, marked \"paid\", so we discontinued attaching them.\n\nTrusting this will be of some help, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n'Signed' R. G. Scott,\nPrincipal.\n\nP.S. Their manager informed me that the same thing occurred with the Chilliwack Hospital and the Board had made a settlement.

Snow, of $155.20, for removal of transformers and supplying and running heavy wire across the girls' playground to the School. You will remember I discussed this with Mr. Phelan, when he was here last August, and showed him then, the way in which the support had pulled away from the pole, so that it was imperative that these transformers be moved. I pointed out to him also, that last winter when there was a short in one of the circuits, we could light an electric lamp, by making contact with the pole, which carried the transformers; also, by making contact with any of the piping in the Laundry and a switch.\n\nI had the matter rectified at once, but it still left the high voltage wires coming across the playground and in proximity to trees, which in some cases had worn the insulation off these wires and made it dangerous. I sent the account in the first place, to Mr. Phelan, seeing I had discussed it with him. I think the item was included in the estimates for Repairs for $125.00 for this work. Mr. Phelan sent the accounts back to us for more detail; this has been added and I trust that it is in order. We have only last week received it from Mr. Snow. I would be glad if you would send it forward and if you think best, for Mr Phelan's attention, once more.\n\nThe account for painting the Infirmary and for removal of moss, which I also sent to Mr. Phelan, were returned for further detail and I am sending them to you, under separate cover. None of these items have been authorized, except that they were discussed with Mr. Phelan, when he was here, and that is the reason I sent them on to him. Evidently he sent them to the Department and the Department, apparently, gave them some consideration, seeing they were sent back to me for details.\n\nI am also enclosing Mr. Harper's account for the heating installation of the Preventorium and trust that you will find them in order. We have tried to be careful, the figures seem to be correct, and the detail is apparently in this time. This is the contract price which he gave us in the very beginning. I am enclosing a second account, however, from Mr. Harper, because we found that we simply had to have some protection from the water running off the roof, which made it quite impossible to go in and out of the doors when it was raining, as streams of water from both the kitchen and main roofs poured down over the platform and the entrance. I thought at first, putting a short piece of trough in, just to take the water beyond the platform, would do, but this would not have been satisfactory, as it would have left the water within easy access to the\nfurnace room, consequently I had to have troughs run right along the sides, taking the water to the extreme ends of the building. His account, as enclosed, for this work is $15.42, and I trust that you will find this in order.\n\nWith all good wishes, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. C.

O'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Daunt:\n\nI am now in a position to give you the details of the proposed improvements to our fire escapes.\n\nFirst of all, I had Mr. Brock of Chilliwack out, and have gone into the matter of the door in the upper corridor, between the boys' and girls' sides, and it does seem, after considerable deliberation, that it would be quite unwise and quite unsatisfactory, to have the doorway through the clothes closets in the teachers' rooms, and have them go through these rooms and out into the corridor. There is no doubt, that in case of fire, this roundabout way would result in confusion and so, would not be satisfactory. Mr. Brock, who has done a good deal of work satisfactorily for the school, would undertake to supply all materials and do the work of cutting the door through and hanging same in the partition between the Boys' and Girls' sides on the upper floor for the sum of $15.00.\n\nRegarding improvements to our fire escapes, I think I have pointed out the difficulty caused in readiness of exit, when the children come down the fire escapes. When they reach the lower platform, which is still 8' above the concrete floor of the yard, they have to come down through a manhole, one by one, on an iron ladder, which is attached to the brick wall. In our fire drills, down the front and out the front door, where we have readiness of exit, we can clear the school in less than one and one half minutes. But when they have to come down these fire escapes, progress is good until this lower landing is reached and then there is a blockade, with children standing waiting upon the steps all the way up. I feel sure that this would result in tragedy, if we ever have a fire and have to use these fire escapes. It took the boys 6 minutes to get out of the school and down the fire escape, and it took the girls 9 minutes, owing to congestion, as the children went down, one by one, on this ladder, through this manhole.\n\nI had a long talk with the Deputy Fire Marshall in Vancouver, and he advised me that it would be necessary to have several improvements and that our present system was certainly inadequate. He advised me to see the Pearson Wire and Iron Works, who have done a lot of this sort of thing for the city schools and not one of whose contracts has been unsatisfactorily filled. While there are other firms, he said he never had to turn back any work which this firm had done. I have shown the Manager of this firm, the sketch prepared by Mr. Williams, and from it the Pearson Wire and Iron Works have agreed to provide two counterbalance stairs complete, with weights, sheaves and cable, delivered at Coqualeetza for $243.00.\nThere would be some small expense extra in having these fixtures attached, but I think we could perhaps attend to that at the school, or certainly by getting one man up from the city, it could be done with two days' work and help from ourselves. There would be 1054 lbs. weight in the two stairs and counterbalance weights; the stair stringers to be 4\" x 6\" iron. The chairs to be 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" x 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" x 3/16\", 5/8\" flexible cable used, supposed to be good for 25 years. 3/8\" x 2\" stirrup, and 28 checker plate treads.\n\nWhile a counterbalance stairs is not admitted in some schools in the city, it is still used in hospitals and in certain schools and other public buildings. I think you know the type. The stair remains suspended until the first child begins to come down, when it lowers to the ground and remains in that position until the last child has come down the escape. If we had these, we could empty the school in practically the same time, down the fire escapes, namely 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) minutes. It does not seem possible, owing to there being an exit in the way, to bring the stairs down right to the ground.\n\nI would be glad if you would forward this estimate to the Department. We ought to have also, stairway fire escapes of the type, on the back of the school, one on each end of the building, allowing exit through the lavatories. As you know, apart from the stairway escapes on the back of the building, there is nothing but the ladders attached to the front. Even if two new fire escapes were not given us, I feel there certainly should be one new one on the girls' side. One could take a chance on the boys getting out, perhaps, down the present ladder, but it would be exceedingly difficult for the girls and certainly not adequate for either boys or girls.\n\nTwo new stairs, with two landings and counterbalance stairs, at the bottom, would cost $465.00; if we ran the stairs right to the ground, the cost would be $90.00 less. This is an approximate estimate. I trust that at least you may be able to get the two counterbalance stairs to complete our present equipment.\n\nThanking you for your interest and assistance, I am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR.C. Scott,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, March 10, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the third instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Coqualeetsa Indian Residential School, giving details of improvements which he recommends be carried out in connection with the fire escapes.\n\nIn reply I have to say the Department will approve of the expenditure required - approximately $15.00 - in having a door installed in the partition wall, between the two sides of this building, on the top floor. You may arrange, also, for the purchase of two fire axes and have one installed in a case on each side of the partition. Please forward an itemized account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure.\n\nThe Department has noted the Principal's request, that stairway fire escapes, of the same type as those on the back of the school, be provided at each end of the building. While there are no funds available in our Appropriation for the balance of the current fiscal year, it will be possible to provide for this expenditure from the appropriation for the coming fiscal year. The Department will therefore approve of you taking up this matter with the Principal and arranging for the installation of a stairway fire escape at each end of the building, allowing exit through the lavatories. These fire escapes should include counterbalance section, as outlined in the Principal's letter. It is noted that the cost of the two new stairs, with two ladders and counterbalance stairs at bottom, would be approximately $465. The school authorities, themselves, should perform as much as possible of the labour in carrying out the work.\n\nThe accounts covering the cost of installing the two stairways should not reach the Department until after the middle of April, next, when funds are available to pay the cost of the work. At that time, you should forward accounts, in triplicate, giving in detail the amount of labour required, the number of hours employed and the rate paid. Should there be any freight charges on materials for same, a receipt should accompany the vouchers.\n\nThe Department will leave in the hands of the Principal and yourself the matter of installing the fire escapes, and all work should be satisfactorily carried out. It is hoped that when these escapes are installed it will overcome the present danger of the existing ladders and provide ample means of escape in case of fire, with the least possible loss of time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B. C.\nSIR:-\n\nI regret that your letter dated the 12th of December, File No.158-0-5, should have remained so long unanswered, but on taking the matter up with the Reverend R.C. Scott, Principal of Squaileetza Indian Residential School, further possible fire hazard was pointed out, and I wished to obtain an idea of the cost of some of Mr. Scott's suggestions before laying the matter before you.\n\nI am enclosing a communication from the Reverend Gentleman, from which you will see that the original change suggested by Colonel Pragnell can be made for approximately $15.00, and I would recommend that this be authorized.\n\nIn connection with Mr. Scott's remarks on the fire-escapes, there is no doubt a distinct slowing up in the evacuation of the children from the School occurs at the lower platform, as indicated. This might easily cause the rear of the departing line of pupils to be endangered by a fire.\n\nWhat is, to my mind, worse, is the system of up-right ladders from the top story attached to the wall outside the windows, on to which children would have to swing. In reasonable weather these could be negotiated by the boys, but would be very dangerous for girls. In weather, such as we have had during the past month with low temperatures accompanied by northerly gales, they would be impossible for anyone.\n\nThe first proposition outlined by Mr. Scott and estimated to cost $243.00 would do away with the congestion on the existing fire-escapes.\n\nThe second proposition estimated to cost $465.00 would eliminate the dangerous ladders and provide extra facilities for rapid evacuation.\n\nThe cost being considerable, I hesitate to make a recommendation, for immediate purchase, but I wish to emphasize the danger of the existing ladders and I do think it would be most desirable to install a better system of evacuation at the earliest possible moment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nTO STANLEY BROCK LIMITED\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nSOLD TO (Coequaleetza Residential School,)\nSardis, B.C.\n\nC.S.NO. 7057\n\nTERMS.\n\n| QUANTITY | YOUR ORDER NO. | YOUR REG'N NO. | PRICE | AMOUNT | TOTAL |\n|----------|----------------|----------------|-------|--------|-------|\n| 2        | #12151-44 Drive Pinions - 17 T. 5 P. | 4.15 | 8.30 |\n| 2        | #12151-142 Short Hub Transmitter | 34.75 | 49.50 |\n| 16       | 5/8\" x 3-1/4\" Brass Capped Carriage Bolts | .35 | 5.60 |\n| 2        | #12151-10 Trunnion Bearings | 4.95 | 9.90 |\n| 1        | #1210-907 Gauge Glasses | .33 | .33 |\n| 1        | #3220-90 Gauge Glass Washer | .02 | .02 |\n| 1        | #3225-070 Gauge Glass Kit | 1.40 | 1.40 |\n| 1        | Outer Wood Case - Woodwork only | 77.00 | 77.00 |\n| 1        | Wood Cylinder with 1 Vertical Partition, 2 compartments, 2 doors, woodwork only | 80.00 | 80.00 |\n| 2        | 3/8\" x 3-1/2\" Brass Capped Carriage Bolts | .07 | .14 |\n| 8        | 3/8\" x 2-1/2\" | .06 | .48 |\n| 2        | 3/8\" x 2\" | .06 | .12 |\n| 20       | 1/4\" x 3/8\" Roll Galv.

(RG 10, Volume 6442, file 880-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES CANADA\nOttawa, March 24, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, requesting that a steam ironer be supplied, for use in the laundry, and setting forth the need for this equipment, together with an estimate of the cost.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will have no funds during the coming fiscal year to cover the cost of supplying an ironer. The Department has noted the large amount of laundry work required and the work performed by the girls. It is thought that the Principal should add another member to the staff, to assist in the heavier part of the work in the laundry, if he considers that too much time is taken up by the girls in doing the work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster,\nB. C.\nSIR:\n\nI beg to forward you herewith, a communication from the Reverend Principal of Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, in which he sets forth the need for a Steam Ironer in their laundry.\n\nApparently, the cost of such a machine, new, is $3,000.00, but there is a good used one available at $1,000.00.\n\nThis seems a great deal of money, and I refrain from comment, other than to remark that there would appear to be two sides to the school situation:\n\nOn the one hand we have the fact that undoubtedly the ironing at this Institution is very heavy, and done in the present manner takes up a great deal of the girls' time, besides exposing the present machinery to a heavy steam strain. The proposed installation would do away with both these drawbacks.\n\nOn the other hand, having their future welfare in mind, it appears to me that too much machine help in these schools, useful as it is in operating the Institution, is not the best kind of preparation for life in a shack on a Reserve, where the ability to carry on domestic duties with plain everyday appliances will count more than academic proficiency, or a knowledge of steam ironers and electric stoves. That appears to me, to be one place these big schools fail to function.\n\nUnder the circumstances and conditions there is no doubt this machine would be very useful, and if the money is available would probably warrant the expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nMarch 12, 1936.\n\nMr. A. O'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Daunt:\n\nI would be grateful if you would bring to the attention of the Department, my request of last August, for a Steam Ironer for our Laundry. I pointed out at that time, the urgent need.\n\nWith about three thousand pieces going through, per week, with our present equipment, the girls are kept working from four to five days weekly. It is not only hard on them physically, but it renders it almost impossible to find time, outside the classroom periods, for instruction along Home Economics and Handicraft lines, which is vitally necessary for the practical training of these children. I pointed out also, how wasteful our present system is, by using live steam to bring the water in our washer, up from cold to washing heat. It is also hard on the cylinder itself, and in view of the fact that the Department has just installed a new washer, I would like again, to point out that using steam in this way creates a pressure, which is hard on the cylinder.\n\nA new Ironer, 100\", two roll, one pass, belt driven machine, would cost in the neighborhood of $3,000.00, but I pointed out, that Stanley Brock Limited could supply a used ironer, passed by the Inspector and in good condition, two roll, one pass, 100\" machine installed for $1,000.00. This machine has been discarded, not because of any deficiency or breakdown in it, but simply because it had become too small and required four attendants, two putting the goods through and two taking them away. The new machines have a return apron, which enables the two workers who feed the machine, to take away also, and thus saves 50% of their labor cost.\n\nBy installing a hot water tank, which could be secured second-hand, for two hundred dollars, with heating coil complete, we could use the exhaust steam from the ironer, to create a plentiful supply of hot water, which could be piped direct to the washing cylinder. In view of the fact that the Department will be asked to furnish a high pressure steam boiler this coming year, I would like to emphasize again, the gain that there would be in having this equipment, from the standpoint of decreased fuel consumption.\n\nThe main thing, however, is the fact that our present system keeps our girls too long in the laundry. If they could get rid of doing all the heavy flat work, such as sheets, towels pillow cases,\netc., it would speed up the process, as these articles could go direct from our tumbler, or dryer, through the steam mangle and be finished with. The training of the girls in ironing, would not at all be interfered with, because all articles of personal clothing would still be washed and ironed individually.\n\nI have been going through our roll of pupils and beg to point out, as showing that we have fewer and fewer girls available. Six years ago we had three girls from 6 to 8 years; today we have 15. Six years ago we had eighty-six girls from 9 to 16 years of age; today we have only seventy. Six years ago we had 16 girls who were over 16 years of age and today we have three. The proportion of Grade VIII and High School girls is very much the same, so that it does not affect the depletion of available labor. Six years ago there were seven girls in Grade VIII and High School and today we have five.\n\nThis will make clear, I am sure, the need for doing something to lessen the time that our girls spend in the laundry. I am most anxious to do even more than we are doing this year, for these girls, in the way of a practical training in house keeping and home making, dress making and handicrafts such as spinning, carding, dyeing and knitting wools into all kinds of articles for clothing. Of course if the Department felt like giving us a new machine, well and good, but I feel that this second hand machine, if passed by the Government Inspector, would be adequate, and in view of the necessity mentioned above, of installing a new High Pressure steam boiler, I feel that the Department might well give the matter consideration.\n\nThanking you for your interest, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. Scott,\nPrincipal.\n| DATE | PARTICULARS | CREDIT | DEBIT | TOTAL |\n|------|-------------|--------|-------|-------|\n| Dec 30 | [Handwritten] |        |       | 194   |\n\nWE BEG TO ADVISE HAVING PASSED DRAFT UPON YOU FOR $5\nAT FROM AND COMMEND OUR\nDRAFT TO YOUR KIND PROTECTION.\n\nYOURS FAITHFULLY,\n\nKIRKLAND & ROSE\n\n[Stamp: Representative of the Treasury]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Benton,\nAssociate Secretary,\nUnited Church Home Missions,\n290 Queen Street, West,\nToronto 2, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn Thursday, March 25th, the writer had an interview with the Reverend Scott, Principal of the above Institute, regarding the aforementioned arrears, due to our having billed you only half the correct consumption for several years past.\n\nNo doubt Mr. Scott has explained to you that this arose out of the fact that the meter registers only one-tenth of the current passing through it and therefore has a multiplying constant of 10 to give the correct result. This was inadvertently omitted when billing you. I explained that had the reverse been the case and you had been overbilled, we would have immediately issued a credit for whatever was due to you.\n\nThe stand taken by Mr. Scott is that the Institute is provided with a certain definite proportion of the expense by the Government Department of Indian Affairs; that no further funds are available and therefore the debt can not be honored. We, on the other hand, are endeavoring to meet the Institute in a liberal way by 8 cents, instead of 7 and 5 cents and 6 and 3 cents, which rates have prevailed during the major portion of the time. Not only this, I have suggested that as the underbilling extends over a period of six and one-half years that if the Institute was short of funds we were willing to accept payment of the arrears over the same period during which they had been incurred, which would add approximately $25.50 per month to your regular lighting account.\n\nIt would appear to the writer that as the Government bear the major portion of the cost of this Institution, which according to the annual statistics is in the neighborhood of 75 per cent, that they have benefitted to this extent in connection with the arrears, and it does not seem unreasonable that they should pay this amount. I shall, therefore, be glad if you will take this matter up with your Board, especially the suggestion I have made that the debt be liquidated over the same period in which it was incurred, which I believe you will agree is a very reasonable proposal.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd.)

I am sorry that the amount now submitted is so much in excess of that which the firm gave to me as a rough estimate. That is largely due to the fact that the sketch which was made for me by Mr Williams took account only of the first two stories, and left the upper story unprovided for. It is this, as stated in the letter from The Pearson Company which has increased the cost.\n\nThe windows on the third floor are set back from the wall, so that the platform has to extend over a part of the roof in order to get clearance for the stairway to the second floor windows. The flight of steps is a long one, so I had the quotation made for ladders going right to the ground. Otherwise it would have had to be a counterbalance unit from the ground floor window. This would have been much more costly, and there is the unsatisfactory element of upkeep to be sure that it would always be ready for use. The other fire escapes come practically to the ground, by means of the ladder from the lower landing. This is very unsatisfactory so far as utility and ready exit is concerned. These ladders should be replaced by stairways as suggested in the second part of the Pearson Co.'s quotation but so far as allowing access to the dormitories from the outside, the ladder is almost as big a menace as would be the stairways proposed. I think we can eliminate the Counterbalance unit. We have had no trouble for some years, so I am informed, through use of fire-escapes to obtain entrance to the building. Locks and seals, on the inside are all we use, and they are sufficient.\n\nThe ladders on the front of the building, and again from No. 5 dormitories on both boys' and girls' sides, are quite inadequate and unsafe for use. The proposed units would allow access through the Lavatory windows as shown in the sketch. There would need to be made into a basement window to allow ready exit, but that is not an expensive undertaking. It should, however, be provided for. The main shaft would be the main, and likely the only expense as we could change them ourselves.\n\nOur present system of fire escapes is entirely inadequate and would not pass inspection by a fire marshal. These proposed additions, especially if supplemented by the additional sections from the main floor landings to the ground on our present escapes at the rear of the School, would give us equipment that would be adequate. We would then have three exits, namely:\n\n1. By the stairways and through front and rear entrances;\n2. Down fire escapes at the rear of the building;\n3. Down fire escapes (as proposed) at the end of the building.\n\nIf the Department is unable to meet the cost of the proposed new units at $948.00, plus cost of erection, then I trust that they will undertake the extra unit from the lower landing to the ground, or the unit now on the rear of the School. We might do the work of installation in this case, as there would be no new\nbraces required. It would be only a matter of cutting the present platform, and attaching the new stairs to the present landing.\n\nIn our last fire drill, the boys took 6 minutes and the girls 9 minutes to get out and clear of the fire escape. This was due to the congestion on the lower landing through having to go down the ladder one at a time. The addition would give us ready exit right to the ground, and I cannot too highly recommend its being granted. The matter of the units on the end, as proposed in the enclosed Blue Print might wait for further consideration, but are vital to greatest degree of safety.\n\nIf the work were done on the new units during the summer vacation we would supply board for the workmen.\n\nRegretting the increase of cost for the proposed new units, but emphasizing once more the need of some such further protection, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRCS/ PRINCIPAL.\n\nP.S. I am really up the Coast on a visit to the villages in hope of stimulating recruiting of pupils, and shall call to see you early in May upon my return.\n\nIn looking more carefully at the sketch, I do not see why the lower landing might not be single, and the stairway continue straight to the ground. The stairway from the third floor would naturally land on the outside of the platform on the second floor landing. Thus the continuation over the ground floor landing might well be straight down to the ground across a single width landing there. This would lower the cost some I have no doubt.\n\n[Signature]\nSIR:\n\nWith reference to your letter dated the 10th of March, File No.155-0-5, in which you authorize an expenditure of $465.00 for improvements to the Fire Escape System at Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, and which figure was based on a report and plan submitted by the Reverend Principal.\n\nI now beg to forward you another letter from Mr. Scott, together with a blueprint, from which it would appear that he failed to take the third story of the building into consideration when working out the original cost submitted.\n\nA quotation in connection with the new plans, to make a complete job, of $948.00 for material plus $72.00, together with one week's board for two men in erecting them is submitted by the Pearson Wire & Iron Works Limited, Vancouver. The Reverend Mr. Scott, however, offers to absorb this cost of labour and board, which leaves the estimate at $948.00.\n\nA proposal to improve the foot of the present escapes at a cost of $172.00, plus $18.00 for erection costs is also enclosed. This latter solution, however, does not improve the third story situation, which, at present, is undoubtedly dangerous.\n\nIt is apparent, therefore, that in order to fully cope with the situation an expenditure of $948.00 is called for. The alternative expenditure of $190.00 will adequately take care of the first two floors, but will leave the top floor unprotected, as the existing up-right ladders could not be used in bad weather, or indeed at any time except by strong and active pupils.\n\nI have advised the Reverend Principal to allow the matter to remain in abeyance pending your instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.O'N.

Total, Fifty-six dollars, ($56).\n\nThere are three other buildings which are badly in need of shingling, and I would say that another Fifty dollars would do all three. These include the building now used as Boat Shop, the extra dormitory near by, and the cottage, which I hope some time to have fixed up for a Manual Training proposition. The amount of Fifty dollars extra would be for the shingles for all three buildings. This work could readily be done by our own Manual Training boys, as the roofs are low, but I would not care to put these boys up on the roof of our house. I shall get estimates for the materials necessary to recondition the cottage mentioned, which could be used as a residence for married staff members.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.C.

It is now some thirteen or fourteen years since the School was built. I have hunted everywhere for plans of the drainage system and have enquired from Baynes and Herrie, whom I understand were in charge of the building of this School. I have made all possible enquiries locally as well, but can get no trace of these plans. I have plans of the heating and plumbing, but these do not go farther than the connection with the drain. The drainage system itself is not shown. In endeavouring to clear the drains from the boy's lavatories in the basement we can get only so far with a \"worm\" or with the fire hose, but cannot tell whether this drain continues under the building or whether it goes our around.\n\nI understand copies of these plans are filed in Ottawa, in the Public Works Department, and if so, I would greatly\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nappreciate it if we could have a copy of the same, as we simply must remedy this matter. We do not wish to have to tear through cement floors, if we can get entrance to the drain at some point outside the building.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.C. SCOTT\nPrincipal\nper. [signature]\n\nRCS/BW\nMay 31, 1936.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honorable the Superintendent General,\n\nMr. A. O'Neil Daunt, Indian Agent, New Westminster, B.C., has reported on the improvements which it is recommended be carried out in connection with the providing of proper fire escape facilities at the Cappilano Indian Residential School, Burdine, B.C. At present, there are ladders on the front of the building, from both boys' and girls' dormitories, which are inadequate, unsafe for use and would not pass inspection by a fire marshal. There are 285 children in residence. At a recent fire drill, it required six minutes for the boys and nine minutes for the girls to get out of the building and clear of the fire escapes; due to the congestion through having to go down the ladders one at a time. This would be a serious condition in case of outbreak of fire, the building being only semi-fireproof.\n\nThe Agent has forwarded a sketch plan for the installation of the new fire escapes required, to be located at each end of the building and to extend from the third story to the ground. This would give three exits, viz.:\n\n1. Present fire escape at rear of building;\n2. Fire escape (as proposed) at each end of building;\n3. If necessary, by the stairways and through front and rear entrances.\n\nThe agent has forwarded, also, a quotation received - by the Principal\nby the Principal from the Pearson Wire and Iron Works, Limited, Vancouver, manufacturers of fire escapes - who offer to make a complete job, supplying the material and labour in installing the equipment, to the amount of $1,000.\n\nFunds for the purpose are available in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year, and I would request your authority to incur the expenditure and to have the Pearson Wire and Iron Works, Limited, Vancouver, supply the material and make the installation. This firm has done satisfactory work of a similar type for the Department in connection with other schools. Both the Agent and the Principal strongly urge that adequate fire escape facilities be installed.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, May 30, 1936.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th instant, enclosing a list showing the number of Thermene extinguishers supplied Indian residential schools during the past few years. I wish to thank you for this list, which will be of future use in keeping the fire equipment at the schools in good, serviceable condition.\n\nRegarding the Thermene extinguishers supplied the Ceqaleetna Indian Residential School, Sardinia, B.C., we find that refills were last ordered from your firm on January 17th, 1935 - at which time 8 Karbaloy recharges were supplied.\n\nI understood from your Mr. Snarr, during his recent visit, that it would be possible to install certain equipment and recharges at an expenditure of approximately $4.80 each, which would overcome the necessity of having the extinguishers recharged yearly. In this connection, would it be necessary to have these machines returned to the factory, or could the work be done by the staff at the school? I should be pleased to have full information, together with an estimate of the cost per extinguisher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. B. MacKenzie,\nSecretary,\nPyrene Manufacturing Co. of Canada, Ltd.,\n91 Dawn Roadway,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, June 11, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, relative to the supplying of conversion units for the 14 gallon Thermene extinguishers supplied by your firm in October, 1935, for use at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, Sardis, B.C.\n\nIn this connection I have to inform you that an order will be placed with your company, in due course, to supply nine carbon dioxide cartridges with new cage and firing pin and necessary Karbaloy for recharging these extinguishers.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nGeorge N. Hansell, Esq.,\nPyrene Mfg. Co. of Canada, Ltd.,\n91 Dawn Roadway,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, June 11, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIn October, 1929, nine 1\u00bd gallon Thermos fire extinguishers were supplied for use at the Ceqalotza Indian Residential School. In order to keep these extinguishers in serviceable condition, it is necessary that they be recharged each year. To overcome this condition, we are placing an order with the Pyrene Manufacturing Company, Toronto, to supply carbon dioxide cartridges complete with new cage and firing pin, to be installed in these extinguishers. By the use of this new method, the annual recharging is done away with, it only being necessary to periodically weigh the carbon dioxide cartridge and check this weight against the weight stamped on the side.

F. MacKenzie, Secretary.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nWe acknowledge your letter of May 30th, and with reference to the last paragraph, undoubtedly Mr. Snarr was talking about the recent improvement which we have made in our 1 5/4 gallon Thermene Extinguishers.\n\nAfter considerable experimenting, we have perfected a carbon dioxide cartridge, which complete with a new cage and firing pin, is attached to the old extinguishers. This does away with the use of an acid, and eventually decreases the aggregate cost of recharging over a period of time.\n\nFormerly, this extinguisher to comply with the Fire Underwriters', and in order to give adequate protection, had to be recharged annually. By the use of this new method this annual recharging is done away with, it only being necessary to periodically weigh the carbon dioxide cartridge, and check this weight against the weight stamped on the side.\n\nAs pointed out to you in our letter of May 11th, 1935, under your file No. 55396-9, we are prepared to supply you with this conversion unit, complete with the carbon dioxide cartridge, and necessary Karbaloy for recharging the Extinguishers, at a cost of $6.50 each net, F.O.B. Toronto. We feel certain that if you adopt this type of charge to your various units, it will do away with a lot of extra work in regard to recharging, and also will over the next few years pay for itself through your not having to purchase new recharges annually.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPYRENE MANUFACTURING COMPANY\nOF CANADA LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

ORR,\n\nThe Estimates for Indian Education for the current fiscal year provide for the following work at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School:\n\n1. Supplying and installing two vacuum pumps in boiler room - $1,800.\n2. Supplying one - 15 h.p. high pressure boiler - 500.\n3. Purchase of one hot water tank - 400.\n4. Re-shingling and reconditioning roofs of buildings - 400.\n5. Miscellaneous repairs - 400.\n\nMr. Agent Daunt, in forwarding his Estimates, last fall, states that the installation of the two vacuum pumps in the boiler room is rendered necessary because the steam return from the upper radiators back to the boilers is so slow that condensation takes place too rapidly and pockets are formed. To overcome this, the Engineer has to resort to forcing his furnaces at full capacity. This waste of fuel does not bring results and, in consequence, the building is cold on its exposed side and radiators are frozen.\n\nRe high pressure boiler, the Inspector of Boilers of the Public Works Department condemned the present boiler in use and stated it could not be used after the end of the present school year, June next. A new hot water tank - capacity 500 gallons - with heating coil, is required for laundry purposes.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6442, file 880-5, part 2)\nMEMORANDUM\n\nJune 9th, 1936.\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nI am returning, herewith, Departmental memorandum of the 29th ultimo. You will note that the Minister has approved your recommendation that fire escape facilities should be provided at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School.\n\nBefore deciding which firm shall be given the contract it is suggested that tenders should also be requested from the Vancouver Art Metal Company, 16 West 2nd Avenue, Vancouver. If their tender is lower than the one submitted by the Pearson Wire and Iron Works, Limited, it will be acceptable to place the order with them. However, if they are higher the price submitted by the Pearson Wire and Iron Works, Limited can be accepted.\n\nEnc.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nMr. A. O'N. Daunt, Indian Agent, New Westminster, B. C., has reported on the improvements which it is recommended be carried out in connection with the providing of proper fire escape facilities at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, Sardis, B. C. At present, there are ladders on the front of the building, from both boys' and girls' dormitories, which are inadequate, unsafe for use and would not pass inspection by a fire marshall. There are 225 children in residence. At a recent fire drill, it required six minutes for the boys and nine minutes for the girls to get out of the building and clear of the fire escapes, due to the congestion through having to go down the ladders one at a time. This would be a serious condition in case of outbreak of fire, the building being only semi-fireproof.\n\nThe Agent has forwarded a sketch plan for the installation of the new fire escapes required, to be located at each end of the building and to extend from the third story to the ground. This would give three exits, viz.:\n\n1. Present fire escape at rear of building;\n2. Fire escape (as proposed) at each end of building;\n3. If necessary, by the stairways and through front and rear entrances.\n\nThe Agent has forwarded, also, a quotation received - by the Principal\nby the Principal from the Pearson Wire and Iron Works, Limited, Vancouver, manufacturers of fire escapes - who offer to make a complete job, supplying the material and labour in installing the equipment, to the amount of $1,020.\n\nFunds for the purpose are available in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year, and I would request your authority to incur the expenditure and to have the Pearson Wire and Iron Works, Limited, Vancouver, supply the material and make the installation. This firm has done satisfactory work of a similar type for the Department in connection with other schools. Both the Agent and the Principal strongly urge that adequate fire escape facilities be installed.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, June 16, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, enclosing a communication which you received from the Principal of the Coqualeetsa Indian Residential School, together with a quotation from the Pearson Wire and Iron Works, Limited, Vancouver, for the supplying and installing of fire escapes, to be located at each end of the building and to extend from the third story to the ground. The sketch plan, showing the location of the fire escapes, was also received. It is noted that the above company quote the sum of $485.00 for material, plus $72.00, together with one week's board for two men in erecting the escapes. The Department has noted, further, that the Principal will absorb the cost of the labour and board, which leaves the estimate at $557.00.\n\nThe Honourable the Minister has approved the expenditure in connection with the installing of adequate fire escape facilities but has directed that tenders should be requested, also, from the Vancouver Art Metal Company, 16 West Second Avenue, Vancouver. If their tender for the installing of similar equipment is lower than the one submitted by the Pearson Wire and Iron Works, Limited, it will be acceptable to place the order with them. However, if they are higher, the price submitted by the Pearson Wire and Iron Works Limited can be accepted. You should be guided by these requirements and place the order for the installing of the fire escapes with whichever one of the above firms quotes the lower price.\n\nThe work should be carried out at an early date, and, when completed to the satisfaction of the Principal and yourself, you should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, showing in detail the work performed. These accounts should be attached to proper voucher forms, certified in the usual manner and forwarded for payment.\n\nShould the Vancouver Art Metal Company quote the lower price for the equipment, no doubt, the Principal would be willing to absorb the cost of labour and board, as he agreed to do if the Pearson Wire and Iron Works were given the work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

It is noted that the cost of the work exceeded the amount authorized. In view of the reasons stated by the Principal for the extra expenditure, the Department will pay the costs, and you may forward the accounts, in triplicate, properly certified.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. O'H. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster,\nB. C.\nSIR:\n\nUnder date of June 10th in your letter No.153-0-5, you gave authority to incur an expenditure of $56.00 in reshingling the Principal's Residence at Coqualeetza Indian Residential School.\n\nOn the 8th of July, I forwarded Agency Voucher No.277 for $45.89 in favour of the Sardis Lumber Company, covering shingles and nails for this purpose. This left a balance of $12.11.\n\nI have now received two further accounts from the Reverend Principal, one in favour of the Sardis Lumber Company for more material to the amount of $21.86 and one for Mr. R.E. Mower, covering labour amounting to $22.40, making a total of $44.26, which means that your authority has been exceeded by $32.15.\n\nI am enclosing herewith, a copy of a letter received from Reverend Mr. Scott in this connection and am holding these accounts pending your instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nENCL.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nAugust 25, 1936\n\nMr. A.O'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Daunt:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith vouchers to complete the account for shingling the Principal's Residence at Coqualeetza. I very much regret that the amount has exceeded the estimate which I sent in to you for $56, for both materials and labour. This is wholly due to the mistake which Mr. Mower made in his estimate. It now turns out that instead of twelve thousand shingles it took sixteen thousand. This was due to the character of the roof. Each of the \"hips\" on the roof were shingled and also the \"hips\" on the front verandah, and this made very much more loss through cutting than he had estimated. The cost of nails was also almost double his estimate, due to using 1\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\" size instead of 1\".\n\nI think this is the first time an estimate has exceeded the amount first sent in. Under the circumstances in which we find ourselves financially, I do not see that I can absorb the extra cost. At the same time I am loath to ask the Department for the balance. Consequently I would suggest that some of the $50 authorized for shingling the out buildings at the School, be used to pay this balance. Then by taking a Number 2 shingle for these buildings and exercising care in putting them on, we could get by with a minimum expenditure. I shall leave it to your own judgement as to whether you adopt this suggestion or ask the Department for the amount required.\n\nThe first account for materials, which should have been the only one, was for $43.89. This left $12.11 of the $56.00 remaining. The balance for the shingles and nails amounts to $21.85. The bill for work is $22.40, a total of $44.25. This leaves $17.85 of the other $50 allowed for shingling. It is not very much and I would appreciate it if the Department would pay the extra for shingling as above, and leave us the full $50 for the out buildings.\nMr. A.O'N. Daunt.\n\nAugust 25, 1936\n\nespecially in view of the fact that the roof of the Principal's house has not yet been stained. However I am willing to abide by the suggestion made earlier in this letter if you think it best.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR.C.

Daunt,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Daunt:\n\nI am now able to present to you certain facts in connection with an increase of equipment for boys and girls handicrafts. I have a competent Dress-Maker undertaking instruction for our girls over and above the work that is done in the Mending Room, where repairs to clothing are made. In addition, Mr. Peake, who is Boys' Supervisor and a tailor by trade, has undertaken to do the repairs for all boys' clothing. We have had to take a machine from the girls' side and give it to Mr. Peake over on the boys' side, but he is satisfactorily. He is training boys in this work which I feel is a very practical thing. The difficulty is that we have not enough machines to do this work properly. I need at the very least one new machine for the boys' side.\n\nI have taken the matter up with the Singer Sewing Machine people, and they have an up-to-date machine which would be satisfactory at $105. Applying the usual discount of 15% and a special discount of 4%, this leaves the price of the machine to the Department at $50.49.\n\nI would like also to bring the matter of increased equipment for our Shoe Repairing to the favorable consideration of the Department. This is a very practical training and something which a boy can take hold of and put to practical use in his home village. In order to give adequate training, using only tools necessary for Hand work and one machine, which the average boy would be able to secure for himself, it would require $125. I have secured prices from the Singer Machine Company and from Denby Brothers with regard to cost of supplying a satisfactory machine. The price from the Singer people is $103 while that from the Denby people is $90. In addition to the buying in 1930-31, I think that the Denby machine would be more satisfactory. The lower part of the machine is adjustable and could be renewed if necessary, while the same part on the Singer is cast in one piece as part of the body of the machine. The Denby machine is heavier also. It is practically impossible for anyone doing Shoe Repairs to get along without one of these stitching machines, as the stitching is not only a very slow process by hand, but in some cases can not be done by hand. Mr. Fordred, our instructor, is a Shoe Maker by trade and he intends to have each of the boys now working at shoe repairing supply their own pair of shoes complete this year in addition to doing the repair work for the School. If the Department would be agreeable to securing the Stitching Machine from Denby Brothers at $90, I would take care of the $35 for hand tools out of School funds by applying the balance from our Manual Training Prize money for that purpose. You will remember that last year the Department allowed Allan Young to remain for a year to take further training on condition that he buy his own tools.\nIt happened that he was able to do so, but when he went home last Summer, he took his tools with him, hence the need for extra tools if we are to keep two boys employed as we hope to do. I trust that the Department will give this their favorable consideration, as I am sure it will put our Shoe Repairing on an adequate basis for training of these boys. With all good wishes, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\n[Handwritten note: Copy on file]\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, November 3, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Cocolastza Indian Residential School, requesting the purchase of a Diesel engine, to be used for demonstration and instruction purposes in connection with the motor mechanics department and in operating the laundry, the total cost involved being approximately $450.\n\nAs our funds for the balance of the present fiscal year are extremely limited and as there are many more urgent requests, the Department is not prepared, at the present time, to favourably consider the supplying of the engine.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. O'M. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster,\nB. C.\nOttawa, November 3, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter dated September 18th, last, regarding the installing of mechanical stokers, repairs to playroom floors, etc., at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, I would say that the Department is not prepared to favourably consider the installation of the mechanical stokers. It is considered, if the Principal desires to have these stokers installed, that he should arrange for payment of same from the saving that would be effected in the cost of fuel.\n\nThe Department will approve of the repairs being carried out to the playroom floors, and the contract for carrying out the work may be given to Mr. H. D. Layfield, 3617 West Third, Vancouver, B. C., to lay a three-quarter inch \"Fresco\" heavy duty mastic floor. The cost should not exceed the sum of, approximately, $500. You should arrange to have this work carried out at an early date. The Principal and yourself should see that a satisfactory job is completed.\n\nThe Department will approve, also, of an expenditure of $50.00 in sealing the windows on the outside of the north and east faces of the building.\n\nThe Department will approve of an expenditure to the amount of $75.00 in the building of a milk-house.\n\nWe are not prepared to authorize the repairs and painting of the farmer's cottage at the present time.\n\nWhen the above authorized work has been completed, you should forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. O'H. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B. C.\nSIR:-\n\nI beg to forward you herewith, a communication received from Reverend R.C. Scott, Principal of Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, regarding the purchase of a Diesel Engine for that Institution.\n\nThe Diesel Engine is required to complete the motor mechanic training of the boys and it can be used by a slight extension of the shafting to operate the laundry. This will not only reduce the cost of laundry operation, but it will also be a safeguard against any possible breakdown of the power due to ice storms in the Winter time.\n\nThe cost of a suitable Engine, such as has been installed in St. Michael's Residential School at Alert Bay, is $410.00 to which would be added an expenditure of $40.00 for extending the main line laundry shaft, making a total of $450.00.\n\nThe idea appears to be an excellent one, and if funds are available I would recommend it to the favourable consideration of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G.O'N. Daunt.\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nOctober 22, 1936\n\nMr. O.W. Daunt,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Daunt:\n\nI have been going into the matter of a Diesel engine with some care and I am now able to give you certain facts in this connection. From all I can learn the full Diesel put out by the Vivian Engine Works of Vancouver is giving good satisfaction on the Coast. I have talked with engineers who have had them in charge and also with officials of the Canadian Fishing Company, and they are well pleased with the performance of these engines. The cost however of purchasing a Vivian engine seems to me too high. I do not feel like asking the Department for an expenditure sufficient to get one at this time. I have received specifications and prices on their Marine and Stationary units. One 3 cylinder 30 H.P. Vivian four cycle full Diesel complete would cost, along with the auxiliary compressor unit, $2349.00 after a 10% discount. This same engine in a stationary type would cost $1989.00. A single cylinder marine unit, 11 H.P. complete, would cost $775.00 exclusive of Sales Tax in each case.\n\nIt is possible however, to secure a 7 H.P. Lister four cycle, full Diesel, the same as has been installed in St. Michael's School, Alert Bay, for $410. These Lister engines have given fine satisfaction at Alert Bay. If we had one I think it would be sufficient for demonstration purposes, as it has the Bosch fuel injection system just the same as the Standard Vivian or Atlas Imperial machine, thus we would have in this unit all that is necessary for instruction purposes. In addition, by expending $40 we could extend our main line Laundry shaft through the partition of the adjoining room. The engine could be set up there and used to run our Laundry. This is the same engine they have been running at Alert Bay to supply Laundry power with perfect satisfaction for the last six years.\n\nIn view of the fact that it seems likely we shall have to make some compromise with the B.C. Electric Company in connection with their account for back power, if we had this engine we could supply that power for 1\u00bd\u00a2 per K.W. hour as compared with nearly 4\u00a2 taken to run the big 7 H.P. motor at present supplying that power. Thus this engine would fill a double need and I would strongly recommend its being installed. I might add that the year of the Ice Storm we had to rent a gasoline engine to provide power for over three weeks, and having this unit it would insure against a repetition of that.\n\nOur Motor Mechanics department seems to be doing good work, and the boys are interested. Several of them who are at present attending School this year, have been on Seine boats and Packers, and if we can give them\n\nINDIAN OFFICE\nNEW WESTMINSTER\nOCT. 23 1936\nMr. A.O'H. Daunt:\n\nInstruction in Diesel engineering it will complete our course of training. The total cost of installation to provide for Laundry power would be only $450.\n\nI do hope that it will be possible for the Department to give us this very desirable unit.\n\nThanking you for your past interest, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nRCS/W\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOct. 29, 1936\n\nDR.

I.A.\nSIR:-\n\nWould you kindly inform me what credit will be available for repairs at Coqualeetza Indian Residential School this year.\n\nI included various items in the Estimates for the current year, to the amount of $9,218.75, amongst which was the sum of $1,800.00 for two return Vacuum Pumps in the boiler room.\n\nFrom the Boiler Inspector's Report, which, no doubt, will have reached you by now, the installation of Mechanical Stokers is recommended, and we have obtained a quotation of $1,147.00 for two Stokers, which is a saving of $653.00 on the pumps.\n\nThe calculated saving in fuel, based on the average expenditure is estimated at $764.00, being about $550.00 for price of fuel and the balance in more efficient stoking.\n\nAnother urgent item, having a bearing on heating efficiency is $50.00 for sealing the windows on the outside on the North and East faces of the building. These items of stokers and window sealing call for an expenditure of $1,197.00 and represent the item of $1,800.00 for vacuum pumps, placed in the Agency Estimates for the current year.\n\nThe Reverend Principal also requests that repairs may be made to the Blue-room floors, for which an item of $2,468.25 was provided for in the Estimates. In this connection I have received a bid from the Fred. M. Scott Company of Vancouver, to lay a three-quarter inch plywood Heavy duty Mastic floor on these rooms for $941.65, which is only a fraction of the original bids made last year.\n\nRepairs and painting of the Farmer's Cottage at the School, is also asked for by the Principal. This building has been removed to a new location and set up on a foundation of cement blocks but needs repairs and painting outside and inside also needs reconditioning, plastering in some rooms and painting. Mr. Scott requests $550.00 for this work and would make it a Manual Training project for the boys, if the Department will supply material to the above amount. I would, however, point out that no provision was made for this in the current year's estimates. A milk house at $75.00 is further requested. This was shown in the Estimates for the year.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nFile No.1-S-B.\n\nTo Summarize, the following requests are now being made by the Reverend Principal:\n\n1.

This would shut off the breeding pen for our hogs and cattle and give us a runway for them, as it is at present all that goes on there is visible to the children in the Preventorium and also to children on the Girls' Playground. The fence which is there is beyond repair and by building a new strong, close board fence we would do away with the objectionable features just mentioned, and provide adequate runway for both our hogs and cattle.\n\nThe cost for posts and lumber would be $66. I pointed this out to Colonel Pregnal when he was here and doubtless you have heard from him. I have also explained it to Captain Barry but he said it was not in his department. We would of course do all the work. I would appreciate it very much if we might have this assistance given as soon as possible so that we could get the work done before the Spring work on the farm absorbs the activities of our boys.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.C. Scott\nPrincipal\nOttawa, December 9th, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir,-\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd instant, Agent Daunt was instructed on the 28th ultimo to incur an expenditure of $105.00 in providing iron extensions to extend the present fire escapes at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School to the ground and to eliminate the present short iron ladders.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\n\nRev. R. C. Scott,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetza Indian Res. School,\nSardis, B. C.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nDecember 2, 1936\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMay I again call to your attention the matter of the extension to our Fire Escapes on the rear side. As I pointed out, the children go down the regular stairway to the landing platform just above the rear door, from which they descend on a ladder through a manhole. This is really dangerous. It extends the time at least double in getting the children out. When Captain Barry was here three dormitories came down the new Fire Escapes in just under two minutes, while it took two dormitories with fewer children more than four minutes to come down these rear escapes through the manhole.\n\nI have a figure from the Vancouver Art Metal Company agreeing to put one stairway on each side from the lower balcony to the ground with necessary alterations to railing to make it complete and safe at a cost of $106 Sales Tax included. In addition they will fix a ladder, at present the only exit out of No. 5 dormitory on the boy's side, making it 6\" from the wall instead of close in as it is at present.\n\nI would strongly advise this expenditure. If undertaken it would give us two complete sets of Fire Escapes, one on the end and one at the rear of the building on both Boy's and Girl's sides.\n\nAwaiting your reply, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.D. SCOTT\nPrincipal\nOttawa, November 28, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. Inspector Barry, in a report on his recent inspection of the Ceqaletza Indian Residential School, has drawn attention to the old fire escapes. He states that fire drill was carried out during his visit and that it took two minutes to clear the old escapes, due entirely to the fact that about 10 ft. from the ground the children have to pass through an opening in the escapes and reach the ground by an iron ladder, with the help of the members of the staff to catch them.\n\nThe Inspector has recommended that authority be granted to incur the expenditure required - $105.00 - in providing iron extensions to extend the present escapes to the ground and eliminate the present short iron ladders. He states he was told that this could easily be done by the firm which supplied the two new escapes this summer.\n\nThe Department will approve of you arranging, at an early date, with the Vancouver Art Metal Werks, Limited, Vancouver, to install the iron extensions from the present old escapes to the ground. You should see that this work is completed in a satisfactory manner,\n\nat an early\n\nA. O'N. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster,\nB. C.\nat an early date. Please forward an itemized account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost, which, it is hoped, will not exceed the above mentioned amount. The Department desires to have the fire escape facilities at this school placed in a thoroughly satisfactory condition and, as far as possible, free from any danger to the pupils during their fire drills or in case of fire.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\nEXTRACT from Inspector Barry's Report regarding his inspection of the COQUALEETZA INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL on the 12th & 13th November, 1936.\n\nOriginal on file 153-0-6.\n\nThe Fire Drill carried out while I was at the school was from the dormitories down the old and new escapes. It was well carried out. The children on the new escapes were clear of the school in about one minute, but it took another two minutes to clear the old escapes DUE ENTIRELY TO THE FACT THAT ABOUT TEN FEET FROM THE GROUND THE CHILDREN HAVE TO PASS THROUGH AN OPENING IN THE ESCAPES AND REACH THE GROUND BY AN IRON LADDER AND WITH THE HELP OF SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE STAFF TO CATCH THEM. EVEN THEN ONE FELL AS I WATCHED THE GIRLS.\n\nI would strongly recommend that the sum of one hundred six dollars be authorized expended on the provision of iron extensions to take the present escapes to the ground and eliminate the present short iron ladders. This, I am told, can easily be done by the firm which supplied the last two escapes and would only cost the sum of one hundred six dollars. This recommendation is with regard to the old Fire Escapes at the back of the school.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, November 23, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, enclosing a communication which you received from the Principal of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, requesting that a sewing machine and a shoe stitching machine be supplied and giving an estimate of the cost at which he can obtain these machines.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of the Principal or yourself arranging for the purchase of the machines mentioned. It is noted that the sewing machine can be obtained at a net cost of $50.49 and the shoe stitching machine, at a cost of $90. An account, in triplicate, covering the cost of the machines, should be obtained, and, when the machines are delivered at the school, you should attach the account to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward to the Department for payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

Scott, Principal of Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, in which he requests a sewing machine for the boys' side at a net cost of $50.49, and a Shoe Stitching Machine costing $90.00.\n\nThese Machines would probably save the School money, but I am not prepared to say how far the Department should go in this respect.\n\nI would, however, remark that St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School installed its own shoe-making Plant complete, considering that the saving to the School in shoe repairs and manufacturing warranted the expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.N.

We have a small silent machine, and while it is a great deal better than nothing, still it does not allow much scope for either educational or purely entertainment films. We are reduced to using the same ones over and over. In the standard 35 mm. machine we would have the one for which films are being made and we would have access to a large and constantly growing library of educational, travel and other films. As I have said, I could not see up to now how we could finance it, but if we could get some assistance from the Department in buying the machine, I think now we could handle it to great advantage.\n\nIt seems more necessary that we secure a machine with sound reproducing apparatus because each year we are reduced to our own resources to provide entertainment for our pupils. This is due to the Quarantine which our Medical Officer places us under. Some times we have contagious diseases in the School. This year in the first part of the term it was Mumps, but ever since last Fall Measles have been rampant in the surrounding community. Consequently our children have not been allowed to go to the Picture Show in Chilliwack, and it has aggravated the problem of School discipline in addition to the loss of education in such things.\n\nIn conference with Mr. Williams, our Manual Training Instructor, we have devised a scheme whereby pupils at the beginning of the term would take out a Season Ticket. In this way we would be assured of paying for film rentals and perhaps something towards the cost of the machine. We have gone into this matter in detail and we feel sure that the best offer received yet is for a second hand 'Soundon' machine with a guarantee of first class condition with the sound apparatus completely new. The cost of the machine is $150. If the Department could see its way clear to make us a grant of $75, the School could handle the remaining amount.\n\nI am sure this would help immensely, as I have heard what goes on the Reserves, stories of considerable dissatisfaction especially among the older pupils over the quarantine. In view of the tragic happenings in some other Schools this year, I feel that the action of our Medical Officer is warranted, but I do feel at the same time that we should do something to make the life at Coqualeetza as self-contained and happy as possible.\n\nTrusting you will be able to grant us this consideration, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.C.

Our funds are so limited that this amount cannot be exceeded.\n\nYou may so inform the Reverend Principal and, if it is considered that the refrigerator is more necessary than other repairs and improvements, you may arrange for its purchase from a firm on the approved list, at a cost not to exceed the estimate given in your letter of the 11th instant. It is noted that the insulating of the room can be done by the school authorities at a cost not exceeding $124.00.\n\nIt should be distinctly understood with the Principal that the total cost of the refrigerator and its installation will be deducted from the amount available in this year's appropriation. At the same time, you might discuss with him and report to the Department the manner in which you recommend that the balance of the funds be expended. It is understood, of course, that only necessary work will be undertaken.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. O'H. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.

McLennan, McFeely and Prior Limited, is also attached, from which it would appear that the installation of the Refrigerator would cost $455.00. In addition to this the insulating of the room would cost a further $182.00, unless the School perform the work themselves, in which case the estimated cost of the insulation would apparently be $124.00.\n\nI do not know what funds are available for work of this nature, so the matter is passed to you for your consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.O.N.

Daunt,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Daunt:\n\nI believe you have on file a letter from the Frigidaire people, McLennan, McFeely and Prior, with regard to installing a refrigerator in our School. I think too that the Kelvinator people through Marshall-Wells B.C. Limited put in a bid some time ago. On looking up our files I find the Marshall-Wells quotation was put in under date of August 26, 1935, at a total cost of $852 complete. Davies and Logan of Chilliwack are the local representatives. You will be able to compare this figure with the one handed in by the Frigidaire people, for whom Menzies Hardware is the local representative.\n\nI would like to emphasize again our need of such a plant. With four hundred pounds of milk a day to be taken care of and most of it used in the School, it is essential that we have proper facilities for taking care of this and other perishable foods. Now that we have a Milk House at the Barn, I intend to put in a Aerator by means of which the milk would be brought down at once from 95 degrees to a temperature as near 50 degrees as possible. Then if it were put at once into our refrigerator it would mean that the milk would be kept at a temperature below the point where bacteria spread freely. This would mean a great deal to us, as there will be days within the next two months and for the first two months following the opening of School, when we will lose milk. All through the Summer this is of course particularly true.\n\nIf it is at all possible I would appreciate it very much if the Department would give this installation their favorable consideration. This matter was first referred to in an estimate prepared in August 1935. I would be glad if you would forward this letter to the Department.\n\nThanking you I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.C.

Deant.\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nMr A.O'H. Daunt,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nJuly 17th, 1937.\n\nDear Mr Daunt:\n\nI beg to ask for authority from the Department for the following expenditure, the same to be a charge against the $2000.00 allotted for Repairs etc to Coqualeetza Residential School for the current School year.\n\nThe figures are based upon estimates secured from men doing the work along the lines indicated. All labour, other than that necessary for oversight, or for technical reasons, to be supplied by the School.\n\n1. For lining 4 Wash Rooms, 1 Cloak Room, and 1 Passage 4 feet high with lumber complete with Labor: $81.00\n\nThe walls referred to above are those in the Lavatories on the Boys' Side, in the basement, and in the two first Floor Wash Rooms, on the same side.\n\nThese walls were repaired by Robertson Brothers two years ago; the regular Plaster materials were used, but they have not stood up. I am sure, after conferring with others on this matter, that nothing but a wooden Wainscoting will be satisfactory. Vouchers for materials and labor will be submitted in detail. Cost not to exceed the above amount.\n\n2. For Re-shingling two outbuildings, $18.00\n\nShingles, No. 1, Estimated Cost: $54.00\n\nOne of these outbuildings is used as our Boat Shop. The other is one which we keep ready for quarantine purposes in an emergency, and it is used also for Boy Scout, or other activities for the time being.\n\nEstimate is for materials only, all work to be done under our Manual Training Instructor, and to be carried out by Senior Boys.\n\nINDIAN OFFICE\nNEW WESTMINSTER\nJULY 19 1937\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nA.O'N.D.\n\nFrom Page One, ----------------------------------------------- $135.00\n\n3. For new Kitchen Drain: Move one sink, if necessary; all materials, fittings, and labor to be supplied by the Plumber. (Exclusive of manual labor to make cutting for the drain) ----------------------------- 75.00\n\nThe above work is rendered necessary by the breakdown of the old drainage system. We have had great difficulty in carrying on until the end of the School year last month. It is impossible to get at these old drains, and the only way we could keep them open was by continuously blowing them out with steam. This we cannot do for another year. These old drains run into the walls, and cannot be followed, as we have been unable to secure plans of the same. All we know, is as far as we are able to explore with the steam hose. Apparently one of these drains runs under the Boiler Room floor.\n\nThe new drain will run across the Kitchen floor in front of the Kitchen Range, right to the outside wall. It will go through at a point opposite the Range, and then turn into the outside drain which at present takes away the dish water, and Kitchen refuse, and leads to the main drain to the settling tanks.\n\nThere will be clean out plugs on the inside, as the kitchen, and on the outside, at the point where it comes through the wall. This will enable us to insert a clean out rod both inside the building and out, for the entire length of the drain. The pipe used will be a four inch Soil Pipe and should obviate all trouble for years. The present pipe inside the building is only 2\".\n\n4. For 2 new water fronts for Kitchen Range, Pipe, all fittings and Labor -------------------------------------------- 35.00\n\nAt present we cannot get hot water although the fires are on from early morning. After consultation with Mr Arnall, there seems nothing to do but to install two new water fronts, as above. The old ones have been in for over twelve years, so far as I can learn. The range concerned is, of course, that in the main kitchen, a two fire box, two oven one.\n\nCarried forward ----------------------------------------------- $245.00\nRefit sink in Serving Pantry for washing dishes by steam, fittings and Plumber's work -------------- $245.00\n\nProvide 22 wire baskets for this @ $1.50 each -- 33.00\n\nThe above project entails the item under 3. At present dishes are washed on each of the tables in the dining room. In the process, in spite of our supervision, food scraps, bits of dish cloths etc find their way into the dishpan, and are carried out and emptied down the outside drain mentioned under Item 3. In spite of triple screens, much of this waste, at least in pulverized form, gets into the drain and plays havoc with its functioning.\n\nIn addition, flies are attracted by food particles left in these screens; the smell, at times is very objectionable, and the whole system is not in the best interests of the children for health reasons.\n\nUnder the new system, all dishes will be placed in wire baskets, and hosed off with steam into which a small quantity of water has been introduced. They will then be carried back to the tables and the tables will be set for the next meal. All scraps of food will be scraped off before dishes are placed in the baskets, and will be taken in containers direct to the barrels in which our table scraps are kept until used for the pigs.\n\nThus, dishes will be sterilized, they will not be subject to improper drying, and the clogging of the outside drain, smells, and fly dangers, will be obviated.\n\nI have discussed this change with Mr Arnall, and he assures me that it is quite feasible. Adequate care and supervision will be given during the washing of the dishes. Steam is at present laid to this sink, but the pipes lead to the bottom of the tubs, and is utilized to heat cold water until it is hot enough for washing purposes. Under the new system, valves will be placed on each of these pipes, and the water introduced in a common pipe leading to a short length of steam hose which will be used to direct the steam and water to the dishes in the baskets. Nothing but hot water and such grease as may adhere to the dishes will find its way into the drain.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nA.O'N.D. (4)\n\nBrought Forward from Page 3------------------------ $293.00\n\n6. For Sump in Student Dining Room ----------------- $15.00\n\nAt present we have no way of washing the Dining Room floor but by scrubbing. Much of the time this is done by small boys, and they do not get their scrub cloths properly rinsed during the work. This is not in the best interests of good health. Under proposed conditions, the floor would be sluiced off with the hose, and the excess water conveyed by means of the sump to the drain leading to the outside and to the settling tank just beyond the dining room wall.\n\nExpenditure is necessary for floor fittings, pipe and pipe fittings. All labor to be undertaken by the School. (Other than that needed for Plumber in installing fittings as above.)\n\nScrubbing would then be done by the boys using Deck brooms, and it could be done oftener as well.\n\n7. For Playgrounds:\n\nMany of the seats on the Girls' Side are in bad repair. Some of them are rotten and will have to be replaced. Swings must be replaced also. Estimated cost--$10.00\n\nOn the Boys' Side I would like to build a Hand Ball board 24' by 20'. It has been very hard to find ways to keep the boys' busy during play hours. Ball playing near School buildings is prohibited. It will give a fine opportunity for Team Play and be a fine form of exercise, and the use of the Board could be allowed for \"Kick Ball\", a form of play which is at present indulged in against the end of the Boiler Room. This is close to the Girls' side, and makes a problem of discipline. It also results in broken windows. Hand Ball could be played by boys of different ages, and at times when foot ball is not possible. Estimate for Hand Ball Board, Lumber only--$20.00\n\nTotal Estimates of above Repairs------$358.00\n\nCarried forward-----------------------------------\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nA.O'N.D. (5) Bro't forward---- $388.00\n\n8. For repairs to Plumbing in Lavatories and Toilets\n\nThere are a lot of repairs needed on both Boys' and Girls' sides. Connecting pipes to wash basins, and to toilets are leaking and will have to be replaced.\n\nEstimate for fittings and Plumber's wages $50.00\n\nTotal for above repairs-------- $388.00\n\nThe above amounts do not take into consideration painting, both inside and out of the main building and of the outside of Manual Training, Principal's House, Barns and other outbuildings. I shall make suggestions as to these items later, after further conference with those who can advise upon them.\n\nRespectfully Submitted:\n\nR.G.S./\n\nPRINCIPAL.\nSIR:\n\nWith reference to your telegram of July 12th, in which you instructed me to obtain a quotation from the Menzies Hardware Company, of Chilliwack, in connection with the proposed installation of a refrigeration service at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School,\n\nI beg to inform you that I telephoned Mr. Menzies, and asked him if he wished to submit an individual tender. He informed me that he did, which I may say, I could not quite understand, as I knew he was the Agent for McLennan, McFeely & Prior, who had already made a tender.

Daunt,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Daunt:\n\nI am enclosing herewith vouchers in quadruplicate for materials secured from the Valley Lumber Yards in connection with fitting up a Vegetable Room under the barn. I do not often go ahead without securing the Departmental authority, but something had to be done at once in order to save our vegetables. I had thought of getting a combined implement shed and vegetable house, and was making plans for it. This large room in the basement of the new barn was however available. I had it drained at School expense last Winter, but we were not sure that it would keep dry, and so I was somewhat undecided about using it. After investigating however, I found that it had no water in it even during the time of heavy rain, so I went ahead and had it fitted up.\n\nIt has given us a large room somewhat \"L\" shaped, approximately 36' long on each of two sides, and 18' wide. It is reached by a stairway from the main floor of the barn and can be locked securely. I have lengthened the air vents making them to lead from the floor of the barn to the floor of the vegetable room for the cold air, and from the ceiling of the vegetable room high up into the loft of the barn. We have sufficient bins and shelving to take care of all our vegetables.\n\nThe account is for materials only. The work was done by our Boat Builder and his helpers, and is a fine job. I am sure the Department will be pleased with the space we have made available in this way. I trust they will overlook my having gone ahead in this instance for the reasons given above, and will authorize payment of the account.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.C. SCOTT\nPRINCIPAL\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6442, file 880-5, part 2)\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. K.H. Daly\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter received from Reverend R.B. Cochrane, D.D., Secretary of the Board of Home Missions, The United Church of Canada, Toronto. You will note that this letter refers to a claim of the British Columbia Electric Railway Company against the Oquawka Indian Residential School, which is at Sardis, British Columbia. This building is owned by the Department, but the school is under the management of the United Church of Canada. Current expenses, such as payment for electricity, are met by the school management from the amount received from the Department for per capita grant.\n\nI would appreciate your advising me whether or not, in your opinion, it would be advisable to take this case to Court.\n\nDirector.\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nNovember 4th,\n1937.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRes: Claim of British Columbia Electric Ry. Co. against Coqualeetza Residential School.\n\nAs you probably know, for some years the electric power for the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School has been supplied by the British Columbia Electric Ry. Co. When Mr. Scott took over the principalship a few years ago, he called in a representative of the Company and he checked over all the wiring, meters, etc. However, on July 12th, 1936, Mr. L. McPhee, District Representative of the Company, wrote to Mr. Scott, making a claim for $5,482.93 (later revised to $5,583.03) for power allegedly used by the School and not paid for because of an alleged defect in the meter supplied by the Company.\n\nSince the date of the claim, our office has been in correspondence with the Company in regard to the matter. Mr. Beaton, my former colleague, in discussing it in Ottawa had his attention drawn by the Solicitor of your Department to the case of General Dairies Limited vs. Maritime Electric Co. Ltd., the decision on which he thought provided us with a good defense against this claim of the B.C. Electric Company. However, when, at the request of the Executive of the Board of Home Missions, we consulted the law firm of Clearihue & Strath in Victoria, B.C., it was pointed out by them that this case had been appealed to the Privy Council and that the latter body had given a decision a few months ago, reversing the decision of the Court of Appeal. This case will be found in the Maritime Electric Company vs. General Dairies Limited 1937 1 B.L.R. 609. As a result of this decision of the Privy Council, the law firm I have mentioned above advise us that, in their opinion, the B.C. Electric Company could collect this bill, and, if it were not paid, the Company could turn off the electric current from the School.\n\nThen we suggested that the Solicitors negotiate for a settlement with the B.C. Electric Company, and they write now to say that the Company will accept $1,000. in full settlement, to be paid at the rate of $32.50 a month.\nNow, our difficulty is that Mr. Scott has a deficit in the School account at the present moment and our Home Mission appropriation from the funds of the Church is exhausted. We have no available money with which to meet this unexpected\u2014and to my mind\u2014unfair claim. It does seem to us that the Indian Department ought to help us out in this unfortunate situation. It was no fault of Mr. Scott's, nor of our Board, that the Company's meter did not register the full amount of current which it is said was used. All the bills which were presented by the Electric Company were paid promptly. The Coqualeetza School is an enterprise which is carried on jointly by the Government and the United Church, and the per capita grant from the Government is not enough, of course, to make it possible to have any reserve from year to year.\n\nAs you know, the United Church is not a business organization and it is purely on charitable and Christian grounds that we are engaged in this work. My submission is that your Department ought to, at least, bear the major part of this account.\n\nWill you be good enough to bring the matter to the attention of Dr. McGill and see if something substantial cannot be done.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nRBC MLT\n\n[Signature]\nEX'D.\n\nYour file: 1-5-B\n\nOttawa, October 19, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant, you may arrange for the purchase of the sixteen dishwashing baskets requested by the Principal of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupp. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA.O.M. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nSIR:\n\nI beg to forward you herewith, a letter from the Reverend R.C. Scott, Principal of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, in which he requests to be supplied with sixteen more wire dishwashing baskets, for use at the school.\n\nTwenty-two such baskets were originally supplied, under authority of your letter, No. 153-0-5, of July 30th, 1937, and the attached communication explains the need of the additional number now asked for.\n\nThe cost will be $24.00, and I would recommend that permission be given to make this purchase, as a charge against the balance of the credit available for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nENCL.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDear Mr Daunt:\n\nI am glad to report that our new system of washing dishes with steam by means of the wire baskets kindly supplied by the Department is a great improvement on the old way. It has been especially valuable during this Measles epidemic. Dr McQuarrie and Dr Henderson both seemed pleased that we were handling the work in this way.\n\nIn fact, I have made it thoroughly effective. I really need some more baskets. These supplied, take the large plates and the knives and forks at one time, but the \"stalls\" are much too high for the saucers. When these are put in, they slip through and lodge one on the top of the other in the bottom of the basket. They cannot be cleaned in that fashion. So we have to put them in the sink which is not very good in itself, and when they are finished, the basket from which they were taken has gone back into the dining room and confusion results.\n\nIf we had another 16 baskets, we could put the cups and saucers into them, and thus take care of all the dishes on each table at the one time, and ensure their getting the maximum benefit from the steam and hot water. The saucers could be washed down while the baskets were in the washing room, and would be ready for the dishes and to be reset upon their return.\n\nMr Fordred, our Engineer, takes charge of the washing and handles the steam, so that there is no danger to the children in any way. The confusion resulting from the inability to handle ALL the dishes belonging to each table, at the one time, does not help to get the girls into the way of the new system. I am anxious that it should be a complete success and would greatly appreciate it if the Department would allow me to secure the additional 16 baskets. These would cost the same as the first set\u2014$1.50 each. Even though the sides are lower, being just half the height of the baskets for the plates, there is an extra compartment put in which makes up for the lesser amount of material used.\n\nI am setting down a rough sketch of the basket I need.\n\nHoping for a favorable reply from the Department, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL.\n\nP.S. The above would, of course, be a charge against the sum authorized for repairs for the current year. There is just over $1000.00 of the original $2000.00 still remaining, according to my count, so that there would appear to be room to include the above. It is getting late to attempt outside painting now.\nNEW WESTMINSTER, B.C.\nOctober 5th, 1937.\n\nDepartment File No.153-0-5.\n\nSIR:-\n\nWith reference to Departmental letter dated the 27th of September, I beg to return herewith, Agency Voucher No.442 in favour of Messrs.

Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: Claim of British Columbia Electric Ry. Co. against Coqualeetza Residential School.\n\nAs you probably know, for some years the electric power for the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School has been supplied by the British Columbia Electric Ry. Co. When Mr. Scott took over the principalship a few years ago, he called in a representative of the Company and he checked over all the wiring, meters, etc. However, on July 12th, 1935, Mr. L. McPhee, District Representative of the Company, wrote to Mr. Scott, making a claim for $3,493.93 (later revised to $2,583.03) for power allegedly used by the School and not paid for because of an alleged defect in the meter supplied by the Company.\n\nSince the date of the claim, our office has been in correspondence with the Company in regard to the matter. Mr. Beaton, my former colleague, in discussing it in Ottawa had his attention drawn by the Solicitor of your Department to the case of General Dairies Limited vs. Maritime Electric Co. Ltd., the decision on which he thought provided us with a good defence against this claim of the B.C. Electric Co. However, when, at the request of the Executive of the Board of Home Missions, we consulted the law firm of Clearihue & Straith in Victoria, B.C., it was pointed out by them that this case had been appealed to the Privy Council and that the latter body had given a decision a few months ago, reversing the decision of the Court of Appeal. This case will be found in the Maritime Electric Company vs. General Dairies Limited 1937 1 D.L.R. 609. As a result of this decision of the Privy Council, the law firm I have mentioned above advise us that, in their opinion, the B.C. Electric Company could collect this bill, and, if it were not paid, the Company could turn off the electric current from the School.\n\nThen we suggested that the Solicitors negotiate\nfor a settlement with the B.C. Electric Company, and they write now to say that the Company will accept $1,000 in full settlement, to be paid at the rate of $32.50 a month.\n\nNow, our difficulty is that Mr. Scott has a deficit in the School account at the present moment and our Home Mission appropriation from the funds of the Church is exhausted. We have no available money with which to meet this unexpected - and to my mind - unfair claim. It does seem to us that the Indian Department ought to help us out in this unfortunate situation. It was no fault of Mr. Scott's, nor of our Board, that the Company's meter did not register the full amount of current which it is said was used. All the bills which were presented by the Electric company were paid promptly. The Coqualeetza School is an enterprise which is carried on jointly by the Government and the United Church, and the per capita grant from the Government is not enough, of course, to make it possible to have any reserve from year to year.\n\nAs you know, the United Church is not a business organization and it is purely on charitable and Christian grounds that we are engaged in this work. My submission is that your Department ought to, at least, bear the major part of this account.\n\nWill you be good enough to bring the matter to the attention of Dr. McGill and see if something substantial cannot be done.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n(Sgd) R.B.

We can empty the School in one minute and a half on regular drills by way of these Fire Escapes. Only when the drill is in the daytime, do the pupils use the ordinary exits, and then only from the classrooms.\n\nThere is need however, for extending our Fire Alarm system so that it can be heard in the kitchens and laundry. There also ought to be one bell outside, so that in case of a daytime fire, staff members and older pupils on Play-grounds, in Manual Training Buildings or the Barns, could be summoned to help.\n\nOur Fire Equipment is checked over regularly. Although this is a semi-fireproof building, I have a Night Watchman on duty from the first of November to March 31st. After this date, patrols are resumed by men members of staff at ten o'clock and at midnight. The engineer is on duty in the morning at six o'clock. He lights the fires and remains on duty. Staff members and older pupils have been instructed as to their position and duties. Notices giving these positions and duties, and the names of appointees, are posted on all floors and general fire regulations are posted on the Bulletin Board in the main corridor.\n\nI shall bring the contents of this letter to the attention of Staff members at our next Staff Meeting.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRCS/W\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is noted that you took action on the authority given to the Commissioner in official letter of September 21, 1937, file No. 153-0-14.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

C.\nSIR:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated February 8th, informing me that as there has been so much delay in forwarding requests for repairs and purchases for Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, and so many unexpected demands have been made on the Departmental appropriation from other sources, that it is impossible to do more than supply the urinals at a cost of approximately $625.74.\n\nI instructed the Reverend Principal accordingly, and am now in receipt of the attached letter, regarding a Gang Plough, and which is self explanatory.\n\nAuthority to the amount of $150.00 was given the Indian Commissioner to make this purchase in your letter, File No.153-0-14 of September 21st, 1937, and the implement ordered by the Reverend R.C. Scott, who, however did not take delivery. The plough is now at Chilliwack, and before authorizing him to accept it, I shall be obliged if you will inform me whether the authority, in question, still holds good, in view of your more recent letter.\n\nThe purchase undoubtedly should have been completed last Fall, but the Reverend Mr. Scott was then enthused with the idea of a Tractor, of which I did not approve, and so the matter dragged. The plough is necessary, as they have to borrow one each year, which is a poor principle, and if it is possible to allow this purchase, I am in favour of it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.O.P.

Daunt,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Daunt:\n\nIn regard to our conversation on the 16th instant with regard to the unexpended balance of the $2000.00 allotted to Coqualeetza for new equipment and repairs for the current year, I hope that the Department will allow the purchase of the Gang Plow, for which I requisitioned on September 10th, 1937. You informed me by telephone that it had been authorized. Following a conversation with Captain Barry regarding an attempt to link up the School with the Indian farmers on adjoining Reserves, I wrote the Department through Mr. Indian Commissioner McKay, with regard to supplying a small tractor. You have a copy of that letter under date of September 29th, 1937. Thus you will see that I brought this matter to the attention of the Department quite early in the year, and as soon as Commissioner McKay informed me of the inability of the Department to purchase a tractor, I immediately got in touch with Mr. Ironsides of Chilliwack agent for the Massey-Harris Company, who ordered a Two Bottom Horse Drawn Gang Plow. This Plow is now in Chilliwack awaiting delivery. It was ordered in good faith by me on the assumption that the balance of the $2000.00 would be available for Coqualeetza throughout the School year.\n\nI would also like to say, that if I have seemed a bit slow in availing myself of this balance, in every respect it has been with the idea of keeping it as a sort of insurance against unforeseen expenses which often occur as the School year passes. Consequently I do hope that the Department can see its way clear to grant us this Plow. It is quite beyond the dignity of this School, to go on borrowing equipment of this kind, and we really cannot get our work done without it. I may say we have horses on the farm for the above implement.\n\nTrusting that the Department will allow the above authorization to stand, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.C.

This letter came to hand this afternoon, and after conference over the Telephone with Mr Farquharson a few minutes ago, I told him I thought it best to send the tender right on to Ottawa direct by Air Mail, as one of the firms from Vancouver had told me the tenders were to be in Ottawa by the 25th inst. I phoned Mr Launt's office in New Westminster, and received advice to do this, although Mr Launt was not in at the time. I trust this will be in accord with your mind. It seemed the best thing to do since the matter was being handled from Ottawa.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nREV. R.C. SCOTT, B.A.\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6442, file 880-5, part 2)\nOttawa, February 13, 1938.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER:\n\nThe Cocolaletza Indian Residential School, at Sardis, B.C., is owned by the Department but is operated under the auspices of the United Church of Canada. They obtain their electric current from the British Columbia Electric Railway Company. Last year the Company checked the meters in use at the school and found that they were defective and that this condition had been in effect for the preceding two or three years. This resulted in the meters registering under consumption, and, as the Company based their bills on the meter readings, they did not receive payment for the actual amount of electric current that had been used. After carefully checking the meters the Company submitted to the Principal of the Cocolaletza School an account for $2,562.03, which amount they computed was due them but had not been paid.\n\nAs the school authorities had paid the amount requested by the company during the period in question and as the discrepancy arose owing to defective meters owned by the company, the school authorities took the position that they were not responsible for payment of the claim for $2,562.03. The Principal wrote the Department at that time and asked our opinion, and it was found that a similar case had occurred in the province of New Brunswick. This was the case of General Dairies Limited versus Maritime Electric Company. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the General Dairies Limited was not liable for the payment but the Privy Council reversed this decision and gave judgment in favour of the Company.\n\nIn view of the information contained in the above...\nabove paragraph, it would appear that the British Columbia Electric Company can legally collect the amount from the authorities of the Coqualeetza Residential School.\n\nWithin the last few months, the Company has offered to settle its claim against the school for $1,000.00. As you are aware, the school authorities pay for the electric current from the amount received for per capita grant. The authorities of the United Church of Canada point out that at the present time they are operating the Coqualeetza Residential School at a loss and are obliged to provide the deficit from their Mission funds. They have, therefore, appealed to the Department to assist them in meeting the claim of the British Columbia Electric Company. In view of all the circumstances, as outlined above, I feel that we should assist them to the extent of at least $500, and I enclose, for your consideration Memorandum to Council, which, I trust, will receive the approval of the Honourable the Minister.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, 13th February, 1929.\n\nPRICES FOR THE CLERK OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL:\n\nApproval for the expenditure of the sum of\nFive Hundred Dollars ($500.00) towards claim for expenses\nof cost of electric current supplied Coqualeetza\nResidential School.\n18th February, 1936.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL:\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT the Cowichan Indian Residential School (United Church of Canada), Bardsis, British Columbia, obtains its electrical power from the British Columbia Electric Railway Company;\n\nTHAT the above mentioned company recently discovered that, owing to defective meters, the amount charged the Cowichan Residential School for the past three years was $2,503.03 less than it should have been;\n\nTHAT the company first made a claim on the Cowichan Residential School for the above-mentioned amount but have recently offered to settle for One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00);\n\nTHAT in a similar case recently tried before the Privy Council it was ruled that the defendant was obliged to pay even though the meters were defective;\n\nTHAT the United Church of Canada, under whose auspices the Cowichan Residential School is operated, have appealed to the Department for financial assistance in paying the $1,000.00 claim of the British Columbia Electric Railway Company and have urged that Department provide at least half of the claim.\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to recommend that an amount of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) be allowed the Cowichan Indian Residential School toward the cost of the claim and that same be chargeable to Vote 169 - Indian Affairs Branch - Mines and Resources.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 9, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of January 27 in connection with requests received from the Principal of the Coqualeetsza Indian Residential School I regret that owing to the fact that these requirements were not previously brought to the Department's attention it is not possible to authorize the total expenditure requested by Reverend Mr. Scott.\n\nHowever, the Purchasing Agent has been supplied with the information regarding the estimate made by Metals Limited of Vancouver for installing new toilets and it is expected that an order will be placed in the near future.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Mr. Scott.\n\nHowever, the Purchasing Agent has been supplied with the information regarding the estimate made by Metals Limited of Vancouver for installing the new toilets and an order will be placed in the near future.\n\nIn connection with this estimate which totals $525.74 it is noted that one item reads \"50 feet 2 inch galvanized pipe at 4\u00a2 -- $20.00\".

Daunt,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Daunt:\n\nI am enclosing herewith Requisition Forms in triplicate for extra seating. The need is all in our three lower rooms. Our new children seem to be getting more nearly the grade age in White schools, and consequently our Primary, Junior and Intermediate classes are more crowded.\n\nIn our Primary Room we have forty-six pupils with forty desks. Miss Enves has been getting along using small tables, but it is not very satisfactory. The large class is due to our keeping the Primary children in school all day. They are very much better there than running about, and they are not big enough to do any work. I am asking for five No.5 desks for this room. In our Junior Room we have thirty-five desks, but we have forty-one in the afternoon class, and here again the teacher is getting along with improvised seats. We really need at least four No.4 seats. We can improvise for a couple of pupils well enough, but to seat six in improvised fashion is out of the question. In our Intermediate Room we have forty-two in the afternoon class with thirty-six desks. Here again we can improvise for three without difficulty, but we need very badly three No.2 desks, for the Intermediate classroom.\n\nI trust that the Department may be able to furnish these, as it will facilitate the work and discipline of the classrooms greatly.\n\nThanking you I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.C.

A copy of the Rev. Principal's letter to Mr. Daunt is attached hereto in which the various items making up the sum of $980.84 are listed.\n\nImproved toilet and urinal arrangements are urgently needed at this school, and it is not understood why the Reverend Principal did not take action earlier in the year to seek authority for this expenditure and arrange to have the work carried out during the summer holidays, especially when he was aware that a sum of $2000.00 had been set aside by the Department to cover cost of repairs and new equipment.\n\nAuthority has already been received for the purchase of a new gang plow, which it is the intention of Principal Scott to purchase at an early date.\n\nA set of disc harrows is necessary and should form part of the farm equipment.\n\nThe application is recommended for favorable consideration, and if funds are not available to take care of all the work, it is respectfully suggested that the items should be considered in the following order of importance:\n\n(a) Urinals and toilet equipment, including toilet valves - $653.34\n(b) Repairs to eaves troughing and drain pipes, school and barn - $12.00\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\n(c) One...\n(c) One gang plow - $142.50\n(d) One set of disc harrows - $69.00\n(e) Re-shingling of boat shop and granary - $54.00\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 8, Vancouver, B.C.\nMr A.O'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nJanuary 20th, 1938.\n\nDear Mr Daunt:\n\nI believe there is an amount of $982.67 which remains unexpended of the $2000.00 allowed for new equipment and repairs for the year 1937-8 which is now drawing to a close. As there does not seem to be any need for waiting further for what might be termed emergency items, I wish to submit the following list of really important items which I trust the Department will give its sympathetic consideration.\n\nDisc Harrows: ----------------------------------------------- $ 89.00\n\nThe Department was good enough to authorize the purchase of a Gang Plow, and for the same reason I am asking for a set of Disc Harrows, namely, we have none of our own. For years we have borrowed and have had to await the time when neighbors could lend us theirs. As the years have passed this has been more and more difficult until now it has become exceedingly uncomfortable, and it results in loss to the farm through delays. I have taken this item up with the Massey Harris Company through their local agent, Frasides Ltd., of Chilliwack, and they have put in a set of 12 suitable for a three horse team, and supply carrier for the tongue for the same at the above price. I trust that the Department will grant us this; it is fundamentally necessary for the farm work and for the training of our farm boys as well.\n\n2. Urinals and Toilet Equipment: ----------------------------- $ 683.34\n\nNot long ago, I believe Inspector Barry sent in a report criticizing very severely our toilets and lavatory conditions generally. I wrote to the Department through you on that matter. At the same time, it is very urgent that we get the items listed at the foot of this paragraph. I may say that I have had Dr McQuarrie and Dr Henderson, our local Medical Health Officer look over these premises and equipment and they both declare that it is \"impossible\" for us to keep these toilets free from odor owing to the fact that the lime has penetrated the floor materials at the front of the toilets, whereas on both sides do their part, and while I do not for a moment admit the situation to be just as Inspector Barry has apparently presented it, still it is imperative that something be done to lessen the danger to floors, with consequent odors, and perhaps menace to health. Certainly it is prejudicial to comfort or satisfaction to any of us.\n\nCarried forward: -------------------------------------------- $ 772.34\nI took this matter up with the Department some two years ago, and submitted prices etc., but nothing has been done. I feel that if now, after receiving reports as noted above, if nothing is done, the responsibility for conditions will have to rest with the Department. I shall still do my best in any case.\n\nWe have done away with the bed room pails in the dormitories, and have put in partitions in the corridors so that the toilets are not liable to the boys during the night. At present they have to use the toilet bowls and it is in this way the floors become saturated with the dripping of urine, a certain amount of which is bound to find its way into the floors. The use of urinals\u2014a 1-Stall in each of the upper Lavatories would lessen this difficulty at least fifty per cent, if not to completely eliminate it.\n\nThe 2-Stall Urinals are for the Basement Lavatories where the boys wash and use toilet facilities at least three times a day. I may say that we are very much pleased with the way the boys are responding to the endeavor we are making to give them better toilet facilities, such as toilet paper, deodorizers etc., and I feel sure that if we had these urinals, they would give hearty support to our efforts to improve conditions. I would urge this item upon the Department for most favorable consideration.\n\nThe matter of the new valves for both Boys' and Girls' sides, and for one Staff Lavatory, is almost an emergency one. In fact it is all that the old valves have been in use since the original installation. I have renewed diaphragms, gaskets and other parts, but it is quite impossible to make these old ones function. In some cases they have had to be turned off, and are standing useless\u2014one of the facts which Inspector Begg noted\u2014and they simply cannot be made to work further.\n\nThe list, with items and costs follows:\n\n| Item Description | Quantity | Cost |\n|------------------|----------|------|\n| Senior Boys' Basement Lavatory\u20141-2 Stall Urinal | 1 | $130.12 |\n| Junior Boys' No. 1 Lavatory\u20141-2 Stall Urinal | 1 | $130.12 |\n| Senior Boys' No. 2 Lavatory\u20141-2 Stall Urinal | 1 | $73.60 |\n| Senior Boys' No. 3 & 4 Lavatories\u20141-Stall Urinal | 1 | $73.60 |\n| Fittings\u2014For 2-Stall Urinals | 1 | $30.00 ea. | $30.00 |\n| Labor\u2014For 2-Stall Lavatory 3 & 4 | 1 | $20.00 |\n| Fittings\u2014For 1-Stall Lavatory 3 & 4 | 1 | $8.00 |\n| Labor\u2014For 1-Stall Lavatory 3 & 4 | 1 | $8.00 |\n| Extra Pipe (For 2-1 Stall Urinals No's 1 & 2) | 1 | $30.00 |\n| Cement | 5 Sacks @ .90 | $4.50 |\n| Labor, for Overseeing Cement layer | 1 | $15.00 |\n\nTotal estimated cost\u2014$628.76\n\nThe above estimates I have secured from Metals Limited of Vancouver. The labor for installation was done by accredited Plumber from Chillik.\n2. Urinals etc Cont'd. Brought forward: $772.34\n\nAll rough labor, apart from the Overseers Cement work to be done by the boys of the Manual Training Department of the School. The difference in cost of fittings on above Urinals is due to the different outlets which must be found for the same. All materials to be submitted with itemized cost, and labor costs to be set down at hourly rates, with the time taken etc.\n\nToilet Valves:\n- For Jr Boys' Basement Lavatory 1 Valve\n- Sr Girls' 1 Valve\n- Jr Girls' 1 Valve\n- Sr Staff Toilet, Girls' Side 1 Valve\nTotal 5 VALVES @ $10.92 = $54.60 (Included in total above)\n\n3. Re-shingling of two outbuildings: $54.00\n\nOne of these buildings is our Boat Shop, and the other is a building we are using for a Grainery. Both are in great need of re-roofing. This work, apart from the 15,000 shingles needed, to be done by the boys of the Manual training Department of the School. This item was authorized some time ago, but we have not been able to get the work done. This was largely due to the Measles Epidemic of last fall, which made it impossible to carry out plans. The work will be done as soon as the weather permits.\n\n4. Gang Plow: $142.50\n\nThis item also was authorized previously. The Plow is now in Chilliwack ready for delivery as soon as we need it for the Spring work.\n\n5. Repairs to Mestroughing and Down pipes, on Barn and on School Main Building: $12.00\n\nThere may be some saving on these figures, but they are very close. The above amount, taken along with $1077.35 leaves the small balance of $1,83 out of the grant of $2000.00 given the School for Repairs and New Equipment. Trusting the Department may see its way clear to authorize the above items, so that we may get the work done with despatch, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Then the second gong would be put on the end of the Boiler Room outside, which would throw the sound to the barns and Manual Training Building quite easily. As there are at least a dozen boys and the Farm Instructor doing milking both morning and evening, it is quite important that they should hear the alarm in case of fire.\n\nI would also like to have three small Fire Extinguishers added to our equipment, one to be placed in the Sewing Room, and one in the Mending Room, and one in a dormitory above the Manual Training Building, which we sometimes use.\n\nI would also respectfully draw your attention to the item in my estimates for 1938, for two fifty foot lengths of inch and a quarter Fire Hose, estimated cost $90.00, which should be provided not later than this Summer.\n\nThanking you for your cooperation at all times,\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.C.

In the estimate I put in a price of $84.00, but on consultation with the Singer Sewing Machine Company, their recommendation was for a 31-K-15 machine with a motor, the total cost to be $113.\n\nWe have only one sewing machine on the Boys' Side, and the boys themselves are doing most of the mending of their own clothes. At present they do a great deal of sewing, patching, etc., by hand, but it is quite impossible to keep up with the demand. It is a fine thing that the boys are learning to look after their clothes, but as I have said, there is such a volume of it that they ought to have equipment to take care of it. There will still be plenty of mending to be done by hand, but the surplus which has to remain over from week to week, would be gotten rid of if they had the machine we are asking for. Mr. Peake, our Boys Supervisor, is a tailor by trade, and it is owing to his oversight and training that the boys are able to do this work.\n\nI would greatly appreciate it if the Department would see fit to honour our request. We have 125 boys, so that you will see a machine such as we are asking for would be quite in order.\n\nThanking you for your interest and help at all times, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nR.C.

Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nMany times throughout the year I have recalled your letter to me under date of May 5th, 1937, File 153-0-5 in which you stated that consideration was being given to the installation of two or three Moving Picture Equipments in some of the Schools. Once again I would like to bring before you our need of better facilities along this line. Our small 16 mm. Silent Machine has been in use a long time and before long will need either extensive repairs or renewal. Since my first letter, the library of 16 mm. films available for Schools has been largely increased, so that I am not now so much concerned, about a 35 mm. as compared with the 16 mm.\n\nLast night Rev. A.R. Lett, Principal of St. George's School at Lytton, visited us enroute home from Vancouver, and gave us a very fine picture show, using his new Sound Machine, and this has increased my anxiety to secure some such equipment. I find that not only Companies carrying 16 mm. films for rental have increased their libraries, but Government Departments and University Extension groups and the Board of School Trustees of Vancouver have provided libraries which are available to Schools such as ours. The educational factor in the showing of these films is very strong. No amount of teaching or reading for instance, could have given to our children the conception of the Fraser Valley, the rolling country, mountains and lakes of the Interior from Lytton to Telkwa, B.C., as did the showing of Mr. Lett's films last evening.\n\nIn addition to the educational needs, there is still the need for providing recreation owing to the strict quarantine which we are placed under for nearly two thirds of the School Year. Between Measles in the School before Christmas, and the amount of Whooping Cough, Scarlet Fever and Chicken Pox in the surrounding community since Christmas,\nMr. R.A. Hoey\n\nApril 8, 1938\n\nwe have been left to ourselves to provide for our children's needs. Again let me say that I feel the quarantine is amply justified, as the health of the School has been excellent since Christmas. With the exception of a few mild cases of Chicken-pox, we have had little or no sickness.\n\nHoping that Coqualeetza may be one of the schools favored with the installation which you have in mind, and assuring you of my willingness to cooperate in any reasonable scheme which the Department may evolve,\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.C.

The couplings are brass with two lugs upon which we use a spanner, and there are five threads inside the coupling which seem to me to be the ordinary pipe thread.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for British Columbia,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs intimated in our conversation with you a day or two ago, we consider that the installation of a vertical boiler at the Coqualeetza Indian School is not of the most economical type, as when the boiler is under working conditions for laundry and sterilizing purposes, it has to be forced so as to maintain the head of steam required; and from this viewpoint we would suggest the consideration of the installation of a boiler of the horizontal type, which we consider would be better suited for the requirements. It would be much more economical to operate as it would not require to be forced as a steady head of steam can be maintained at a very low operating cost.\n\nFurthermore, with this type of boiler the steam space is such that there always would be available a reserve amount of steam.\n\nFurthermore, with the horizontal type of boiler much easier firing conditions are required, and with the travel of the gases being in a horizontal position you do not have the quick pull through that you have with the vertical type of boiler.\n\nWe would propose in this connection the supplying of a horizontal return tubular boiler complete in accordance with the requirements of the B.C. Inspection Act for a minimum working pressure of 155#, and with a heating surface of 155 square feet.\nInstead of the ordinary brick setting we propose supplying steel casing made of 1/4\" plate with connecting angles for bolting the panels of the casing together, and the interior of the casing would be lined with one inch of asbestos and 4 1/2\" of brick, with the exception of the fire box portion which would be 3\" thick.\n\nThis boiler complete with all steam mountings, and necessary castings for hand firing, completely connected up with suitable smoke pipe, etc., and including the removing of the old boiler would be at a price of One thousand three hundred and eighty-seven dollars ($1,387.00). This also being inclusive of all carriage and sales tax and installation charges.\n\nThis price is somewhat higher than that quoted by us on the vertical installation, but in the long run it would be a cheaper installation owing to the saving effected in operation.\n\nTrusting this proposal will have your consideration, and awaiting your further word, we remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nVANCOUVER ENGINEERING WORKS LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Manager\nVictoria, B.C.,\nDate: June 29th, 1938.\n\nMr. C.

[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6442, file 88-5, part 3)\nExtract from Inspector Barry's report dated January 20, 1939.\n\nI turned on the valves of the three outside hydrants and discovered that there was no water in the pipes that supply these outside hydrants. Water to the hydrants comes to them from inside the school. The pressure in the Sardis town supply is low in any case, about 40 pounds, and because of the size of the various supply pipes inside the school the pressure at the outside hydrants is too low for much success in fighting a fire of any size. As it would not be possible to increase the pressure much in any event I am not making any special recommendation at the present time. I just wish the Department to be aware that in case of fire at this school we shall have to depend mainly on chemical extinguishers, of which there are a number and these have been tested lately.\n\n(Sgd.) Gerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nExtract from Major MacKay's letter of January 31, 1939.\n\nThe Inspector's observations on the water supply and fire fighting arrangements have been noted. Although I am not familiar with the system, it would appear from the information supplied by the Inspector that the point of diversion for supply of water for fire fighting purposes should be to the main pipe before it enters the school and not as present installed. This point of diversion should be so installed and protected that the supply for fire fighting purposes could be turned on immediately as required at any season of the year. I am asking Mr. Daunt to examine the system and submit suggestions as to how it can be improved and made more effective, using the present source of supply.\n\n(Sgd.) D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 2, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd ultimo you may purchase material at a cost not exceeding $200.00 for manual training purposes at the Coqualeetza Indian residential school.\n\nWhen forwarding the account you should distinctly state on it that the material was secured in order to allow the boys to get practical training in vocational work and that the expenditures should be charged to B.C. Special.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nAn application has been received from Mr. R.C. Scott, Principal of Coqualeetza Residential School, through the New Westminster Agency office, for assistance to the extent of $200.00 to purchase materials required to make certain improvements to two cottages on the school property to provide accommodation for certain members of his staff.\n\nThe amount applied for is to be used entirely for the purchase of materials, the carpenter and other work to be done by the senior boys of the school, under supervision, as a Manual Training project. No provision was made in either the current year's estimates or those submitted for 1939-40 to provide for such an expenditure, but as the proposed work would provide an excellent opportunity for the older boys to receive some practical training in carpenter and other work, I would recommend the application for favorable consideration should funds be available from unexpended balances.\n\nThe application was referred to Inspector Barry, a copy of whose reply is enclosed, together with a copy of Mr. Scott's letter to Mr. Indian Agent Daunt in the matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosure\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nP.O.Box 444,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nJanuary 20, 1939.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have read with some care an application from Rev. R.C. Scott, Principal of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, dated January 16th, in which he requests that approval be given for the expenditure of some $200.00 for materials in connection with the accommodation of certain members of his school staff.\n\nI may say at once that I am very anxious that the services of Mr. Huddleston be retained as Boat Builder at this school. The retention on the staff of instructors who are married men, and who are well adapted for the work, is a very important factor in regard to the future of the School.\n\nCould this matter, please, be considered as a Manual Training Project? The cost of materials only is being asked for and even here if the sum of $200.00 is exceeded the school authorities will be responsible for the balance. The boys, under supervision, will do the work and thus learn the best way to make such improvements to their own homes on the various Reserves.\n\nI would therefore strongly recommend that not more than $200.00 be set aside for the above mentioned Manual Training Project if there is any available fund from which such a sum might be obtained so late in the Fiscal Year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry.\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nMr. A. O'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nRe: Farmer's Cottage at Coqualeetza.\n\nDear Mr. Daunt:\n\nOn August 3rd, 1934, File 1-8-B, I took up with the Department through you, the matter of accommodation for our farmer, for even at that time, I could see that if we were to keep efficient help, one would have to provide for a married man. This has been my experience ever since. I had to pay rent for a cottage for Captain P.F. Pirie until the beginning of this School year, when Mr. R. Carter became Farm Instructor upon the resignation of Captain Pirie. Up to now Mr. Carter has been living in a small cottage just behind the residence, but it is totally inadequate, as he has four children, and there is only one bedroom, and another sort of enclosed verandah space, which they are using for the time being as another bedroom. As his children are growing up, it is absolutely necessary that he have more accommodation. Consequently, I had a cottage moved from down near the Boat Shop, to a position on the left of the driveway as you proceed to the Preventorium. This was done at School expense, at a cost of $55.00.\n\nThe case for accommodation for the Farm Instructor has been emphasized by my experience with the Boat Builder, Mr. R. Huddleston. As you know, we have been most fortunate in having an instructor of the type of Mr. Huddleston, who not only understands his business, but has a way of getting his instruction over to the boys who have worked with him in the Boat Shop. He got married just over two years ago, and then because I had no accommodation at the School, and of course because he thought he was going to better himself, he resigned and we lost his services. During the Fall Term, I interviewed several Boat Builders, but was not able to secure a suitable man. Either he was a really good man and wanted too much money, or they were men of doubtful standing in their work, and men whom I could not be at all sure of fitting into the life of the School as an instructor. However, I am glad to say, for the School's sake, we have been able to re-engage Mr. Huddleston, and if I can get accommodation for him and his family here...\nat the School, he is quite willing to again undertake an instructor's position and I hope by the end of this month we will be again busy in our Boat Shop. As the majority of our boys will be fishermen when they leave, I am sure the Department will be heartily behind this phase of our School work.\n\nFrom the foregoing, you will see that my problem is one of accommodation for both the Farm Instructor and the Boat Builder. Having moved the afore mentioned cottages, I have now two cottages which could be fitted up if I could get the help of the Department. I took this up with Inspector Barry last week, and he was of the opinion that the work of reconditioning these cottages under the supervision of our Manual Training Instructor, would be very valuable training for our senior boys. It would be necessary however, for me to secure the materials. When I wrote in 1934, my scheme was to build a bungalow for the Farm Instructor at a cost of $820.81. This the Department was not willing to undertake, but if they would now be agreeable to allowing us $200 for necessary materials, we could fix up both of these cottages, and thus have accommodation for these two very necessary instructors. All work would be done by the Manual Training staff and the senior boys. The materials needed would include:- replacement of doors and windows, wall board, painting, kalsomine, chimney repairs, shingling and bathroom equipment, septic tank, piping in water and water connections. Itemized statements of description, amount and cost of materials would be submitted to the Department in the usual way, the total cost not to exceed $200. All charges submitted will be for materials only, the work to be done by our senior boys as a Manual Training project, and any cost over and above the $200 would have to be absorbed by the School.\n\nFrom my knowledge of Indian villages, that is exactly what is needed in very many of them, namely a reconstruction of the houses. In many of these villages, they have water piped to the homes, and the training that these boys would get in the above project, ought to be valuable both as training and as a suggestion of what can be done with an old building.\n\nI trust that you may see your way clear to recommend this expenditure on the part of the Department, and as I have said, I feel sure it will be a very practical training for these boys, and will help to solve the problem of accommodation for staff, which has been a very pressing one for the School.\n\nThanking you for your interest at all times, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"R.

When you visited the Department you were informed that money was available for this purpose, but no authority whatever was given to you to proceed with the work.\n\nAs you are aware, there are very definite regulations in force now, requiring that all material be purchased through our Purchasing Branch, and it is also necessary to consult our Head Office before employing anyone to do work at a residential school for which the Department is expected to pay.\n\nSince you were in Ottawa I have been expecting to hear from you every day, giving the quantities of paint required and other information regarding the painting of the Coqualeetza school, but your letter of the 24th instant is the first communication that has been received in connection with this matter since you were here.\n\nPlease let me have your explanation regarding your action in this matter at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nReferring to our conversation when in Ottawa in April, with regard to getting the paint so that we could do the work ourselves on the smaller buildings, I beg to say that I have received the enclosed statement from Davies and Logan of Chilliwack. They tendered on the whole job, but there was so little difference between any one of the three tenders, that I felt it better to give the contract for the main building, the Principal's residence and the Manual Training building to Menzies Hardware, and they are now at work, although the weather has been so wet that it has been exceedingly hard to make much headway.\n\nYour suggestion was I think, in consultation with Mr. Phelan, that we might get the paint on the enclosed list and charge it to the B.C. Special Grant. All the buildings are very very much in need of painting. This is only too apparent in the work already undertaken and I trust that it may be possible for us to get the materials as enclosed. We will begin in the late summer and try to finish up in the early Fall when the weather is usually good. I may say that Davies and Logan are agents for Marshall-Wells paint and they are giving us the wholesale price, F.O.B. Vancouver.\n\nI would be glad if you would advise me as soon as possible so that I may keep our staff busy through the summer.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.C.

This will be the first time in recent years when the grant will be paid in full, provision having been made in this year's estimates for the restoration of the 5% reduction made in such grants several years ago.

At that time he was informed that the sum of $1,025 was included in this year's estimates for the repainting of the school and the purchase of a pump. The Principal did not at that time intimate that a truck was needed at the institution, nor did he discuss the difficulties experienced by him in providing transportation for the pupils during their stay at the summer camp.

Private Secretary to the Minister of National Defence, submitting representations made to Hon. Mr. Mackenzie relative to the urgent need of new transportation being provided for this School. Note specially the request that action be taken before the beginning of the camp, July 1st.\n\nWill you please have the matter looked into immediately, and, with a return of the letter, be good enough to let me have a draft reply.\n\nW.J. Pratt\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nDr. McGill-\nFor draft reply as requested.\nDEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL DEFENCE\n\nOffice of the Minister, OTTAWA,\n\nJune 17, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Pratt:\n\nI understand that your Department purchases trucks for your various residential schools. Representations have been received by the Minister on behalf of the Coqualeetza Residential School, Sardis, B.C., where it is stated they are urgently in need of a ton or a ton and a half truck.\n\nThe Principal, the Reverend R. C. Scott, has nothing for the transportation of his pupils except an old Buick car which he had made over into a truck. This has seen constant use and is stated to be unsafe for the transportation of the pupils at the present time. For your information I may say that the engine model is stated to be a 1917 model and the brakes are in very bad condition.\n\nThey use the truck for carrying drinking water during the two months they camp near White Rock, and as they have to bring two barrels at least of water each day for drinking and cooking purposes, they will certainly require some kind of vehicle before they go to camp. They also take the children once a week to Blaine, to the picnic park, and use the old truck and the Principal's car between the camp and the park, both going and returning.\n\nThey also need transportation in case any of the pupils become ill and have to be taken to a doctor or hospital. With sixty to seventy pupils at the camp, it can be expected that this will be necessary at least once or twice during the camp season. The Principal cannot leave his own car there all the time, and if the truck is unfit for use, they are without means of transportation and there is no telephone within two miles of the camp.\n\nW.J.F. Pratt, Esq.,\nPrivate Secretary to the\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI understand -\nI understand an expensive vehicle is not required, but that the Principal would like one which could be used for freight, and also have seats put in for the transportation of pupils as mentioned above.\n\nIt would be greatly appreciated if you would have one of your Departmental officials look into this and do whatever you can to assist. I am informed that the Principal is quite unable to solve this problem through school funds and that something should be done before the beginning of camp, the 1st July.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Miss) A. Dixon,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nDH\nOttawa,\nJune 8, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information and for the action suggested, copy of a memorandum received by this Branch from the Purchasing Agent.\n\nMr. Phelan is absent from the office and I am not at all sure that the original requisition came to us through your office. In any event Mr. Bailey's memorandum is self-explanatory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nMemorandum\n\nMr. R.A.Hoey\n\nWith reference to your requisition of April 26th, file 153-0-5 for automatic electric sump pump and thermostatic traps for the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, Sardis, B.C., I may state that competitive prices were obtained with the following results:\n\n(a) The lowest quotation on the pump was $139.75 f.o.b. Sardis, submitted by The Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Co., Ottawa, for delivery through their Vancouver Branch of a Penberthy automatic electric sump pump.\n\n(b) On the 24 half-inch thermostatic traps and 16 three-quarter inch thermostatic traps, the quotations were:\n   Empire Brass Co. $3.50 each\u2014for Dunham Vancouver less 2% \u00bd\" traps\n   Crane Ltd., $3.50 \" for Hoffman Vancouver less 2% \u00bd\" traps\n\nBoth these companies appear to be quoting on a substitute for the 16 - \u00be\" thermostatic traps, as their price is $1.59 net for 16 - \u00be\" x \u00bc Blk mall reducing elbows.\n\nI would suggest that the advice of Mr. C.E.Webb, Dominion Water & Power District Engineer, 739 Hastings St. West, Vancouver, B.C., be obtained, and that if the pump offered by Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Co., is satisfactory, it be ordered through Major MacKay's office. Similarly it should be possible to secure traps of satisfactory design from Crane Ltd., or Empire Brass Co. of Vancouver. I may add that these two firms are on our approved list, while the two indicated on your requisition are not.\n\nWhen the purchases have been completed, please send voucher and invoices to this office for the usual action.\n\nW.M.Bailey\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nMr R.A. Hoey,\nSupt., Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nJune 29th, 1939\n\nDear Mr Hoey:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th inst this evening. I cannot say how deeply I regret having gone ahead with the painting job without first consulting the officials here. While I certainly did not take your words as authorizing me to go on with the work, I did however take them to mean that the matter was settled, and I inferred that the officials here had been informed and seeing that this particular figure had been accepted, as I thought, there was nothing to hinder my getting Menzies to do the work in accordance with the letter submitted to me a year ago, and sent on to the Department.\n\nI have secured figures each year for the last three years, and have included the amounts in the repair sheet sent in to the Department. Consequently, as I have said above, when you mentioned the matter to me it seemed as though it had at last been decided, and I proceeded upon getting home, to see Menzies and advise them that their contract had been accepted.\n\nI have been confusing all along, the acceptance of a figure for forwarding to the Department, and its being actually accepted. I have always felt that if a figure was for any reason not acceptable, it would not be forwarded by our officials here. Consequently, when this particular figure was the one which appeared on the sheet you showed me in Ottawa, I inferred that nothing else was necessary.\n\nI have tried at all times to cooperate with the Department, and I would not for the world have gone ahead with this work, had it not been for what I now see to have been a rather stupid lack of thought on my part. I ought to have known that some notification should have been forthcoming from our officials here, but I really did not know it was the policy of the Department to get what seemed to me to be a repetition of a figure before accepting it. The procedure has never been explained to me, and it was only a few days ago when I mentioned the work being undertaken to Mr Daunt, that he explained that I had really gone ahead upon my own authority and that it would not be acceptable to the Department.\n\nI apologize most sincerely, and only hope that my action has not been construed to have been owing to anything you may have said to me while in Ottawa, for it was only indirectly so, and I now see that I did not understand at all, the workings of the Department in these matters.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter which I am sending to Mr Daunt to be forwarded to Major MacKay, which I trust will make clear that I, and I alone am to blame.\n\nI did not write you earlier about the materials for painting the other buildings, because I have been more than busy, and the weather has been such as to render any work of that kind impossible. Consequently, I decided to wait and get the materials late, and then do the work toward the end of the holidays, and complete it when the pupils came back as the weather is usually good in September.\n\nI trust that some arrangement may be made which will be acceptable to the Department in the present instance, and can only say again how greatly I regret having seemingly set departmental regulations at nought; I did not realize I was doing so.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nMr. A.O. O'Connell,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nJune 26th, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. O'Connell:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Mr. Ross by Air Mail this evening in which he accuses me that he is much disturbed over my having gone ahead with the painting of the school building without authority. He states that his information to me was simply that there was money available for that purpose, but it was in no sense giving me any authority to go ahead with the work.\n\nThat is quite right. I did not take it that he was authorizing me to proceed with the work, but seeing I knew, misapprehended entirely the action of the Department in setting aside the particular sum involved, as being tantamount to acceptance, I inferred that officials here had been advised, and that it was expected that I would proceed to advise the firm which gave that particular amount as their figure for the job.\n\nI now see that I have been quite wrong, and I want to take the full blame for my action.\n\nWith all the orders away of this year, and the School closing pressing upon me, I am afraid that I did not take time to really think the thing through. At the same time, I want to say that I have been quite wrong in my understanding of Department regulations, for I have proceeded under the assumption that no further action was to be expected by our officials here, if the figure set forth in a repair sheet was accepted as a basis by Ottawa.\n\nI shall certainly never be involved in such a mistake again, and wish to apologize and to hope that the Department will accept my explanation, and be good enough to do what may be possible to bring the matter in line with their usual procedure. Meanwhile, I again wish to say how much I regret the entire misunderstanding, for I really do wish to act in harmony with the Department in all things.\n\nI suppose I was influenced too, by the knowledge that this particular firm (Mandela) is an old time Liberal organization, and that their figure was the lowest one received.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would forward a copy of this letter to the Commissioner, and assure him that I shall come in the first of the week to express my regret personally.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL\nMay 16th, 1939\n\nRev.

I beg to say that I greatly appreciate this.\n\nOnce again I would like to say how much I regret having misunderstood what you said to me while at Ottawa. I hope sincerely it has not made any difficulty. I saw Commissioner McKay yesterday and he explained in detail to me the significance of any such action on my part and also the procedure with regard to such matters. My not having had any experience in these things since the appointment of a Purchasing Agent was largely to blame for my hasty conclusion. As a matter of fact, I had asked for and received four tenders for the work previously and Menzies was the lowest of them all. As I was given to understand that the political aspect was also in order, it made it all the easier for me to assume that my action was justified. I shall certainly exercise every care in future.\n\nAgain hoping there has been no complications for yourself or anyone else,\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.C.

However, as pointed out in the communication of June 28, there are certain regulations that we are obliged to follow at the present time, and I feel certain that in future, when you wish to incur any expenditure for which the Department is expected to pay, you will obtain our authority before proceeding with the work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

R.C. Scott, Principal of Coqualeetza Indian Residential School regarding the painting of the main buildings of the Coqualeetza unit at an estimated cost of $797.00. Mr. Scott's letter is self-explanatory and need not be reviewed here other than to observe that the Rev. Principal accepted information given to him during a conversation with the Department, while in Ottawa recently, as sufficient authority to proceed to incur an expenditure of some hundreds of dollars.\n\nMr. Daunt informed me of the situation by telephone on the 27th instant when I suggested that he obtain a letter of explanation from Mr. Scott and forward same with a copy of Mr. Menzies' tender with a report to this office.\n\nI doubt very much if the Department intended that work involving an expenditure of such magnitude should be undertaken without reference to the officials of the Branch through the regular channels of the service.\n\nIn view of the circumstances, however, I consider it would be well to authorize Menzies Hardware Ltd to continue and complete the work seeing that a considerable expenditure has already been incurred.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

Mennies Hardware Company, Limited, Chilliwack, for $797.00, which, I understand, is the amount of the Contract discussed in Ottawa by Mr. Scott with Mr. Hoey.\n\nIn view of the circumstances, as detailed by Mr. Scott, I would recommend that the matter be referred to the Department, and if the facts are as stated, authority be obtained for the above Firm to complete the work, which they have already commenced.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nA.O'N.

I presume it was sent on to the Department in the regular way.\n\nWhen I was in Ottawa in the end of April last, Mr Hoey showed me the above figure along with some others, and said that an amount of $1025.00 had been allowed to Coqualeetza for repairs etc. I saw that the item referred to above, was the one sent in by Menzies Hardware last summer.\n\nWhen Mr Hoey added \"do not be too long getting started at this work,\" I naturally thought that he was informing me so that I might see to its being undertaken without delay, and it never occurred to me that neither you nor the Commissioner had seen it.\n\nIf it is the policy of the Department that such undertakings should be authorized also from the start, it is possible Mr Hoey had no other thought than that he would take it up with you upon my return.\n\nHowever, seeing I had been informed down there, I went right at the work when I got home. It looks as though I am at fault, but as I have said, it never occurred to me that you had not been notified, and seeing the item had been sent on to Ottawa in the regular way, I did not realize that it should have been again taken up through your office.\n\nI would be glad if you would inform Commissioner MacKay of this side of the occurrence, for I certainly would never knowingly have done anything aside from the regular procedure.\n\nThe slight increase in the amount of the contract is due to the fact that the moss was much more rank after a year's growth than when the original figure was submitted. At that, Mr Menzies informed me today that it had cost him more than twice what he had estimated this last time. The moss could not be removed with a long handled brush, but had to be dug out from between the shingles with smaller tools, and it took time.\n\nI trust that you may see your way clear to recommend this expenditure and that Major MacKay will overlook my seeming neglect to put the item through in the regular way. As I have said, it never occurred to me that it had not been dealt with here.\n\nThere are other items pending of which Mr Hoey spoke, I shall take them up through your office in a day or two.\n\nRegretting very much my lack of thought in this matter, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The condition is due partly to the fact that pipes have been run under the corridor, and in some cases pulled out leaving spaces along the under-foundation to subside, and also to the fact that over quite an area, the foundation was only three-quarters of an inch thick. Due to this it is now found necessary to build up the old foundation and reinforce it in spots requiring additional material as follows:\n\nTremco Mulsomastic 35 gals.\nTremco Primer 7 gals.\nCement 5 sacks.\nSand & Gravel aggregate 1\u00bd Cu. yards.\n\nMaterials and labor to cost $68.40.\n\nUnder the circumstances there is no option but to recommend the additional expenditure and I would appreciate authority for the same, by air mail, if at all possible, in order to have the work completed before re-opening of the school.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

None of our fire doors are locked and the windows are made into doors opening outwards in one piece so that there is no delay in exit.\n\nLast March our fire alarm system shorted at about five o'clock in the morning, causing bells to ring. It was a complete surprise to everyone and was a very good test of discipline. I am glad to report that I was called immediately by the staff member appointed, and dressing hurriedly, reached the front lawn just as the girls were forming up in line. The staff member on duty in the girls' dormitory instructed the girls to each one put a blanket over their shoulders so that although they had not taken time to dress, they were fairly well protected. The drill was carried out just as though it had been a practice one and it was a great satisfaction to me, for we had often wondered what actually would happen if we had a fire. The only missing factor to cause panic might have been the presence of smoke, but the test was sufficiently real to afford fair confidence in the actions of both staff and pupils.\n\nWhen I came to the school, I found they were using the dormitory over the Manual Training shop for accommodation of boys about twelve years of age. I was not satisfied at that time with the fire escape, an iron ladder, and had it lengthened. I also took precautions with the heating and have always had at least one staff member and one senior boy in charge. I thought of asking for assistance from the Department to provide an iron fire escape similar to those on the main building, but in view of the fact that the school may be discontinued, I did not press that expenditure this year. After a good deal of thought, I decided to build a wooden stairway down the outside of the building as this would be a big advantage over the one staircase in the building, which was almost sure to be a regular \"trump\" in case of fire. I purchased the materials out of school funds and had the work done by our Manual Training instructors and their senior class. Each boy in\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\n\nNovember 4th, 1939\n\nthe Senior Class, made a drawing of the proposed stair case and then assisted in building it. It comes down from the middle window of the front, which opens out in one piece like a door, along the side of the building, providing an easy and safe exit. The boys are using this stairway in all fire drills just as though they were in the main building.\n\nAs the building of this stairway was a bona fide Manual Training project, I presume the Department will be quite agreeable to my including the cost of materials in my regular quarterly Manual Training vouchers. The total cost was under twelve dollars.\n\nI may say I also have a night watchman on duty from the 1st of October.\n\nAssuring you of my desire to co-operate at all times, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL\n\nRCS/EW\nTo Account Rendered\n\nNov 22 2-1/2\" Elbow 1.00 1-1/2\" Cap 3.00 1-1/2\" Nipple 2.00\n6 Sheets 22 Gauge Galv.

The equipment from Coqualeetza is motor powered and as we have city power now installed in the School for electric irons, this equipment could be hooked in on the power lines and an unnecessary load avoided for our Diesel engines.\n\nThere is ample room in our laundry for the installation of this equipment and I am prepared to recommend to the Commission that the School will meet freight charges on the shipment from Vancouver or from Seattle should there be no funds available. The addition of this equipment would be well worth the $30.00 or $40.00 required to pay freight.\n\nAs it appears that time is a factor, would you consider wiring the Department either at Vancouver or Ottawa to have a salvage sale of this equipment delayed until this application can be given consideration?\n\nThanking you,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n-Principal.\nOttawa,\nApril 5, 1941.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo I ascertained from the Assistant Superintendent of Medical Services that the laundry machinery which was discarded at the new Coqualeetza Hospital has already been disposed of by turning it in to the firm from whom the new machinery was purchased and thereby reducing the cost of the latter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

I have no idea where the letter was from October 8th to March 5th - when it was received in our office.\n\nIt may be too late to do anything about the appeal of these people for this academic year, but surely with the Coqualeetsa school ending the calendar year 1935 with an unprecedented overdraft, due to the fact that they are approximately fifty children short of the per capita number allowed by the Department of Indian Affairs, the matter should be taken very seriously.\n\nWith very kind regards, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKJB:L.\nEnc.\n\nP.S.

E. B. Gechrems, D.D.,\nRev. K. J. Bostan, B.A.,\nRev. Colin Young, D.D.,\n299 Queen Street, West,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWe, the undersigned ex-pupils of Coqualeetza Residential School, Sardis, B.C., take this opportunity to lay a serious grievance before you as representatives and Secretaries of the Board of Missions of the United Church of Canada, to which Church we all belong.\n\nRecently our people have been informed by the Local Indian Agent that no more boys and girls of this place are to be sent to the aforementioned school for their education, and we and our parents are very greatly disappointed and disturbed over the matter, and for the following reasons:\n\nI. The day school of our village has never in the past, nor does it now supply all the advantages in education such as we require, Domestic Science, Music, Vocational Instruction, Boat Building, etc. Invaluable preparation for life service. Why should our younger brothers and sisters and our children be denied these advantages which have hitherto been given us?\n\nII. During the recent epidemic of Flu in our village many of our fathers and mothers died, leaving several children of school age now having lost one or both of their parents are very greatly in need of guardianship and guidance at the critical time of life. Our situation, serious at all times, is doubly so just now in view of the fact that our parents find it difficult or impossible to support their families. Why should innocent children suffer and lose their lives because of the whims of present Government policy?\n\nIt has been our hope for some years that a Residential School might be built by the Government for our children somewhere in the north, say at Skidegate or Fort Simpson, for the education of our boys and girls from United Church homes. We have been encouraged to believe that we might expect this, but this changed policy of the Government has destroyed any such hopes. Would it surprise you to learn that there are more than two hundred and fifty people, seventy-five of whom are under guardianship in moral and religious endeavor is given to the Coqualeetza? Is the present Government not concerned about the future moral and religious conditions among the\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6442, file 880-10, part 1)\nIndian people? Or is the present trend the product of immature conclusions or ridiculous fads on the part of some officials in the Indian Department who are seemingly all-powerful today?\n\nAs children of the Church we lay our grievance before you in the hope that your influence as our advocates may speedily change the policy of the Department so that several needy cases in our village may receive sympathetic consideration and be permitted to proceed immediately to the school of our choice to receive such education which has been heretofore denied us.\n\nWe attach herewith the names and ages of children who are desirous of proceeding to Coqualeetsa, and who by the ruling of the School Inspector are denied that privilege. Trusting that you will give our complaint and protest your serious and immediate consideration, we subscribe our names.\n\n1. M. J. Williams\n2. Ambrose Collinson\n3. Don Collinson\n4. Geo. Young\n5.

The Department, like the Board of Home Missions, in recent years has suffered from drastic reductions in income and undoubtedly some of the curtailment of services which has characterized the last five years is due entirely to financial limitations.\n\nAs soon as I hear from the Department I will communicate with you again.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6442, file 880-10, part 1)\nOttawa, April 3, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Beaton:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, enclosing copy of a petition from Skidegate, signed by a number of ex-pupils of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, requesting that the Department authorize the admission of children from the Skidegate Reserve to the above named school.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to your letter of October third, last, and my reply of the 8th of the same month. The Department will approve of placing in the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School any orphan, destitute, or neglected child from the Skidegate Reserve, who is of school age and in good health. Arrangements could be made during the coming summer to select the children of the classes mentioned and have them taken to Coqualeetza. I note you have written for the names and ages of the children. When you have this information, I should be glad to hear further from you in the matter.\n\nI can assure you the Department is desirous of assisting in every way possible in obtaining the full number of pupils for which grant is provided at the Coqualeetza School, and it should be possible, next summer, to obtain the required number from the Skidegate and other reserves in northern British Columbia and on the West Coast.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

You might take up this matter with the Principal, on the occasion of your next visit to the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nA. O'H.

Date of Inspection April 29, 1936.\n\nOriginal on No. 162-15-6.\n\nI would recommend that the following pupils be sent on from the Kitamaat Indian Residential School to Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, should a request be made to the Department for permission to transfer them. It would in my opinion be much in the interest of the below mentioned children that they be given at least two years in Coqualeetza.\n\nHANNAH MORRISON - Age 14. Grade 6. An attempt may be made to marry her off at an early age if left in the village. Her sister was married at 16 and such marriage has I understand not been very satisfactory. With two years at Coqualeetza she will be in a much better position to express her own wishes in the matter of marriage, and she will have a better idea of Handicrafts and Vocational Work.\n\nAMELIA GRAY - Age 14. Grade 5. Living with an Aunt. Mother is dead. Teacher reports that her home life is not very happy and that she would be better off if sent out of village for a couple of years. I should certainly like to see her at Coqualeetza. This is the case of a child from a home that is not very satisfactory.\nOttawa, May 8th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department has been informed by the Associate Secretary of the Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada, that you will receive a request in the near future to approve the admission to the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School of the following children:\n\nDela H. Greene       Clifford Jones\nMary A. Greene       Pauline Jones\nPauline M. Greene    Philip Stevens\nVelma Pearson        Billie Stevens\nWesley Pearson\n\nThe Department has already advised the Associate Secretary that we are prepared to approve placing in the Coqualeetza Residential School any orphan, destitute or neglected child from the Skidegate Reserve who is of school age and in good health.\n\nIt may be possible, however, that some Indians who would be in a position to support their children and send them to the day school on the reserve would prefer to place their children in the Coqualeetza Residential School. When you receive such requests, you should at once advise the Department giving full particulars regarding the reasons for the parents wishing the children placed in a residential school rather than sending them to the day school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. De-Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nR. Howe, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nMasset, B. C.\nMay 6th, 1936.\n\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter received from Mr. H. E. Greene, Secretary of the Council at Skidegate, in response to my request for the names and ages of pupils who wish to enter Coqualeetza this fall.\n\nI have told Mr. Greene to go ahead and make application for these pupils through the new Agent in the ordinary way. You will then be in a position to deal with each case on its merits.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB:JGA.\nSkidegate Mission,\nB.C.,\nApril 25th, 1936.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B.A.,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYours of 31st ultimo came to hand and was glad to hear from you. We certainly will be glad to send you the list of children wishing to get the opportunity of going to Coqualeetza. Hoping that you people will make it possible for them to get there.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, we beg to remain\n\nYour humble servants,\n\nSkidegate Council,\nSkidegate Mission, B.C.\n\nPer.

I would like to be able, as stated in my letter, to secure the help of the Indian Agent should they stay away another year. If the School were to be full, as I trust it may, then of course all such children would have to go on the waiting list, or be discharged.\n\nSome forty children remained away, most of them without permission, and it was this which caused the financial difficulty which we face just now. In addition, I graduated 29 pupils. By diligent recruiting, I have been able to get a goodly number of new pupils, but we are still short of the number we need in order to pay expenses. Any consideration the Department may be able to extend will be much appreciated.\n\nSigned:\n\nPRINCIPAL.\n\nINDIAN OFFICE\nNEW WESTMINSTER\nMAY 14 1936\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nMay 12, 1936\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of April 20, File No. 1-8-E, I beg to enclose herewith application forms for No. 0599 Robert Bolin and No. 819 Jacob Grant. I regret the poor form of this latter application. It was made out by the missionary R.L. McConnell at the time and corrected by Mr. Fougner, Indian agent, who put in the full name of the boy, Jacob William, and corrected the age from nine to eleven, and inserted the birthday. I had very great difficulty in securing this application. The parents sent the boy to school in the beginning of the year and then seemed to be on the move so constantly that the missionary was not able to get in touch with them until quite recently. September 10 was the date the boy arrived at school. There being only one mail a month to Kitimat, means a two months delay at the best of times.\n\nI am also enclosing a list of pupils sixteen years of age and over who are in attendance and upon our rolls here in this school. I have given reasons why I feel it would be wise to allow these children at least another year. In general I would like also to say that the school has suffered financially this year owing to children staying away. This was largely due to causes quite beyond our control. The ice-storm a year ago came when parents from Vancouver Island were visiting the school, and they spread the news of the terrible condition of things, giving the impression that it was a usual occurrence. The unfortunate fatal sickness in four instances also meant that children were taken home and kept home. Added to this the long-shoremen's strike on lower Vancouver Island and the poor fishing in the Queen Charlotte's and on the Nass River, completed a very difficult situation. As a result I can foresee a deficit of in the neighbourhood of one thousand dollars. If we can fill the school next fall we can absorb it nearly all. In order to do this I would greatly appreciate it if we may be allowed to keep all sixteen year old children and upwards, those willing to stay as set forth in the list enclosed. This will help to insure our pupilage for next fall, in addition to being, I feel, very much in the interests of the children themselves. I feel that we are making progress in the practical side of the education we are giving these children and I am quite sure that they will benefit largely another year.\n\nI am also enclosing a second list of pupils who have remained away from school without permission. There are fifteen years old and upwards and in accordance with Section 10 of the Indian Act. I hope it may not be necessary to use any compulsion, and in any case shall try to use all possible discretion, but I would like to be able in the case of these older children to have the assistance of the Indian agent in securing their return to school, if they remain out again.\n\nINDIAN OFFICE\nNEW WESTMINSTER\nMAY 14 1936\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nRegarding the children whose numbers are listed in your letter, I beg to say that I shall apply for their discharge if they do not return to school next fall. I trust this will be satisfactory to the Department. I am sure that a number of them will come back.\n\nRegarding the application of No. 826 - Henry Pahl, I beg to say that I have been endeavouring to secure this ever since the boy came to school. He was sent in by the father last September. This is another case where there is only a monthly mail service, and the father has been moving about from place to place. I have sent application blanks to him recently, after waiting nearly six months, and I hope to have it in hand before long.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nSIR,\n\nWith reference to your letter dated the 14th of April, File No.153-0-10, and having reference to the March Quarter Return of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School.\n\nI beg to forward you herewith, a communication from the Reverend Principal, addressed to the Deputy Superintendent General, together with a list of pupils over sixteen years of age and his remarks connected therewith.\n\nA further list of pupils absent from the School without permission, giving their Reserves, and the reason for their absence, is also attached.\n\nYou will note that the Reverend Principal would like to secure the co-operation of the various Indian Agents concerned, in order to have them return to School.\n\nApplication for admission in connection with Rena Bolin, No.0595, of the New Westminster Agency, and Jacob Grant of the Bella Coola Agency, are attached hereto.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nENCLS.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6442, file 880-10, part 1)\nOttawa, May 28th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, enclosing letter of the 12th instant from the Principal of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School. You may inform him that the admission of Rena Bolin and Jacob William Grant is approved.\n\nThe Department appreciates the financial difficulties of the Coqualeetza School, due to the fact that a number of children did not return after holidays last year. However, it must be kept in mind that the Indian Act provides that children over fifteen years of age can only remain in residential schools with our permission. When children have reached the age of sixteen or close to that age, and are allowed home on holidays and do not return, the Department considers it undesirable to take any steps to force them to return. With this in mind, you should inform the Principal that the following pupils should be considered discharged from the Coqualeetza Residential School, and their names should not appear on future returns:\n\n| No.   | Name            | No.   | Name            |\n|-------|-----------------|-------|-----------------|\n| 631   | Eddie Nelson    | 0397  | Lizzie Woods    |\n| 672   | Cecil Tait      | 0417  | Rita Brown      |\n| 683   | James Ames      | 0447  | Emma Bolton     |\n| 700   | Bernie Roberts  | 0478  | Minnie Lewis    |\n| 705   | Clarence Yaltadzie | 0485 | Caroline Wilson |\n| 710   | Arthur Stewart  | 0515  | Annie Hunt      |\n| 804   | Teddy Robinson  | 0550  | Helen Douglas   |\n|       |                 | 0592  | Verna Price     |\n\nThe respective agents are being written regarding pupils Nos. 695, 755, 774, 780, 787 and 0522, with a view to ascertaining if it is possible to have these children return to the Coqualeetza Residential School for the academic year 1936-37.\n\nThe list of pupils at present in the school who are sixteen years of age and over, and whom the Principal wishes to retain for another year, has been very carefully considered. It is realized that in some cases there are very special reasons why certain children should be retained but, at the same time, in the case of pupils of eighteen years of age and over, unless there are exceptional circumstances, the Department considers it is not in the best interests of all parties concerned to keep them at school. They are really adults, and if, through force of circumstances, they have not obtained higher standing by the time they have reached eighteen or nineteen, our experience shows that in the majority of cases there is no great benefit obtained by keeping them longer at school. In considering the lists submitted by the Reverend Principal, the Department has endeavoured to be as fair as possible, both to the pupils concerned and to the\n\nA. O'N. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nCoqualeetza\nCoqualeetsa School, as well as recognizing our own responsibility in the expenditure of public funds. Our decision regarding this list is as follows:\n\n(1) The undermentioned should be discharged as from June 30, 1936:\n\nNo. 563 - Allan Young\nNo. 727 - Willis White\nNo. 593 - Walter C. Joe\nNo. 0346 - Marjorie Underwood\nNo. 636 - John Wilson\nNo. 0479 - Kathleen McMillan\nNo. 710 - Arthur J. Stewart\nNo. 0524 - Dora Modeste\nNo. 0567 - Jean Little.\n\n(2) The following may remain in the school for another year:\n\nNo. 515 - Frank Calder\nNo. 799 - Adolphus Marks\nNo. 558 - Phillip Watson\nNo. 802 - Philip Louie\nNo. 570 - Franzen Stokan\nNo. 821 - William Stephens\nNo. 606 - Phillip Clarke\nNo. 0361 - Josephine Williams\nNo. 616 - Elmer Dick\nNo. 0417 - Rita Brown\nNo. 633 - Donald Gladstone\nNo. 0426 - Mary Williams\nNo. 637 - Vernon Jones\nNo. 0432 - Katie Moon\nNo. 652 - Sidney Wilson\nNo. 0437 - Laura Lewis\nNo. 681 - Wilfred Sam\nNo. 0444 - Jean Walker\nNo. 684 - Gordon Angus\nNo. 0447 - Emma Bolton\nNo. 691 - Cyril Underwood\nNo. 0455 - Caroline Wilson\nNo. 716 - Harry Amos\nNo. 0497 - Vesta Matthews\nNo. 736 - Elmer Greene\nNo. 0502 - Josephine Wilson\nNo. 757 - Alec Stevens\nNo. 0506 - Myrtle Kelly\nNo. 758 - Gordon Robinson\nNo. 0549 - Dolly Dick\nNo. 777 - Chas. P. Wilson\nNo. 0550 - Helen Douglas\nNo. 786 - Benjamin Tait\nNo. 0579 - Emily Wilson\nNo. 785 - Frank Venn\n\nWith regard to those pupils mentioned above for whom permission is being granted to remain for another year, the Department considers that we should not be responsible for their expenses in going on holidays. Such pupils should either be retained in the school during the holiday period or the Principal, to ensure their return, should obtain from the parents the return fare of each of them. Our experience shows that, while principals or others interested may consider that pupils of sixteen years of age and over should remain in school for a longer period, when such pupils are allowed home it is extremely difficult, in many cases, to have them returned.\n\nFor your convenience, I enclose an extra copy of this letter which you may forward to Rev. Mr. Scott.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, June 20, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to the application for the admission of three Petersen children to the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School. The information contained in your letter has been carefully considered and it is, also, noted from the application forms that the medical examiner states that each of these children has active tuberculosis.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to approve their admission to the Coqualeetza Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n203-6 Rogers Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 28th last, with reference to Heber Clifton and Douglas Vern who did not return to the Coqualestza School at the expiry of their holidays last fall.\n\nIn this connection, I would state that had the matter been reported by the Principal of the school to this office at the time, steps would have been taken for their immediate return.\n\nHowever, I shall get into touch with the parents as soon as possible and arrange for their return unless there is some valid reason why they should not do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 29th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn writing you yesterday, the Department did not mention the following pupils:\n\n43 - No. 542 - Moses Leeson, 21 years of age,\n58 - No. 676 - Chris Matthews, 18 years of age,\nD-43 - No. 611 - Donald Elliott, 15 years of age,\nD-43 - No. 523 - Norman George, 15 years of age.\n\nThese pupils have reached an age where it is very difficult for the Department to consider allowing them to remain longer in the Coqualeetza School. The Principal's report shows that Donald Elliott would only be in Grade 10 next year, and Norman George is just completing his first year high school work. Chris Matthews is stated to be in Grade 10. The reason for wishing Moses Leeson to remain is that he may complete Grade 12.\n\nUnless these pupils have the intention of making practical use, along academic lines, of the education they are receiving, the Department does not see any necessity for returning them to the school simply that they may attend another year at high school.\n\nI should appreciate if you would personally discuss the status of these four pupils with the Principal and advise me what action you consider it is best to take in their regard.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nOttawa, May 25th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is informed by the Principal of the Coqualeetza Residential School that Heber Maitland, No. 755, of Kitimat; and Jerry Starr, No. 750, of Klemtu, did not return to the Coqualeetza School at the expiry of their holidays in the Fall of 1935.\n\nIf these boys are in good health, it is considered that it would be in their best interests to return to Coqualeetza after the holidays this year. If you know of any reason why they should not return please advise me at once. Otherwise, you should make the necessary arrangements to send them to Coqualeetza when the school reopens after the summer holidays. In this event, payment of their transportation will be made on receipt from you of a properly certified account in triplicate.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. Gillett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nOttawa, May 28th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is informed by the Principal of the Coqualeetza Residential School that Heber Clifton, No. 774, of Hartley Bay, and Douglas Vann, No. 787, of Greenville (Lakalsap), did not return to the Coqualeetza School at the expiry of their holidays in the Fall of 1935.\n\nIf these boys are in good health, it is considered that it would be in their best interests to return to Coqualeetza after the holidays this year. If you know of any reason why they should not return please advise me at once. Otherwise, you should make the necessary arrangements to send them to Coqualeetza when the school reopens after the summer holidays. In this event, payment of their transportation will be made on receipt from you of a properly certified account in triplicate.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOttawa, May 25th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is informed by the Principal of the Coqualeetza Residential School that Earl Parnell, No. 695, and Lavina White, No. 0522, did not return to the Coqualeetza School at the expiry of their holidays in the Fall of 1935.\n\nIf these children are in good health, it is considered that it would be in their best interests to return to Coqualeetza after the holidays this year. If you know of any reason why they should not return please advise me at once. Otherwise, you should make the necessary arrangements to send them to Coqualeetza when the school reopens after the summer holidays. In this event, payment of their transportation will be made on receipt from you of a properly certified account in triplicate.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nR. Howe, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nMassett, B.C.\nMiss Phillips gave me the names of the following children whom she understands it is intended to send to residential school if the Department will permit. The remarks are the result of either my own observation or of the teacher's record.\n\nDella Green - Age 12. Grade 4. Very good in Tests set at inspection. She would be a great success in a residential school, and could take Entrance Test in another three or four years at Coqualeetza. Mr Green is the Secretary of the Indian Council and wishes to send two other children with Della I am informed. I did not see these or if I did I have no special notes about them. They come from a good home.\n\nValma Pearson - Age 11. Grade 3. Very poor in Tests set at my inspection. Very poor pupil for a residential school. I understand that her parents also wish to send Valma's brother, who is I am informed somewhat deformed and unable to stand straight. There is I understand T.B. History in this family and I doubt the children could pass the medical test or that they should go if they could.\n\nKenneth Jones - Age 8. Stanley Jones - Age 7. In this case the mother is dead and these children live with their grandmother. They might well be sent to Coqualeetza if they can pass the medical test.\n\nPauline Jones - Age 9. Others in this family have been to Coqualeetza. Pauline is reported by teacher to be a good student. There is no special reason for this child to go to residential school outside the fact that others in the family have been there. I would not object to her going myself.\n\nI hope that the above information will indicate just the type of children who are seeking admission in the Indian residential school from this village. It will be noted that Pauline Jones is not a relation of Kenneth and Stanley Jones. The whole of the above with the exception of the Pearson children might be allowed to go to Coqualeetza this next September as there are at least eight new Beginners ready for admission to this day school next term. I am, however, that the day school here be permitted to grow to two full time Divisions as soon as possible.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter No. 153-0-10 of May 28th, I may say that I interviewed the parents of Heber Maitland and of Jerry Starr, regarding the matter of the boys not returning to Coqualeetza School in the fall of 1935. I am assured by the parents of Heber Maitland of Kitimaat that he will return to the school in September next, but it is doubtful if Jerry Starr will do so. The only excuse the parents gave was that the boy was not well. However, he will be examined when the doctor next visits the Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSIR:-\n\nI beg to forward you herewith, the School Return for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1936, received from Reverend R.C. Scott, Principal of Coqualeetza Indian Residential School.\n\nOn checking this return and having in mind your letter dated May 28th, Departmental File No.153-0-10, I found numerous discrepancies, so returned the report to the Reverend Principal. It has now come back with the attached letter of explanation, so I am sending it to you for your consideration.\n\nIt appears to me that the best way of handling this School is to have a definite ruling, that, when pupils are absent for an entire quarter, they should automatically be shown discharged, as from the end of that quarter. Without some such drastic and definite ruling, the School is liable to increase its slackness in regard to such matters, so the sooner they are brought into line the better.\n\nI shall be glad to receive your definite instructions in the matter at your early convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.N. Daunt.\nIndian Agent.\n\nENCL.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Mr Daunt:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your statement regarding the Blue Sheets which I have just sent you, in which you point out that I have not followed the instructions of the Department regarding discharges as set forth in their letter of May 28th last, a copy of which you had sent forward to me.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that I have asked for more discharges than the Department has asked for in Paragraph (1) of that letter, and have included most of those asked for there.\n\nWith regard to the first list of pupils, of whom the letter says \"Their names should not appear on future returns\", I beg to point out that in Para. 2, Paragraph (2) the Department authorizes at least four of these same pupils to remain in School for another year. This being so, and in view of the fact that it is quite impossible for me to advise the pupils involved, that they will not be allowed to return, and seeing I have already let it be known that several of them are planning to come back, it seemed unwise to ask for the discharge of any but those whom I have set down on the Discharge Sheet which accompanies the returns.\n\nI note that the Department says that any who may return could be re-admitted, but my experience with regard to allowing pupils to come to School and then trying to secure the Admission Forms, has shown the great difficulties involved. The children come to School from the reserves, in most cases, go off to their tree lines or to places where they put up their winter supply of fish, and it is months before I can get the necessary forms. In one such case, that of Henry Pahl, I have been unable for the past year to get the required forms.\n\nIn view of these facts, and especially as the per capita grant is involved in only one case\u2014that of Allan Young\u2014I would greatly appreciate it if the Department would allow the returns for this Quarter (June) to stand with the distinct understanding that all the names set forth in their letter of May 28th will be put upon the Discharge sheet for the September Quarter, thus clearing up the whole matter without the chance of complications arising from any of them returning as is almost certain at the present moment. All who do not return should certainly be struck off the roll, and I shall undertake to see that this is done. I am quite in agreement with the desire of the Department to have the names of all these pupils taken off, if they do not return in September next.\n\nWith regard to Allan Young, the only name which involves the Per Capita earnings, he has been in residence all the past School year and in harmony with the practice of the Department's usage. I would appreciate it if his name might remain until the September Quarter returns go in, and we might receive the Per Capita grant for the 43 days allowed for holidays in the usual way.\n\nI would be glad if you would acquaint the Department with the information contained in this letter, and trust that they will be agreeable to my request.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL.\n### ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT SCHOOL DURING QUARTER, 1936\n\n| No. | Name                  | Date of Admission | Band | State of Education | Remarks Upon Discharge |\n|-----|-----------------------|-------------------|------|--------------------|------------------------|\n|     |                       |                   |      |                    |                        |\n\n### DISCHARGE OF PUPILS\n\n| No. | Name                  | Date of Discharge | Periods in the School | State of Education | Remarks Upon Discharge |\n|-----|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|------------------------|\n|     |                       |                   |                       |                    |                        |\n\n---\n\n**NOTE:** One or more of these forms should be forwarded with each quarterly return and full particulars should be given regarding all pupils either admitted or discharged during the quarter.\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Reverend Principal says that the children are being taken care of by the School, and he would like to accept them as pupils.\n\nIf, however, you finally decide that they cannot be admitted to the School, I do not know what can be done with them. Their mother, an Indian woman, has died, and there is no orphanage or other institution to which they can be sent. Their father a white man is a fisherman, and is in the northern waters; he could not take the children with him even if we were able to locate him.\n\nI hope after you have received Dr. McQuarrie's report, you will be able to reconsider your decision in this matter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.O.Ball]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nB/DH.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, July 20, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, enclosing the June quarter return of the Coqualeetza Residential School.\n\nIn view of the information contained in the Principal's letter of July 11th, it has been decided to accept the June quarter return, with the distinct understanding that all pupils whose names were mentioned in official letter of May 28th, and who have not returned to the school by the time the September quarter return is being prepared, shall be included on the discharge sheet for the September quarter.\n\nPlease inform the Principal that, in future, in the case of any pupil who is absent from the school for three months, his or her name should be struck off the return and included on the discharge sheet.\n\nIn the case of re-admissions to the school, it is not necessary to secure new application forms. The only information the Department requires, when it is desired to re-admit a pupil who has been formerly attending the Coqualeetza School, is that application for such re-admission should be made to the Department by the proper Indian Agent, and assurance, by a medical certificate, that the pupil for whose re-admission application is being made is in good health.\n\nIt is noted that the June quarter return contains the names of three Peterson children, who come from the Vancouver agency. The application forms submitted for these children showed that the medical examiner considered each of them has active tuberculosis. Mr. Agent Ball was informed, in official letter of June 20th, last, the Department was not prepared to approve their admission to the Coqualeetza School. Please request the Principal to have these children re-examined at once, and, if they have active tuberculosis, they should be returned to their grandfather, who resides on the Capilano reserve.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

Scott says he would like them to stay.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) Doreen Heelas\nClerk to Indian Agent.\n\nDr. A.L.

The information contained in your letter has been carefully considered and it is, also, noted from the application forms that the medical examiner states that each of these children has active tuberculosis.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to approve their admission to the Coqualeetza Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) J.D. Sutherland.\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nF.J.C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n205-6 Rogers Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa, July 20, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 5th instant, you may inform the Principal of the Kitamaat Residential School that the transfer of the following children to the Coqualeetza Residential School is approved:\n\nNo. 74 - Abel Paul\n# 81 - Allan Hall\n# 82 - Gilbert Smith.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. Gillett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nSIR:\n\nI beg to forward you herewith, copy of communication received from the Office of Mr. Indian Agent Ball, Vancouver Agency, and also one from the Education Branch of the Department, in connection with the illegitimate children of Mary Mathias Joe, deceased, a Squamish Indian woman, who resided on the Capilano Indian Reserve.\n\nPrior to relinquishing the position of Medical Superintendent of the Vancouver Health Unit, I arranged to have these three children clinically examined and X-Rayed at the Vancouver Chest Clinic, as I was informed that an application was being submitted to the Department to have them admitted to the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School at Sardis. I heard nothing more about them until I was informed that they had been in Coqualeetza School for two months, but not in the Preventorium.\n\nFollowing the receipt of this information, I instructed the Reverend Principal that they were to be immediately removed from the student body and admitted to the Preventorium. Now I find that the Department will not sanction their admission to the School in any event.\n\nMr. J.D. Sutherland, Acting Superintendent of Indian Education, has apparently been misinformed about the health of these three children. None of them have active pulmonary tuberculosis disease of the infectious type. One child is entirely free of the disease, while the second has \"type F\" and the third \"type G\", neither of which are to be classified as \"open\" cases. From a medical standpoint all three of them are fit subjects for admission to Coqualeetza Indian Residential School.\n\nI am not particularly interested in anything but the medical end of this problem, but I am interested in keeping the main student body of this School tuberculosis-free.\n\nI feel that if our efforts along these lines are going to be successful, there must be the fullest cooperation between the School, the Indian Agent and myself, in connection with the admission of suspected children such as these to Coqualeetza or any other School, which we are trying to keep free of tuberculosis. Two of these children are potential spreaders and since their admission the disease may have made such progress as to render them a source of danger to the whole student body. I cannot understand why Mr. Indian Agent Ball did not consult me before these children were sent to Coqualeetza Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.L.

We are more and more prepared to give them practical training, and the contact with the larger constituency of a school like Coqualeetza is in itself calculated to be helpful. Emily Wilson, who came to us under transfer from Kitimat Girls' Home last year, has done very well indeed and I would greatly appreciate it, if the Department could see its way to authorize the transfer of the above three pupils.\n\nHoping for a favorable reply in the near future as there is only one boat a month in to Kitimat, and I have refused to allow these girls to come until I have the consent of the Department, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRCS/\nPRINCIPAL.\n\nP.S. The next boat in to Kitimat is about the 28th of September.\nOttawa, September 1st, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th ultimo, the Department approves of Joseph Reece of Hartley Bay attending the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School during the coming academic year. You should arrange to have the usual application form and certificate of health submitted to the Department for him.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. R. C. Scott,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetza Indian Res. School,\nSardis, B. C.\nOttawa, August 4, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd ultimo, the Department approves the transfer of Abel Paul, Allan Hall, Gilbert Smith, Hannah Morrison and Amelia Gray from the Kitamaat School to the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, provided there is no objection on the part of the parents.\n\nRegarding their transportation, the Department has advised the Principal of the Coqualeetza School in connection with the amount allowed for transportation of pupils to and from the Coqualeetza School this year. You should therefore make application to him for the funds required for the above mentioned children's travelling expenses to Coqualeetza.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nfor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nJames Gillett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B. C.\nSir,\n\nThe principal of the Residential School at Kitimat has asked that Abel Paul, Allan Hall and Gilbert Smith be transferred to Coqualeetza School. The Residential School at Kitimat does not keep boys after they have reached the age of eleven years.\n\nThe Principal has also asked if the Department would approve of sending Hannah Morrison and Amelia Gray to Coqualeetza. These girls are each 14 years of age. The Principal recommends that these be given further training at Coqualeetza, as they are promising pupils. I notice also that Captain Barry also recommends that they be sent to Coqualeetza.\n\nI understand from Rev. Mr. Schli that there is room for all of the above children at Coqualeetza School, and I would recommend that they be allowed to go there.\n\nThere is nothing in the letters I have received from Kitimat, as to who will pay the fares for these children. If the parents are unable to meet this expense, would the Department provide transportation, if approval is given for their transfer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. Gillatt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 30th, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Hanson,-\n\nIn the absence of Doctor McGill, the Deputy Superintendent General, I desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, enclosing letter received by you from Chief Councillor William Matthews of Massett.\n\nOwing to lack of funds, the Department is unable to provide the amount that would be required to permit Indian residential schools to pay transportation costs of children whose homes are located at a considerable distance, in order to allow them home for holidays. Under these circumstances, it is not possible to consider authorizing the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School to send home for holidays the children attending that school from the Massett Reserve. For your information, I may add that, during the holiday period, those children who remain at the Coqualeetza School are taken to a summer camp located on the ocean.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nOlaf Hanson, Esq., M. P.,\nPrince Rupert,\nB. C.\nPRINCE RUPERT, B. C.,\nJULY 21, 1936.\n\nDoctor H. W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed herewith is a letter of which I am in receipt from one William Matthews, Chief Counsellor of the Indian Reservation at Massett, B. C. I am passing this along to you for your consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nOLAF HANSON, M. P.\n\n(Skeena)\nMr Olof Hanson, M.P.\nOttawa Canada\n\nMasset Reserve B.C\nJune 25th 1936\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of May 28th received. We are very glad to know you were successful in securing some money for repairing our wharf. In a way we are helpless, we have no voice to demand our rights, that is why the Massett people appreciate your consideration. We are one and all very grateful, let us hope we may have a chance to show you how much we value your help.\n\nOur Indian Agent, Mr Gillet, was transferred to Bella Coola, now we have no one here to look after the interest of the people. We have several very important matters to be attended to right now, we hope you would make time to look into this at once.\n\nWe have some children in Coqualeetza Residential School \"Sardis B.C\" and \"Alert Bay.\" We have been unable to get our children to come home for their holidays the last two summers. It is a hardship and great burden on all our poor people, when we have to pay for their transportation to and from the school. It costs us forty dollars round trip for one child eighty dollars for two children. Now eighty dollars will buy enough grub for man and wife and four children to last them all through the winter. We appeal to you to ask the authorities to enforce the provision laid down in the Indian Act, which reads:\n\nThe Superintendent General may provide for the transport of Indian children to and from the boarding or industrial schools to which they are assigned, including transportation to and from such schools for the annual vacations.\n\nWe have some other matters to put before you at a later date.\n\nWith kindest regards, I remain\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nChief Councillor\n\nW. Matthew\nJuly 24th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is desired to refer to the problem of the three Peterson children who have been in the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School but who were directed not to be formally admitted to that institution. In this connection, I wish to refer for your convenience to the Department's letters 2-83 of July 20th, July 6th, and June 20th. Doctor McQuarrie has reported on their medical examination to the effect that none of them have active pulmonary Tuberculosis in a communicable form.\n\nThe matter seems to have become somewhat involved, and I think the best way of dealing with it is to lay down two principles which the Department would like to have followed.\n\n1. That the Department cannot authorize the admission to Residential Schools of children who are not recognized as Indians. On this point it may be said that if the father has definitely abandoned them the Department might consider a recommendation for their admission to the Band whether entitled to interest distribution or otherwise. If the father has not abandoned them, he should provide for their maintenance away from the Reserve. If they are to live on the Reserve, they should be recognized as members of the Indian Community.\n\nF. J. G. Ball Esq.,\nIndian Agent\n205-6 Rogers Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\n2. That the Department does not wish to have admitted to the Coqualeetza School children who are already subjects for preventorium treatment. Admission to the school involves the Department taking charge of the children for a period of several years, and it does not wish to assume such responsibility for children who are in a doubtful condition from a Tuberculosis standpoint. This may not be entirely feasible at all schools, but it is feasible, and the Department thinks essential, in a school which has been placed under a definite system of Tuberculosis control as Coqualeetza.\n\nIt is desired that you will review the situation in the light of these observations. The present direction is that the children should not be in the school, and you should take whatever measures are necessary to remove them from it. The matter can be reconsidered on the basis of your further report before the school opens in the fall.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R.

Scott not being there when the Indian children arrived, and not having informed this office of their expected arrival, the children were left stranded on the Union Steamship Docks till approximately 10:00 P.M. of the 10-9-36, at which time the Ticket Agent at the Union Docks got in touch with the R.C.M.P.

As no arrangements were made for transportation from Vancouver to Sardis, B.C., I purchased tickets at the B.C.

I discussed this matter personally with Mr. Sutherland last week, and he was of the opinion that the Provincial Child's Welfare Branch should take care of them, but upon taking it up with them today, they say that as Petersen and the mother were not married, the children are Indian. This is in contradiction to the third paragraph of your letter in which you state that the Department cannot authorize the admission to Residential Schools of children who are not recognized as Indians.\n\nThere is no possibility of the Squamish Band accepting these children as members, even if it were advisable to do so.\n\nAs you are aware, there are many children of this class in Residential Schools in this Province. The reason these children appear to be subjects for preventorium treatment is that the newly appointed Medical Superintendent, Dr. Atkinson, examined these children, and as they were his first cases, went into a great deal of detail in having blood tests and other examinations made through the Provincial Board of Health. Actually, I understand that when he made the examinations, he considered them far above the average of the children who are placed in Residential Schools, and passed by medical officers.\n\nThe father, Carl Petersen, is up North and presumably will not return until after the Fall fishing.\n\nThe Superintendent of Neglected Children is absent at the present time, but on her return, the matter will be taken up with her, although her office advised me that she had already had this case under consideration and had decided that she could do nothing as these children were the illegitimate offspring of an Indian woman, and therefore outside her jurisdiction.\n\nWould it not be satisfactory to have the opinion of the School Principal and Medical Officer, as to what disposition should be made of these children?\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nB/DH.\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nTO CANADIAN NATIONAL STEAMSHIPS\n\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nFOR Fares as per Transportation Warrants attached.\n\nWarrant No. 1253 Fares of Lawrence Bell from Prince Rupert to Massett $4.50\n\nWarrant No. 1254 Fares of Indian Children from Queen Charlotte City to Vancouver\n\n1 Adult Fare $16.65\n6 Children $75.00\n\nAUDITED FOR PAYMENT\n\nOCT 21 1936\n\nACCOUNTS BRANCH\nDEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nPlease remit cheque to Purser SS. \"Prince John\"\n\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nTRIPPLICATE FOR FILE\n\n16-10-36\n\nVoucher in duplicate detached for Accountant to pay.\n\nCORRECT\n\nRECEIVED PAYMENT\n\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Scott, Principal of Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, to discharge pupil No.542, Moses Leeson.\n\nI have now received the following from Reverend Mr. Scott:-\n\n\"With reference to Moses Leeson, I would regret exceedingly if this pupil had to be discharged. He is one of the best we have ever had, and had he been advised earlier would likely have asked for the special courses, upon which he is now engaged. In other words I feel that it would be an injustice to him to have him leave Coqualeetza this year. He is going into his work in Shoe Repairing, Navigation, and Motor Mechanics with fine application. The Department was good enough to allow Allan Young to remain for Shoe Repairing last year, and I am sure it has meant and will mean a good deal to him that he had the opportunity. Moses Leeson is quite as worthy of similar consideration. However, I realize that there must be an end some time to continuing older boys and girls at School, unless for such special reasons, and would greatly appreciate it if the Department would allow me to keep him in school for the remainder of the academic year, even though they feel they could not allow the Per Capita Grant for him. I have several more pupils this year, as we have accommodation for them, even though we are not able to ask for the Grant, and would like to include him in the number. I feel a bit personally responsible to see that he gets a chance for this special training.\"\n\nRegarding the above, it would appear that plenty\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\nplenty of notice was given, as on June 2nd, following receipt of your letter dated May 29th, I notified the Reverend Principal that this pupil, having reached the age of twenty-one years, should be discharged.\n\nWill you kindly give me definite instructions, which Reverend Mr. Scott is to consider as final.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O*N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 19, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant, the Department approves the action you have taken in informing the Principal of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School that Moses Leeson - No. 542, should be discharged at once.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B. C.\nSIR:-\n\nWith reference to your letter dated the 28th of October, File No.153-0-10, in which you direct that Pupils Nos. 542 and 676 of Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, should be discharged at once.\n\nI beg to refer you to your letter dated October 1st, File No.153-0-22, in which Christopher Matthews (No.676) is authorized to attend Chilliwack High School during the Academic year 1936-1937, and that the advanced educational grant of $50.00 will be allowed for him.\n\nI instructed the Reverend R.C. Scott to discharge No.542, Moses Leeson, and am enclosing his reply from which it would appear that he wished to carry him this year in Diesel Engineering. As, however, the Department are not purchasing the demonstration engine for this School, and this boy is twenty-one years of age, I am informing the Reverend Principal that the original order must stand.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nNovember 6, 1936\n\nMr. A.O'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nINDIAN OFFICE\nNEW WESTMINSTER\n\nNOV. 9 1936\n\nDear Mr. Daunt:\n\nThis is to acknowledge receipt of your letter containing list of pupils admitted to Coqualeetza last quarter and also list of pupils discharged at the same time. I am giving attention to those pupils whose application forms and certificates of health as mentioned in your letter are not complete.\n\nRegarding No. 542-Moses Lessson, who is the only remaining pupil of the four suggested for discharge by the Department, I beg to say that I have been waiting until we had something more definite with regard to the Diesel engine which we have asked for before taking up his case with the Department. When I spoke to him of the suggestion from the Department that it might be better for him to discontinue High School work, unless he was preparing for some definite career, for which that work would be a preparation, he said that he thought it was necessary for him to complete High School before undertaking a course in Diesel engineering. I explained to him that if it was a practical course rather than one in advanced theory, we could give him all he needs here at Coqualeetza. He was quite satisfied to leave High School and said that he would think about taking the course here. Consequently I waited for further word before taking up his case. He came back to School late as he was engaged in fall fishing, and is here now. He has been one of our very best pupils, thoroughly dependable and has made satisfactory progress in his work. He is very anxious to take Shoe Repairing, for which he seems to have a natural ability, Motor Mechanics, Navigation and Boat Building, and if the Department would allow him to remain for this year, I am sure he would get a lot of practical benefit from his work. He has been for some time on the Shoe Repairing. Mr. Fordred says he is by far the best workman he has had. I am sure that we can give him enough Navigation and Diesel engine instruction to greatly increase his usefulness in the fishing industry, and therefor increase his chances of better financial returns. He would be able to work at the Shoe Repairing in the winter and as there is no one in his home village doing such work, his spare time in Winter might be profitably employed.\n\nI have been gathering data for an appeal to the Department for assistance in getting equipment for Shoe Repairing and shall be writing shortly about this. I would greatly appreciate it if the Department could see its way clear to allow this pupil to remain for this year. I greatly appreciate the consideration the Department has shown in this case, and in this instance I am very sure that Lessson would amply justify any such privilege that may be granted him. Hoping that you may see your way clear to recommend it to the Department,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRCS/W\nCOQUELCHETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nIN ACCOUNT WITH:\nHAROLD F.

It is noted that you will keep in mind the instructions contained in that letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. R. C. Scott,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetza Indian Res. School,\nSardis, B. C.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C. December 3, 1936\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nSchools Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of November 25th over signature of Mr. J.D. Sutherland with regard to the list of pupils sent in by Captain Barry, a copy of which you enclosed with your letter. I beg to say that practically the same list was submitted to you through Mr. Daunt early in May. Not having heard anything I presumed that the Department was willing for these children to remain for this year. I note in your present letter that you are willing that these children, or most of them, should remain until the end of June next. I appreciate the consideration thus given the School. It is very necessary that we maintain our pupilage to the maximum this year in an endeavor to absorb the deficit of last year, owing to diminished pupilage. I can understand the viewpoint of the Department, but would like to say that in many instances these pupils get a good deal more out of their school years from sixteen to eighteen than out of any other two years in the School. I infer in view of the fact that the Department has added equipment for Manual Training, Motor Mechanics, Boat Building and Girls' Handicrafts, that it would be their wish to allow certain students to remain even after they have reached the age of sixteen years. If not, it would seem to take away any meaning from the policy of the past. I am quite in accord with the desires of the Department to make the education of Indian children in Residential Schools as practical as possible, and also to lessen the number of students above sixteen years. At the same time I think a few students who are likely to make use of it, should be allowed High School privileges and that students specially worthy should be allowed extra training along practical lines. These would be cases to be taken up with the Department directly, and I shall try before the end of this School year to bring before you any suggestion I have to make with regard to such pupils for next year. I greatly appreciate your cooperation by issuing\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nSchools Branch,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDec. 3, 1936\n\nInstructions to Indian Agents concerned to assist in recruiting for the School. At the same time I would point out the difficulty that would face them, as it does me, in view of the fact that the Department is placing strong emphasis on Day Schools. For instance, Campbell River has been one of our good villages, but a Day School has recently been built there and I have refrained from recruiting. One or two children have come in from there this year, but they are from underprivileged homes.\n\nAssuring you of my desire to cooperate and to work with the Department along lines that seem in the best interests to all concerned, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.C. SCOTT\nPrincipal\nOttawa, November 25, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, with further reference to Moses Leeson - pupil No. 542 of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School.\n\nIn official letter of the 19th instant, your action in instructing the Principal to discharge this boy was approved. However, in view of the contents of Reverend Mr. Scott's letter, the Department now considers that this boy might be allowed to remain at the Coqualeetza Residential School.\n\nIt is noted from Mr. Scott's letter that there are more pupils in the school than the number for which grant is allowed. You may, therefore, inform Reverend Mr. Scott that the Department approves of Moses Leeson remaining in the school for a short additional time, in order that he may complete his course but his name should not be included among the regular grant-earning pupils.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nA. O'H. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B. C.\nOttawa, November 25, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Inspector Barry's report regarding his inspection of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School on the 12th and 13th instant.\n\nWith his report, Inspector Barry forwarded the enclosed list of pupils who are sixteen years of age and over. You are, no doubt, aware of the requirements of the Indian Act; viz., that pupils should not be retained in a residential school after they reach the age of sixteen unless our permission has been obtained. Our files do not indicate that such permission has been requested except in a very few cases.\n\nMr. Barry is of the opinion, in which the Department concurs, that it should be possible to obtain younger children and, in this regard, I may say that we are prepared to cooperate with you by issuing definite instructions to the Indian Agents concerned to assist you in recruiting for your school.\n\nIt is our desire that the pupils whose names are shown on the enclosed list should be discharged from the Coqualeetza School within a reasonable time and, certainly, all of these should be discharged not later than the end of June, 1937. The Department does not wish the pupilage at the Coqualeetza School to be suddenly reduced below the number for which grant is provided but, in writing this letter, we simply wish to point out to you our views in the matter and I feel you will agree that the matter can be handled within the next six or seven months in a manner that will meet with our approval and, at the same time, will not effect the finances of the Coqualeetza Residential School.\n\nOn the suggestion of Inspector Barry, I enclose copy of circular letter with reference to fire drill.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. R. C. Scott,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetza Indian Res. School,\nSardis, B. C.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nIN ACCOUNT WITH\n\nR.

(RG 10, Volume 6442, file 880-10, part 1)\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of February 26th, File 153-0-10, with regard to Max and Jean Elliott, pupils at Coqualeetza School. I appreciate very much the fact that these children are being allowed to stay until the end of June. At the same time I wish it were possible for their cases to be reconsidered. They are certainly Indian children for all intents and purposes, living the Indian mode of life in a village where there is no Day School. Their parents are Indians. Even though the father is not recognized as an Indian he is living all the time on an Indian Reserve.\n\nSo far as our pupilage is concerned, if the Department insists on the graduation of all our sixteen year old pupils, it means almost a twenty percent exodus of our present enrolment. When you add to these the number who will remain out for the usual causes, I can foresee difficulty in filling the School another year. However, I am concerned for the future of these children, and if it were possible, would appreciate very much the reconsideration of their cases. I shall be glad to cooperate with the Department in every way.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.C. Scott\nPrincipal\nOttawa, February 26, 1937.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to Jean Elliott.\n\nFrom the information given in your letter it is not considered that this girl is a ward of this Department. You refer to her brother, Max Elliott, who is at present a pupil at the Coqualeetza School. He was sent to Coqualeetza in 1933, but on reviewing our files, it is found that no application was ever submitted for our approval.\n\nBoth Max and Jean Elliott may remain at Coqualeetza until the end of June. At the end of that time, however, they should be returned to their parents. It is felt that there should be no great difficulty in securing a sufficient number of recognized Indian children to keep the Coqualeetza School at full strength.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. R. C. Scott,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetza Indian Res. School,\nSardis, B.C.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nFebruary 17, 1937\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to bring before you the case of Jean Elliott, daughter of John Elliott of Ladysmith. This man is for all intents and purposes an Indian. He lives the Indian mode of life and claims to have been received as a member of the Chemainus Indian Band, to which his wife belongs. I have taken this matter up with Mr. Indian Agent Graham of Duncan, and he informs me that Elliott was not accepted by the Department as a member of that band.\n\nLast Summer when I was visiting the Indian fishing camp at Cape Mudge, Mrs. Elliott asked to have their little girl received at School. There was nothing in the circumstances or the appearance of this man to indicate that he was anything but an Indian; consequently I received the girl and she has been here at School since September. Seeing that there is no Day School at Ladysmith, and her brother Max Elliott, No. 773 has been at this School for the last three years, I would appreciate it very much if the Department would agree to this girl being received as a grant earning pupil at Coqualeetza. Mr. Graham is quite willing, but simply waits for the permission of the Department as is usual in such cases.\n\nThanking you in anticipation I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.C. SCOTT\nPrincipal\nOttawa, February 16, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, enclosing a return requesting the discharge of three pupils from the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School and, in reply, to inform you that the discharge of the following is approved:\n\nNo. 0544 - Mary J. George\n\" 0545 - Isabel George\n\" 0546 - Mary V. Sillseemult\n\nIt is noted that the Principal is endeavouring to obtain the applications and certificates of health for the admission of the children referred to in official letter of January 20, last. It is hoped that he will be able to forward these with his March quarter return.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B. C.\nSIR:-\n\nIn reply to your letter dated the 20th ultimo, File No.153-0-10, I beg to forward you herewith, Form No.35, for addition to the September Quarterly Report, applying for the discharge of the three pupils, No.0-544, Mary J. George, No.0-545, Isabel George and No.0-546, Mary V. Sillseemult.\n\nThese pupils were absent from the School at that time, and as under the regulations they were not carried on the December Quarter Return. Form No.35 should have been rendered for them in September and this was not done, the attached, therefore, will complete the September report.\n\nWith reference to the missing applications and certificates of health, I have received the following report from the Reverend Principal:-\n\n\"I have your letter of the 25th instant, with regard to our December Quarter returns and the comments upon the same by the Department. With regard to the pupils whose Applications and Certificates of Health have not been received, I am working on these and hope to have them all in hand before the March Quarter. I have one or two completed now. There is no mail for instance into Kemano or Gardiner Canal and I just have to take chances on getting it in.

Daunt,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Daunt:\n\nI am enclosing two letters from the Principal of the Provincial Industrial School for Boys, which are self-explanatory. I have really had good fortune thus far with problem cases and have had no trouble in a single instance. I have a boy in School now from Kitimaat who just escaped being sent up to Prince Rupert for trial on a case similar to this. We have the girls here too, who were involved at Kitimaat, and were sent in by Mr. Gillett the Agent; so that our experience has been favourable to help out in such cases. However, this lad is along in years a bit and he is also over sixteen. From Mr. Boyes' letter it would appear that the Department is desirous of sending this lad to a Residential School. We are graduating both our Shoe Making lads this year, so that this boy might fit in alright. I would consider taking him on the understanding set forth in the last paragraph of Mr. Boyes' letter of May 17th. If you think the Department would be agreeable I shall be glad of your advice in the matter. Please return the letters when you reply.\n\nWith all good wishes and thanking you I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.C. Scott\nPRINCIPAL\n\nRCS/W\nENC.\nProvincial Industrial School for Boys\n\nP.O. Box E.\nPORT COQUITLAM, B.C. May 10th, 1937.\n\nSuperintendent,\nCoquileetza Residential School,\nSardis, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received a letter from Mr. S. Mallinson, Acting Indian Agent at Hazelton, in which he asks me to inquire as to the possibility of your school accepting a boy from here.\n\nThis lad, George Williams, has been here for over a year and it seems a shame to keep him longer. He has never given a bit of trouble, has become a real worker in the shoe shop and should be sent home. Unfortunately there appears to be no home and the department is forced to send him to one or other of its Indian schools. Apparently Alert Bay is crowded, hence the suggestion that I get in touch with you.\n\nIf you have room for George I shall be pleased to notify Mr. Mallinson to that effect and to secure his transfer to you.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFOB/C.\nPrincipal.\nProvincial Industrial School for Boys\nP.O. Box E.\nPORT COQUITLAM, B.C. May 17th, 1937.\n\nR.C. Scott, Esq.,\nPrincipal, Coquileetza Residential School,\nSardis, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI was pleased to receive your letter and to learn that you might have a place for George.\n\nThe boy was seventeen on January 12 of this year. He was sent in on a charge of Carnal Knowledge, having to do with a fifteen year old Indian girl on the Kitwanga Reserve. He arrived here May 2nd, 1936.\n\nSince the day of his arrival he has never given us a minute's trouble. He works well, plays hard and tends strictly to his own affairs. Naturally a quiet fellow he is learning to smile and even laugh on occasion and if he could see a place for himself when he leaves here I think he would develop even more rapidly.\n\nIn the event of your deciding to try him I want you to know that we would be prepared to take him back at a moment's notice should his conduct become unsatisfactory to you.\n\nThanking you for your interest in the lad, I remain,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nOttawa, June 2, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th ultimo, you may inform the Principal of the Coqualeetsa Residential School that the discharge of the following pupils is approved:\n\n| No.   | Name                  |\n|-------|-----------------------|\n| 515   | Frank Calder          |\n| 570   | Frances Stokan        |\n| 616   | Elmer Dick            |\n| 623   | Donald Gladstone      |\n| 649   | Jacob Brown Smith     |\n| 652   | Sidney Wilson         |\n| 654   | Wallace Paul          |\n| 676   | Chris Matthews        |\n| 684   | Gordon Angus          |\n| 692   | Eddie Underwood       |\n| 699   | Calder Raymond        |\n| 706   | Godfrey Williams      |\n| 716   | Ames Harry            |\n| 731   | Ernest Morven         |\n| 752   | Gordon Robinson       |\n| 759   | Wellington Morrison   |\n| 760   | John Shaw             |\n| 762   | Walter Douglas        |\n| 752   | Chester Maitland      |\n| 756   | Heber Maitland        |\n| 772   | Max Elliott           |\n| 777   | Charles P.

Age Limit. |\n| 0579 | Wilson, Emily | I7  | VII   | Has reached her limit in all respects with regard to School life. Age Limit. |\n\nI beg to say that there are six girls on the above list, who were not mentioned in the Department letter above referred to, but I have included their names for the reasons set opposite. There are forty-six names altogether on the above list, as compared with the forty-two on the list submitted by the Department.\nI have not included one name in the Girls' list which was mentioned, namely, Marjorie Wilson. I am very anxious to have this girl remain at School for another year. Her father and mother are separated, and she is not developed enough to stand up under the circumstances which are certain to confront her. She is good at cooking, sewing and Home Nursing and is very anxious to return for a year's work in these departments. She got 75% in her Department work, and I would greatly appreciate it if the Department would allow her to remain in school next year.\n\nThe same is true with regard to Helen McMillan and Mildred Davis. I have included their names in the list, but both these girls warrant another year in Handicrafts, and have asked to be allowed to remain. I can heartily recommend this to the Department.\n\nRegarding the Boys' list:\n\nI have taken the liberty to leave the name of Elmer Pollard off the above list, although it is on that submitted by the Department, but I have included names which were not suggested by the Department.\n\nPollard is perhaps our best pupil. He is much interested in Navigation and Mechanics to get his papers so that he can be put in charge of Seine Boats or large fish boats. He has secured a place on the Seine Boat \"Otter Bay\" at Alert Bay for the summer and is very anxious to be allowed to return to Coqualeetza for one more year in which to take more Navigation and Motor Mechanics, as well as his Class Room work. I cannot too highly recommend him for this course, and trust that the Department will allow him the privilege. I feel sure it will mean progress in actual fitting out for his life's work.\n\nThe name of Elmer Green, has also been omitted. This lad is bed with Tuberculous glands and is in our Preventorium. I feel that he should be allowed to remain until he has been \"X\" Rayed again at the end of this School year, when the matter of his discharge can be taken up.\n\nThe same is true of Charles Erica Wilson, but he is in better shape than Elmer Green, and so I have included his name for discharge, as I think the \"X\" Ray report will be favorable.\n\nThe above list embraces the names of 45 pupils, which is a big class to discharge in one year. However, I am in favor of graduating Sixteen year old pupils, with exceptions such as I have intimated above. Hence, I shall be glad to have the support of the Department in recruiting pupils to take the places vacated by those listed above, as suggested in their letters of Nov. 25th/36 mentioned at the beginning of this letter.\n\nI shall write more fully on this matter in a few days.\n\nI shall be glad if I might have Certificates, such as the Department issues to pupils graduated from Residential Schools, for the above pupils, in time for our closing exercises next month.\n\nTrusting this is all in order, and assuring you of my desire to cooperate in all that will increase the efficiency of the School, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRCS/\n\nPRINCIPAL.\n\nP.S.\n\nI find that I have not mentioned the name of Wilfred Sam. Both his parents are dead; he has no home, and conditions on his Home Reserve are bad. He is slow in Class Room, but started late to go to School. He has done better this year than any yet, and if he had another year to get more experience in farming, and in M.T., I am sure it would be money well spent by the Department. I would greatly appreciate it if this lad were allowed another year.\nOttawa, July 13th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 28th ultimo, the Department approves the transfer of Irene Grant; Reggie Smith and Arthur Cross from the Kitamaat Indian Residential School to the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School.

R.C. Scott, Principal of the Coqualeetza school arrived in Prince Rupert on the 27th inst. to collect returning pupils. Also two lady members of the Alert Bay school staff arrived for the same purpose. Special care is given in the selection of pupils for residential schools, deserving and necessitous cases being given first consideration.\n\nW. E. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nMr R.A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSeptember 10th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to say that I am forwarding by this mail, one of the Certificates which were issued to pupils of this School who Graduated in June last. This particular one, was wrongly inscribed. It is made out to Vesta Williams, and it ought to have read \"Vesta Matthews\". I wonder if a new one might be issued to this pupil? If it is sent to me, I shall gladly forward it.\n\nAnother of our Graduates, Gordon Robinson, graduated a year ago but took High School work, Grade IO last year, and is being discharged as from June 30th last, says he did not receive a certificate. I would greatly appreciate it if a certificate might be issued to him also.\n\nThis lad was one of our best pupils, and did well in his work last year. He might have continued with good hopes of success, but felt that seeing he was going out along with others of his village to fish, trap and hunt, that he might better get at his life work. His record all through his School life was good, and I am hoping that in time he will give effective leadership to his people along lines that will make for their betterment.\n\nThanking you in anticipation of these courtesies, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL.\n\nP.S. Gordon Robinson's number was 758.\n\nR.C.S.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 5, 1937.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of August 27th enclosing application for the admission of Vina Dolores Clifford to the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School.\n\nPlease communicate with the principal and, if he is finding difficulty in obtaining sufficient pupils, to bring the pupilage of the Coqualeetza Residential School to the number for which grant is provided, the Department will have no objections to your sending Vina Clifford to the school.\n\nIf, however, the placing of her in Coqualeetza would mean that an Indian child would have to be refused, the girl should not be sent to the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nGordon G. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agency,\nNanaimo, B.C.\nDear Sir,\n\nre - Application of Vina Dolores Clifford for Admission to the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School.\n\nI enclose, for your consideration, an application for the admission of Vina Dolores Clifford, age 7, to the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, Sardis, B.C.\n\nThere is no doubt that the father of this child was a Whiteman but his identity was never established.\n\nThe mother is an unmarried Indian woman who is constantly sick, having received hospital treatment several times this year. She has often obtained employment as a maid but could not hold a position for any length of time owing, mainly, to ill health.\n\nThe grand-parents have a grown-up family, all living at home, and are bringing up the children of a deceased daughter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. Mallinson,\nClerk.\n\nEnc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 4, 1837\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo enclosing letter from the Principal of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School with reference to Jean Elliott.\n\nAs the Reverend Mr. Scott was previously informed, it is extremely doubtful if this girl should be considered as one of our wards. However, if Mr. Scott finds difficulty in obtaining sufficient pupils to bring the pupilage of the Coqualeetza School to the number for which grant is provided, the Department will not object to his retaining Jean Elliott for another year.

Scott, Principal of Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, regarding the case of Jean Elliott, who is apparently a half-breed pupil of Ladysmith in the Cowichan Agency.\n\nThe initial correspondence in this matter appears to have gone direct to the Department, so I am forwarding you Captain Scott's letter for attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nAugust 21, 1937\n\nMr. A.O'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Daunt:\n\nSome time ago I wrote the Department with reference to Jean Elliott, daughter of Jack Elliott of Ladysmith, being allowed to continue at Coqualeetza as a grant earning pupil. I wrote a second letter with regard to this girl, but have had no definite reply from the Department. Their first letter advised me that this girl would have to be discharged from Coqualeetza as her father rated as a White man. I would like to make another plea for this child.\n\nHer mother is an Indian of the Ladysmith Band, and the father is a half-breed who lives with his wife permanently at Ladysmith. I understand that his brother's children attend Kuper Island School. He is to all intents and purposes an Indian, and lives the Indian mode of life entirely. There is no School of any sort near their home at Ladysmith, either Indian or White, and it means that this child, who is an Indian to all intents and purposes, will be denied an education. I have room for her and if the Department could see its way clear, I would be glad to have her continue at Coqualeetza.\n\nTrusting that it may be possible to keep this girl, and awaiting the reply of the Department,\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.C.

Their Cousin Jean Elliott was of the same standing and the Department granted her permission to attend as a Grant earning pupil. She is in poor health and I have not asked her to return. Other children of the above children are Indians of the Quamichan Band. They live the Indian mode of life, and have no school near them. I did not recruit them, but they came in along with other children from their area. I have room for them at the present and would appreciate it if they were allowed to attend as Grant earning pupils for the year.\n\nNo. 882 Is an ex-pupil of Alberni Residential School. The father and mother are separated, and the mother has looked after him from his childhood. She lives in Vancouver, on Powell Street. The boy ought to do well here this year. His mother cannot support him now that he cannot be taken out of Alberni.\n\nNo's 766 and 767, also 724 and 0563, are all re-admissions having been discharged for being absent more than three months. Under arrangement with the Department their way is clear to re-enter without new Application Forms.\n\nTrusting you will find all this in order, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL.\n\nIndian Affairs.

He states that the father is dead and that mother is not giving proper care to the children and, as a result, their home life is hopeless.\n\nIn view of the above information, it is considered that it would be in the best interests of these children to place them in the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School. You should have them examined by a medical officer and if he pronounces them physically fit, you may arrange for sending them to Coqualeetza at the earliest possible date. Payment of their expenses will be made on receipt from you of a properly certified account, in triplicate.\n\nYou should, of course, forward application forms and certificates of health for the Department's file.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nW.E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOttawa, October 20, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th instant, you may inform the Principal of the Coqualeetsa Residential School that the Department approves the admission of the following children:\n\nLeonard Allen Parnell\nPhilip Parnell\nElizabeth Abraham\nFrank George Dixon\nArnold Gilbert Pearson\nThomas Harry Hans.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division\n\nB.T.

There is five more that should have been sent with the above number, but they were away with their parents in different districts fishing.

Between two and three thousand garments pass through the hands of the seven or eight girls on duty, during the week.\n\nThe Manufacturing Department is becoming a place of interest, for, at least twenty distinctly different types of articles are made there during a school term. A girl's training culminates at graduation, for she is then supplied with new materials to make a complete set of clothes, including woolen material for a suit.\n\nDuring the last year, the opening of a very small Indian Handicraft and Home Craft branch, was made possible by a $100.00 grant from the Indian Department at Ottawa. This work is under the direction of Miss Aust, Columbian College, and includes carding, spinning, dyeing, knitting and weaving of yarns into Cowichan sweaters, weaving and hooking of them into rugs, using symbolic native designs. They have also used commercial wools for knitting and for weaving on simple and more complicated looms. The result has been some well knit sweaters and berets, and artistically woven radio mats, purses belts and bandings. Into these latter articles they have woven canoe, whale, thunder birds, arrow heads, basket and totem designs.\n\nSince last November the girls have been keenly interested and greatly encouraged through the kindly interest of Mrs. Scott, who has made it possible for them to have extra tuition in cooking twice a week, two to to the Principal's Residence and receive careful direction along this line. This is an expansion very much needed.\nThe girls of our Residential Schools need encouragement in house cooking, laundering, etc., necessary in family life; not only encouragement, but made to realize that it is not just daily routine, but that it all has a worthy Scientific and Economic side, very much needed in home life, and especially the home life of their villages.\n\nA Home Economic plant or building is needed and a qualified Instructor. This would make it possible for the girls to have a minimum of five periods a week for three years, along the social science of housekeeping and home-making, and graduate from the school with a diploma.\n\nMiss E.

Scott, Prin.\n\nDated, Sardis, B.C.\nJanuary 30, 1935.\nVocational Training: Attached to this report are very full statements with regard to the Vocational Training at the school. Statements with regard to the Girls' Work, Manual Training, Boat Building, and Navigation were prepared for me at the school. Owing to the prevailing blizzard conditions and sub zero temperature while I was at the school, it was quite impossible to see as much of this work as I should have desired. It is possible that I shall have an opportunity of inspecting the Boat Building and Manual Training later in the year, if I visit the school to carry out Tests preparatory to the children writing the Provincial Entrance Examinations at the end of June.\n\nThe Navigation Class is a new addition to the activities of the school. The instruction given by the Principal ought to be of the very greatest help to the boys when they graduate and are engaged in the various types of boat work along our coasts.\n\nIt will be noted that the boat being built here is a 28 foot gill net or trolling hull. I am very glad to learn that the boys are doing the actual work. Little benefit is gained by the boys when the instructor does most of the work and the boys just watch or help with the rough work only.\n\nThe Vocational Training of the girls is receiving increased attention. I am in favour of the giving of instruction in the handling of the small boat; but I could not recommend any extra grant at present for this, as there are so many things badly needed in the school as mentioned in other parts of this report. I believe that it would be perfectly possible to have a few of the girls at a time attend to the cooking Etc. in the Principal's Residence, as is now being done, and that possibly this could be increased a little to cover the preparation of Staff meals Etc. as apart from the general work of the school. This or something very like it is being done, and I am of the opinion that this training must suffice for the present. The work in Weaving, Etc is proving a success.\n\nFire Protection: Fire drills are held regularly. It was of course quite impossible to hold such a drill during my visit to the school. The temperature was about six degrees below zero and there was a snow blizzard most of the time. Under these conditions to have attempted a Fire Drill would have been to expose the children to grave danger.\n\nDormitories: The general condition of the dormitories is quite satisfactory, as far as neatness, state of beds, floors, Etc. The dormitories located towards the front of the school were far too cold, even with the steam full on. The wind and snow make their way around the window frames. It is very necessary that something be done to remedy this state of things during the 1935 vacation period. It would be hard to exaggerate the adverse conditions under which the school was being carried on at the time of my inspection. It was found quite impossible to hold a conference with the Principal in his own office even with the steam heat full on and an extra electric heater working. The wind was blowing right into the room and we had to retire to the office of the Lady Superintendent at the back of the building. The Dormitories are taking every possible risk of losing a number of children through illness resulting from exposure to adverse health conditions during the winter at this school under present conditions. The failure of the heating plant is reported on again under the heading of Boiler Room.\nExpense for equipment for these classes, the Department agreed, should be taken out of the grant of $600.00 for Boat Building Supplies.\n\nA Compass, Parallel Rulers, Dividers, a Set of Charts and 18 copies of Rules of the Road have been secured at a cost of under $30.00.\n\nFifty-eight boys have been enrolled and two classes a week are held, one for the High School Students, and one for the Intermediates and Seniors. The course embraces a working knowledge of the Compass, laying of Courses, applying Deviation and Variation, familiarity with Signals, Buoys, Chart Reading and the Rule of the Road at Sea.\n\nThe boys seem greatly interested and the aim of the course is to help them to handle their own boats intelligently and to give them the rudiments of Navigation and Seamanship, which would make possible a start towards responsible positions upon boats for Fishing or S.S. Companies.\n\nThe assistance of the Department in providing equipment is much appreciated.\n\nCapt. R. C. Scott,\nPrincipal\nCOQUALNETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\n- BOAT BUILDING -\n\nReport:\n18th January, 1935.\n\nThrough the kindness of the Department in granting $600.00 for materials, we have been able to begin a course in Boat Building this month (January, 1935).\n\nThe Instructor is Mr. R. Huddleston, formerly of the Sea Craft Boat Works, New Westminster, B.C. Mr. Huddleston is thoroughly trained and seems to have the knack of getting the boys to do the actual work under his supervision.\n\nThe Course will include building a 28' Fishing Boat, suitable either for gill netting or commercial trolling, and later on, two row-boats. Twelve boys are engaged, six in the morning and six in the afternoon, and each shift gives them three hours of continuous work. The work is laid down from a plan drawn by Mr. A. Halliday of Vancouver, a Marine Architect of long standing, and each class is instructed in what work may have been done by the other group, before going on with their own shift. This is a practical effort to make possible enlarged usefulness, with profit to the boys concerned and we feel that the Department will be well repaid for the initial outlay.\n\nThe salary of the Instructor, is, for the time being, paid by the school, out of Per Capita Funds, but it is hoped that, providing the work done is worth while, the Department may see its way clear to relieve the school of this item. Future work will depend upon our being able to sell the boats produced, so as to buy materials for further boats. It is not, of course, proposed to go into such production on a larger scale than may be necessary to give the boys adequate instruction.\n\nMr. R. Huddleston - Instructor\nCapt. R. C. Scott - Principal\nREPORT OF MANUAL TRAINING DEPARTMENT\n\nThe Manual Training course is divided into four divisions. The first, or elementary division gives a rudimentary knowledge of the bench tools and their use and care, demonstrated through a series of twelve exercises or models, such as small brackets, pot stands, etc. This embraces such operations as planing, sawing, chiseling and boring. Coupled with this, is the theoretical part, with the drawing of the models, printing and notes on the tool operations and assembly.\n\nThe secondary division is a continuation of the first, only following a more detailed course of models, with additional theory and drawing practice. The models range from a simple bench hook to small stools, trays, lamps, etc. Construction of these models employs a variety of joints such as butt, dado, mitre and mortise and tenon. Also tool operations as rabbeting and grooving. Finishing of models both painting and staining are introduced.\n\nThe third division branches into rural and farm projects, including milking stools, single trees, double trees, harness hooks, ladders, saw horses, etc.\n\nThe fourth division is a study in elementary cabinet making and involves table construction, frame construction, cabinet construction, door construction and drawer construction.

In view of the very definite information supplied in your letter, no further action will be taken at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B.A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\n\nPP/O/K.\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nRe: Manual Training, Coqualeetza School\n\nI have read the extracts from Inspector Barry's report, enclosed in your communication of December 11th, with a good deal of interest, and my first reaction is one of surprise that Mr. Barry should have been inspecting this school for five years without having discovered before what he is reporting at the present time. There is absolutely nothing new in the situation except for the fact that very decided improvements have been made since Captain Scott became Principal.\n\nNone of us is satisfied that the handicraft being taught either to the boys or to the girls at Coqualeetza is ideal, and yet it is only fair to the school to say that of all the residential schools belonging to our own or any other Church, visited by our Commission in May, Coqualeetza was the only one that had a manual training department worthy of the name.\n\nI do not think it is necessary that I should attempt to deal with the details of these criticisms, but I would like to make one or two observations.\n\nThe Manual Training Instructor at Coqualeetza is a very highly qualified man and is working for less than half the salary that he could get teaching his own specialty in a vocational or technical school. He is genuinely interested in Indian design, art and crafts, and is probably, outside of Dr. Haley, the best authority in British Columbia to-day on that line. The designs and other work on the girls' side which Captain Barry commends - and quite rightly so - owe a very great deal to this man's investigations and suggestions. Like all specialists, he does tend too much to the manufacture of exhibition pieces, and does not give sufficient attention to the manufacture of the simple articles of home furniture which the boys should normally use after they graduate. It should be said, however, that very considerable improvement in that respect has taken place during the last year and that in the building and outfitting of the Preventorium the Department undoubtedly saved about $1,000 through the fact that the senior boys did most of the work under the direction of this teacher.\n\nThe teaching on the girls' side is just as weak from the same standpoint and is also in process of evolution. Their work in the making of Cowichan sweaters, kimonos, and other such articles, is indisputably excellent, but the amount of actual experience\nthey get in making the clothes that they will need for themselves and their children after they graduate, is less than in some schools with a much less elaborate programme.\n\nI do not attach much importance to Mr. Barry's criticism of the manufacture of totem poles by the hundreds. There is plenty of excellent hand carving being done on totem poles at Coqualeetza. The lathe and saw being used in the manufacture of the cheaper ones are not so expensive but that any Indian boy could easily buy them for himself after a good fishing season, and there does not seem to me to be any valid reason why the Japanese should preempt the market for totem pole place cards and that type of thing, while the graduates of our residential schools go idle for half the year. So far as it's being a commercial venture is concerned, I think it can easily be demonstrated that it has never been profitable to the school. I place a fairly high value on it, however, as indicating to these Indian boys the type of thing they can do in their own homes in British Columbia between fishing seasons that will increase their income.\n\nPersonally, I regard the instruction which is being given in boat building as satisfactory. I think the electrical and radio course is excellent. The boys are getting a fine training in navigation. I do not know the reason why the department of motor mechanics is not now under the direction of the teacher who has been heading it up for the last two or three years. I sat through one of his classes on the occasion of my last visit to Coqualeetza and considered that as a mechanic and as a teacher he was far above the average. He was the owner of a fine garage and repair station in the neighboring town of Chilliwack and it may be that his own business has increased to the point where he finds it impossible to give any time to the school. I will write to Captain Scott and find out. I do know that the boys in the class which graduated in motor engine work last year were all competent to take down, repair, and put together two or three different types of boat engines.\n\nAfter I have heard from Captain Scott, I will communicate with you again.\n\nThanking you for letting me see this report,\n\nI am Yours sincerely,\n\nKJB.MLT\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6442, file 880-11, part 1)\nOttawa, December 11, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Beaton,-\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of Inspector Barry's report regarding the manual training work at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School.\n\nAs it appears from the Inspector's report that the manufacture of totem poles is more or less a commercial enterprise and, consequently, may bring some revenue to the school, the Department considers it advisable to communicate with you before writing the Principal. We are inclined to agree with Mr. Barry's conclusions that it would be better to discontinue manufacturing totem poles by machinery.\n\nI would appreciate receiving your comments regarding Mr. Barry's report.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B. A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. W.,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nPP/O'M.\nIn the words of the Instructor \"A separate branch is the Indian Handicraft Section. We are attempting to give a course on Indian designs, carving, totem poles etc., using, as near as possible, the native coloring. Totem poles are made from photos, cuts, or drawings of authentic poles. The decoration of Manual Training projects is dealt with here, and carved or painted Indian designs are applied wherever suitable. We are treating this as a Commercial subject and are trying to develop a market for Indian Crafts. I would like to suggest that the Department recognize this branch and endorse it in the School Curriculum\".\n\nWith regard to the work outlined in the words of the Instructor above, I wish to say that I consider the making of totem poles as it is done at Coqualeetza a complete waste of time. The poles are first cut out roughly by hand saw and then finished by the boys. Such poles are, the Instructor tells me, being ordered by the hundred as a commercial or quasi-commercial venture. The poles have a label attached when finished saying that they are Indian craftsmanship etc. To me the poles that I was shown appear very poor indeed. They are not much better than the rubbish sent to B.C. from Japan, and in fact the Instructor admits that the poles made at Coqualeetza have to compete with the article as made in Japan. From a Manual Training point of view the construction of totem poles, largely by machinery, would not appear to have any value whatever. Efforts are being made at Alert Bay Indian Residential School to teach the Indian boys to carve out the totem poles by hand, the Instructor being a well known carver of such poles, Charlie James. This activity at Coqualeetza appears to me a very minor activity started just because St. Michael's Alert Bay was making some splendid poles.\n\nI would ask the Department to have the making of totem poles in Indian Residential Schools BY MACHINERY or PARTLY BY MACHINERY stopped as soon as possible. I expressed to the Instructor my own personal dislike of such machine made totem poles, and also informed him that there was a wide spread feeling in the Province that the making of totem poles partly by machinery at Coqualeetza was a very great mistake.\n\nIt will of course be understood that I am anxious that genuine native craft work be encouraged in the schools. I have reported on this in other years. The work now being done by the girls, as mentioned on the last page under the girls' part of this report on Vocational Training, deserves every encouragement.\n\nThe High School course in Manual Training is a continuation of the Fourth Division and is along more technical lines. Let the work and operations are here taught to all pupils. Furniture construction is the foundation of the course. The Vancouver Technical School Course is being followed to some extent at least.\n\nI may say that I am not very well satisfied with the work now being done in the Manual Training Class here. The best thing I saw was the construction of a T.B. Preventorium. I consider that there are a number of articles needed in the classrooms which should be constructed by the M.T. Class before such foolish things as totem poles are made. The making of farm equipment\nequipment such as that described in Division Three is an activity of use to the Indians.\n\nIt is hoped to introduce an Electrical and Radio Course along the basic lines laid down by the Vancouver Technical School. Students of such course will construct actual circuits from a simple bell circuit to the more complex wiring for houses, automobile and marine wiring and ignition, dry cells, storage batteries, generators, and radio systems will be studied. If the necessary funds are available actual radio projects will be taught, from the simple circuits used in crystal sets to more advanced circuits. This will enable students to service and repair existing sets, or to construct sets of commercial value.\n\nThe above three paragraphs are taken from the notes supplied to me at Coqualeetza. I may say that I am in favour of instruction being given to the older boys in the actual working and repair of engines likely to be used by them in fishing boats. I consider however that the instructor should be an outside mechanic, which would not appear to be the present intention at the school. When I reported on this work some two years ago an outside mechanic was employed. I certainly do not think that expensive equipment should be supplied by the Department. No doubt the Indian Agent will advise if necessary when the school makes requests for a grant for this work.\n\nIn general I would like to see the Manual Training and any added courses in Motor Engineering or Electricity take a very much more practical turn than is at present the case in the school. Highly finished cabinet work, telegraph poles made partly by machinery, and other work depending on machinery unlikely to be available in an Indian village would appear to me a waste of time. The actual building of a small fishing boat of from 24 feet to 26 feet is a worth while project, as such boats are used in the fishing industry. The Indians of the northern parts of the Province are very anxious that their boys should be taught to repair such boats and their engines.\nOffice of the New Westminster Indian Agency,\n\nOctober 11th, 1935\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 548, amounting to $144.65 in favour of Reverend R.C.

Daunt,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nINDIAN OFFICE\nNEW WESTMINSTER\n\nJan.13/36.\n\nDear Mr Daunt:\n\nEnclosed please find letter re the re-organization of our Motor Mechanics Department, along with list of tools for same. There are two items which may cause comment, namely the paint and the old engines for blocks. I may say that all the expense for lumber used in re-arranging these rooms, for building work benches, desks and seats cupboards etc has been supplied by the School. It has taken a good deal of paint as we had to paint the walls for about six feet up, all around and then the tables, work benches seats etc took a lot. I have really gotten it, and it is most of it used already, but I felt it was fair to ask the Department for a part of the cost of re-arranging. It is going to make the department a lot more efficient, as well as afford room for a Chemistry \"Lab.\", lecture room for Farm work etc etc. The old engines we have at present are useless for any practical purpose and the old car engines we propose to secure will afford the boys a fine chance to actually work with gas engines. The marine motor differs only in weight, and stroke etc etc, the principle is the same for both. I trust that the Department will see its way clear to give us this help, particularly as we are saving around $450.00 for salary of an instructor, as I mentioned before.\n\nAlthough I have no idea that such a thing might occur, yet it is only fair to say, that if Mr Williams were to leave us, we might not be able to get a Manual Training Instructor who could do all the work he is doing, and it might be necessary to ask again for an outside instructor. However, we shall not borrow trouble, for I feel sure that if we had to distribute motor mechanics in a different fashion, I would be able to fall back on Mr Huddleston who is really a genius at working with machinery - in a practical way.\n\nI am really away up the East Coast of the Queen Charlottes en route to Skidegate and Masset. I felt this was the psychological time to see these people. I shall not have the time later on, and they will soon be scattering to their trap line etc. I am sure the trip will work out well for the School. I am not yet prepared to drop this big Northern area for recruiting. It may come to that later, but for the present I feel it would not be right or advantageous either to the Indians or to the School.\n\nWith kind regards, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nDear Mr Daunt:\n\nRegret that I omitted to enclose this sheet with the other part of the letter written today. This illustrates engine parts for use of boys just starting in. All boys will take notes and make drawings, as well as do the practical work. This was not possible under the old arrangement as we had not the room or equipment, desks etc., with room for same.

SCOTT\nPrincipal\nOttawa, July 13, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, enclosing papers written at examinations set for the students taking a course in Motor Mechanics at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School. These papers have been examined with interest. It is considered that a very practical training is being given which will be of great benefit to the boys.\n\nIt is noted that you are writing the Department, through Mr. Agent Daunt, regarding the supplying of a small Deisel engine, for instruction and demonstration purposes. You should state the cost involved in the purchase of this equipment. When the Department receives this information, consideration will be given as to whether the engine can be supplied.\n\nAs requested, I am returning herewith the examination papers and note books. I would request that you express to the boys whose papers you forwarded the Department's appreciation of their work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. R. C. Scott, B. A.,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetza Residential School,\nSardis, B. C.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am submitting herewith examination papers written at examinations set for our Motor Mechanic students last month. They will afford an idea of the instruction which is now being given in this department of Coqualeetza. Even though they are three of the best papers, may say that the average mark obtained was just over the minimum for Second Class Honors. I am anxious to give as practical a training as possible to the pupils of this School, and thought that you would be interested in seeing what is being attempted.\n\nThe practical work is a large part of the training. These boys have taken down engines, cleaned and fitted the heads and gaskets, ground valves, polished and fitted bearings etc., and done such work as would be done by them in repairing or refitting their engines, in connection with their work at home as fishermen.\n\nI am anxious to go one step further, and have a small diesel engine in our department for instruction and demonstration. Several of our older boys are anxious to get training in this type of engine, and if we had one here, we could give a real practical training which would, I fancy, be better for such students than to send them to a Technical School, unless, of course, in the case of students extraordinary, who might be able to take a longer and more technical course. For the average boy, however, it is the practical training that counts. I have run and cared for a 30 H.P. 2 cylinder, full Heisel engine for nearly ten years. I have taken down cylinder heads, ground and fitted valves and sleeves, timed valves and carried on all the work of an engineer on such a machine and feel that I could give adequate oversight, while Mr. Williams, our present instructor could give all the theory. I shall write you through Mr. Indian agent Hunt more fully on this matter.\n\nI would be glad if you would return the enclosed papers and note books as they ought to be retained by the boys concerned.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6442, file 880-11, part 1)\nFine Boat Job\nBy Boys At Coqualeetza\n\nThirty-five Foot Power Boat of Special Design For Local Waters\n\nA very fine job of boat building has just been completed by a dozen boys of Coqualeetza Industrial School, Sardis, under the supervision of Mr. R. Huddleston, formerly of the Seagull Boat Works at New Westminster. The boys are between the ages of 14 and 17, and the work has been done in four months under normal instruction and conditions.\n\nThe boat might be termed a combination runabout and light tow boat, and is 35 feet long with an eight by six beam, and is said to be the largest boat yet constructed in these parts. It will be equipped with a 100-h.p. motor and will have a speed of 16 miles per hour. There is a gas tank capacity of 200 gallons. It has nice lines and is light draught, being designed for lake boat use. Planking is of B.C. red cedar, the gunwales of oak ribs of oak, while half a ton of Australian gum tree wood has been used.\n\nConstruction throughout is standard and the boat is a sturdy, business-like craft. Delivery was made last week by Harold Cartmell for use on the Fraser river and Harrison lake.\n\nThe training given the boys is of practical importance, as all of them come from families engaged in boat-building and fishing at the head and lower ends of Vancouver Island. The workmen's job shop is located in the Progress saw outside the boat-building shop Saturday is a credit to the boys and their instructor. A smart looking rowboat nears its hours of completion, and will probably be used at the school's summer camp on the River this season. Training in this department is such that one boat of the type referred to may two rowboats be completed each year for commercial undertakings but for instruction purposes only.\n\nThe boys at Coqualeetza are not only trained in building sea and water-going craft but also in power plants. Under George Williams, the boys are taught the principles of gas engine construction and repairs. In this way they are on leaving school proficient in building and repairing boats, taking down and raising chimneys and other mechanics associated with the work in home surroundings. Attached to the manual training department has separate a machine shop from the classroom, where navigation and chemistry in addition to motor mechanics are taught.\n\nThe Progress was afforded a peep at the arts and craft department by Captain Scott, where the wool is carded, spun into yarn dyed in colors produced from native materials, the yarn being woven into the Cowichan sweaters, and other articles by the girls of the school.\n\nWith nearly two hundred pupils are assembled, proper means to health are important. In this matter Captain Scott reports that results through the medium of the Preventorium established some time ago have been very gratifying.\nOffice of the New Westminster Indian Agency,\n\nMarch 27th, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 1085, amounting to $371.68 in favour of Reverend F.C.

(RG 10, Volume 6442, file 880-11, part 1)\nOttawa, February 26th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your No. 1-8-B of the 21st instant, you may inform the Principal of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School that the Department will allow a grant of $100.00 a year towards the expenses of the instructor of Indian handicrafts.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B. C.\n\nPP/O'M.\nSIR:\n\nI have received a request from the Reverend R.C. Scott, for a revival of the Grant of $100.00, made by the Department in 1933, (Your File No. 153-0-11, to Doctor Raley, Dec. 24th, 1933.), as a refund of the expenses for an Instructor of Indian Handicrafts, at Coqualeetza Indian Residential School.\n\nMr. Scott is having Miss Aust up every week-end from New Westminster, to do this work. She is an excellent teacher, knows her work, and gets along well with the girls.\n\nShe teaches them to card, spin, and to dye wool, using nearly altogether native dyes, and finally, the knitting of this heavy yarn into \"Cowichan Sweaters\". In addition, she does all sorts of other work, such as the application of Indian designs to blankets, bath robes, pillows, chintz, etc., which, among the North, who may not be so interested in knitting \"Cowichan Sweaters\", are taught the knitting of sweaters, mitts, socks, etc., using the ordinary manufactured wool, which they would have to rely upon in their northern homes.\n\nThis instruction is of as much value to the girls, in their future lives, as Manual Training and Motor Mechanics are to the boys, and if it is at all possible, I would most strongly recommend that the recognition and assistance asked for, be extended to this valuable form of training.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, January 31, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th instant, you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the motor mechanic tools for the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School. It is noted that these will cost approximately $194.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nSIR:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter from the Reverend Mr. Scott, Principal of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, supporting an application for Motor Mechanic Tools etc., to the amount of approximately $194.00.\n\nUntil now the Department have refunded the School at the approximate rate of $450.00 per year for this tuition service, and it is now proposed to replace this service by a Member of the School Staff. The saving in fees, therefore, will more than offset the cost of the tools asked for, and which will, of course, be necessary, as the late Instructor largely depended on his own outfit for the instruction given.\n\nMr. Scott's letter is explanatory and I would recommend that authority be given to make the purchases specified.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nENCLS.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nDear Mr Daunt:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a list of tools which we would like if the Department would be good enough to give us, for our Motor Mechanics classes. I would like to point out that we would have had to ask for these tools in any case, even had we carried on as we did last year, but with the re-organization which we have effected, we have saved the Department an expenditure of $45.00 per month, which, extended for the ten months of the School year, totals the sum of $450.00. Looked at from this angle, the expenditure for tools is fairly a moderate one. As I have just stated, even had we carried on as last year, with an outside instructor, we would have had to ask for these tools so that the boys might have had the opportunity of actually doing work themselves.\n\nI might say that I found the former arrangement not just satisfactory. While Mr Edwards is one of the best mechanics in British Columbia, still he is a very busy man in his own Garage, and I found that the senior boys were loth to join up with his classes and the younger ones were withdrawing, because they said they did not get anything new; they had covered the work in the first year or so. There was no definite curriculum, and again, much of the work Mr Edwards did himself, while the boys looked on. Of course, he was handicapped for the want of tools, and a different arrangement would have had to be made in this connection even had he stayed.\n\nUnder the new plan, the instruction will be given by Mr Williams our Manual Training Instructor, and I feel sure he can do the work. He is practical, and at the same time has had the training in teaching. Added to that he has worked out a curriculum based on that of the Vancouver Technical School. Pulla will follow that course, and will write examinations to those of the Vancouver Technical School, and will be able to get credit for such work if they wish to continue. This is a gain I think. It will give the exceptional student a chance to go on if he wishes, and it will give the entire class the benefit of following a definite line of instruction. Every boy will take machine drawing and theory, and will actually do repair work, such as making and fitting gas-kets, valve grinding, bearing fitting etc., in a simple series of exercises covering both the two and the four stroke engines.\n\nA sample page of the course is enclosed, the ten units covering approximately ten weeks.\n\nAs I have said, tools are necessary if the instruction is to be practical and of the best value, hence our request as enclosed. We propose too, to use our assistant manual training instructor, who is a thoroughgoing boat builder, to instruct the boys in actual installation of engines in boats. An engine bed will be set up, and an actual installation made in the work room. We also plan to adapt truck engines from automobiles for use in fishing boats. This is actually being done by fishermen up the coast and is thoroughly practical and makes it possible for boys who might not have an outfit for years, to acquire one. Engine costs are prohibitive for the average boy. A truck engine can be secured for a \"song\", and can be adapted for boat use. This will be another distinct gain, we feel.\n\nIn asking for automobile engines, I might point out that this is done in all automotive instruction schools. The system is the same as that of the marine engine, and it is feasible to get old\nCCQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nA.O'N.D.\n\n(2)\n\nCars engines at the ridiculously low figure suggested, which will be quite good as \"blocks\" for instruction purposes, and it may be we shall be able to get engines which we may be able to adapt for use by some of these boys. Some day, we shall build and equip a boat with such an engine, as one of our boat building projects. In keeping with this programme, I have charged the quarters of the boat building class to one of the other buildings not at present in use, which will give more room. It also gives the room formerly used as a boat shop, to be used as a \"school room\" for Motor Mechanics. The boys under Mr. Williams have done all the work. Formerly only one room was used, and benches were carried in and out each time the class was called. They were old and unsightly, and the temporary character they given to the class, did not help to make the boys feel they were actually at school.\n\nNew tables have been made, and new benches built, the walls of the room and the equipment just mentioned have been painted, and as a result we have a class room for Motor Mechanics where the boys can sit down comfortably and do their theory and get instruction along theoretical lines. The room formerly used for both, will now be used only for practical bench work.\n\nI may say in closing, that this class room will also be used for a \"Lab\" for the chemistry work in our Grades Nine and Ten, and will fill a much needed part of our equipment as we are to continue to do High School work. This undertaking by CCQualeetza, by the way has also saved the Department a big item for fees. Last year fees amounted to just over $600.00. However, it will be only about one fifth of that amount. The room will also be used for my Navigation classes. I had formerly to use the Assembly Hall, without tables or black board. Cupboards are provided in this new room, for each of these classes.\n\nThe lumber used in this new set-up has been secured out of School funds, we are asking only for the paint. I trust that the Department may see its way clear to grant us the request for tools, and for old engines for engine blocks. If our classes are to be practical we must have these \"blocks\". The ones now in the room are practically worthless, and cost much more than the ones we now propose to secure.\n\nIn deep appreciation of the aid the Department has given to the School and assuring you that we desire to be as helpful as possible in this mutual task on behalf of the Indian people, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL.\n\nP.S. Samples are enclosed of the first year course as proposed herein, and a sample drawing to be done by the boys, also list of tools asked for. I should have said so, that through our Manual training instructor, we have secured the loan for the next two months, of a marine gas engine, such as is used by most fishermen up the coast. It will be in operation \"put down\" to demonstrate working of each part. Power is secured through a small electric motor.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Scott, Principal, Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, SARDIS, B.C.\n\nfor Expenditures in connection with Manual Training at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, for the quarter ended June 30th, 1936.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Sub-Allotment No. 520.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 518\nOttawa, December 10, 1936.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department is very much interested in your letter of the 4th instant outlining the instruction being given in the motor mechanics department at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School.\n\nYou may purchase a Model A Ford engine, complete, at a cost of approximately $50. Payment of this engine will be made on receipt from you of a properly certified voucher in triplicate.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. R. C. Scott, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetza Residential School,\nSardis, B.C.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nDecember 4, 1936\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith several pages descriptive of the work being given in our Motor Mechanics department. I hope it will be of interest, and give you some idea of the extent of the course, both in theory and practice, which we are giving out boys. The accompanying data will give some idea of the course in Motor Mechanics for Part I. The outline of the theory and a copy of the lesson, Unit No.7 together with all drawings for that lesson, are attached. An outline of job and assignment sheets, together with a copy of Job No.1 are also attached.\n\nOur present equipment includes several old car engine blocks which we use for instruction in repair work. We have not a complete engine suitable for overhauling, consequently I would like permission to purchase a Model A Ford engine complete at a cost of about $50. This would give us equipment to cover the complete job and assignment work for Part I. It is essential that a working model be obtained for this class. For instance, it is not enough that the boy merely grinds the valves in an engine. He should also complete all jobs leading up to that, such as removing head wires, valve plate covering, as well as the actual process of valve grinding. After re-assembling, the boy should start up the motor and make all necessary adjustments such as tuning it up, timing, starting and operation. A boy, for instance, might renew a gasket on a non-working motor and not realize that he might have covered some inlet or outlet in the water circulatory system. He might grind valves, but he would have not certain knowledge whether he had made a good job unless it could be tried out on a regular working model. Both of these necessary items in his training would be provided if we had a motor such as that for which I am asking. Again, we have not a motor which has a complete...\nThe Secretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDec. 4, 1936\n\nIgnition or wiring circuit, and this engine would cover this need also. Transmission, clutches, drive systems, universal joints, all ought to be studied and could be accomplished with the Model A Ford engine. A study of the accompanying sheets would show the work we have in mind. As the Department could not see its way clear to supply an actual diesel working model, it would suffice for the time being if we had a working model such as described above.\n\nI appreciate very much the assistance the Department has given to our attempts to make the training of our pupils as practical as possible, and if it were possible to secure the above mentioned equipment, we would have practically all that would be necessary to cover an effective course.\n\nHoping for a favorable reply, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.C.

There are usually two valves to a cylinder, one inlet and the other exhaust. The various designs of heads are called by letters, which resemble the shape of the valve heads and the centre line of the cylinders.\n\nPoppet Valves\n\nAll valves shown are of the poppet type; that is the valves pop or work up and down, being opened by the camshaft and closed by a spring. The stem acts as the guiding part of the valve while the head prevents the gases leaking.\n\n\"L\" Head\n\nAn \"L\" head or side valve engine arrangement as shown, the valves are side by side and placed to one side of the cylinder. The stems project downward so that they can be worked off the camshaft with a short push rod or tappet. This is a very popular design because of simple construction and quiet operating.\n\n\"T\" Head\n\nThis has a valve on each side of the cylinder, one the exhaust and the other the inlet. Two camshafts are used, one working the inlet valves, the other the exhaust.\n\n\"I\" Head\n\nThe \"I\" head or overhead valve engine has the valves arranged directly above the cylinders. The valves are inverted or upside down and are worked by push rods and rockers from the camshaft. The valves are placed in a line parallel to the centre line of the engine; the advantage claimed is better scavenging of the cylinder. Sometimes the valves are worked directly from a camshaft placed on top of the cylinder head in which case the engine is known as an overhead camshaft engine.\n\n\"F\" Head\n\nA combination of overhead and side valve is used in this type. The inlet valve is overhead, while the exhaust is in the side. The side is operated by a tappet or push rod and the overhead by a push rod and rocker.\n\nSide Valve\n\nA section of a side valve is shown in place in the cylinder block. The valve head fits in a seat, the angle being 45\u00b0 though 30\u00b0 seats are occasionally used. The valve head and seat are made gastight by grinding the valve so that it fits closely to the seat. The combustion chamber is completely sealed when the valves are closed. If the gases leak when the valves are closed, the valves require grinding. The valve stems move in the guide,\nwhich is removable and is made of cast iron. The valve port or opening conveys the gas to or from the valve.\n\n**Overhead Valve**\n\nThe overhead valve is shown in the section drawing. The cylinder head in this case forms the valve seat, and on removing the head the valves and assembly come away with the head, so that regrinding and cleaning are very conveniently done.\n\n**Side Valve Assembly**\n\nThe valve assembly is shown. The camshaft raises the valve, the motion being transmitted to the valve stem through the tappet. The valve is closed by the spring which is of sufficient strength to prevent the gases leaking when closed. The seat is formed in the block, access to the valves being gained by removal of the cylinder head. The spring acts on the valve through the retaining cup which is locked to the valve stem by split taper collars, or rectangular or round pins. The guide clearance on the stem is .003\" which is necessary to prevent sticking of valves.\n\n**Tappet**\n\nThe tappet and adjustment are casehardened and may be shaped in a variety of ways where it works against the camshaft. The common designs are shown, a disc tappet and a roller tappet.\n\n**Valve Clearance**\n\nIs the space between the end of the valve when closed and the tappet adjustment when the tappet is on the wounded portion of the cam. This adjustment is very important and is made when the engine is hot. The clearance differs with engines from .004\"-.006\" When adjusting it is good practice to set one cylinder at a time, leave one valve open when of course the other is fully shut and can be adjusted. The engine is then turned until the valve adjusted is open and the other one set.\n\n**Overhead Valve Assembly**\n\nThe motion is taken from the non-adjustable tappet by the pushrod to the rocker. The rocker is pivoted above the cylinder head to give a downward motion of the valve when the push rod moves up. The valve retainer shown is of the horseshoe type. The wearing points are hardened and lubricated by oil pumped from the interior of the engine.\n\n**Clearance**\n\nThe clearance is checked where the rocker meets the valve stem. It is adjusted by the screw and locknut on the end of the rocker arm. Clearance runs from .006\"- .002\".\nValve Heads\n\nThere are two types of valves, mushroom valve and tulip-head valve. The mushroom head valve has a domed head of cast iron fitted on a stem of steel. The tulip head is concave for lightness and is made in one piece from tungsten, silicon-chromium, cobalt-chromium or other heat resisting steel. A valve made of special steel has a high strength even at bright red temperatures.\n\nValve Seats\n\nMost of the modern engines have valve seats of hardened steel or hardened bronze for the exhaust valves. These are either pressed or screwed into place in the form of rings, one for each valve. These special seats resist the action of the burning gases better than the seats formed in the metal of the block, thus cutting down the necessity of grinding valves so often. Shrinking the seats into place is the most popular method of fitting. The rings are placed in liquid air which has a temperature of -190\u00b0C. This contracts the rings so that they can easily be driven into the recesses; then as the rings heat up to atmospheric temperature the recesses are gripped tightly.\nI visited and went over the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School. I met Captain Scott this time though I had missed him before. At the time of my visit there were 223 children in the school. (I think this must be 123, but I have 223 in my notebook). I did not see the children in any of the classes as it was Founders' Day and they were all having a holiday.\n\nI also went over the Preventorium which is nearly completed, and which is filling a long felt want.\n\nThe Principal mentioned several things required at the school. For instance, they are going in for boot making in the same way as the Mission School has done. This, of course, includes repairs. He states that they require a stitching machine which costs $103.00. Further, in the Manual Training class they are concentrating upon boat building, and instruction in marine engineering and navigation. All of this is useful to the Inuit boys at the school who will have to earn their living by fishing. They badly want an old Deisel engine for instructional purposes. They have an old gasoline one, but a Deisel is required. I should suggest that the Deisel engine out of the Naskeena be given to the school for instructional purpose and a new Deisel put in the Naskeena of the Skeena River Agency. As you know, I am expecting this engine in the Naskeena to give out in time the same as the one in the Duncan Scott, and with the constant repairs I believe it would be a saving to remove this engine before a serious breakdown occurs.\n\nThe Principal also informs me that some fencing is required. He showed me the fence which certainly does require renewal and re-erection. This will cost $60.00, and I recommend that this be done.\n\nFurther, the roofing of the school is badly in need of repair in various places, and an estimate should be obtained of what is required in this way.\n\nI found everything else at this school clean and tidy and in every way satisfactory. The children looked happy and healthy.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Geo. S.

This has at times been included in the Manual Training Vouchers, and at times has been sent in direct as in this instance. The Department has been good enough to allow those formerly sent in, and I trust that those now enclosed may be given favorable consideration.\n\nThe water pump from the Simplex Company was to give us another working unit for demonstration in class room work, and ultimately we hope to adapt this particular Motor for marine work. Thus the boat building class will have some chance to do such work. The repairs were all for Motor Mechanics equipment and do not include those for ordinary School purposes.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL.\n\nP.S. The account for the Water Pump was not received until last week, and was not paid until that date. Otherwise it would have gone into the March Quarter.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO:** Reverend R.C.

B. Ashbridge, Indian Agent for the West Coast Agency:\n\n\"Due to existing conditions on the Coast making it imperative that Indians seek other than their natural source of livelihood, it is respectfully recommended that manual training and domestic science be conducted on more practical lines. At present the girls are taught fancy sewing and are employed in kitchens, both admirable in their way, but they should be taught how to make fishing nets and the operation of canning machinery, also how to wash without the aid of electric washing machines, and the baking of bread without electric bakeries. They should also be taught simple home nursing, hygiene, and kindred subjects.\n\n\"Boys should be taught practical boat building and operation of marine engines. These Indians are natural mechanics and could very easily be taught under a competent instructor. Every year these Indians lose hundreds of dollars owing to shipping furs not properly prepared, and this art could be taught to advantage.\"\n\nAs you have a number of Indians from the Coast in your school I am bringing Mr. Ashbridge's suggestions to your attention. I expect that you will give these your careful consideration as their adoption would result in the pupils receiving the practical training that they require.\n\nRev. H. C. Scott,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetza Residential School,\nSardis, B. C.\nIt will not be possible for the Department to continue indefinitely paying per capita grant unless we receive definite assurance that the curriculum has been arranged in a manner that will ensure the pupils being taught those subjects which will best fit them for their after-school life.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.

Bailey,\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nMay 14, 1938\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have your letter of May 2nd in which there are quotations from the report of Mr. P.B. Ashbridge, Indian Agent for the West Coast, with regard to Manual Training, etc., for Indian children.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we are endeavouring to bring Coqualeetza School more and more in line with the wishes of the Department, and I fancy we are having fairly good success at present. We still lack of assistance to the graduates of this School in later life. Some fancy sewing is of course taught the girls, but we are laying more and more stress on making their own clothes. The carding, spinning of wool in preparation for knitting and weaving articles of clothing is taught. They are taught to use native dyes from hemlock bark, alder bark and onion skin, etc. We have what we call a Home Economics Kitchen a separate unit from the main Student Kitchen. Here the girls are taught to plan, prepare and serve a meal similar to one that would be served in the ordinary home. I may say that all our girls use the wash tub. We have no electric washing machines or electric laundries. We also have a Home Nursing class which is under the care of our School Nurse, who is a graduate Registered Nurse. Here the girls are taught Home Nursing, Hygiene, etc. In addition, our Senior girls are detailed to the Preventorium where they learn to take care of the dishes of sick persons. These are washed separately. We use different colored dish pans, different colored dish cloths, and in every way try to impress upon them the need for keeping such dishes separate. The girls also get training in the taking of temperatures and the preparing of meals for the sick, although we do not of course allow them to do any nursing where they would come into close contact with tubercular cases.\n\nOur boys are getting a very fine training in Boat Building. We built two 35 foot boats last year, and we are completing a second one this year, 33 feet in length. I am enclosing a copy of the specifications and materials used for this boat. This is a boat similar to the ones used on the inside waters. Next year, all being well, we may build a 38 footer, which will be of heavier construction suitable for the off-shore fishing in which our Queen Charlotte Island Indians engage. I am thoroughly conversant with both these types of boats. For fifteen years I was on the Coast in inland waters in Mission work; and for four years I was stationed at Queen Charlotte in the Marine Mission Work. I have just returned from a trip to the Islands and other points up the Coast in the endeavour to bring the School into closer touch with the people, to keep\nin touch with graduates and in every way help to make the influence of the School more effectual and permanent. While in Skidegate, I saw Vernon and Clifford Jones rebuilding an old hull. Both these boys had been trained in our Boat Building Shop. They secured this 36 foot hull which had been in disuse for a good while, put in a new keel, some new timbers, raised the deck combings, laid on some new planking and recaulked the whole hull. They were also getting a new forefoot on her, and had secured an engine which they were installing without any other assistance than that of their father. The father was greatly delighted, and thanked me for the help we had given these boys. It just means that they will have become independent. It was very encouraging to me, and I would like to thank the Department sincerely for the assistance which they have given us in making this training possible.\n\nOur Manual Training classes are this year being conducted on much more practical lines. It will likely result in a somewhat less spectacular exhibit, but I am quite sure that the boys will have gained greatly in knowledge that will be of practical use. Over a year ago I thought of the making and repairing of Fish Nets, and I had a young Cape Mudge fisherman under promise to come and give the boys training along that line. He was also going to show them how to rig up trolling outfits and give them some idea of how to use such gear at different depths and at different seasons of the year. However, he failed me, but I have it in mind for another year. I have myself conducted Junior and Senior class in Navigation and Seamanship throughout the year. I have several senior boys going out this summer who own Seine boats, and I am quite sure the knowledge they have gained will be of great use. They are taught \"The Rule of the Road at Sea\", Compass and Chart work, some knowledge of the buoyage system, the laying of courses, and practical suggestions in seamanship are given. The Department of Marine is tightening regulations all the time, and these young men will need not only to have local knowledge in the future, but knowledge such as I have indicated above which will make it safe for them to take their vessels into strange Coast waters. The traffic in such waters is increasing all the time.\n\nI trust that you will see from this that we are endeavouring to cooperate with the Department in every way to give the pupils a training which will best suit them for after school life. I would say that about 75% of the pupils of this School make their living from the sea or from Coast industries. I trust that you will be reassured, and feel that the grants paid by the Department to this School are being expended to the best of our ability to produce results in harmony with the aims of yourself and other officers in charge.\n\nAt the same time, if there should be any criticism of the size of boats built at Coqualeetza, I trust that my twenty years experience and my practical knowledge of what is needed, together with the fact that we have a thoroughly capable Boat Builder in charge, will be given due consideration. When we first began, there was a disposition on Inspector Barry's part to want us to build a 24 or 25 foot boat for fishing purposes. A boat this size would be simply worse than useless in the areas from which most of our pupils come. It might do on the Fraser River, but in Northern waters it would be hopeless. I should have said that we build from two to four Row Boats each year, using both the Carvel and Clinker built types. The entire programme of Boat Building however, is kept upon an instruction basis and not a production one.\nMR. R.A. Hoey.\n\nMay 14, 1938\n\nI refused an order for twelve Row Boats last Fall after one gentleman had seen the Row Boat we exhibited at the Vancouver Exhibition.\n\nAgain let me say how greatly & appreciate the assistance of the Department in the entire programme. It is very gratifying to me, and I shall always be glad to receive suggestions that will be helpful and make for progress. The letter of Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge is quite timely.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.C. Scott\nPRINCIPAL\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nAugust 24th, 1938.\n\nDear Mr Hoey:\n\nFor some time now, I have been thinking of writing you with regard to some assistance to one of our Graduates, Joseph Edgar of Clo'oose, on the West Coast of Vancouver Island. This lad was a member of our last Building Class for the last more than two years. Last Fall, Mr Huddleston, our Boat Builder, thought it would be a good thing for each of his six boys to make a Model of a fishing boat; then I was to act as judge, and the best Model would be used as a pattern for a boat.\n\nEach boy made a Model, and then I examined each one. There was not very much difference between most of them, but the one made by Joseph I chose because the lines were a bit better than those of any of the others. Of course I did not know who had made it. Mr Huddleston concurred in my judgement, but suggested one or two minor changes that would be an improvement.\n\nWell, that was the boat which you saw when you made your visit last June.\n\nI have had a letter from Joseph and one from his father, and they are both very anxious to have this boat. The father says, \"in order to give my two boys a chance to make a few dollars\", I know they need a new boat, and the fishing grounds they frequent\u2014right out on the open pacific\u2014demand the best. I have been holding the boat at Four Hundred Dollars, as this would only give us the cost of materials, and allow a balance for replacement of tools and equipment etc. The Department gave us the money to get materials for our first boat, and then we sell, and re-imburse the School, and get more materials. This we must do in this case.\n\nJoseph offers Two Hundred Dollars down, and the balance next year. It is a big order for him, and I have wondered if it would not be possible for the Department to make him a grant of One Hundred Dollars toward this boat. It is not more expensive than they do for Graduates in other parts, and it would certainly be a great inspiration to many others, for I would like to see other boys build their own boats. As I have said, this lad designed this boat, and worked on it right from start to finish, and I know it would do a lot to create a right sort of pride\u2014that of craftsmanship\u2014if it were made possible for him to secure it for his very own.\n\nI trust that you will give this request your earnest consideration, and if at all possible make a grant to this lad which will enable him to get this boat. I am quite sure that four hundred dollars is a big order for him. One the other hand we can easily sell the boat for Four Hundred as it is a fine seaworthy craft, but the more I think of it, the more I feel that a Hundred dollars invested in this lad would bring dividends in character and accomplishment in the years to come.\n\nThanking you for your interest and help at all times, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRCS/\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of September 3rd, File:153-0-11, advising us of an arrangement whereby we may purchase Boat Building materials at a cost not to exceed $100.00 in connection with sale of our last year's fishing boat to Joseph Edgar of Clooos, on the West Coast of Vancouver Island.\n\nI beg to say that this boy and his father called at the School this week and put down the $200.00 in cash and they will take the boat away as soon as arrangements can be made.\n\nI appreciate very much the consideration the Department has shown in this matter, and I am quite sure that Joseph and his cousin, Martin, will be materially assisted in their work as fishermen by acquiring this new boat. Both of these boys were in our Boat Building Class last year.\n\nAgain thanking you I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.C. Scott\nPRINCIPAL\nOttawa,\nSeptember 3, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo with reference to the boat that was built by the boat building class of the Coqualeetza Residential School last year.\n\nI note that you are prepared to sell this boat to ex-pupil Joseph Edgar for $400.00 -- $200 of this amount to be paid this year and the balance next year. I have further noted that you suggest that the Department make a grant of $100.00 to Joseph Edgar to assist him in meeting this year's $200.00 payment.\n\nVery careful consideration has been given to your suggestion but present regulations would not permit our making a grant in the manner that you recommend.\n\nHowever, the Department would be prepared to purchase materials for the boat building class at a cost not exceeding $100.00. This amount would be over and above any other purchases that we might be making for the Coqualeetza School. In this event you would accept $100.00 from Edgar this year and in addition would receive materials costing $100.00 from the Department. By handling the matter in this way we will not subject ourselves to any criticism from the Auditing Branch. You should, therefore, purchase material for the boat building class at a cost of $100.00 and forward certified accounts in triplicate.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. R. C.

Now however, we have been fortunate enough to secure once more, the services of Mr. R. Huddleston, and we are all ready to begin work on a new boat. Part of the materials to be used will be those listed.\n\nConsequently, it would appear that the invoice is in order, and I would be glad if you would forward it to the Department at your convenience.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.C.

Scott, Principal of Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, in connection with Boat Building at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Reverend Principal quotes Departmental authority dated September 3rd, 1938, File No.153-0-11, on the account, and from the covering letter, which I attach for your information, he apparently has had a direct understanding with the Department. I am accordingly passing the voucher for your consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\n\nFebruary 7, 1939\n\nMr. Huddleston has done, on the occasion of your visit last Spring.\n\nI presume that the request for assistance to provide materials for the reconstruction of two cottages, has reached you through Mr. Indian Agent Daunt, and I trust that it may receive favorable consideration.\n\nThe problem of accommodation for married help at Coqualeetza, has always been a pressing one. I pointed out to the Department, shortly after I came, that it seemed impossible to keep efficient help unless this were done. I have tried all the while Mr. Huddleston was away to secure another Bolt Building Instructor, but had failed to locate one whom I thought satisfactory. The applicants were all either too old, or too inexperienced, as something had to be done, I secured the materials to reconstruct a cottage for Mr. Huddleston and one for Mr. Carter our Farm Instructor. The work has been done entirely under the supervision of our Manual Training Staff, by the Senior boys, and it has proved valuable experience. My knowledge of Indian villages, leads me to feel that the one thing necessary is rehabilitation of old houses, and these boys certainly should have caught the vision of what can be done with an old building. The above two cottages have been unoccupied practically ever since I came. We now have two comfortable homes, which I hope will prove an essential factor in maintaining an efficient staff in these two departments.\n\nWhile the expenditure will run over the $200.00 asked for, still if the Department is good enough to advance us that amount, it will relieve the school of some hardship. I am sure I have your full support in trying to increase the practical side of our instruction, and hope that you will be able to sympathize with me in the situation in which I was placed.\n\nThanking you for your enquiry, and hoping that this letter will give you all the information required,\n\nI am, Yours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL\n\nACB/HW\nCoqualeetza Residential School\nUnited Church of Canada\n\nPrincipal\nREV. R.C. SCOTT, B.A.\n\nSardis, B.C. February 7, 1939\n\nMr. H.A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have your letter of January 26th, 1939, file:153-0-11, enquiring as to the qualifications of Mr. R.C. Smith, now engaged as Manual Training Instructor.\n\nMr. E.W. Lythgoe resigned at the end of last school year, as he preferred teaching in the White schools. I then wrote to Mr. F.G. Baird, Director of Technical Education for the Province, who submitted several names, among which was that of Mr. Smith, who with one other received his special recommendation.\n\nI chose Mr. Smith, and have been well satisfied with his work. He has taken the course for Manual Training Instructors in the Vancouver Technical School. He has for a time, assisted to Mr. Parker, the Principal, in machine work. He is qualified to teach all woodwork subjects, and has had special instruction on hand work and machine work. In addition he has had complete Commercial education of four years, besides three years carpentry experience.\n\nHe is twenty-six years of age. I may say that in addition to his work as Manual Training Instructor, Mr. Smith has fitted in to the life of the school very well, and has undertaken his share of house duties on the Boys' Side with entire satisfaction. I am only hoping we shall be able to keep him for a few years, as I am sure, starting as he has now, with so many in the Junior classes, he will have a fine group of students by the time they reach the Senior grades.\n\nRegarding Mr. Huddleston, Assistant Manual Training Instructor, you have perhaps noted that there were no vouchers for him at $40.00 a month, included in our Manual Training Account. That was because we were unfortunate enough to lose his services until December 31st. He is an excellent workman, and I was always afraid we would not be able to hold him. He married about two years ago, and when what seemed like an excellent opportunity opened with the Boeing Company of Vancouver, I could not blame him when he accepted it. However, as you perhaps know, that Company was engaged in a process of re-organization with a view to undertaking extensive aeroplane manufacture. As a result, the employment of Mr. Huddleston was held up so long that it seemed quite problematical as to whether the Company would re-open their Boat Building at all or not. Consequently he wrote to me towards the end of December and offered to return to the school if we could find him house accommodation, and arrange a mutually satisfactory schedule of house duties. As you may imagine, we were most glad to have Mr. Huddleston return, and are laying the keel for a new boat, which will be built by the Senior boys this term. I am sure that this will prove satisfactory to you, as well as to myself, having seen something of the work.\nOttawa, March 16th, 1939.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Bailey,\n\nI enclose voucher amounting to $160.16 covering the cost of materials purchased by Mr. Indian Commissioner MacKay for manual training work at the Coqualeetza Residential School.\n\nThis expenditure should be charged to B.C. Special Appropriation. It would be appreciated if you would issue Purchase Order so that the account may be paid.\n\nR. A.
