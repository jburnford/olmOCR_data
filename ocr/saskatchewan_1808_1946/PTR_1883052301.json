Even the emigrants from Europe are beginning to arrive. It is certain that next year will be greater than that of any previous year. Mr. George Stephen, President of the C. P. R., has already made arrangements to arrange for the transport of 30,000 persons across the plains in the next few years. A large number will also receive homesteads under the new laws, and societies which assist emigrants from Ireland, Germany, and other countries have been formed. Many of these will be able to find employment on the railway or elsewhere; others will be able to purchase land and then establish homes for themselves and families. The Government is doing all it can to encourage settlement in the North West, and has even offered prizes to the first settlers who will locate there. The Government is also working hard to improve transportation facilities, and has already constructed many miles of railway. The future looks bright for those who wish to settle in the North West.\n\nPRINCE ALBERT\n\nPlanning Mills and Saw and Door Factory\n\nCORN, SOYBEAN AND MACAAT SEEDS\n\nSaw, Doors, Window Blinds, Moldings and all building materials.\n\nBODFELLOW BROS. & PROP.\n\nSTAPLE & FANCY DRY GOODS\n\nWAREHOUSING\n\nAT\n\nFORT QU'APPHELLE.\n\nAll the Latest Novelties.\n\nBOOTS & SHOES\n\nOur Stock in this line is very complete, and prices will be found very low.\n\nMens' Shoes from $125.\n\nLadies' Newport Tie Shoe $150.\n\nClothing,\n\nA choice assortment of Ready Made Clothing.\n\nMens' Fancy Shirts in great variety.\n\nHATS,\n\nFelt Hats in all styles.\n\nGrocer,\n\nWe show the largest stock of Groceries and Canned Goods ever imported.\n\nMISS MACK & CO.,\n\nCampbell's Block, Prince Albert, N.W.T.\n\nW.

The loss is estimated at $40,000.\n\nIt is understood that the question for the acquisition of the Grand Trunk and Canadian Pacific Railway is in contemplation, and that the line will be controlled by the Ontario and Quebec Railway.\n\nThe Sultan of Turkey has invited Baron Von Goltz, the German minister at Constantinople, to visit Turkey and assist in the reorganisation of the military administration. It is expected that this will permit the Baron to accept the invitation.\n\nJohn and Theo. Humphreys have been appointed agents for the Stewart-Carter, Canada, lumber company, who, when they struck over the head with a loaded gun, killed Mr. Humphreys. Evidence shows that the assault was the result of a complaint.\n\nThere arrived in town during the month of March 5,608 immigrants, and during April 3,908, making a total of 9,516, against 20,191 in 1882. There were 17,616 immigrants arriving in the first three months of this year, against 11,660 immigrants, against 34,914 in 1882.\n\nSpecialists have been engaged for the first time in Nova Scotia a battery on an extensive scale for the protection of the coast.\n\nOn the public lists or a paper has been issued for giving Public Notice that the Minister of Finance, relying upon some part of the report of the Board of Trade for the coming Exposition at Paris, has ordered the printing of a number of batteries for any purpose.\n\nIt is understood that the government intends to publish a circular publication at Winnipeg, early in May, some of the contents of which will relate to the North-West, such as the enumeration of the population, the extent of settlement, lying between the Canadian Pacific and the Canadian Northern lines, and along and adjoining the main line of the Canadian Pacific railway. Some of the contents of the circular will also be addressed to the Indians.\n\nThe fact that Canada will not need, for some years to come, more than a dollar of a loan, except to replace one or two cents, by 4 per cent., selecting a dollar of a loan, except to replace the strike the public mind with great force. There will be no demand for loans, each time with disastrous results. The Canadian market was a swing in the London markets. He was now convinced that the Canadian market would be able to maintain itself and develop itself without the aid of the Canadian Government.\n\nThe change I introduced in the House of Commons this Session has received the support of the majority of members, and against it was too strong. The Epoch Times has been very kind in publishing a statement which included with some details of the proceedings in the House, a probability degree of success of the measure.\n\nThe Grizzly Bear is a club, voted against the bill, and the majority of members have a chance of enlisting the Government in their cause. The measure, which, though technically private, had been introduced by the Government. The majority by which the first reading of the bill was carried was small but sufficient, and the measure, if passed, would provide over traditional procedures, and would give the Government a chance in a new field of legislation, and would be decidedly better from every point of view. If the measure had been introduced, there have been an end to much useless agitation, and to the meetings, speeches, and disturbing exhibitions. A measure of this nature is essential\u2014and it is not all that is needed\u2014but it is not enough to cause a feeling of resentment, which would have been felt by the people and the Legislatures, would have been too strong for the Government.\n\nEncouraging the work of the Town camp, G. & G.
