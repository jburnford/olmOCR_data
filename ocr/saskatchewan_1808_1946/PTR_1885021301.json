The Standard maintains that the life of the average period of such extreme cold. It asserts that persons having affections of the lungs or heart court sudden death in emigrating here.\n\nIn the first place, the Manitoba Press says that the meteorological readings quoted by the Standard are false. The St. John's College observatory, Winnipeg, is provided with as reliable instruments as are obtainable, and 40 below zero is the lowest temperature recorded by them during the last winter. This is about as low as it has fallen for many years. We are not in a position to affirm or deny explicitly with regard to Regina, but we have every reason to believe that the temperature in that town and its vicinity never falls materially below that of Winnipeg and vicinity. On an average it is probably higher.\n\nIn the second place, anyone who has lived for a length of time in the North West will tell the Standard that the climate far from being fraught with danger to the lives of the inhabitants, is noted for its healthful qualities. It is extremely difficult, if not impossible to find anywhere a more robust population than ours. We believe there is not a more healthy country in the world than the Canadian West. Whatever advantages might lie against our climate, they are more than counterbalanced by the fact that the people, will unanimously contradict it. Pulmonary diseases are almost unknown in the country except among those who come from other places seeking relief. When these troubles are not too far advanced, they are easily cured by them. Beyond a certain stage, however, consumption and kindred diseases seem to run their courses more rapidly here than in a less bracing atmosphere.\n\nThus far, so far, have settled in the North West have been particularly free from the affections of the heart, or the Standard's story must be at fault. We have yet to meet the immigrant organ in question have any such experience to offer as a protest against our climate. Perhaps, however, the Standard refers only to female immigrants. Many of them have succumbed to the \"affections of the heart\" within a short time after their arrival, but they always recover in the end.\n\nThe Mail in the course of a well considered reply to the Standard's article, points out that it is not decided that North West winters are severe. It contends that the Government pamphlet which dominates such misleading publications as that certain portions of this country and certain portions of England and France are in the same latitude, leaving no room to infer that the climatic conditions are similar. These the Mail demonstrates as clumsy frauds which deceive no one, while creating distrust in all official representations concerning Canada. The Standard's contrary justification that the extremes recorded of the cold in this country are often grossly exaggerated.\n\nIt says\u2014\n\n\"The lowest corrected mean temperature recorded by the Greely party, which reached the utmost north in Arctic exploration, was 61 below. Accurate registration of cold is not attempted anywhere in the world. The thermometer at the observatory at St. John's College, Winnipeg, and the lowest readings have certainly not recorded this winter. Mercer freezes at 40 below, and measurements are then taken by standard thermometers. The results of these must always be received with caution, the difference which instruments exhibit at a temperature below the freezing point of mercury being so wide as to require a large number of experiments in order to determine what is technically termed their proper correction. Dr. Kane, in vol. ii., page 405, of his explorations, points out that in his experience at 40 below, the thermometer which had given a correct temperature as low as 42 to show at -60 differences from fifteen to twenty degrees. He gives an instance of this. On February 5, 1854, he took the thermometer at midnight and temperature above, as he had agreed within 18, and which had been selected as the most consistent of nearly 35 spirit instruments, and found this extraordinary variation in their readings between 42 and 54, 53, 50, and -52. Had this happened in Manitoba, the patriotic Americans who dish up false news concerning Canada for the purpose of deterring would in all probability have assumed our lowest record to have been the correct one.\n\nAs regards the danger to life from cold in the North West, the Mail holds that the experience of settlers does not agree with the Standard's statement. Persons in states of weak constitution cannot, under normal conditions, endure extremes either of heat or cold, but those in good health enjoy winter in the North-West, where the men who have perished on the plains are quoted from time to time, but is a reference to quest could be held in each case, the Mail thinks it would be found that whiskey is invariably an important contributory cause of death. Under the cold plains the drunken hunter forces his victim into a sleep from which he never awakens. A clear case of death from cold per se the Mail affirms has not occurred in the history of the North-West. Our contemporary concludes as fol-\n\n\"The North West is not the best place in the world for the weak and pamy immigrant. He had better remain in England. But to every immigrant endowed with good health and a disposition to work it offers an unalloyed but even unparalleled advantages, but a fair and reasonable prospect of reward.\"\n\nProvided, let us add, that he is possessed of the means of establishing himself on a farm. At the present time, to do so was a wholly impracticable undertaking of any other description.\n\nHeating Pipes\u2014Suppression and care.\n\nThe symptoms are moisture, lack of inspiration, intense itching by scratching very distressing, particular parts of the body, especially the head, neck, shoulders, arms, legs, and feet. The patient complains of feeling cold and weak, and usually suffers from diarrhoea. The patient should be treated with care and attention.\n\nAddress, THE GLOBE PRINTING CO.\n\nPRINCE ALBERT\n\nChester Thompson,\n\nGeneral Blacksmith,\n\nRepairing Farm Machinery a Specialty.\n\nJames Sinclair,\n\nMerchant Tailor,\n\nand Dealer in\n\nBENTS' FURNISHINGS.\n\nNEW GOODS AT MEDICAL HALL\n\nBurdock Blood Bitters,\nBurdock Healing Ointment,\nBurdock Pills,\nVictoria Hypophosphites,\nVictor a Bucha and Eva Ursi,\nFraenkel's Worm Powder,\nY.

The Governor General read the following Speech from the Throne:\n\nMr. Speaker:\n\nHon. Gentlemen of the Senate:\nGentlemen of the House of Commons:\n\nI again meet you for the dispatch of our legislative business. We have, as usual, abundant harvests with which Providence has blessed our country, and upon the whole circumstances are promising. In commercial prosperity, although there has been some extent shown in the decline of trade which has prevailed in Great Britain, yet the strength of the Spanish, rest upon foundations which no temporary or political disturbance can undermine; and therefore I trust that you will be one of peace and prosperity.\n\nThe flow of population into Manitoba and the North West Territories, although impeded by the difficulties which have arisen, has been substantial, and the testimony of members of the British Association and other representatives of New South Wales attesting to the well-being, contentment and happiness of the settlers, is most gratifying.\n\nA full investigation into the Territorial road and telegraph system for the transcontinental railway will be undertaken next year. The report of the committee for the consideration of the statutes affecting the Dominion has been completed, and will be submitted to your consideration. You will once more be invited to consider a measure relating to the representation of the people in the House of Commons, and the revision of the laws of the provinces. A prominent arrangement of matters for the coming session will be the establishment of a new system of taxation in the territories, and the measures concerning the same will be submitted to your consideration at an early date.\n\nThe question of the Constitution is very nearly completed, and will be laid before you during the present session. The question of the construction of lines of railway through the North West Territories has presented itself, and the Government has acted in the matter, and various schemes have been made by the Provincial Governments of the North West and Canada, as well as by some of the Chambers of Commerce in Great Britain, of the necessity and causes for the adoption of such a measure.\n\nCHINESE IMMIGRATION.\n\nWith reference to its trade relations, as well as to the question of the objections which have been taken with reference to the influx of the Chinese people into Canada.\n\nThe question of the Constitution is very nearly completed, and will be laid before you during the present session. The question of the construction of lines of railway through the North West Territories has presented itself, and the Government has acted in the matter, and various schemes have been made by the Provincial Governments of the North West and Canada, as well as by some of the Chambers of Commerce in Great Britain, of the necessity and causes for the adoption of such a measure.\n\nSYSTEM OF BANKRUPTCY.\n\nAs regards the question of bankruptcy, I give adequate protection to the creditors. Attention to this important subject is earnestly invited. In pursuance of the instructions received from the Government, the bill has been drafted and despatched to Mr. David Smith and Hudson's Bay Company for their consideration and information as to the advantages of the same, and also the practicability of the route for commercial purposes. Approval of the route for the railway during the present session will be laid before you.\n\nAn international exhibition is now open at Antwerp during the present session, and another at Paris. Exhibition is to be held in London in 1886. Canada should, I think, be represented by the best specimens of our native productions on both occasions, and I have your consideration of the best manner of doing so these important objects.\n\nSeveral other matters of importance will be addressed to you. Among them will be the revision of the Income Tax Act of 1877, the Civil Service Act, and the law relating to contagious diseases among animals. I desire to call your attention at an early period of the session to the population of the North West Territories, and the settling of the North West Mounted Police.\n\nSTEWART BROS., TRADERS, GENERAL MERCHANTS,\n\nBegin to announce to their customers, as the public in general that they have just completed their fitting, and have determined to close out the following departments:\n\nBoots, AND Shoes, Hardware, Wall Paper, AND Crockery AT COST Flour, $5, Biscuits, 15c, Oatmeal, 9c, Black Tea, 50c, Japan Tea, 50c, Beef, 10c, Pork, 10c.\n\nDressed Flooring, $48 Undressed do., 42 Dressed Siding, 48 Undressed do., 42 Sheeting, 30 Common Lumber, 35 Dimension do., 40\n\nLath, 75 cts. per bundle.
