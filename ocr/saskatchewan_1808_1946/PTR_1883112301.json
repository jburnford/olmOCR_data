We shall be obliged if all letters are addressed to the Proprietors.\n\nA NORTH WEST CONVENTION\n\nNot long ago we wrote to you that we were preparing the Means and Means by which we could not make a very good thing out of the convention held at Regina, and we thought that the best course would be to hold another convention place along the line of the P. R. R., to discuss the question of a North West Alliance with North West Allies, with a view to effect some arrangement between those who were opposed to the proposal during the ensuing session of the Dominion Parliament, to permanently bring before the members of the House of Commons the most pressing of our demands concerning grievances and requirements. The idea is a good one, and we trust that it will be carried into effect without delay. The efficiency of delegations, provided that the right men are selected. Persistent pressure from the right quarters will more likely prove beneficial results than all the speeches and petitions that could be presented, or resolutions drawn up, and, we believe, the result of the Education and St. Albert delegations will show. The only thing that can prevent success is lack of enthusiasm. Members can put themselves in their proper places and forget all party considerations. We believe that the game quite easily, and something great their opinions to afford the opportunity for action. Last winter, we urged upon our people the importance of sending a delegation to Ottawa, to present our demands, and we believe that if this had been done there would, at least, an opportunity for a better understanding of our points; there would have been improved relations. We have not lost sight of the matter, and a further rights association, which will be called the North West Alliance, has been formed. We have been working hard for this purpose, and we believe that the time is ripe for its organization. We are anxious to see an organization of this kind, and we believe that it will provide funds for the expenses. The result of sending a delegation to Ottawa will be to bring about a better understanding of our views, and we believe that such an organization will be of great benefit to us. We believe that the time is ripe for its formation, and we believe that it will provide funds for the expenses.\n\nWANTED - A POLICE MAGISTRATE\n\nAmong the many wants of this place, and the country in general, there is none so pressing as the want of a police magistrate. The want of a police magistrate is felt throughout the entire country, and we believe that the time is ripe for its formation, and we believe that it will provide funds for the expenses.\n\nThe Mounted Police\n\nQuite a sensation was created on Sunday by the arrival of a large force of Mounted Police, under the command of Capt. Anderson. Of course there was still much excitement in the air, and it was said that they came here in response to a request from the citizens of Prince Albert. The Mounted Police are now stationed here, and they have been sent out in response to a request from the citizens of Prince Albert. They have been sent out in response to a request from the citizens of Prince Albert.\n\nJ. M. CAMPBELL\nTRESTON HOUSE\n\nBest Billiard Hall west of Winnipeg\n\nFIRST CLASS POOL & CARO TABLES\n\nWM.

As far as the farmer is concerned, he is paid a fair wage for his work, but he cannot make a living by farming a few acres to eat, sell, or barter.\n\nIf the farmer does not have enough to live on, he is poor. If there are no farmers in the town of Prince Albert, and can tell me where each went to, I shall be obliged. If there are no farmers of less than ten acres, I will cheerfully grant the privilege, and will assist in getting them started. I am sure that through the inclemency of the winter months.

On motion by Mr. Stewart, Mr. Macdonald and Mr. F. E. Cochran was appointed secretary. The chairman briefly explained the object of the meeting, viz., to consider whether they were going to take Incorporation, that they would have municipality and that they would all work together for the common good.\n\nMr. John B. Betts said that he had not had an opportunity of studying the distance between the town of North West Council, relating to Incorporation, but he had read the statement which was published in the newspapers, and thought that a committee be appointed to examine the claims expressed by the Act.\n\nThe Chairman then read from the Town Trustee's report on the Incorporation of town.\n\nMr. Betts suggested that the question should be discussed by the town Incorporators.\n\nMr. Wm. Stewart explained if the Guelphs people had considered the Ordnance and whether they were satisfied with it.\n\nMr. Dawsom said that the subject has been discussed extensively in the field of discussion and that the question is decided in favor of town Incorporation. He was himself appointed at that time to go to the town of Prince Albert and District of Leves in a pamphlet form which will contain the advertisements of the various firms who have been engaged in the publication of the Ordnance and other matters.\n\nMr. George Miller expressed himself in favor of the measure.\n\nMr. James Brown thought the town should be four miles long and half a mile wide.\n\nMr. Dawsom suggested that there ought to be a town hall to take care of the affairs of the town and women's associations in the centre.\n\nThe meeting then proceeded with the appointment of a committee to arrange details.\n\nMr. Barker suggested that the committee should meet next week.\n\nThe following gentlemen were the duly proposed and seconded and several elected: Messrs. Thomas McKay, Wm. Stewart, J. B. Betts, J. D. Macdonald, Miller, J. D. Murray, J. B. M. Miller, R. Deasom and J. E. Hooper.\n\nMr. Barker said that the Committee be appointed to make the details required by the ordinance, to prepare necessary papers and plans, define the limits of the town, designate town wards, etc., and to report at a future meeting of citizens to be called for that purpose.\n\nIt was moved by Mr. Barker and seconded by Mr. Deasom that the town be incorporated into a town under the provisions of the Ordinance of the North West Council, passed for that purpose, which was seconded by Mr. Stewart and passed unanimously.\n\nA vote of thanks was then passed by the Chairman and Secretary and the meeting adjourned.\n\nNow that the hall has been bought, we hope to have a good season. The ordinance provides that the annual election shall take place early in January, except case of a previous election, for which there may be a special increase.\n\nA petition has been presented to the Council and Secretary, which must be answered by the Council and Secretary, and the number of inhabitants, etc., must be determined by the Council and Secretary, and the number of electors must be determined by the Council and Secretary.\n\nThe office of the Clerk of the Council has been removed to the new building nearly opposite Mrs. Macdonald's mill, River street.
