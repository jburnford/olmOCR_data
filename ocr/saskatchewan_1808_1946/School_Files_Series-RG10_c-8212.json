Anderson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLongford Mills, Ont.\nPersonal attention,\n\nR.R. # Athelstey, Ont\nJuly 4/27\n\nMrs. Russell T. Herring, Sup't Ed.\nDept'g Ind. Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAfter being here a year, and putting my best thought and effort into the problems of this reserve, I am venturing to write to you personally concerning one or two matters that are possible solutions of perhaps the most serious problem of the lot.\n\nBut first of all, I want to thank the Department for the support, and prompt furnishing of supplies asked for. It has meant much to what I consider a very successful for the pupils. I have been experimenting to find out what appeals most and I trust a program can be worked out that will make for greater usefulness in the years to come.\n\nThe sewing and crocheting for the girls has kept everyone of them in school all year. But they want to make real clothing not just practice stuff. If we can get the material to make up, I shall...\nthought that perhaps some of it could be sold to provide material for the next year. I have noted also that the older girls and some women are eager to learn new ways of earning a living so that they will not have to sell body and soul for clothes.\n\nThis brings me to a suggestion, that dawned in my mind, where a dance kept me awake most of the night of July 1st. I haven't seen the Agent yet to get his opinion and as I leave for my holiday as soon as the cheque arrives, I may not see him.\n\nThey tell me a new Council hall is to be built. Also that Mr. Orr recommended using material of the old one for the new building. The puzzle to provide ways and means for training the girls and women, without the expense of more buildings, was solved in my dreaming.\n\nWould not the Department consider keeping the old Council Hall as part of the school unit for industrial purposes, due to provide adequate space for physical training in all kinds of weaving?\n\n(a) I should like to see the girls taught basket weaving by one or two of the best workers in the reserve. It is becoming a lost art.\n\n(b) Rug making could be added to the handicrafts.\nwith only a slight initial expense.\n\n(c) The girls ought to have as part of their school course a simple practical course in cooking and cleaning.\n\nA cook stove in the hall\u2014such as most ordinary utensils\u2014even makeshift ones\u2014would be a means of splendid work here.\n\n(d) A homemade workbench\u2014a few tools\u2014a few feet of lumber, some nails, glue etc., and the boys could get practical handcraft-making of furniture, practical arithmetic etc.\n\n(e) Classes for women under the guidance of the teachers could do a little to elevate the moral tone by giving them something to do. There are a few who want to learn how to garden\u2014do dairy work etc.\u2014Some of the girls in school are intensely interested.\n\nf. With Entrance classes there will be two more studying for next year\u2014it's heavy work for one or even two\u2014and immediately the salary is just ordinary teacher's salary\u2014but Miss Wilcox and I are ready to put every bit of our energy and knowledge into the work here.\nThe chief problem here, is that through natural laziness emphasized by lack of definite training for any definite work, the people get into all kinds of mischief and are an ever increasing menace to the welfare of the community.\n\ng. With the added space - the problem of training for School Concerts &c would be solved.\n\nh. With all due deference to Mr. Orr, whom I was sorry to have missed by 10 minutes on his surprise visit here, the place and quietness of the school would be materially enhanced if the new Council Hall were built farther north on the present grounds, near the crossroads corner; and we need the nights rest if we are to carry the work here in the least adequately.\n\nI hope that you will take this suggestion in the spirit in which it is given and consider ways and means of promptly saving this building for the school and women of this Reserve.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMrs. Jane Chickle, Prin.\nLongford Hall\nJuly 15, 1927\n\nI enclose herewith a letter addressed to Mr. Russell & Co., handed to me by Mrs. Stickle, Principal Roma Indian Day School, which will explain itself regarding her suggestion that the present Council Hall be converted into a new one in order to be used for school purposes. I cannot agree to her suggestion that the present Council Hall is not safe and would not be advisable to use for school purposes provided a new hall is built possible. We could arrange in the basement a section that could be used for school work as set forth by Mrs. Stickle.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nRoma Indian Reserve\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Every classroom should have a cupboard for supplies. When the lights were put in near the front of the senior classroom, one should have been put in in centre of room\".\n\nIf you approve of the Inspector's suggestion, you may arrange to have the cupboard in the senior room moved to the junior room and arrange to have a cupboard large enough to contain the general supplies installed in the senior room. It is thought that it would be cheaper to have this cupboard built locally than to purchase same. I shall be pleased if you will consult the teacher as to the type of cupboard that would be satisfactory, and forward an estimate of the cost of having same built.\n\nI have also to request that you will state the probable cost of installing a light in the senior classroom, as recommended by the Inspector.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I had the water in the well at the School all pumped out and the inside also cleaned out. I took samples of the School and Council Hall water and had them tested. The report I received according to the Provincial Analysts is... The water from the well at the School is bad and the drinking of it should be prohibited. The water from the Hall pump is OK. It is a question of by cleaning out the well again and washing the stone work with Chloride of lime it will be much better but it is worth a try. But if the soil through which the water comes into the well is infected the treatment is worthless.\n\nImmediately upon receiving the report I went direct to the School pump and placed a notice prohibiting the use of the water and at the same time disconnected the pump so that it cannot be used.

The attendance is irregular mostly due to colds and slight ailments. Seven pupils were absent on the day I was there.\n\nThe buildings are in a good state of repair. The front steps will later on need a few boards replaced. The Agent will have this attended to when it becomes necessary.\n\nApparently both teachers are giving good service and getting along very well with the parents. The Indians I talked with, all spoke very highly of them.\n\nThe walls of both classrooms look bare. Could you let them have six wall pictures each for the two rooms? There is a need for four wire window screens, two for each room. Nothing in this way has ever been provided and it is very annoying, particularly in the summer time, when the windows have to be opened, to have the classrooms full of flies.\n\nIf the funds at your disposal will bear this small expenditure, I would recommend that Agent Anderson be advised to get four screens made right away.\n\nINSPECTOR.\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector McGookin, who recently visited the Rama Indian Day School, has recommended that four screens be provided for the windows of the classroom \u2014 two for each classroom. In this connection I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery at the school of four half screens of the ordinary sliding type. These screens may be purchased when considered timely by you to have them delivered. Please forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nThe Inspector also recommended that pictures be supplied for the walls of the classrooms. The Department is placing an order through the Government Stationery Office here to forward a set of Nelson's Pictures of Canadian History. There are twelve pictures in the set, and six should be placed in each classroom.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nA. S.

It will be possible to authorize only the absolutely necessary repairs in order to make the roof watertight. It is noted from the communication which you forwarded from the man who examined the roof that same could be made watertight for approximately $30. The Department will therefore approve, when weather conditions permit, of you having the absolutely necessary repairs made to the roof. The cost of material and labour should not, if possible, exceed the sum of $30. After these repairs have been completed, please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, stating in detail the material and labour supplied.\n\nDuring the coming fiscal year, I have to say that the Department will rely on you to see that only the absolutely necessary repairs, equipment and supplies are requested for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I would dig this hole in the ground and cement it and install an automatic electric sump pump, which would keep the water pumped a foot below the floor, and pipe it to a suitable point where it would flow by gravity outside. This pump is worth ninety ($90.00) dollars. I will install it, doing the electric wiring, laying the tile and putting fresh cement back again as it is now, making and cementing sump hole for $60.00. This would make a total of $150.00 and I would leave everything in good order.\n\nIndian Affairs.

At times there is as much as 6 inches of water, it backs up into the furnace and coal bins, and in one of the class rooms the boards of floor are warped, so doubt from dampness in basement.

I can patch the plaster in the two rooms of the\nliving quarters and the ceiling of the clock room and touch up the tinting give the living quarters floor two coats of paint and patch up the steps in front for $25.00 supplying labour and material.\n\nYours Etc\n\nH. Heint\nSir:\n\nI have acknowledged receipt of your letter of July 24 regarding repairs at Rosedale Indian Day School including painting of floors in Teacher's quarters. I have today gone over the work required with Mr. Hunt and believe his tender for doing most of it is actually necessary. There will not be so much expense placed on the front entrance step but sufficient for paint. The walls in main room will not be touched as this may last for some time though repainting would give a better appearance. The floor in Teacher's quarters do not require scraping only painting.

They inform me today that no remittance covering the amount has yet been received by them. Will you kindly look into the matter and advise me.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAgent,\nRama Indian Reserve.\nLongford Mills, Ont.\nMarch 13th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOwing to the recent heavy rains the basement in the Rama Indian Day School has become flooded.\n\nOn the evening of March 11th, Miss Swerdleger telephoned to me that the water was coming in very badly. I immediately got in touch with Mr. A.R. Payne, of Orillia and arranged with him to have the water removed.\n\nI visited the School on the morning of the 12th and found the water had risen to about 4 feet, putting out the furnace, with the result that the School rooms were too cold for the pupils to remain in School, and I instructed the Teachers to dismiss their classes until such time as the trouble is overcome and the furnace can be started.\n\nThis morning the water had again risen to yesterday's depth, and consulting Mr. Payne he stated the only thing to do is to keep on pumping until the trouble is overcome. The School is still closed.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nAgent,\nRama Indian Reserve.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nLongford Mills, Ont.\nMarch 17th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn further reference to my letter of the 13th inst. regarding the water in the basement of Rama Indian Day School, it has been necessary to keep pumping the water until this morning, when the electric pump started and I expect it will be able to keep the water down, unless the flow into the basement is again as much as the last few days, the pump was not large enough to carry off all the water, hence it rose and put the pump out of order.\n\nWhere the water entered the basement could not be located, around the School the ground is raised, and no snow within 15 feet of the School wall. There is a down pipe from the roof at the North East of the School, which may be the cause of the trouble, and I would recommend that it be altered. The pipe from the roof runs down into the ground, close beside the wall of the School, coming down from the roof about half way down is a tin pipe connecting to an iron pipe about 10 feet in length, and this iron pipe goes down into the ground, and how the water is disposed of then I do not and could not find out, possibly if you have the plans of the School when it was built they will show. However I would recommend that this pipe into the ground be done away with, and made that the water be drained off on the surface. Immediately where the pipes enter the ground there is a settlement, as if something has given away.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAgent,\nRama Indian Reserve.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, March 21, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, regarding the water in the basement of the Rama Indian Day School, stating that you consider if the down pipe from the roof, at the north east corner of the building, was removed it might prevent the water seeping into the cellar in future.\n\nYou may arrange for the removal of this pipe, which drains into the ground. The Department will leave the matter in your hands, to make the best arrangements to overcome the water draining into the cellar. It is hoped that the electric sump pump which was installed will remove the water at present in the basement and that, after the pipe is removed, there will be no further difficulty in keeping the cellar drained.\n\nPlease forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred in removing the down pipe, stating definitely the number of hours and the rate paid in having the work done. This matter should receive your early attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. S. Anderson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLongford Mills,\nOnt.\n\nA. P. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nDear Sir:\n\nReference No. 24-1-5\n\nI have again to report that the water was again coming into the basement of the Rama Indian Day School yesterday, about 6.30 P.M.

Average attendance is very good and the pupils are making good progress. They look healthy, clean and tidy. Cod Liver Oil is given daily in the class rooms. All pupils have been vaccinated up to date. Sewing, mending, and knitting are taught in the senior room. The class rooms are clean, comfortable and well ventilated.\n\nThe class room walls and ceilings are badly in need of redecorating. The upstairs rooms of the teacher's residence also need this attention. The walls have got discolored and shabby from a leaky roof. The new roof and painting of the outside wood work has added very much to the appearance of the building.\n\nThos. McGookin.\nInspector.\n**TRANSFER BILL**\n\n**W. WOOLWORTH CO.

I cannot at this time say just what the cost of the casting will be but the labor would run about $200 or $250.\n\nI would point out that the reason for the trouble you are having so soon after the installation of the furnace is that it is altogether too small for the building and too light weight and will not stand the heavy firing necessary to get the required heat.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hard coal can, of course, be used equally as well.\n\nPease \"Economy\" Furnace not cased.\n\nPrinted in Canada\nMr. A.S. Anderson,\n\nIn compliance with your request I am sending you the bill for work done at the Rama School, also an explanation regarding the condition of the furnace.\n\nWe found on tearing down the furnace that the firepot and the cast radiator were so badly warped out of shape that it was impossible to put on the new combustion chamber, so we had to take the old casting back to town and patch it before replacing it. Now this will only last for a short time but we hope it will see you through the rest of the winter.\n\nIf you intend fixing up this furnace in the spring it will mean purchasing new firepot, combustion chamber, and radiator which is nearly the whole furnace.\n\nAs I pointed out in my previous letter this furnace is too small for the school and has to be fired too heavily to get the rooms to the required temperature, and as\nIn consequence, the furnace is burnt out prematurely. You will have the same trouble again if you still use this furnace.\n\nYou really need a larger furnace and one of a heavier quality such as the Pease Economy. There was a Pease furnace in the school before the present one was installed and I believe it lasted quite a number of years. I believe the No. 916 Pease Economy would be the right furnace for this job. It has a capacity of 45,000 cu. ft. and weighs 1800 lbs. The price for the furnace is $197.00. Now I am expecting the Pease traveller in Orillia soon and will take him to the school to look the job over to see if the piping is as it should be. Then we will be able to make our suggestions to you and give you a price for the job complete.\n\nWe trust this will be satisfactory to you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEdgar Maynard\nIN ACCOUNT WITH\n\nEDGAR MAYNARD\nPLUMBING, HEATING AND TINSMITHING\n\nAll Accounts are due and payable at this store on the 1st of each month.\n\nTo repairs to furnace\n10 lbs iron 12 120\n5 lbs furnace cement 75\n5 asbestos blanket 25\n6 1/4 x 1/4 bolt 0.5\n12 ft. tin pipe 95 920\n10 ft. helper 360\n2 trips 28 miles @ 5 140\nTotal 16.45\nVoucher No. 57\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to Edgar Hayward,\nAddress 11 West St. South,\nOrillia, Ont.\n\n| Year | Service | Amount |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| 1938 | To Amount of Account, Edgar Hayward, 11 West St. South, Orillia, Ont. | $16.45 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 506\n\nVoucher No. 57\n\nDATE March 11th, 1938\n\nIndian Affairs.

As mentioned on purchase requisition of July 6 a furnace with a heating capacity of 35,000 to 40,000 feet is necessary. The No. 916 Pease Economy Warm Air Furnace has this heating capacity.\n\nThe firm installing the furnace should be in a position to decide if new cold air registers are necessary. If so, they can be installed after the furnace has been placed in the proper position. I do not consider it necessary to send a heating engineer to the two-roomed Indian Day School.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. R. A.

Repairs are also necessary to front platform steps of school - estimated cost approximately $25.00. The platform and steps are not used, as side entrances are open, but have an unsightly appearance from the road and mar the appearance of an otherwise fine school building.\n\nW.S.

The known infected children have been sent home. I had Dr. Brown make an inspection of the pupils on Monday and he reports that the general cleanliness is not good and it is considered advisable to provide soap and paper towels for use at the school as sending these dirty children home for a clean up has not proved very effective. With this in view and in order to get started without delay, I have purchased a few paper towels and a bar of medicated soap.\n\nI am of the opinion that liquid soap would be the most sanitary and satisfactory if a container can be purchased. Kindly advise if it is in order to purchase towels, soap and etc. required to carry out this plan.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant with reference to installing paper towels and liquid soap in the Rama Indian Day School. As you have been informed, Mr. Doucet of this Branch will visit the Rama School at the end of this week and you should discuss the matter further with him.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

I have had expert advice to this effect. This could have been done at the time the new furnace was installed in 1938 at a cost of about $75.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoey\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThere is one matter about which I forgot to talk to you. I was at Rama on Sunday. In talking over the needs with Mr. Hayward, who is both missionary and teacher, he said that he thought the children were suffering from lack of proper food. Would you consider making it possible for the school to provide a noonday lunch? I know that the difficulty does not arise from the economic needs of the people; and, consequently, I hesitate to make the suggestion, but I believe it is well worth thinking about.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nNovember 18th,\n1944.\nOttawa,\nNovember 22, 1944.\n\nMr. H.J. Featherston, Indian Agent, Longford Mills, Ont.\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada in which it is intimated that one of their officials was informed by Mr. Hayward, teacher of the Rama School, that the latter considered that the children were suffering from lack of proper food and it has been suggested that a midday meal should be supplied.\n\nIn view of economic conditions on the Rama Reserve at the present time the Department cannot understand why the parents are not in a position to provide the necessary food for their children. At least the great majority of children attending the Rama School live a comparatively short distance from the school and should be able to go home for lunch. However, I thought it advisable to submit the matter to you. You might discuss the situation with Mr. Hayward and you might point out to him that it would be appreciated if he would interview you regarding such matters before submitting them to any outside official.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nNovember 28, 1944.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to the advisability of supplying a midday meal at the Rama School. I am communicating with the Indian Agent and on receipt of his reply I will write to you again.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. Geo. Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIn reply to your letter of November 22nd in regard to noon lunch for pupils of Rama School I beg to advise that I have taken this matter up with Mr. Hayward and am advised that this appears to be the outcome of a chance remark made by Mrs. Hayward to Dr. Dory when he was telling her about the special biscuits sometimes supplied Indian children. She wondered \"if it would put more pep into the children here.\"\n\nAll children at Rama school go home for lunch and none walk more than a mile to school. Mr. Hayward states that he never even thought of a noon lunch at school and realizes that if there is any undernourishment it is more likely to be due to ignorance and indifference than poverty.\n\nH.J. Featherston\nIndian Agent, Rama Agency.\nOttawa, December 5, 1944.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nUpon receipt of your letter of the 18th ultimo, regarding the possibility of providing a noonday lunch at the Rama Indian Day School, the Indian Agent was written.\n\nI have just received his reply and he points out that all children go to their homes for lunch and none have to walk more than a mile. Under these circumstances, he has expressed the opinion that the serving of a midday lunch is not necessary.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nActing Director.\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2 B, Ont.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of October 19th in regard to furnace in Rama Indian Day School.\n\nIt has not been easy to get anyone to even look at an out-of-town job of this sort but yesterday Mr. Jack Oatway, a plumber from Orillia, who seems to know his business, came out and gave the furnace and system a looking over. As the repairs required are very much beyond anything known or thought of at the time of Mr. Phelan's visit, I am making a report and asking instructions.\n\nThe fire pot is burned through and has to be replaced and the grates are also ruined and have to be replaced. I made the inspection with Mr. Oatway and discussed with him the cause and remedy. In the first place the air doesn't circulate sufficient to heat the building and in an effort to do so, fires are made so hot that no furnace will stand it for long. Mr. Oatway says that the heat just sits over the furnace. The situation is made worse by the sort of coal that we are now compelled to use which burns up quickly and hot and also by a fireman not too competent.\n\nThe circulation can be increased somewhat by adding another cold air pipe to each room and taking it into the furnace a little differently at an estimated cost of $75.00 plus the cost of the castings (grates and firepot).\nHe strongly recommends the installation of a forced circulation system by electric fan. He estimates that this will cost $300.00 plus cost of castings. He also recommends an electric \"janitor\" to control the drafts at an additional cost of $37.50. He considers this particularly advisable in this case where one has to contend with an incompetent or careless fireman.\n\nI think myself, that we will never get satisfaction until there is a forced circulation and the saving in coal will be considerable and the life of the furnace greatly increased.\n\nAs previously intimated, no one is looking for work or business but Mr. Catway has stated that he will undertake to do the job in the Christmas holidays if given the instructions immediately so that he can place his orders.\n\nH.J. Featherston\nIndian Agent, Rama Agency.\n\nP.S.\nThere is no certainty that the firepot will permit the operation of the furnace until Christmas but it is hoped that it can be done.\n\nH.J.F.\nOttawa,\nDecember 7, 1944.\n\nMr. H.J. Featherston, Indian Agent, Longford Mills, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to the furnace at the Rama School. The Department approves your arranging for the installation of another cold air pipe in each room and also the supplying of new grates and fire pot. It is noted that the expenditure in this regard will be $75.\n\nWe also approve the installation of an electric \"fanitor\" to control the draughts at a cost of $37.50.\n\nWe are approaching the end of the fiscal year and our funds are becoming limited. Consequently it is not possible to favourably consider the additional expenditure of $300 for the installation of a forced circulation system.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nDecember 7, 1944.\n\nMr. H.J.

Owing to the difficulty of securing expert advice, it was late in the year 1944 before definite information was available, and as the necessary labour could then be secured, the work covered by the attached voucher was authorized. It would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid. The coding is as follows:- 421-76-10-691.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\nOttawa, February 23, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR DOREY,\n\nSome weeks ago Reverend Doctor Dorey suggested that a midday meal be served at the Rama Indian Day School. We wrote to the Indian Agent and in reply he pointed out that in his opinion there was no necessity for serving a midday meal as all the children go home for lunch and none have to walk more than a mile. This information was conveyed to Rev. Dr. Dorey, but he has written again as follows:-\n\n\"Following our conversation, would you take up with Dr. Moore or Dr. Falconer the possibility of their looking into the advisability of arranging for noonday lunches or other means of improving the diet standards of the Rama Indians. This would, of course, mean a preliminary examination of the need of such improvement.\"\n\nOn the occasion of the next visit of either Dr. Falconer or yourself to the Rama Reserve, it would be appreciated if you would review the matter mentioned above.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nQUARTERLY REPORT ENDING MARCH, 1945, ON RAMA INDIAN AGENCY\n\nThe heating of the Day School has been much improved since the changes and repairs to the furnace.\n\nH.J. Featherston,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nThe exceedingly high wind that we experienced a few days ago blew the board fence that was in front of the girls toilet at Rama School down, posts and all. The toilets also require squaring up and repairing. Kindly send me an advance of $30.00 to cover the labour costs of the repairs required. Some new building material will be required also.\n\nH.J.

Featherston,\nIndian Agent, Longford Mills, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th instant, the Department is forwarding you an accountable advance for $30.00 for labour to repair the fence at the Rama Indian Day School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI would refer to my letter of April 11th in regard to damage to the board fence around the toilets at Rama Day School. The advance of $30.00 has been received but I have not as yet done anything about it. Mr. Hayward has suggested that if these toilets were moved, one to each side of the lot, benefit would result in that the boys would not hang around the toilets so much.\n\nI am not prepared to say whether the benefits to be expected would warrant the change but I submit it for your consideration. The existing toilets are not in too good a condition and will have to be repaired or replaced in any case whether moved or not. Possibly the School Inspector could advise on the question or the matter be held in obeyance until Mr. Arneil looks the situation over.\n\nI am enclosing a plan of the school set up.\n\nH.J.

In view of the second paragraph of your letter, I feel the matter should be left in abeyance until Mr. Arneil visits the agency. Mr. Arneil is absent from the office at the present time, but I will discuss the matter with him next week.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of May 4th in regard to the toilets at Rama Indian Day School and to report that the matter was discussed with Mr. Arneil during his recent visit to the reserve. It was decided that the toilets should be torn down, salvaging what material may be of use and that new toilets should be erected, one on each side of the school grounds.\n\nKindly forward an advance in the amount of $125.00 for this purpose.\n\nH.J.

Original on 24-1-6.\n\nI would like to submit the following detail for improving school conditions:\n\n(a) School grounds should be cleaned up and beautified. This school should set an example to the whole community.\n\n(b) The building needs painting, inside and out.\n\n(c) Proper electric lighting should be installed throughout the building.\n\n(d) There should be some means of driving good warm air into the class rooms and exhausting foul air.\n\n(e) Properly equipped inside toilets should be installed and if possible, there should be running water in the school building.\n\n(f) There should be a definite system of supplying textbooks and work materials within a short time so that the particular needs of this school could be filled. The present system seems to give little leeway for supplying local needs.\n\n(g) The cost of heating this school could be lowered if it were properly insulated.\nJuly 20, 1948.\n\nMr. H.J. Featherston, Indian Agent,\nLongford Mills, Ontario.\n\nWe have received Inspector Bolingbroke's report on his inspection of the Rama Day School on May 20th and he refers to the necessity for insulating the class room. You mentioned this matter in your letter of June 21st and we replied on June 24th but have not heard further from you.\n\nYou might also obtain a quotation on painting the interior of the school and we would like to know at what cost electricity could be installed in the building.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MOD\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 24th, 1948, in regard to repairs at Rama Indian Day School, I can now report that the cost of new eave-troughs throughout will run to about $35.00.\n\nThe insulating material required to do the ceiling of both classrooms will cost about $125.00. There will be the labour over and above that. I would think that it would be under $25.00.\n\nIt will cost probably $10.00 or $15.00 to repair the chimney.\n\nMinor repairs are also required for the furnace.\n\nH.J. Featherston\nIndian Agent, Rama Agency.\nJuly 22, 1948.\n\nMr. H.J. Featherston, Indian Agent,\nLongford Mills, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 21st instant, the Department approves an expenditure of $85.00 for repairing the eavestroughing at the Rama School.\n\nAn amount of $150.00 will be allowed for material and labour for insulating the ceiling in both class rooms.\n\nYou may also have the chimney repaired at a cost of approximately $15.00.

George Snache, an Indian painter, by trade, to paint the two class rooms, the cloak rooms and hall of Rama Indian Day School, one coat, for the sum of $165.00 and he supply the paint or $90.00 for labour only and we supply the paint. It is proposed to use KemTone on the upper walls and ceiling and varnish on woodwork, seats and desks. I believe the price is reasonable.\n\nBefore any painting is done, the plaster will have to be repaired. This is not included in the price quoted. The cost should not exceed $25.00.\n\nIf this job is gone on with, it might be well to do the teacher's living room and the stairway and hall.

In the class rooms there are three lights only, at intervals across in front of the blackboard. The kitchen has a six drop light from the ceiling, no switch and no base plug. The same is true of the living room and the two bedrooms. The basement is much the same.\n\nThe Hydro-Electric Power Commission render a service, on request, in respect to the lighting of schools in the Province and I submitted a plan of the school (main floor) and asked their advice. They prepared a detailed plan which I am enclosing for your attention.\n\nI went over the building with an electrician who has been doing some work herabouts and gave him the plans in order that he might prepare an estimate of the cost of a proper installation. This man failed to submit an estimate saying that he was unable to get quotations on suitable fixtures and just recently returned the plans. It may be that someone with a larger and better connection would proceed with the job but before contacting anyone else, you should review the whole thing and advise.\n\nIf the school is rewired, I am afraid that there is little of the present wiring that can be made use of in the new job. I would suggest that switches and base plugs be put in the kitchen, living room and bedrooms, the basement properly wired and possibly lights over the outside doors. I would suggest that either flourescent or Semi-direct lights\nas shown on Plate 2 in group four be used in the classrooms. The fluorescent lights require much less current. It might well be that a 350 watt would do in place of the 500 watt if the semi-direct is used.\n\nI would say that the job would probably run to five or six hundred dollars but this is only a guess.\n\nKindly advise and return plans.\n\nH.J.

You might bring this matter to our attention again in April or May, 1949 and possibly we could secure a firm quotation for the work at that time and have the work done during the summer holidays.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nACCOUNT RENDERED\n\nOct. 7, Invoice No. 6897\n\n50 B.M. 4/4 $1 Poplar P.O.S. 3.50\n\nRemittances Received after above date will appear on next statement.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department will approve of this work being undertaken during the coming summer holidays, and you may arrange with an experienced man to do the work and supply the paint and other materials required.

A new fence is also needed around the school lot and the well from which the school secure its water wants cleaning badly and the whole cost should not exceed $200.00, allowing $125.00 for the new roof, $50.00 for the fence and $25.00 for odd repairs and the well.\n\nIn reference to the roof, I would believe that a good grade of arrow-lock shingle put on over the cedar shingle would make a satisfactory roof, providing the cedar shingles were all nailed down well before the arrow-locks were laid.

You should obtain a price for the supplying of the shingles and for the labour, and submit same for the consideration of the Department.

Ten-Test - estimated cost $28.00\n- 500 ft. strapping - estimated cost $7.50\n- 100 ft. cove moulding - estimated cost $2.00\n- 1 panel door with frame and oak sill (3'4\" x 6'8\") at an estimated cost of $2.50\n- Locks and hinges at an estimated cost of $2.50\n- 4 gal. of paint estimated cost $15.00\n- Oil, turpentine and brushes - estimated cost $5.00\n- Nails - estimated cost $4.25\n- 1 pane of glass 14\" x 31\" and three-eighths inches, putty and glaze at an estimated cost of 75 cents.\n- Exterior painting, 5 gals. of paint, oil, turpentine, etc. at an estimated cost of $25.00\n- Labour - estimated cost $80.00\n\nThis is only an estimate and the total cost would run in the vicinity of $256.60 and would put this building in proper condition for a number of years.\n\nThe building is over 50 years old and it would be necessary to remove all plaster from walls and replace it with Ten-Test, as, on account of the condition of the plaster, it is dangerous to the pupils.\n\nAs this building is so old and not knowing what difficulties may arise when repairs are being made, I would ask the authority of the Department to purchase from local firms on the approved list the necessary materials for these repairs, to whom it is possible to return any unused materials after repairs are completed.\n\nWhen this authority is granted, a cheque for $80.00 for payment of wages should be sent forward.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This lumber would cost about $2.00 and besides the cupboard there would be enough lumber to repair the wood-shed door and the interior of the boys out-house.\n\nThe cost of any labour involved will be nil as I can have it done by some Indian who seeks relief assistance from the office.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

In the latter event, you should let me know the cost of the material and forward a requisition in order that purchase of the material may be made through our Purchasing Branch.

I shall not comment on it further. It should be demolished, and a new school built. This report should receive consideration in your program of better school accommodation.\n\nThe minor repairs, which I am endeavouring to have completed before school reopens are as follows-\n\nGlass where necessary\nRepairs to toilets\n1 gallon paint\n\nand I trust my action meets with your approval.\n\nGeo.

Down, Indian Agent,\nMuncey, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of\nthe 28th ultimo, the Department approves the\nminor repairs to the River Settlement School.\n\nIn your estimates for the fiscal\nyear 1948-49 you should include a request for\na new school to replace the present River\nSettlement School.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nExtract from Inspector Young's report on his inspection of the River Settlement School on November 7, 1947.\n\nIt appears that my visit followed a rather unusually bad demonstration of Halloween pranks. The register was stolen so that no record of attendance was available. The door on the girls' closet was smashed and the room was not as tidy as it might have been.\n\nI have always complimented Mr. Reid on his ability to have the pupils respond alertly, co-operate in the care of the property and other activities which lead to good citizenship. These features were not so much in evidence at this visit; still assignments are made. Their printing and writing are good.\n**Longfield Brothers Limited**\nLumber \u2014 Millwork \u2014 Coal\nMOUNT BRYDGES, ONTARIO\n\nSOLD TO:\nDept.

As he has been suffering with some difficulty with his eyes, the Doctor has advised that for the present he suspend his studies, and this is the reason why he is retiring temporarily from Mission work. Mr Menomenee does not hold the usual certificate, but he passed the entrance examination for the High School when he was at Muncey.\n\nDoubtless Mr Indian Agent Maclean of Parry Sound, will know about Menomenee, and can advise you as to his fitness for the school work.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nTo the Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nRev.

The complaint being that the present teacher will not teach the Indian children only up to a certain age say when they have arrived at the age of twelve years.

In conversation with Chief Meech, he states that female teachers have conducted the Ryerson School on Parry Island for the past fifteen years with very indifferent satisfaction or success. Hence the reason of appealing for a change.\n\nI may state that male qualified teachers are not so easy to secure as these people may imagine. By advertising for such a person it may be possible that a duly qualified man might be secured.\n\nI am Sir your obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Seely,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\n[Stamp]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In addition to this the Public School Inspector speaks very highly of the present teacher. In his last report, which was made in the month of September, he says:\n\n\"He is doing excellent work. The school has been and is in very good form.

Moved by Joseph Partridge and seconded by John Menominee that this Council resolve that they pay to the Department for a change of Teacher who is at present teaching the Ryerson school, reasons viz.\u2014That an Indian speaking both the Indian and English languages would be an advantage in teaching the Indian children especially the smaller ones just commencing school.

And they claim that the present Teacher has refused to teach boys older than fifteen years, and the Chief contends that in the winter months when the mills are shut down and the lumber shipping is over, the winter is the only time for boys to go to school. I told the Chief and his Councilmen to embody their reasons fully in their resolution, which they have not done hence my reason for writing on this matter.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd., D.F.

F. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nMoved by John Menomonee and seconded by Thomas Pabamawadong that this council pass a resolution in asking a change of a school teacher at the Ryerson School, a male teacher is preferable to take charge of this school. For this reason, we want our young men and women to go to school as much as possible, so they can pursue their ambitions intentions to improve what they have learned and qualify themselves to be extensively useful at home or elsewhere. We need a better order for the ruling of the school. Two boys were reported for lack of order. So we are forced to ask the Indian Department to have a change of this school here, a man who would take full control of the school.\n\nSigned\nChief Peter Nege\n\nThere is no reason of removing the present teacher. There are but seven children belonging to the Band attending to the Ryerson school. The place for the larger boys and girls attending the school if a male teacher was in charge is not worth considering. The boys reported are non-members of the Band. Therefore, to expel them, I shall not consider any further complaint.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Miss Armour has been in charge of this school for seven or eight years, holding a Second Class Provincial Certificate.\n\nAfter advertising in the \"Globe Times\" the 17th of July last, the spirit of applicants for the position of Teacher's have been many but their qualifications and experience were not up to the Inspector's desire. We have two applicants selected, one for Shawanaga School, Pary Island, and Shawanega School. Mr. Partridge remains for another year at Henry Islet.

McLean Esq.,\nSecretary and Deputy,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sir: Having applied for the Parry Island Ryerson's School in answer to the advertisement appeared in the columns of the Daily Globe in the latter part of last July. For which was never answered one way or the other. I think any candidacy for this position, no law in the Indian Act excludes this by which the Indians are governed. I fail to see the justification in the part of some authorities, when they are so prejudiced against the Indian talent, just because of their race, preferring their race to place them in any mortuary income; why then do you educate the Indian youth, is it not to lift them up into some responsible position to utilize their gained influence for the elevation of their people. I say sir it is shame to ignore this most important medium in hastening the elevation\nof the dusky race: But I see in your own stand point you seem to look at it from different light, therefore forbear to state any more. I think though my right should have been duly considered and duly notified as should be accorded to a gentleman from a gentleman: If I had been appointed to the teacher's position on Parry Island it was my purpose to exert every necessary power to impart the best of my knowledge to the Indian youth, to satisfy the authorities and the people.\n\nYour humble servant,\nW. A. Elias\nShawanaga\nOnt.\n\nP.S. I write this by the advice of D.F. McDonald, to try to persuade the Department for Parry Island position. I believe the Department will do it, had there been no interference from below, which has no base for the truth or contra. W. A. Elias\nMoved by John Micomene and seconded by John Manitowabo that this council resolve that the Indian Department be requested to inform the council to give the reason why they fail to carry out what they have promised before in appointing a new teacher for the Ryerson School, or else close the school until the new one is appointed.\n\nSigned\nChief Peter Megis\nD. Micomene Secy.\n\nNote:\nThe reason that Miss Armour was engaged was because she was one of the three applicants with the proper qualifications to teach with the approval of the School Inspector.\n\nIt appears that the Indians are anxious to get W.A. Elias, the late teacher at Shawanaga Reserve placed in one of the schools on Parry Island. He has no qualification papers for teaching and the sooner the Department will give these agitators to understand that none but qualified teachers will be engaged the quicker. Mr. Elias and his malcontents will learn that the Department of Indian Affairs has to be consulted as to the selection of teachers.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Macdonald Esq.,\nIndian Supt.,\nParry Sound.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA copy received you sent to me in which the Indian Department replying the resolution was passed at Parry Island Indian Council on the second day of Sept., in reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Ryerson School. The chief and the Council were quite sure that there would be a change made for the appointment of a new teacher for the said school. Because the Indian Department promised to do so. The parents whose children are attending the school, that is, the members of the Parry Island Band are so desirous to have a change in the near future.\n\nWe admit that what the Indian Department states in the letter that some professional qualifications required of anyone before can be appointed as a teacher. We know that Miss Armour has some qualifications for the position.\n\nBut the question comes in here and the preference for the change, the following reasons why the change is desired. First, her health is not strong enough to attend her duties for the next twelve months. She just barely got through for the last quarter, and took sick then. She is too delicate on account her age probably. Secondly, the Indian Department should seek to satisfy the Indians whose interest money are paying for the teachers on the reserve. Thirdly, the Indian Depart-\n\nIndian Affairs.

The resident non-members are sending their children so far, thus is but one pupil belonging to the band attending. I have warned them that I would put the school law in force.\n\nThe whole trouble rests with the Chief who, I think, is advising the members to refuse from sending their children. I will give them another week to take their choice, either to send their children to school or appear before the Police Magistrate and abide by the Consequences.

The Chief's letter has been read and, while there are no doubt some grounds for their objection to Miss Armour, it is not considered that there are sufficient to warrant them in not sending their children to school. It might be well also to point out to the Chief that the Department bears a portion of the salaries of these teachers, in fact in the case of the Seagreen school more than half is paid by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. F. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nExtract from letter from Mr. Superintendent Macdonald, dated December 11, 1911. Original on 151974/1.\n\n\"Mrs. Yarwood, who is teaching at present the Sahanatien School, Gibson Reserve, who holds a Third Class Professional Certificate, with several years experience and references, takes charge of the Ryerson School at New Years at $450. per annum. The increase of salary and the comfortable home and surroundings and with postal facilities were the inducements I held out to her when I learned that she was going to leave the Sahanatien School. Mr. Moore has congratulated me on my success in securing Mrs. Yarwood's services as teacher.\"\nOttawa, December 14, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, and in reply to that portion in which you inform the Department that you have engaged Mrs. Yarwood to take charge of the Ryerson School after New Years I beg to say that this is the first intimation the Department has had that it is her intention to resign. You should have reported this matter and obtained permission to grant the increase in salary. The arrangement is, however, satisfactory to the Department, if it is to others concerned. I would remind you that Mrs. Yarwood was nominated for the position by the authorities of the Methodist Church, who have this privilege in connection with the Gibson school. It is considered that they should be consulted before any change is made. I would ask you to obtain at once from Mrs. Yarwood her resignation in writing and have it transmitted to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nD. F. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of 14 December.\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter regarding the engagement of Mr. Garwood for the Ryerson School. In reply, I explain that when I was at Sahanatin School, on the 2nd of October, Mr. Garwood intimated to me that she intended to quit the Sahanatin School at the end of the term. I asked if she would take the Ryerson School. I explained to her the amount of salary, $450 per annum, a free house, and furniture, situated about 300 feet from the School House, and a mail box or three times a week or oftener. She asked me if I could hold the position open for her for two until she could consult her friends and hear from them. As she had determined to go to North West, when she would quit the Sahanatin School, I advised her to write to the School Inspector and put her application in writing as soon as she had decided what she would do.\n\nThe Inspector being out on duty, doubtless, delays a reply to her application. The Inspector recommended her engagement as he was with myself to have the Ryerson, Shene, and Shawanaga Schools opened as soon as possible, with the best teachers available for the work.\n\nI was under the impression that the Inspector had written you.\n\nI am Sir your obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

Rev. T. E. E. Shore, General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society, is being asked to nominate a successor.\n\nIn the meantime the Department does not wish to have the Gibson School closed and it is thought that you may be able to arrange with Miss Dewasha, who has had some previous experience at the school, to re-open classes on January 2nd unless a satisfactory nomination is made before that date. If you do not hear from the Department in the course of a few days you may arrange to have Miss Dewasha take charge of the school and the Department will pay her at the rate of $300.00 per annum, it to be understood that she will give up the position immediately upon the receipt of notice to do so. If Miss Dewasha will not accept it you may engage Miss Decaire, but, as the former is much closer to the school, it is considered preferable to give her the temporary appointment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nD.

Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Supt.,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report to you that Ryerson School, Parry Island, has been opened today for school purposes. The building in general is very fine and finished in nice shape. I had a few of the leading gentlemen from Parry Sound including the School Inspector, Mr. J.L. Moore, at the opening and they all spoke highly of the school and had a lot to say to the Indian parents who were present, re regular attendance of the children, which I trust may do some good.\n\nI am Your Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Supt.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 23, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to learn that the new Ryerson School was opened under such favourable circumstances.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nAlexander Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nSchool Opened\n\nLast Thursday morning the new Indian school at the Upper Village on Parry Island was formally opened. On the invitation of Indian Superintendent Alec Logan, Mr. J. D. Ridgeway, Deputy Inspector of Public Schools, Rev James Binnie, St. Andrew's Church, Rev W. T. Bunt, Baptist Church, and Mr. Wm. Ireland, Editor of The North Star, accompanied the Superintendent to Parry Island. The scholars, headed by their teacher Miss Munro marched from the old school to the new and in the presence of a number of the parents and friends and the children Mr. Logan opened the proceedings.\n\nIn a brief speech he pointed out that the new school and teachers house had cost about $3,500 exclusive of the seats and fittings, and was in every respect a modern and model building. It was heated throughout by a furnace, had modern ventilation, plenty of light and was a sign of the progressive Indians were making, as well as a credit to the Band. He wanted every boy and girl on Parry Island to attend school regularly and pointed out the advantages of a good education. Mr. Moore, the School Inspector, next spoke and dwelt on the parents' importance of the children attending school regularly. They had row a fine school, a first class teacher in Miss Munro who was doing great improvement. Rev. Mr. Bunt was the next speaker and he was followed by Rev. Mr. Ireland. Chief Megis addressed the school both in Indian and English as did Rev. D. Menominee, the Indian Missionary and Mr. James Binnie. He recounted the fact that Mr. Ireland had been present at the opening of the old Skene school at the Lower Village, the Ryerson school just closed and now the new school. Mr. Ireland was asked to say a few words and he referred to the fact that he had been present at the opening of all three schools on Parry Island, and about thirty years ago he had named the school after the third Indian Superintendent, Captain Skene. The new school was erected by Mr. J. D. Ridgeway and was a very fine school of comfort and convenience. The proceedings closed by singing the National Anthem.\nD. L.

Since I have had charge of the school the attendance has been much larger than in former years.\n\nAs you know living has advanced very rapidly within the last two years, making five hundred dollars as a salary scarcely sufficient to cover the ordinary expenses.\n\nI would be very glad if you would consider a raise of fifty dollars for the next year.\nyours very sincerely\n\n(Miss) Frances Murray\nOttawa, November 21, 1916.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant applying for an increase in your salary as teacher of the Ryerson School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has decided to grant you an increase of $50.00, making your salary $550.00 per annum.

Hunt.\nExtract from Superintendent Logan's report on the Ryerson Day School for the month of February, 1917. Original on 153810/7.\n\nMiss Munt is a good teacher, but it seems to me she is getting tired of teaching the Indians and is having a lot of trouble with the parents. Some will not send their children because they say they do not like her.\n\nThe attendance is very poor. I have had the truant officer after them as the weather is getting better now.\nOttawa, March 9, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to that portion of your report on the Ryerson Day School for the month of February, last, in which you state that Miss Hunt is a good teacher, but that it seems to you she is getting tired of teaching the Indians and is having a lot of trouble with the parents I beg to say that the Department would like to have a full report from you in regard to the trouble this teacher is having with the parents.\n\nYou should inform the truant officer that he must see that all the children of school age attend school regularly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nAlex. Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR MOORE ON THE RYERSON DAY SCHOOL.\n\nTeacher,- Miss F. Munt.\n\nSuccess,- Miss Munt has done fairly well with the pupils that have attended regularly,\n\nGENERAL REMARKS,- Several of the Indians seem to have taken a dislike to the present teacher and are keeping their children at home. It might be well to try another teacher after summer holidays.\n\nDate, of Inspection,- March 20th, 1917.\nNumber of pupils present,- 6\nNumber of children of school age on reserve,- 30\nAverage attendance for 3 months,- 6.\nOttawa, April 19th, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nInspector Moore, who recently visited the Ryerson day school, reports that the teacher is not popular with the Indians and that is the reason for the small attendance.\n\nJudging from the small attendance, there seems to be something wrong, and the Department wishes you to report fully, as soon as possible, on the Ryerson school, stating your opinion in regard to the lack of progress. Kindly state, also, if you consider it would be advisable to make a change in the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nAlex. Logan, Esq.\nIndian Superintendent,\nDanny Sound, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to above letter I beg to report to you, that for some time past the teacher, Miss Munt, has been taking very little interest in the Indian children. She is \"out\" with all the Indian families and does not even visit or speak to the Indian missionary who lives only fifty yards from the school house. She is a very strong Baptist and comes to Parry Sound church and Sunday School every Sunday and is therefore of no help to the Indians in that way. She has a very comfortable school and dwelling and generally has some of her friends from Parry Sound staying with her. I am sure that her influence, as a teacher, is gone and the Department may as well let her go at once and advertise for a new teacher.\n\nI trust this may meet with your approval,\n\nI am Your Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Supt.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 7, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo in reply to official letter of the 19th ultimo, in which you state that you consider that it would be in the interests of the Indian children attending the Ryerson School to have a change of teachers.\n\nI have, therefore, to request that you will be good enough to notify Miss Munt that her services will not be required after the 30th of June, next.\n\nKindly communicate with Mr. Public School Inspector Moore with a view to obtaining the services of a qualified teacher to take charge of this school after the summer holidays. Any applications received should be forwarded to the Department, with full information as to the age, religion, qualifications, experience, etc., of the applicants. Should you not receive any applications by the end of the school year you may advertise for a teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nAlexander Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nNo. 1. Ferguson School,\nParys Island,\nMay 11, 1917\n\nTo the Secretary,\nIndian Dept., Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have just seen Mr. Logan, the Indian Agent and he showed me a letter from the department, at which I was surprised and also very much hurt, at the report Inspector Moore must have sent you of the condition of this school and my work. It is true I had a small school Jan. Feb. & March and I gave him the reasons for it. But the chief reason was the weather conditions. I had trouble with a couple of the Indians which also had some effect. I gave him these two reasons.\n\nAs soon as the weather and road were favourable, I visited the homes, and they told me, the weather had been so bad, these roads drifted, children tightly clad, they could not send them.\nNow, I did not intend writing to the Department. I do not want to hurt or make trouble, or injure anyone. But since reading your letter I feel I must write in defense of myself.\n\nLast Oct. James Walker and David S. Wing, two Indians of the Island, King is late teacher of the school. Truant officer and Policeman. Two old men as full of mischiefness as they are full of years. These men made up their minds they were going to turn the teacher out (as they called it) and get a Mr. Patridge who belongs to the island to take the school after him. They called a meeting, talked matters over, trying in every way to find a complaint. They asked the Chief to write to the Department, asking for a change of teacher. He told them he could not without a reason for my leaving. A certain first friend man friend of mine from Parry Sound, used to visit me. This James Walker said, \"Can't we say something about the teacher and this man who visits the teacher?\" So true and then they started a slander. As soon as I heard of it, I went to the Chief. He said he had nothing to do with it.\nThen he told me just what I have told you. I also had a talk with Mr. King and Mr. Logan, and told them both what I thought of their actions. They only infuriated them more than ever; since they have never ceased to undermine me and my work. I asked Mr. Logan about it, and asked if I should report them. He said no. The quietest way was the best. When Inspector Moore came to visit the school, I asked him the same question. He said the same as Mr. Logan. I would not have written now, only I felt as I said before I must defend myself.\n\nI would have left the school at once, had I been free to do so. As if these men had come to me as they should have done, and told me they would like a change, and given me time to get out. As it is, I had all my winter supplies in, also the furniture in the house belongs to me. You can see the offence & inconvenience. I never have been put to in leaving at that time. I told the Chief then I would leave at midsummer. I take Mr. Logan the same, also the Inspector, everyone on the island knows I am leaving them.\nand I am surprised you have not been informed of the same. When the Inspector was here he also advised me to leave.\n\nAt the end of June I send in my resignation to Mr Logan.\n\nMy school since Easter has been very good, you cannot get the children to attend regular. I have worked hard and faithful. I am satisfied in that I have done my duty. I have been here for three years and a half and a change will be just all round.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nFrances E. Meant.\n\nParry Sound,\nOnt.\nMay 17th.\nOttawa, May 11, 1917.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant resigning your position as teacher of the Ryerson Indian School, to take effect at the end of June, next.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your resignation is accepted and Mr. Superintendent Logan will be advised accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I go out to play with them so as to check them and my attendance goes up now as high as 58 with 43 on the...\nroll while the last teacher never had more than 28. But some men brought in some benches for the pupils to sit on until we can get more seats and they spoke in Indian. They brought them in while school was going on. I told one of them about it and then another one came in and made a big speech in Indian. I would like to know what power I have here at this school in reference to this can I order them out or I have got to sit down and let them run the school.\n\nI may say that why I want them to talk English around the school is to get them to understand it as that is why the children do not get along better at school.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Viola E. Watson,\nTeacher,\nRyerson Indian School,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nThere was no school in Ryerson Indian School Monday Feb 4 because the filth of the school was terrible. I myself had been sick on it for two days and a number of the children asked for it to be cleaned on Saturday Feb 2 but I had to close school for it then there was no wood to put in the furnace.\n\nAfter the caretaker had scrubbed the floor near touching blackboard, seats, woodwork or registers the odor of the school is as bad as ever. I certainly think it wants a thorough cleaning and disinfection. After he had gone I came into the school and found the had been interrupted by lack and certain things were missing. Some belonged to the children others to the school. Now if you are going to stand for this I am not because if I have to put up with this I will leave here and get another school. I want these things returned.\nDo you mean to say that since you will not put the telephone into my house that I have to pay to use it where it is? That is the case it seems to me because I was asked Sunday for ten cents to use the phone but I did not pay it as I did not get using the telephone. If the government is paying for it I have as much right to use it free as any person on the Island. One thing I know that I have done more for the people than any of the others but still they will not give me any accommodation for it. If I have to pay for using the telephone I think you had better get a new teacher for this school. I am willing to leave anytime if the things that were taken away at Nebi's return.\n\nI think it was about time you people were looking after affairs on Parry Island. The Indian Agent thinks the only perfect man on Parry Island is our caretaker who I think is a pure and simple man who knows nothing. Moreover you can't tell him anything all he thinks is getting someone to bully. The children would have a life of a dog if I did not stick up for them. If they don't put in a new caretaker who will take care of the school properly there will be an outbreak of sickness and I will be one of the...\nfirst to be sick.\n\nExpect my pay for Monday Feb. 4 as it was not through any fault of mine the school was closed.\n\nI would like to hear your opinion of this matter as soon as possible as something must be done right away because I cannot stand it. I may be sick by the time you get this letter.\n\nI am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nViola E. Watson\n\nP.S. This man is also constable and truant officer.\nOttawa, February 12, 1918.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant complaining about the condition of the Ryerson Indian school and also that you had to pay for using the telephone.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that inquiries are being made into the complaints made by you.\n\nIn reference to the use of the telephone, I beg to say that, if there was no extra charge for phoning to the person you wished to talk to, you should not have been called upon to pay ten cents for the use of the phone.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Viola E. Watson,\nTeacher,\nRyerson Indian School,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nOttawa, February 12, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a copy of a communication which has been received from Miss Viola E. Watson, teacher of the Ryerson Indian School, in which she makes complaints in regard to the condition of the school and also that things were taken from the school.\n\nThe Department would like to have a full report from you in regard to the matters complained of by Miss Watson.\n\nWhen this building is used for meetings of any kind the band should see that the school-room is properly cleaned after such meetings and before classes are again held in it and, if the work is done by the caretaker, he should receive extra remuneration from the band.\n\nIn reference to the use of the telephone, if there was no extra charge for phoning to the person Miss Watson wished to talk to, she should not have been called upon to pay ten cents for the use of the phone.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAlexander Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSecretary Dept Indian Affairs,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI would like a copy of the letter Mr. Logan sent you answering my complaints. I have got to take witnesses with me to his office now that I have found out that I cannot depend on him. My reasons are as follows. When I asked him the wages of the janitor that I had to report to Ottawa he told me $36. When I asked other questions, he said that he didn't know what they wanted to know for as he had told them (Ottawa). When he came out February 28th and asked if we knew how much he was getting as janitor and mother and I said $36. He said $30, the chief was also present. The janitor himself says $30. I would like to know why the difference, if your treasurer would look up and see which is correct and please let me know.\n\nOn February 28th he (Indian Agent) said that as far as he could see that the caretaker was the whole trouble and would try as mother\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6158, file 423-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nsuggested, we would do the caretaking (as we did anyway) and just hire a man to put in the wood and take out the ashes once a week. I went down to the furnace room one recess to fix the fire and there was the caretaker. He said something to me about a door to be kept shut (he has the key still) and I asked him why he was there as he was only supposed to come around once a week. Then he told me he was to look after the furnace. He said \"He would quit.\" Good-bye,\" I said. \"Good riddance.\" But he was back bright and early and every morning and has been ever since.\n\nI went up to see Mr. Logan Saturday with two witnesses and he denied saying the other but he said it before Mother and I. After the witnesses went out he said that he had no use for the chief, only he was chief. I told him that they said that I was in the wrong company. I am in the company of the children and the young people which has turned Indian Agent, Chief Maggie, Rev. Munroinee, Constable D.L. King and Councillor E. Tabahpinglong against me. I told the Indian agent that they were doing dirty, mean work on the Island and he wouldn't deny it.\n\nI would like to see one of you fellows down here for awhile to look into affairs. These head men see that I know things are not being handled right straight.\nand are trying to get rid of me for fear I show them up to you and the rest of the Indians.\n\nThey are trying to stop the children from coming to school by charging non-members. There are far more non-members than members. Out of 29 on the roll at the present time there are 7 members. When I had 48 on the roll in the fall there were 17 members which you see is very small compared to the non-members. I can safely say that the non-members take more interest in the school than the majority of the members.\n\nThe chief himself has a girl in his house cooking for him instead of coming to school. Councillor E. Tabahpingdong has 2 running the roads instead of coming to school.\n\nI feel I have done my duty in helping the children and the young people who have hitherto been kicked aside and sticking up for the right.\n\nExcuse me if I repeat three sayings which have been said to me by the young people. Last fall I was told \"You have been an improvement to Parry Island already and you will be more.\" Within the last month after Mr. Logan had been out and the children went home wild because they thought I was leaving, three men came up that night to see about it! When talking about it one boy said \"If you leave I won't come around here much, you are the only teacher who has...\"\ntaken any interest in us.\" Another was \"I don't\nleave the children all love you.\"\n\nAfter seeing the way the things are going on\nParry Island, it is no wonder we are at war at\nthe present time. I think unless we look after\nthings in Canada more, it will be brought home\na great deal more than it is at the present time\nabout the war.\n\nI have just heard that they are going to hold\na closed council to get rid of me. They are afraid\nto have it open as the larger majority is for\nme and especially the children, and young people.\nI would like to know what they are trying to\nprove against me. If anything against my\ncharacter, the boys here know what I am like\nand would like to know what they have\nagainst me.\n\nWhen your representative comes down don't\ngo to Mr. Logan first and get so filled up that he\ncannot see anything good points only the bad\nones, so we cannot talk to him as our\ninspector was on March 12th.\n\nI do not blame you for what has happened\npreviously as you acted by the Indian Agent\nthinking he was a man of principle. But now\nthat you have found out that he is not, I\nhope and expect you will do something for the\npoor Indians on Parry Island who have been suffering from the tyranny of these leading men but afraid to say anything on account of the consequences. Speaking from experience the children and young people are the makings of good men and women for their country if they get a chance and their better nature appealed to continually.\n\nThey are complaining about the school being small. I never went below 5 and my average is 12 or 13. You know as well as I that we have had the severest winter this year that we have had for years, then there has been a great deal of sickness. The leaders of the band have no children and don't take any interest in keeping the roads open in winter so the children can come to school, that is another reason why the school has been as small as it was. Then some did not have enough warm clothes.\n\nI do hope you will take action soon as I consider myself a true friend to the Indians on Parry Island and would like to see them get some encouragement.\n\nI am\n\n[Signature]\n\nYour student servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Young and active and loved deeply by her scholars. Logan, chief & councillors are a nuisance to us (meaning party still represent before you) and for the, would be so called, Indian advancement. The trouble is all through the neglect of the caretaker, truant and constable (a case of three in one) ignorant as to his duties of either one or the other. In his positions as constable, he deems himself as the maker of laws.\n\nWe would suggest that Mr. Constable be given a back seat and have nothing to do with the Parry Island Bands of Indians in any form or position. He is a non-treaty and besides that he is practically no good. He doesn't care children go to...\nschool or not same as the chief\nand councillors, because they have\nnone to attend same. So they don't care.\nThis will show in my report and\ninterview with you I mentioned\nsomething about this matter.\nI would corroborate the story of\nthe teacher.\n\nAnother suggestion I have in\nmind is that if you send a man\ndown here, not to pay too much\nattention to the afore mentioned\nauthorities or else stories of not\nmuch value will be told.\n\nThe majority of the people\nresidents of the Pauy Sallud\nReserve, whose children attend\nschool wish the present teacher\nto be retained, if any action\nor resolution is passed by the\nsaid Band's council if the\nsaid council is not defeated.\n\nThomas Mowayosh\n\nPauy Sallud\nOntario.\nOttawa, March 28, 1918.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant in reference to the teacher of the Ryerson Indian school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and secretary.\n\nMr. Thomas Medwayosh,\nParry Sound,\nOnt.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHon. Mr. Meighen -\n\nI am returning herewith the letter addressed by Miss Viola E. Watson to the Right Hon. The Prime Minister, together with a copy of a memorandum prepared by Mr. Benson in charge of the Schools Branch. My own opinion is that Miss Watson is not adapted for Indian school-work, and I think it would be in the interest of all concerned if she would resign.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\n\nApril 2nd, 1918.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,-\n\nWith reference to the letter addressed to the Prime Minister by Miss Watson, teacher of the Ryerson School on Parry Island, I beg to say that Miss Watson, who took charge of this school on September 11th, last, is the holder of a limited Third Class Certificate for Ontario and has had two years experience in teaching. She is twenty-one years old and is allowed a salary at the rate of $550.00 per annum, with a teacher's residence provided.\n\nMr. J. L. Moore, Public School Inspector, who visited the school on the 30th of November, last, reported that \"Miss Watson has been very successful for the short time she has been in this school and deserves great credit for the way in which she has induced the children to attend school.\"\n\nApparently she made a good start, as the Agent also reported that when he visited the school on the 11th of October he found everything very satisfactory and a good attendance, and he recommended that more seats be purchased.\nOn the 12th of December she applied for an increase of salary, but she was informed that the Department regretted that it was unable to comply with her request, as, owing to the war, the funds at its disposal were limited.\n\nOn the 5th of February Miss Watson wrote the Department complaining that the caretaker was neglecting his duties and expressing her views pretty freely about affairs on Parry Island. She accused the caretaker of stealing things out of the school and said that, if the Department was willing to put up with this state of affairs, she was not and she would have to leave and get another school.\n\nShe also brought up the matter of the use of the telephone and complained that she had been asked to pay ten cents for the use of it. A copy of her letter was sent to the Agent, who was asked for a report.\n\nShe wrote again on February 13th, renewing her complaints against the caretaker and also found fault with the Agent, Chief and Missionary. In this letter she says that, \"I cannot tell you in plain enough language what he (the caretaker) is like. You certainly would not like to hear them from a girl, the words that it takes to say what he is like. The Indian Agent has the gaul to tell me to put up with a man like this but I have had hell on earth long enough caused by him. You will certainly agree with me that this is not a fit place for a girl with people like this at the head. As I have said.\"\nsaid before and which I will stick to, that if something is not done soon they will have to get a new teacher for the Ryerson Indian School, Parry Island.\n\nOn the 11th of March, the Agent, in reply to the Department's request for a report on Miss Watson's complaints, wrote saying that he was very much disappointed in Miss Watson, as he was under the impression that she was going to make a good teacher and that she would get along well with the Indians, especially as she had her mother keeping house for her. He stated that no meetings were held in the school-house of any kind and as for the use of the telephone, there is no charge for her or any members of the band for local calls. In reference to her complaints regarding the cleaning of the school he states that he interviewd the caretaker and the missionary and they say that on the Saturday complained of it was Nomination Day, they also had a funeral that day and, as it was very cold, they decided to leave the scrubbing of the school until the Monday afternoon. When Miss Watson decided not to open school on Monday morning they scrubbed it out in the morning, and the caretaker had his wife and another Indian woman to help and they cleaned all they thought was right for them to clean. The caretaker denied stealing\nstealing anything from the school. The Agent states that the caretaker is a respectable Indian, about sixty-five years of age and he and his wife are both above the average Parry Island Indian. He receives $20.00 a year for looking after the school. He looks after the furnace, sweeps out the school and scrubs it out two or three times a year. He says he paid the woman who helped his wife to scrub $2.00 and yet this teacher has so much to say about him. She would not allow him to heat the water for scrubbing in her kitchen and so he had to make a fire outside. The Agent says that she is getting in wrong with the Indians, first accusing the missionary of pocketing receipts from the telephone and now accusing the caretaker of stealing out of the school.\n\nThe Agent states that he has done all he can to make it pleasant for her, but she has no control or discipline over the children and they are doing pretty much as they like around the school, breaking windows, etc.\n\nThe teacher does not wish the caretaker around the school at all and she is asking for the keys of the basement and the Agent says that he cannot see any chance of fixing things up with her and that she is making trouble among the Indians and taking sides with a certain troublesome faction.\n\nShe asked for a copy of the Agent's report, which was not sent her.\nThe Agent enclosed a letter from the Chief, in which he states that he is sorry to learn that the teacher has refused to allow the caretaker to do his work. The Chief says the caretaker is a good man and does more work than he should do. He also says that the teacher is making trouble and that he thinks the best thing to do is to discharge her.\n\nJudging from the many long letters which Miss Watson has written the Department it is doubtful whether she will ever make a success of this school, as she does not appear to be willing to adapt herself to her surroundings. Her letters are badly expressed and indiscreet in terms. It would be to the advantage of all concerned if she would act on the suggestion conveyed to her in the Department's letter of the 19th ultimo, which was to send in her resignation if she was not satisfied with the conditions at the Ryerson School.\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR MOORE ON THE RYERSON DAY SCHOOL.\n\nMiss Watson hasn't been as successful as I had anticipated when I visited the school last term. She evidently hasn't thrown sufficient energy into her work.\n\nThe general management of this school isn't quite as satisfactory as it was last term. I also regret to find such a falling off in the attendance. The teacher seems to think that the attendance during the coming term will again reach the high standard of last term. However, unless there is a decided improvement in these respects before the end of June, I should recommend a change of teacher after vacation.\n\nDate of Inspection\u2014March 12th, 1916.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been thinking for some time about asking you to give us a larger piece of ground for the Ryerson School. Now that we are asked to produce more I know that if we could help in this.\n\nI asked the children this morning if they would like to work a piece of ground of their own and they are all quite willing. So if you will do your part in trying to get us more ground as near the school as possible, I will try to keep the children aroused to do their best in working it. I would like to see them given prizes at the fall fair on Parry Island. I am willing to do my part if you will cooperate with us.\n\nIf you will do this I would like the seeds as soon as possible and please send them to my address as I cannot get across to Parry Sound very well at\nthe present time so you will oblige me very much.\n\nMy plans were for the 2nd class to work at beets, carrots, onions and a couple of plants of tomatoes, potatoes or cabbage. There are 90210 for that class.\n\nFor the 1st class less of the small vegetables and more of the larger ones. There will be 10 in that class.\n\nThen for the primary class there might be 8 or 10 that could handle potatoes and tomatoes and beans.\n\nIf you would also either get window boxes made or give me permission to try at the store to get such boxes so we could have one for each window that all the children will help to make these look pretty. There are 5 windows in the school and 5 in the house.

Watson her services be discontinued from the Ryerson School on Parry Island reserve. Our feelings have been very much hurt indeed by accusing all the officials connected with the Indian Department, that is the Indian superintendent, the Chief of the Band, Constable and caretaker of the school and the residing missionary are the ones she is accusing. There is no sufficient or no reason at all, if she was looking after her own affairs she would not find fault with the officers who are doing their best to please her and make a success of her school. Instead of that she is more associating of those who are raising friction in the community. She is very careless in our school room, the children breaking things quite often slates and other things; she is bound to have her own way without regarding the officials advice. She is more entertainer than a teacher, we want a teacher that can teach. Just to prove what she is and said about her intentions, on Sunday afternoon in the presence of the Sunday school scholars she remarked said by her that the school opens on Monday April 8th., she was telling the children to come to school then, she went on speaking and said \"You may have heard that I am going to quit teaching by giving in my resignation, but I am not going to quit, the Chief and constable have to leave first before I do\" and then again was heard by making a remark it was the time she met the ex-councillor Philip Menomenee, \"that the Chief and the constable have them arrested before I go\". Gentlemen, what do you\ncontinued.\n\nSir,\n\nthink of these expressions made by our present teacher. Therefore we do not think that she is not a proper person to hire to teach at any school in our country. We do beg of you to use your influence and the Indian Department that the present teacher be removed from our reserve to some other locality. There is sufficient grounds to do it, with the Indian Superintendent's consideration the longer she stays the more harm she will do.\n\nSigned,\n\nPeter Megis, Chief.\nDavid Menomenee, Secy.\nOttawa, April 22, 1918.\n\nMadam,\n\nI beg to inform you that your services as teacher of the Ryerson Indian Day School on the Parry Island Reserve will not be required after the end of the current quarter, the 30th of June, next, and Mr. Superintendent Logan will be instructed to take over the premises after that date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Viola E. Watson,\nTeacher,\nRyerson Indian School,\nDepot Harbour, Ont.\nOttawa, April 22, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Department has notified Miss Viola E. Watson, that her services as teacher of the Ryerson Indian Day School on the Parry Island Reserve will not be required after the end of the current quarter, the 30th of June, next.

That we feel she is the first teacher we ever had who has taken any real interest in us and our children and in trying to help us in every way possible;\n\n4. That we believe if she is urged to stay she will be willing to do so for our sakes.\n\n5. We therefore humbly pray that you communicate with Miss Watson, setting out our desires that she remain with us, and asking her to retain the position she now holds.\n\nAnd your Petitioners as in duty bound will EVER PRAY:\n\nDATED at Parry Island this Seventh day of May, A.D. 1918.\n\n| Name                  | Name                  |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| James Peter           | Walker Andrew         |\n| James Peter Mrs       | Walker Andrew Mrs     |\n| James Mary            | Walker James W.V      |\n| James Eva             | Walker Ruby           |\n| James Martha          | Madwayosk Thomas      |\n| Sanibah Charles       | Madwayosk Thomas      |\n| Manitouwaba Louis     | Madwayosk Thomas      |\n| Walker James          | Madwayosk Thomas      |\n| Walker Jas Mrs        | Madwayosk Thomas      |\n| Miller John           | Judge Jacob           |\n| Miller John Mrs       | Judge Jacob           |\n| Miller James          | Judge Lizzie          |\n| Miller Johnnie        | Judge Mary            |\n| Manitouwaba Stanley   | Judge Edward          |\n| Manitouwaba S.

The Department considers that it would be giving Miss Harris very brief notice to dismiss her at the end of the present quarter and it might not be possible to secure a successor at the present time. The Department is prepared to pay an increased salary over that allowed Miss Harris in the event of a qualified teacher being secured.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. Le Moore, Esq., B.A.,\nPublic School Inspector,\nPerry Sound, Ont.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nYour kind offer of help is bringing a speedy response.\n\nIn visiting Parry Island I found a rather bad condition. It seems that the mission house is not in good condition and the Rev. Mr. Black went to live with a Mrs. Thos. C. Salt, son of one of our deceased missionaries and an old friend of theirs. Some 9 years ago Mr. Salt's wife left him and she is living with another man at Alberville. I am assured that Mr. Salt has done all in his power to secure her return.\n\nSome evil minded persons have started talk about Mr. Salt and Mr. Black which has gradually worked up to the point of a scandal. They have recently travelled across to Parry Sound together frequently when going shopping etc., but never in any clandestine way without Mr. Black's knowledge.\n\nI have stayed here 3 days going into this matter thoroughly. I have had them before the Indian Agent, Mr. Logan, the Chairman of the District, Rev. Dr. Smith,\nthe Police Magistrate Mr. Moore and the Quarterly Official Board. I cannot find any foundation for the scandal excepting in gossip and believe I am correct in saying that nothing wrong has been done.\n\nHowever, I think some change is necessary so that the tongue of the slanderer may be effectively stopped for it has started toward condemning Miss Harris who is living alone at the residence attached to the School. As the Mission House must have extensive repairs I have suggested that Miss Harris take Mr. Black into the School Residence for the time being. She is delighted with the idea as it will make life bearable for her. Mr. Logan has given me his consent for her. Mr. Logan has given me his consent that I present the matter to you. Mr. Black and Miss Harris are close friends anyway.\n\nI heartily recommend this course and hope that you will see your way clear to give your authority to have the arrangement made.\n\nKindest regards.\n\nIf you write me send letter to Calgary. I think it might be well to write Miss Harris' party sound direct.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nArthur Barner\nDecember 16, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Barnet,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 6th instant,\nI may say that I do not see any objection to having Mr. and Mrs.\nBlack live with Miss Harris at the school residence.\n\nI would rather that you should write to Miss\nHarris on this subject, as I do not wish to become involved\nin any correspondence that might arise with regard to the\nlittle local misunderstandings to which you refer in your\nletter, and which I do not regard as of very much consequence\nin view of your explanations and comments with respect thereto.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

Original on 153810-6\n\nMiss Harris seems to take very little interest in her work. No doubt this is one of the causes for the poor attendance.\n\nJ. L. Moore,\nInsp.\nOttawa, May 27, 1920.\n\nMadam,\n\nI beg to inform you that the report of the Public School Inspector who recently visited the Ryerson Indian Day School has been received by the Department. The report states that your services are not satisfactory and that you seem to take very little interest in the work. The Inspector attributes your lack of interest in the work as one of the causes for the poor attendance. Your academic qualifications are too limited to successfully teach the school.\n\nIn view of the above, I have, therefore, to inform you that your services will not be required after the end of the present school year, June 30th, next. You should prepare a return on the forms for that purpose, showing the attendance, days taught, etc., and forward it to Mr. Superintendent Logan for transmission to the Department, in order that the amount of salary due can be paid you. Mr. Logan is being informed that your services are being dispensed with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. D. McLean\nAsst.

Moore, Public School Inspector, in his recent report of inspection of the Ryerson Indian Day School, states that the services of the present teacher, Miss Harris, are not satisfactory and that she has not proved capable of teaching this school. She seems to take very little interest in her work, and, no doubt, this is one of the causes of the poor attendance.\n\nThe Department is today informing Miss Harris that her services will not be required after the end of the present school year, namely, June 30th, next. She is being requested to prepare her quarterly return of attendance, days taught, etc., and forward it to you for transmission to the Department, in order that the amount of salary due her can be paid when her services terminate.\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to endeavour to secure the services of a qualified teacher for this school, to take up duties upon the re-opening of the school after the summer holidays. In the event of a qualified teacher being secured the Department will be prepared to pay an increased salary over that allowed to Miss Harris. The name, age and qualifications of any applicants received by you should be submitted for the consideration of the Department. You will be good enough to bear this matter in mind and do your best to secure a qualified teacher in time to re-open this school after the holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAlexander Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\n\nT. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report to you that Parry Island School is closed. Miss Harris has been very careless lately and did not appear at school from May 28th until June 7th, some of the children going each day but no teacher.\n\nI phoned Mr. Moore, the Inspector who suggested closing the school. I told the caretaker to tell Miss Harris to call and see me before opening the school again but she has never called. She went home, some sixteen miles from here but sent her report about June 12th. I do not think she is entitled to salary for the month of June.\n\nI am Your Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Supt.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 18, 1920\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, together with the return of attendance, days taught, etc., of Miss Harris, teacher of the Ryerson School, covering the period which she taught during the current quarter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is noted that Miss Harris did not teach after the 7th instant.\n\nMiss Harris began duties on September 5th, 1919, and is allowed payment for a total of 173 days, as follows:- September quarter 17 days, December quarter 57 days, March quarter 64 days and June quarter 35 days. She receives a salary at the rate of $600.00 per annum and is, therefore, entitled to be paid 173/200 of that amount, or a total of $519.00. She has already received $351.00 and the sum of $168.00 is now due her to complete her salary for the period she taught. A cheque for this amount is being sent.\n\nI beg to refer you to official letter of the 27th of May, last, in which you were informed that the services of Miss Harris would not be further required and requested to endeavour to secure the services of a qualified teacher to begin duties after the summer holidays. I have, therefore, to request that you will be good enough to endeavour to secure a qualified teacher for this school and the name, age and qualifications of any applicants should be submitted for the consideration of the Department. Kindly give this matter your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAlexander Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, June 26, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant enclosing the resignation of Mrs. L. Wilson as teacher of the Shawanaga Indian Day School, to take effect on the 30th instant.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that her resignation as teacher of this school is accepted. The Department is sorry to lose her services and approves of the suggestion made by you that she be offered the position as teacher in the Ryerson School, Parry Island. If she accepts the Department will allow her the same salary as was paid her at Shawanaga, namely, $700.00 per annum, and the bonus during the present fiscal year at the rate of $150.00 per annum. You will be good enough to consult Mrs. Wilson and ascertain from her whether she would be prepared to accept the Ryerson School and inform the Department as to her decision.\n\nIt will be necessary to obtain a teacher for the Shawanaga School, to begin duties after the summer holidays, and you should make inquiry with a view to obtaining the services of a teacher. The name, age, qualifications and experience of any applicants received by you should be submitted to the Department for consideration. For a qualified teacher for the Shawanaga School the Department would be prepared to pay the same salary as was allowed Mrs. Wilson.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAlexander Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMrs. Nellie L. Wilson, who was appointed teacher of the Shawanaga Indian Day School, at a salary of $700.00 per annum and bonus, beginning duty on the 16th of February last, has sent in her resignation to take effect on the 30th instant. Her reason for resigning is that the place is too lonely.\n\nA teacher will be required after the summer holidays at Ryerson, Parry Island, and Mr. Superintendent Logan suggests that Mrs. Wilson be transferred there and, if so, he requests to be informed as to what salary the Department would be prepared to pay her. At the present time she is in receipt of $700.00, which is entirely paid from band funds. The teacher at the Ryerson School only receives $600.00, $300.00 of which is paid from band funds and $300.00 from vote.\n\nI would beg to recommend that Mrs. Wilson be offered the position at the Ryerson School at the same salary as is paid her at Shawanaga and that the extra amount required be provided from the school vote. She has a limited third class certificate, is a widow with two children, and the Inspector states that the pupils have made splendid progress since she took charge. He also states that he found a decided improvement in the general management of the school (Shawanaga) and that he considers Mrs. Wilson a very capable teacher, the attendance having increased considerably since his visit last fall. I think we should endeavour to retain Mrs. Wilson's services and that she be offered the Ryerson School at $700.00 and the bonus.\nSEND the following NIGHT LETTER subject to the terms printed on the back hereof, which are hereby agreed to.\n\nOttawa, July 5, 1920.\n\nAlexander Logan,\nIndian Superintendent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\n\nDepartment will allow Mrs. Wilson eight hundred dollars and bonus as teacher at Ryerson.\n\nJ.

You will be good enough to receive her acceptance of the above offer and forward it to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nAlexander Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nDear Mr. Logan:\n\nI received your wire at Midland on Mon. evening, and was very glad to know that my application was accepted, also that only luggage is in the school. I will send you a cheque for the charges.\n\nI beg to acknowledge cheque for $199.50 on my salary for last term. The Dept. has made a serious mistake, unless they intend forwarding the H.C.L. Bonus later. They are owed $50 short on my salary. I figure it at $85 per month for the 6 teaching months, which allows me my share of the money for holidays. This is the way I have always been paid in other schools and that brings my salary to $255 for the quarter. I won't accept any other settlement from them so you may forward this letter to the Dept. It is bad enough to teach in an Indian School, without being cut short on pay-day.\nI won't be very likely to recommend any of my friends to take Shawanaga school, if this is how the Department pays us off.\n\nI am sorry to trouble you with this, Mr. Logan, but really I was very angry when I received that cheque. Not I have spent $258 since I came to Shawanaga, without any expense for clothing, and have received only $289 for my work.\n\nIf you wish to communicate with me during holidays, you may address to Kinmount. My mail will be forwarded from there. Thanking you for your kindness,\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nNellie L. Wilson.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to above I beg to report that I wired Mrs. Wilson on Monday and wrote her on Tuesday 6th enclosing her cheque and requested her to write me accepting school if satisfied. I received the enclosed letter from her which you might explain after which I have no doubt Mrs. Wilson will accept the Parry Island school.\n\nI am Your Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Wilson as teacher of the Ryerson Indian Day School and enclosing a communication from her regarding the salary she received for her services during the period which she taught the Shawanaga Indian Day School.\n\nWith reference to her salary I beg to say that she began duties at this school on March 1st, 1920 at a salary at the rate of $700.00 per annum. Teachers are required to teach two hundred days in each year, in order to draw their full salary. The return received from her for the March quarter showed that she taught twenty-two days during the month of March, for which she was paid $22/200 of her salary of $700.00, or $19.50. The return for the June quarter shows that she taught fifty-four days during that quarter and she was allowed three holidays \u2014 one day on account of having dental work done and two days on account of illness, a total of fifty-seven days, for which she was paid $57/200 of her salary of $700.00, or $199.50. She was paid the bonus for one month in the March quarter, $12.50, and for three months in the June quarter, $37.50. The bonus is payable to teachers of Indian day schools at the rate of $150.00 per annum. You will, therefore, see that Mrs. Wilson has been paid in full for the service which she rendered at the Shawanaga Day School and that there is no further balance of salary due. In making payment annual holidays are not taken into account, and, as stated above, the payment of salary is based on the number of days the school is open. A copy of the Indian Day School Regulations is enclosed herewith and from it you will see the method adopted in computing salaries for broken periods.\n\nYou will be good enough to explain this matter to Mrs. Wilson. She has received salary and bonus of $326.50 for the 79 days she taught this school.\n\nIt is hoped that she will accept the position as teacher of the Ryerson School, to begin duties after the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Enclosed please find resignation.\n\nI have to state that I am pleased to accept this resignation. From conversation with Inspector Moore and personal observation, I have come to the conclusion that a local teacher is not suitable for this school. The reason for me coming to this conclusion is that they have the idea that they know the Indian bent of mind, and it is a case of familiarity breeding contempt. I wrote to the Department about this matter before and I have come to the conclusion that a teacher from a long distance away is the best for this school.\n\nI am endeavouring to get Miss Fulcher, who was at Gibson Reserve. Miss Fulcher is a very fine type of teacher. I may not be able to get her but there are two other qualified teachers whom she has recommended. In case I cannot get any of these teachers, would the Department please let me know if there are any protestant teachers available around Ottawa.\n\nThis school was in first-class condition when Miss Smilie resigned from the school to look after the Agent. I am sorry to say that the school has not done so well, and I believe the reason is because it is a local teacher.\n\nI am getting into communication with Mr. Casselman, and Miss Fulcher. I will advise the Department when I am able to get a teacher. Please reply if you have any qualified\nteacher who would be suitable for this school.\n\nThe accommodation is first class here, and it is a good position for a conscientious teacher who delights in her work.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJMD/EK.\nEnclosure\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, December 5, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, enclosing the resignation of Miss Ida McFarland, teacher of the Ryerson Indian Day School, to take effect at the end of the present month. The resignation of Miss McFarland is accepted, and you should see that she prepares the usual quarterly returns of attendance, etc., and forwards them through your office.\n\nThe department has no suitable qualified teacher in view for this school, and I have to request that you will continue your efforts to obtain a teacher. It is noted that you have communicated with Mr. Casselman, Principal of the North Bay Normal School, and with Miss Fulcher, former teacher at the Gibson School, and it is hoped that you will be successful in obtaining the services of a properly qualified teacher in due time to begin duties when the school reopens after the coming Christmas holidays. Please submit for the approval of the Department the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher whom you recommend be appointed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOn the James Bay, away up in the far north, there is a Hudson's Bay Post where the Indians come to trade for furs and get in return, flour, tea, sugar and all the other things they need to live on. At this Post there was a very tiny girl whose name was Emily and whose Father and Mother had died when she was left alone with her Grandmother. This little girl was an Indian girl, and her grandmother loved her, and as she sat in the long winter nights, she thought how lonely she would be this winter, and she pondered over what heartache would happen to her if, when she grew up, she would have to go out on the trap lines and have to bear the cold. So she said, away deep down in her heart, \"I won't let her.\"\n\nWhen the sun was shining in the summer, and little Emily was running about trying to catch the sunshine shining in at the cabin door, her grandmother used to say, \"What a sweet child. How can I part with her?\" because by this time she had made up her mind to send her away to the Indian Residential School, away at Chapleau, on the C.P.R. But first of all, she had to get the consent of the uncles of Emily, who also loved her very much and delighted to see her playing around. They did not want her to be sent away, but her grandmother spoke to them, and told them if they loved her they would not want her to brought up to go away from them. So they said yes, and so it was for six days, they paddled, and came to Chapleau and Emily was taken to the school.\n\nShe felt very lonely for her grandmother at first, but after a while she played with the other children who were older than she was all the time she thought about her grandmother and her uncles at Hudson Bay. Then one day a new Missionary came to take charge of Chapleau School, the Rev. Mr. Gibson and his wife. Mrs. Gibson was a big man, ever six feet tall, and he came away up in the North West Territory. When he looked at Emily his heart went out to her she looked so small, and he talked to Mrs. Gibson about her and Mrs. Gibson loved her and made her the same as one of the family. So the time went on, and it came around to Christmas time, and everybody was glad and busy getting ready for Christmas and the Christmas Tree. The children were practicing Christmas songs and everybody was talking about Santa Claus, and why Emily was wondering what it was all about. The older teachers told her about it, and Mrs. Gibson told her that if she was a good girl, Santa Claus would bring her a doll because Mrs. Gibson had written a letter telling Santa Claus how someone was for her grandmother and asked him to bring her a doll the next day which was Christmas. Well, some of the children could hardly sleep that night to see Santa Claus, but Emily lay awake for a long time, and at last fell asleep. In the morning she woke with everybody laughing and all the children clapping their hands, and being very happy. Mrs. Gibson brought Emily in her nightie, and Mr. Gibson himself came over to her and said, \"Santa Claus has a doll for you Emily,\" and sure enough there was a doll given with a red dress and she was very happy. She cuddled into the arms of Mrs. Gibson and cuddled her doll and was ever so happy.\n\nAfter that Emily was happy at the school at Chapleau and attended to her lessons. Sometimes they were very hard and she thought what's the use of trying, and then Mrs. Gibson would come to her and tell her that if she wanted to be a smart girl she must study hard. She would tell her about Pauline Johnson the Indian girl who became a great poetess herself, \"I will try hard and do the best I can.\" Emily got on well with her lessons and it came to pass after a few months Emily was the smartest girl at her lessons in all the Chapleau School.\n\nIt was about this time that Emily had a dream, and in her dream she saw Santa Claus driving in his sleigh with six reindeer and he was in a hurry. She thought in her dream that she was on an Island and that she was the teacher, and that she was busy teaching them to ski. She was a skier who along in her father, and when her to buy brought I were a lot of it, and Clinton learn her that she y day just if Just then it was all dream side her a wee am side, \"Yo you will. I Gibson, an would try. At last, try her e then had in Chapleau School, and he th girl, and she got the Hig she pass and was.

There is a furnished teacher's residence attached to the school building, which will be quite suitable for a married man with one child. The local Indian Agent is Mr. J. M.

Mr. Bolton is a 28 year old Irishman, is married and has one 2 year old child. He expects to reach Parry Sound during the week prior to the opening of school on September first and, of course, will report to your office. You will please give him every possible help as he commences his new duties. Mr. Bolton has no Canadian professional qualifications, but his training at Queen's University, Belfast, and general experience have, I believe, fitted him for this post. He is very highly recommended by those who know him in Ottawa. He came to Canada in 1926 and three years ago married an Ottawa girl.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. M.

The Chief is in favour of this and he thinks that, if an example or two were made, it would have a good effect.\n\nHe feels quite satisfied that Mr. Bolton is doing good work. He is well liked by the Band.\nThis certifies that Mr. Diamond Balton is suffering from a severe inflammation in his eyes and is unable to carry on his duties as teacher in the Ryerson Indian day school on Parry Island.

Daly, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to make application for the position of teacher at the Ryerson Indian Day School, Parry Island; where I have taught for the last three years.\n\nI have raised the standard of daily attendance and have had a pupil pass the entrance examination, which is I believe the first one to pass from this school.\n\nI was unable to answer your letter sooner as I was away from home and did not receive my mail.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nDesmond Bolton.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nEnclosed please find application for position as teacher for the Ryerson Indian Day School, by the present school teacher, Desmond Bolton.\n\nWould the Department please note what Mr. Bolton states re one of his pupils passing the entrance examination. This is the second time this pupil has tried. In connection with this I have to state that at the Depot Harbour School where there are nineteen Indian children attending, there were three pupils passed their entrance without trying the examination, and one of these Indian pupils had the highest marks of any pupil in the school.\n\nI would suggest to the Department that they discuss Mr. Bolton's application to continue to teach with Mr. McGookin, Inspector of Indian Agencies. Mr. Bolton seems to have a pretty fair opinion of himself. I am sorry to state that neither the Indians nor myself have such a good opinion of him as a teacher, and the fact that three pupils have passed the entrance without trying the examination goes to show that it is possible to teach these children a lot better at the Ryerson School than is being done at the present time.\n\nWhen Mr. Bolton was sent here by the late Mr. Ferrier, it was because he was out of a position and to help him tide over the depression. We found it necessary when Mr. Bolton came here to have him go to the public schools here to get in touch with the method of teaching. The Inspector of Schools in this District Mr. Moore informs me that in his opinion he will never make a teacher.\nWhen one considers the number of qualified teachers who are looking for schools it is just too bad that we cannot get some of them to teach in the Ryerson Indian Day School.\n\nI know that the Department states it is customary for the teachers to continue if they have been found satisfactory. This is a situation where the Department and the Agent should co-operate for the well being of the children of the Reserve.\n\nI would appreciate the co-operation of the Department in seeing that we get a qualified teacher for the Ryerson Indian Day School, at the earliest convenience of the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJMD/EK.\nAgent.\nOttawa, August 7, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to Mr. Desmond Bolton, teacher of the Ryerson Indian Day School. The question of dispensing with this man's services should have been brought to the attention of the Department in May or early in June. Please inform him that he may continue in charge of this school until Christmas. If you consider it advisable, you should again write the Department about the first of November, and further consideration will be given to dispensing with his services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound,\nOnt.\nSir:\n\nReplying to yours of August 7th, 22-3-1, re Mr. Desmond Bolton, teacher of the Ryerson Indian Day School, and the question of dispensing with his services. In your letter you ask me to write to you around the first of November, I have been very busy here, but at the same time I was keeping this particular item in mind, but owing to the condition of affairs here I thought it would be all right to write at the first opportunity.\n\nI had a conversation with the Inspector of Public Schools here re Mr. Bolton, and he is convinced that he will never make a school teacher. So far as I am concerned, he was only here one month when I knew that he would never be suitable for an Indian School in this section of the country. It takes a school teacher here on Parry Island to devote all his time to the teaching and any spare time he has, if he feels inclined, he could quite well put it in by talking to the parents about the advantages of education for the children. At the present time he is engaged in the Boy Scout Work. The sad part about it is that he is a married man with one child and rather a likeable fellow - outside of being a school teacher, and when I read him the letter from the Department he asked me if I would try and arrange for him to be kept on until the end of the June quarter.\n\nHe cannot do much more harm than he has done to the school, and owing to him being a married man with a wife and child, and owing to the almost impossibility of him getting a position at the present time I would suggest to the Department\nthat he be allowed to remain until the end of the June Quarter, and that he would be advised to that effect by the Department through this office and also be advised that after the end of the June Quarter his services will be no longer required. I am very sorry for Mr. Bolton, but his idea of teaching in Canada will never be a success. He was never cut out for a teacher and when the respected Mr. Farrier wrote and told me to do the best I could for him as he was up against it, I did so to the best of my ability, but my actions were misconstrued by Mr. Bolton. I arranged with the Department and with the Inspector of Public Schools here that he would get a few days visiting the schools and trying to catch on, and I am sorry to say that when he was through with this experience he did not have very much use for the teaching in this country. Mr. Bolton is quite well pleased with himself. His endeavours with the boy scout movement were about as successful as his teaching in the school.\n\nI trust the Department will allow him to remain until the end of the June term when he would be better able to get a position, but that he be advised by a letter from the Department to this office, that his services after the June quarter will be no longer required.\n\nThe consideration of the Department in this matter will be appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJMD/EK.\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, November 23rd, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your T-5892 of the 20th instant, with reference to Mr. Desmond Bolton, teacher of the Ryerson Indian Day School.\n\nThe information contained in your letter has been carefully considered and it has been decided to allow Mr. Bolton to remain in charge of this school until the end of June, next.\n\nIn view of the large number of qualified teachers who are now available, it is considered that it should be possible to improve the teaching services at the Ryerson School and you should inform Mr. Bolton that it is unlikely that the Department would be able to retain his services after June 30th, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Daly, Indian Agent, Parry Sound, requests the Department to dispense with the services of Mr. Desmond Bolton, teacher of the Ryerson Indian Day School, on the Parry Island Reserve, No. 16, Federal District of Parry Sound. Mr. Bolton was appointed to the position as from September 1, 1931, with salary at the rate of $85 a teaching month. He has no Canadian professional qualifications but is a graduate of Queen's University, Belfast, Ireland.\n\nMr. Agent Daly reports that Mr. Bolton is obtaining very little success in the classroom work at this school. He states that Mr. Bolton is adverse to accepting suggestions for improved teaching methods and he feels that it would be in the best interests of this school to engage a professionally qualified teacher as from September 1, 1935, the beginning of the next school year.\n\nThe reports submitted by the Public School Inspector are very brief, but he states that in some subjects of the curriculum the work is fair.\n\nMr. Bolton is a married man with one child. He has assisted with the church work on the reserve and has also been interested in boy scout work.\n\nI would recommend, in the interests of the education of the pupils in the classroom, that the services of Mr. Bolton be dispensed with at the end of the present school year and the services of a fully qualified teacher be secured for the next school year. If you concur, I will bring this matter to your attention in due time, with a view to the appointment of a teacher.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMay 21, 1935.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,-\n\nI beg to refer to my memorandum dated March 26th, last, with reference to dispensing with the services of Mr. Desmond Bolton, teacher of the Ryerson Indian Day School, on the Parry Island Reserve, No. 16, Federal District of Parry Sound, Ont.\n\nI should be pleased to have your instructions in the matter, in order that due notice can be given Mr. Bolton if it is intended to dispense with his services.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n376 Pembroke St., West\nPembroke, Ont.\nMay 25, 1925.\n\nMr. J.D.

Kenning,\nPembroke, Ont.\nOttawa, May 27th, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, applying for the position as teacher, for the coming school year, in the Parry Island (Ryerson) Indian Day School, and stating the qualifications and experience which you possess.\n\nAs I informed you during your recent visit, it has not yet been definitely decided if the present teacher will be giving up duties. I may say that the matter is now before the Honourable the Minister for his decision. Should there be a vacancy, your application will be placed before him, as it is necessary that he approve all appointments. I can hold out no definite assurance, however, that you would be the applicant selected for the position should a vacancy occur.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nD. G. Kenning, Esq.,\n376 Pembroke St. W.,\nPembroke, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General.\n\nMr. John M. Daly, Indian Agent, Parry Sound, requests the Department to dispense with the services of Mr. Desmond Bolton, teacher of the Ryerson Indian Day School, on the Parry Island Reserve, No. 16, Federal District of Parry Sound. Mr. Bolton was appointed to the position as from September 1, 1931, with salary at the rate of $55 a teaching month. He has no Canadian professional qualifications but is a graduate of Queen's University, Belfast, Ireland.\n\nMr. Agent Daly reports that Mr. Bolton is obtaining very little success in the classroom work at this school. He states that Mr. Bolton is adverse to accepting suggestions for improved teaching methods and he feels that it would be in the best interests of this school to engage a professionally qualified teacher as from September 1, 1935, the beginning of the next school year.\n\nThe reports submitted by the Public School Inspector are very brief, but he states that in some subjects of the curriculum the work is fair.\n\nMr. Bolton is a married man with one child. He has assisted with the church work on the reserve and has also been interested in boy scout work.\n\nI would recommend, in the interests of the education of the pupils in the classroom, that the services of Mr. Bolton be dispensed with at the end of the present school year and the services of a fully qualified teacher be secured for the next school year. If you concur, I will bring this matter to your attention in due time, with a view to the appointment of a teacher.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMinister's Office\n\nJune 3, 1935.\n\nDr. McGill:\n\nRe the attached memorandum concerning the teacher of the Ryerson Indian Day School on the Parry Island Reserve\u2014 I will let you have the name of a successor to Mr. Bolton in the course of a few days.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, June 5, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to previous correspondence, with reference to the services of Mr. Desmond Bolton, teacher of the Ryerson Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I have to inform you that it has been decided to dispense with Mr. Bolton's services as from the end of the present school year, the 30th instant. I would request that you advise Mr. Bolton accordingly.\n\nAs Mr. Bolton and his family are occupying the residence in connection with the school, it will be satisfactory if he removes his personal belongings and vacates the premises before the end of August, next.\n\nYou will be advised of the name of the teacher appointed for the next school year, to begin duties September third.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

The next time you visit this reserve, you should discuss the matter with the teacher and, if you consider it necessary to lengthen the lunch hour to an hour and fifteen minutes or an hour and a half, such action will meet with the Department's approval.\n\nYou should, also, inform Miss McArthur that, in the case of matters affecting the school, she should communicate with you and not direct with the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Information that has reached us indicates that better progress might be made at this school. Miss McArthur has a high school teacher's qualifications and we are rather surprised that she seems willing to continue in an Indian day school.\n\nYour reply should be forwarded as soon as possible in order that an early decision can be made regarding the retention of her services for the next academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

I have had them before and they were not satisfactory.\n\nI had an interview with Mr. J.L. Moore, Inspector of Public Schools in this district, and asked him how he thought Miss McArthur was getting along. He said that this was the best year she had had. I sent word to Miss McArthur that I wanted to talk to her, had a conversation with her, and apparently she is quite satisfied with herself. In yesterday's mail I received the enclosed resignation and I think it would be advisable for the Department to accept it.\n\nI would suggest to the Department, in the event of them choosing a teacher for this school, which according to their letter they intend to do, to try to impress on the teacher for this school to look upon the teaching here from a missionary point of view. That is, the teacher should get around\nand visit and get acquainted with the parents. In that way it would be better for the children, teacher, and everyone. The Indians in this section of the country are very sensitive to the \"high-hatting\" teachers we sometimes have here. My experience in this Agency is, that after a teacher is about three years in an Indian School in this District, they are worse than useless.\n\nWill the department please reply at their earliest accepting Miss McArthur's resignation so that I can let her know that her resignation is officially accepted by the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJMD/EK.\nIndian Agent\n\nEnclosure.\nOttawa, May 31, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th instant, please advise Miss Annie McArthur that her resignation as teacher of the Ryerson Indian Day School is accepted. It is understood that she will give up duties on June 30th, 1937.\n\nYou will be advised, later, regarding the name and qualifications of Miss McArthur's successor.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L.

A fully qualified, Protestant teacher is required. Salary allowed is at the rate of $550 for the ten teaching months.\n\nYou will remember that Mr. Kenneth B. McPherson was employed for some time at the French Bay Indian Day School. He was recommended by Mr. F. G.

He has promised, however, to let me know if anyone should turn up who would be suitable for our schools.\n\nI wrote you a few days ago with regard to the Magnetawan and Lower French Schools.

Devlin,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nDear Sir:-\n\nI have been keeping up inquiries for a teacher for the Ryerson Indian Day School, but up to date without any success.\n\nIt has occurred to me that in default of obtaining a teacher for this school, we might have the children on the Reserve attend the public school at Depot Harbour. There has been a considerable falling off in the population of the village, owing to the cessation of work there by the Canadian National Railways, and inquiries I have made show that the school is sufficiently staffed and could accommodate at least thirty pupils from the Reserve, which is about the average attendance at the Ryerson School. This would entail an expenditure of .10\u00a2 a head per day which in itself would not equal the expenses of our own school. It might however be necessary to supply transportation daily, as the distance covered by some of the pupils would be almost three miles one way. I have not gone definitely into this feature as yet but believe that if the scheme meets with your approval, I might be able to make arrangements with a local man for transportation.\n\nYour early consideration of this matter will be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, suggesting that arrangements be made for Indian pupils of the Ryerson School to attend a neighbouring white school. The cost of their tuition, plus the cost of their transportation, would amount to a considerable sum and there is no guarantee that the Indian children would regularly attend the white school. I feel that it would be preferable to continue your efforts to secure a teacher. It has occurred to me that, as the attendance at the white school has decreased, it might be possible to make arrangements with the School Board to secure one of their teachers to carry on the Ryerson Indian Day School. You might confer with the Board and ascertain from them if they intend to keep all the teachers that they are employing at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. S.

The teacher at present employed has re-opened the school for the current academic year and the Department does not feel inclined to make a change in the teaching services during the middle of the term. However, we have a vacancy at the Ryerson Indian Day School near Parry Sound, Ont. Salary at this school would be at the rate of $85.00 a teaching month, plus bonus of 17%.

Devlin,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nREPORT FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY, 1943.\n\nFebruary has been marked by an epidemic of 'Flu or Grippe all over the country and the Indians have not escaped, but as usual, have had rather more than their share. School attendance has been very poor and in some cases schools had to be closed owing to illness of both teacher and pupils. I have been glad to learn that we are to have a teacher for the Ryerson School on the Parry Island Reserve, which is now scheduled to reopen on March 4. This school has been closed since last June and a good many of the youngster have been running wild, although many who live near enough to the Village of Depot Harbour have been attending the white school there. This school suspension will perhaps help the parents to realize the benefits offered by the Department's schools and induce them to more urgently take advantage of such benefits.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON PARRY SOUND INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF MARCH, 1943.\n\nSchool attendance has been more than usually bad during the winter, due largely to the exceptional snow fall and cold weather. I am glad to be able to note that during the month a teacher was obtained for the Ryerson day school on the Parry Island Reserve. This school had been closed since last June and as it serves a good number of pupils, I am glad to see it in action again. There is a scheme on foot also to have the school buildings on the Lower French Reserve moved from their present site on Jontin Island over to the mainland, which, if we can manage it, should make an improvement in the school attendance at that point.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJune 1, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Ryerson Indian Day School,\nParry Sound Indian Agency,\nElectoral District of Parry Sound.\n\nA Protestant teacher, holding Ontario qualifications, is required for the above-mentioned school for the academic year 1943-44.

I would be glad to have your confirmation of her appointment in order that we may get the school started without delay. Please forward also the necessary forms for her signature.

This means that the Department have paid me only for the actual days which I taught and not for the full teaching month, which I think is customary.

I enclose copy of letter of appointment, cost-of-living bonus and T.D.I form.\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\n\nEnc.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nI have to advise you that Mrs. Vandenberg, teacher of the Ryerson Day School, Parry Island Reserve has been absent from her duties through illness since October 15. Mrs. Vandenberg was admitted to hospital on October 14 and is still there. I regret that I did not notify you of this at an earlier date, but I had been lead to believe that her stay in hospital would be of short duration. Unfortunately it appears now that it may be some little time before she will be able to resume her duties. In the meantime, I am endeavouring to locate a substitute teacher for the Parry Island school to take over there until such time as Mrs. Vandenberg will be enabled to resume.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 9th November, 1945.\n\nMr. Samuel Devlin, Indian Agent, Parry Sound, Ontario.\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant with reference to the sickness of Mrs. Vandenberg, teacher of the Ryerson Indian Day School.

If you are able to secure a substitute teacher during Mrs. Vandenberg's absence, this office should be so advised.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, 9th November, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Ryerson Indian Day School No. 423\n\nPlease do not make any further payment of salary to the teacher of the above school, Mrs. Grace Vanderberg, until you hear further from this office.\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nThis is to advise you that I have secured the services of Mrs. Grace Jacklin, subject to your approval, as school teacher for the Ryerson Day School, Parry Island. I took Mrs. Jacklin to Parry Island this morning to reopen the school there. She is prepared to carry on her duties there until Mrs. Grace Vandenberg recovers from her illness. I do not expect that Mrs. Vandenberg will be able to take over until the new year.\n\nMrs. Jacklin is qualified as a teacher but as she has family responsibilities and resides in town here, she proposes to travel back and forth to Parry Island each day. This is a little difficult at present as there is no ferry now operating between Parry Island and the mainland and I have arranged for Mrs. Jacklin's transfer each day by gasoline livery which will cost us $2.00 per day. I have in mind that we have had considerable trouble in keeping this school going and as there is a potential roll of between thirty and forty pupils, I have committed myself to this extent and hope that you will approve of my action.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 30th November, 1945.\n\nMr. Samuel Devlin, Indian Agent, Parry Sound, Ontario.\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant in which you state you have secured Mrs. Grace Jacklin as temporary teacher of the Ryerson Day School.\n\nPresent regulations do not permit our paying transportation of teachers of Indian Day Schools. Under these circumstances it will not be possible for us to consider payment of account simply stating \"to cover cost of taking teacher to and from school.\"\n\nHowever, in view of your recommendation the Department realizes the importance of keeping this school in operation and we will allow the teacher a salary for her temporary services at a rate of $6.00 a teaching day and with this amount she will be able to pay taxi charges.\n\nWhen issuing the cheque in her favour we will forward it in your care at which time you can adjust the account in question.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nParry Sound, Ont.,\nDecember 13, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nI have to advise you that Mrs. Grace Jacklin is unable to travel back and forth to Parry Island to teach school there owing to ice conditions.

Avtizine,\n5, Cascade St.\nP.O. Box 683\nParry Sound, Ont.\n\nS. Devlin, 659.\nIndian Agent\nParry Sound, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn confirmation of the conversation I had with you this morning I have the honor of making an application for the position of a teacher in the Bay School of Parry Island.\n\nThe particulars concerning my character, education and qualifications for this position are as follows:\n\nI was born in Rostov on Don, Russia, on August 30th, 1901. From 1908 to 1919 I attended a private classical school (gymnasium) there and graduated with a gold medal.\n\nIn 1919 I registered in the Department of Physics and Mathematics of the Don University (Rostov on Don) but due to the Revolution was able to stay there only one semester.\n\nFrom the beginning of 1920 to the end of 1921 I served in the White Army fighting the communists.\n\nAt the end of 1921 I went to Prague, Czechoslovakia and registered in the Electrical Engineering Department of the Polytechnic Institute of Prague. I stayed there until the end of 1924 and then came to the United States to continue my studies at Union College, Schenectady, New York.\nI graduated from the Union College in 1927 with honors and received the degree of B.S. in Electrical Engineering. From 1927 to 1930 I worked in the Switchgear and Testing Departments of the General Electric Company at Schenectady, etc., and at the same time studied for the degree of M.S. in Electrical Engineering. I received this degree in 1937 upon submission of a thesis.\n\nIn 1930 I was admitted to Canada and joined the firm of Canadian & General Finance Company, 25 King St. West, Toronto, Ontario. I worked in the Electrical Engineering Department of this firm in the capacity of an engineer until the end of 1945 when I resigned for personal reasons.\n\nI was born in and belong to the Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church. Besides English and Russian, I read French and Czech and have a slight knowledge of German and Portuguese.\n\nAt the time of my graduation from the Union College I was elected to membership in Eta Kappa Nu, honorary electrical engineering society, and associate membership in Sigma Xi, honorary scientific society.\n\nI am a member of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Association of Professional Engineers of Ontario and Royal Canadian Institute.\n\nI became a British subject on May 16th, 1936, certificate #141946, series A.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6158, file 423-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Ryerson Day School - Parry Island.\n\nI have just been advised by Mrs. Vandenberg, whom I had hoped would be prepared to take over her duties on the reopening of the school after the Christmas holidays, that her doctor will not permit her to do any kind of work for an indefinite time. This leaves us with a definite vacancy at the Parry Island school.\n\nIn connection with this, I had a caller yesterday who was desirous of getting a position as a teacher in one of the Indian schools. This man whose name is A.D. Avtzine was born in Russia and naturalized as a Canadian citizen in 1936. I have checked on this statement and find it correct. I was rather surprised to find a man of his education and attainments seeking a position of this kind and questioned him about this but he assured me that his principal reason was in order to give him an opportunity of studying Indian life. He is a very personable man and speaks very good English although with a noticeable accent. One thing which might militate against his teaching in Parry Island School would be the question of religion since he is an adherent of the Greek Orthodox Church and the Parry Island school has always been considered protestant. From my personal observation I would be inclined to think that he might make a very good teacher. He has made me a written application which I am enclosing herewith and would be glad to have your reactions.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, 9th January, 1946.\n\nMr. Samuel Devlin, Indian Agent, Parry Sound, Ontario.\n\nI note from your letter of the 5th instant that Mrs. Vandenberg will be unable to presume duties as teacher at the Ryerson Indian Day School for an indefinite period.\n\nI have read the application submitted and I know the gentleman is well educated but evidently he has not had any teaching experience. Under these circumstances I feel that his application should not be accepted.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nI have an inquiry from Mrs. Grace Vandenberg formerly teacher of the Parry Island Day School with regard to her standing for sick leave. I am not sure as to what arrangements of this nature are made in the case of school teachers. Mrs. Vandenberg was obliged to relinquish her duties through illness on October 15 last.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 23, 1946.\n\nMr. S. Devlin, Indian Agent, Parry Sound, Ontario.\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to an inquiry you received from Mrs. Grace Vandenberg.\n\nAs you are aware, Mrs. Vandenberg was appointed teacher of the Parry Sound Day School effective September 1, 1945. From the information given to us in your letter of November 6th, she was obliged to give up duties on October 14th. We paid her salary in full for the month of October, which means that we allowed her sixteen days sick leave with pay. I feel that this was a reasonable amount in view of the fact that she was only in our employ for six weeks.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nToronto East General Hospital,\nToronto, Ontario,\nJanuary 21, 1946.\n\nMr. Samuel Derlin,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHaving read your advertisement for a Day School Teacher in the Globe and Mail of recent date, I beg to apply for the position. I do this knowing that I can discharge the services required.\n\nPrior to the war I taught school for three years in the James Bay area under the late Mr. H. L. Tyler, Indian Agent, Moosonee, Ontario. I enlisted in the Canadian Army in Jan. 1940 and am now receiving treatment for arthritis which I incurred whilst Overseas. Since my discharge from the army, I have been reluctant to seek re-employment in James Bay owing to the remoteness of that district from this pension area and to the nature of its climate.\n\nI left the University of Toronto in May 1930 after putting in two years in its Faculty of Arts and began school teaching in 1933.\nin Northern Saskatchewan.\n\nI am 39 years of age and unmarried. I have been advised by the doctors and rehabilitation officers to seek this type of employment.

Two others were also received but have since been withdrawn.\n\nWith regard to Mr. Sampson's application, since he states that he was at one time employed by the Department in the James Bay area you may have some information about him on record. I believe that if his previous record was alright that he would make a suitable teacher.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nFile No. 22-3-1.\n\nI have been advised by Mrs. Grace Jacklin that she has not as yet received payment for her services as a temporary teacher for the Ryerson Day School.

The room I refer to is 25' x 19' with a recess 10' x 14'. It would require considerable fitting up before being used as a school room as the lighting is inadequate and we would have to put in at least two more windows. The plaster on the walls is in bad shape and I doubt if it could be patched sufficiently to be presentable and would possibly require to have the walls completely replastered. An easier job could be done by using wallboard but this is at the moment unattainable. School fittings for this extra room such as desks, etc., might be taken from the Magnetawan Day School which has been discontinued.\n\nThe owner of the room I refer to asks $10.00 per month rent, we to do the repairs.\n\nThere is sufficient accommodation in the teacher's residence attached to the Ryerson School to accommodate two single teachers.\n\nShould you approve of this scheme, please advise me promptly and I will endeavour to have the necessary repairs made and will also be in a better position to obtain teachers.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 8, 1946.\n\nMr. Samuel Devlin, Indian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, the Department approves your suggestion regarding a second classroom for the Ryerson School, provided you can secure two teachers.\n\nI enclose the forms which should be completed by the teachers you recommend for appointment.\n\nAs soon as you have secured the teachers you may make the necessary repairs to the building, keeping the costs as low as possible.\n\nSalary will be allowed each of the teachers at the rate of $100.00 a month plus bonus of 24.1%.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

McCutcheon\nChief Treasury Officer.\nOctober 5th, 1946\n\nDear Phil,\n\nAs you no doubt know, I spent a holiday at Appinwood Beach this summer and while I was there I was approached by a member of the Kettle Point Indians with a view to securing my return to that School. Now that I have returned here since I left this same request had been made, but it was not until this year that I felt free to make a move from Toronto. I agreed with the chief that the Department be rounded out only after assurance that the Indian Agent was fully aware of the circumstances that culminated in my earlier resignation and was personally agreeable to my return. I was assured on both these conditions. I understand that the Department was approached and felt that the request of the Band could not be accepted. I left the matter at that.\n\nI returned the other day to spend a couple of weeks with some friends here and found that the Indians had gone further and circulated a petition that the matter be reconsidered. I saw Mr. McClellan and he confirmed this to me.\nadding that in conversation with Mr. Mitchell he had been informed that the Department felt no change could be made in their decision so far as the Little Poveshiek School was concerned.\n\nI can assure you that there would be no further embarrassment to the Department from my presence at the School and I have Mr. McEachin's assurance that over ninety percent of the Indians favour my return. However, if this is absolutely out of the question I understand that the Emma School is vacant and you might consider that for the time being.\n\nI am anxious to leave this city and return to Kootenay. I find the work and surroundings much more congenial. I am writing you personally therefore, to ascertain just what the position is exactly. If you could drop me a personal note then I would be extremely grateful.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nclo & R. Morris\nRR 5. Trout. Ont.\nIn as much as I am on leave of absence from my present position until the end of the year I would be quite capable of going into the school on a temporary basis until December when the matter could again be reviewed and a final decision made. This would at least have the effect of opening the school and not committing anyone.\nDear George:-\n\nI have received your letter of the 5th instant with reference to your re-employment as teacher in an Indian Day School.\n\nIt is noted you are aware of the vacancy at the Kettle Point School. However, after discussing your application with other Departmental officials, it is felt that it would not be advisable to appoint you to that school again.\n\nWe have a vacancy for a teacher at the Ryerson Indian Day School near Parry Sound, Ontario. I understand that there is also good accommodation for the teacher in the rooms provided for that purpose.\n\nWe would be prepared to consider your temporary appointment and will be willing to accept your services immediately at a salary of $131.00 a teaching month. You will note that in the preceding sentence I mentioned the word \"temporary\". This is in accord with the last paragraph of your letter. If interested please let me hear from you immediately.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. George Dill,\nc/o A.E. Morris,\nR.R. 5,\nFOREST, Ontario.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nI wish to advise that the Ryerson Day School, Parry Island, is still lacking a teacher. I have advertised in the Toronto papers without any success and wish to know if you think that I should continue to advertise this position.\n\nI had one or two applications from married men for this position but as none of them were very satisfactory I would not close with their offers. There is also the fact that the living accommodations at the school are limited and would be completely filled up by a married couple and as it has been our intention to make this into a two room school we would then have no accommodation for a second teacher. The ideal setup would be to have a married man whose wife would also be able to teach, otherwise we would be obliged to have two single teachers. With a nominal roll of about fifty pupils, it will be seen that two teachers are practically a necessity for this school.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 21 November 1946.\n\nMr. S. Devlin, Indian Agent,\nPARRY SOUND, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant, there does not appear to be any great advantage in advertising for a teacher for the Ryerson School.\n\nHowever, if you do not hear of any teacher within the next few weeks it might be advisable to advertise again about the 20th of December.\n\nThe information contained in the second paragraph of your letter has been noted but teachers are so hard to obtain that even though only one applies, we think you should have the school started. If a qualified teacher is secured, we would be prepared to pay a larger salary than that previously mentioned in view of the heavy enrolment.\n\nBernard F.

The band membership as it now stands shows 82 protestants and 50 catholics.\n\nThe idea behind this resolution is that if we find it impossible, as we have found it up to date, to secure a protestant teacher for this point that the Indians of the Parry Island Band would be perfectly satisfied to have a catholic teacher rather than none at all. I believe that if it were possible to relax the regulations in this respect it might give us a wider field of choice.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nPHILIP PHELAN=\nTRAINING DIVISION DEPT INDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA=\nMRS RAIL NINETEEN MORTON ROAD READY TO TAKE PARRYSOUND\nSCHOOL CAN YOU PAY ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY INCLUDING BONUS\nSTOP IF NOT WHAT WHEN DOES SCHOOL OPEN=\nJ M BENNETT,\n\nIndian Affairs.

The course there included several classes of psychology and sociology as well as English, French, History, etc.\n\nAfter graduating, I did social work for the Child Care Department of the...\nChildren's Aid Society of Ottawa and Carleton County,\" leaving there to be married last summer. I am, therefore, not unfamiliar with the handling and training of children.\n\nThe preceding winter I assisted Mr. Ard in bringing a very backward school up to normal working. I came at home except for taking the craft period with the girls of the school. We took knitting and sewing and are now preparing for a sale of our work on the annual achievement day.\n\nLike Mr. Ard, I am musical and play the piano and sing. My musical experience has included training in university and church choirs, and singing in operettas given at McMaster. I am also familiar with school plays and programmes, having participated in them in school and church.\n\nIf you would like some references...\nas to my character and ability, these can be supplied upon request.\n\nHoping that this application meets with your approval, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Mrs.) Walter Telford Acl.\n\nP.S. I might add that I worked as a clerk in the O.T. & A.P. branch of the Department of National Defence from August '41 to September '42 as a Grade IA and from June '43 to August '43 as a Grade II. I left there to attend university in the fall of '42.\n\nM.T.A.\nR.R.2 Sharon, Ont.\nMay 10th '47\n(Phone, 414 Greensville\nC/o Mrs. L.S. Mount)\n\nMr. Samuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Devlin,\n\nThis is my application for the position as principal of the school on Parry Sound Island Reserve should the school be divided into two rooms.\n\nI am an experienced and qualified teacher with a First Class Certificate from the Ontario Normal School in Hamilton. In addition I have a Strathcona Physical Training Certificate, a certificate in the Standard Leadership Curriculum course, and a St. John's First Aid Certificate. I also have to my credit 6\u00bd majors towards a B.A. degree from McMaster University which I obtained intra-murally.\n\nI am Protestant (United Church), thirty-two and married (my wife has her B.A. degree). I am of Irish parentage, was born in Scotland and came to Canada when I was nine years of age.\nMy present inspector is Mr. C. W. MacKillop B.A., B.Ped., Richmond Hill, Ontario.\n\nI am thoroughly experienced in running a rural school since I have taught all the grades from 1 to 10.\n\nI am not green at other types of work either since I had to earn the cost of my own education and earn my own living at the same time. To do so I worked as a sales-clerk in the J. Eaton Co., as an inspector for the American Can Co., and as a laboratory technician for the Steel Co. of Canada.\n\nIn addition to the necessary normal school, senior matriculation, and university subjects, I have studied music and art, in both of which I am credited with some ability. I have a gold medal for violin playing, and have played at many concerts over the radio, and in several orchestras. My matriculation course included Commercial Art and Machine Drafting. I am also experienced in the craft of pottery and in woodwork, both of which are hobbies of mine.\nOnce before, I was in the same inspectorate with Mr. MacKillop when I had the school in Whitefish in the Sudbury District. The school there increased my salary by fifty dollars after the Christmas vacation and gave me room and fuel free. I left to obtain more money so that I could advance my own education. I left my next school which had four rooms, because the former principal wished to return when he was released from the Air Force. I am leaving my present school (with which I am highly satisfied and the board of which wishes me to stay) because I need a greater income due to my married status.\n\nI have several letters of recommendation, copies of which you may have upon request. Hoping to receive your favourable reply,\n\nI am,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nWalter A.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nI am enclosing applications from Mr. and Mrs. Walter Ard for the position of school teacher on the Parry Island Reserve. I have already had some correspondence with Mr. Ard as a result of advertisements which we ran for school teachers in the earlier part of the year. I had explained to him that it was our intention if possible, to make the Parry Island School a two-room institution. It will be recalled that we had discussed this last year, since the school membership roll runs between forty and fifty. As explained at that time, the present school building is inadequate for this purpose but I believe it would be possible for me to obtain a large room in a nearby house which could be, at some little expense, fitted up as a schoolroom. The principal difficulty which remained was the living quarters. Those in the present school building, however, although small, could accommodate a man and his wife. I believe that this would be our best solution for Parry Island where for several years now we have experienced great difficulty in obtaining and retaining teachers.\n\nI am definitely advised by the present teacher, Mrs. Edith Rail that it is her intention to return to Scotland after the summer holidays and that she does not now expect to come back.\n\nThe only fault which I can find with Mr. Ard's application is that his qualifications seem to be high for the position. I would be glad if you would correspond with him direct, advising him as to the probable salaries for himself and his wife, keeping me in touch with what is being done.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 16th, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Ard:\n\nIndian Agent Devlin has forwarded to us the letters received from your wife and yourself with regard to securing positions as teachers at the Ryerson day school, Parry Island Indian reserve.\n\nI enclose two copies of our regular application form; one of these should be completed by your wife and the other by yourself and returned to this office for our consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

The March quarter return of the Ryerson School shows an attendance of 34. This number would not justify two rooms. We expect an average of 50 to 55 if two class rooms are operated. Can you guarantee that we would have the attendance mentioned if a two room school were established.\n\nIn replying you might also let me have an estimate of the cost of renting and fitting up the room in a house which you consider we could secure as school quarters for the academic year 1947-48.\n\nWe note from your letter that Mrs. Rail will definitely give up duties at the end of the current month.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nOttawa, June 5, 1947.\n\nMr. S. Devlin, Indian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ontario.\n\nRyerson Indian Day School\n\nWe have had an opportunity of discussing the situation at Ryerson with Inspector Arneil. If we are unable to get sufficient attendance at Ryerson School to employ two teachers, it has been suggested that Mr. and Mrs. Ard might be employed at the two-room school on Christian Island. However, we will expect to hear further from you concerning their employment.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nCOPY SENT TO DR. DOREY\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nFile No. 22-3-1 (W.T.1).\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of June 2 with reference to the Ryerson Day School on Parry Island. We have had at this school a nominal roll of about 50 pupils. Owing to the rather sporadic operation of the school of late years a number of these pupils have been attending the white school at Depot Harbour. I believe, however, that we should be able to take care of these pupils ourselves with a two-room school.\n\nThe room which I propose to use as a second school room in a house close to the present school building could be fitted up as a school room at a cost of $200 to $250, and the owner of the house asks a rental of $10.00 per month.\n\nI might say that Mr. and Mrs. Walter Ard visited here over the weekend and I took them to Parry Island to inspect the school there and look over the situation. They were to advise me later as to whether or not they would be prepared to consider taking the position there but I have not since heard anything more from them.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nJune 10th, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nPlease let me have the average annual attendance at this school for the last four quarters for which figures are available.\n\nfor Bernard F. Neary.\nOttawa, June 17th, 1947.\n\nMr. S. Devlin, Indian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ontario.\n\nRyerson Indian Day School\n\nReference your Letter of June 4th.\n\nNormally we consider the opening of a second room at a day school only where the annual average attendance is over thirty. Our records indicate that the attendance at this school for the last four quarters is as follows:\n\nMarch, 1945 21\nJune, 1945 27\nJune, 1946 33\nMarch, 1947 34\n\nHowever, if there is a possibility of a definite increase in school population next year, we are prepared to consider the expenditure involved in your letter of June 4th.\n\nHave you heard any further from Mr. and Mrs. Ard in this regard?\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nBFN/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nFile No. 23-3-1.

File 22-3-1 (W.T.I).\n\nIn reply to your letter of June 5, I have just now been advised by Mr. Walter Ard that he has decided to continue in the school where he is at present teaching, having received there a considerable increase in salary, so that we can no longer consider him for any of our schools.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir,\n\nI was due to resign my teaching post here at Ryerson Indian Day School.\n\nDue to a legality I cannot leave Canada meantime with my son. In view therefore of this temporary hold-up may I continue in your service? I have no other plans for deriving a living elsewhere but if you already have appointed a teacher to commence here in the fall perhaps you could place me in a similar post. This one suits me admirably because I can have my little boy with me all the time. However if you have a post elsewhere I shall take it gladly.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEdith Rail (Mrs)\nOttawa, June 23, 1947.\n\nRyerson Indian Day School\n\nMr. S. Devlin, Indian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ontario.\n\nThe attached letter has been received from Mrs. Edith Rail, teacher at the above school. In view of the circumstances, it is recommended that you request Mrs. Rail to continue her teaching duties in September at this school. It will not be necessary for her to be formally re-appointed but it will be necessary for her to submit her salary application form attached to the April issue of the Bulletin, so that we can set her salary for the 1947-48 school term. We will expect to hear further from you in this regard.\n\nBernard F.

This teacher does not plan, and arrange, sufficient seatwork. When she is teaching one grade all others are listening or are idle. Progress must necessarily be retarded under this procedure. Many classes would soon become unmanageable unless kept busier than are these pupils.\n\n\"Pupils' Work - Progress would appear to be spotty. Some are doing fairly well, while others are more or less lost. Oral answers are fairly well given. Written work is rather poor; a higher standard might be required.

I have advised Mr. Manchester that his application has been sent forward to you for consideration. I do not think, however, that he would make a successful school teacher for a large ungraded school since he has had no teaching experience.

Mr. Bolten is a 26 year old Irishman, is married and has one 2 year old child. He expects to reach Parry Sound during the week prior to the opening of school on September first and, of course, will report to your office. You will please give him every possible help as he commences his new duties.

Carried. Pay middle of this month.\n\nChief Peter Megis\nAt a meeting of the Council of the Parry Island Band yesterday the 1st, which I attended, a resolution was passed asking the Department to grant its approval of the purchase of a bell for the Lyndon School House. The bell which they propose purchasing is to be 20 inches in diameter and will cost complete erected on the School House $51.00.\n\nI have been in communication with Miss Rice Lewis, Son of Toronto regarding such a bell as is required, they again offer to deliver the bell at Parry Sound for $16.00.\n\nThe purpose for which the bell is required is to summon the children to school, as a considerable number of them reside quite a distance from the school, I am of the opinion that the ringing of a bell will promote a more regular and better attendance at the school.

A reference to the files in connection with the Shawinaga school shows that the cost of the woodshed there was $43.87.

They promised me that they would try to get along better in future. Mr. Agent Macdonald told me the trouble was that Mr. Elias, who is teacher of the Indian school at Shawinaga, was anxious to be placed in charge of the Parry Island school and that the Indians were trying to get rid of Miss Armour to make a vacancy for him. Mr. Macdonald said it would be unwise to give Mr. Elias this school in any event. I think that there will be no more trouble about Miss Armour in future.\n\nThe school is centrally located and the teacher's quarters will be quite comfortable when the new porch is\nput up.

She has been teaching in this school about seven years.\n\nThe pupils who have attempted to regular attendance have made good progress. The greater portion of the pupils attending this school are children of non-members of the band. For some unstated reason, the Chief and others of the Band are clamouring for the removal of the present teacher, and they refuse from sending their children to school. The discontented agitators are mostly persons that have no school age children. The boys when they reach the age of twelve quit attending school. Excepting a rare case, the girls attend up to sixteen and seventeen years of age, and are much improved in intelligence and moral character, and adapt themselves to cleanliness and taste, surpassing many of their white neighbors.\n\nThe school house neat, warm and comfortable, well aired. The wood for the school is stored in a new and substantial wood shed built last fall, which adds much to the saving of fuel. The outside conveniences should be built further away from the school room door. It should also be further apart. As the present closets are in such shape they are worth improving.\n\nThe teacher's residence has been improved by a storm porch, which has added much comfort to the kitchen. The interior of this house requires painting, such as the floor, stairway, doors, and window casings and the wainscoting.
