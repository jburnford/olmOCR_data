I have also interviewed the Principal of the high school here requesting him to kindly notify me if he can furnish a teacher suitable for the position.\n\nIt is most unfortunate that Miss McIntosh has been compelled to resign at this season of the year as I fear it will be most difficult to secure a teacher who will undertake to go to Kenway Inlet until the weather moderates; however, I shall hope that Mr. Inspector Grant will be able to find someone who will accept the position as I am anxious to have the school reopened with as little delay as possible.\n\nAs soon as I have received a reply from Mr. Grant I will advise you further in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

Quinn who re-opened the school after the summer holidays resigned on Sept 30th. I engaged Mr. A.M. Scott to take charge from Oct 1st until the end of the year. Mr. Scott went to Henvey Inlet arriving there on the 3rd inst but would not remain because there was no house for him to live in, so he refused to board with the Indians until the teacher's house, which is being built, was completed.\n\nMr. Scott returns to Parry Sound on the 10th inst. I at once wrote Miss Ada McIntosh who was formerly in charge of the school offering her the position. In a communication just received from her she has accepted my offer and will re-open the school at the beginning of the week.\n\nI may say that now as the teacher's house is being completed I do not anticipate any trouble in the future in keeping teachers at Henvey Inlet.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.B.

Miss McIntosh states that she hopes to return to re-open the school before Christmas. In the meantime the school will be closed, as it will be impossible to secure another teacher to go to Henvey Inlet temporarily to take charge.\n\nI shall write Miss McIntosh urging her to return to Henvey Inlet at the earliest possible moment.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nW.B.

Jones, teacher of the Henvey Inlet Indian School, has resigned his position and left the school without having given me any previous notice of his intention to do so. I will at once endeavor to secure a new teacher for this school, but owing to the lateness of the season I believe it will be difficult to secure one to re-open this school for the balance of the present term. If I succeed in securing one I will duly notify you.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Supt.\nOttawa, May 14, 1866.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th inst., reporting the resignation of Mr. W.

If you are successful in securing the services of a temporary teacher, the question of permanent appointment will receive consideration on the receipt of recommendations and qualifications.\n\nIn future it would be well when engaging teachers to have some definite understanding as to their term of service, as the Department considers that it is entitled to due notice before accepting the resignation of a teacher; not less than a month's notice will be taken. If they throw up the position, as in this case, the salary will be withheld for that length of time.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nW. B.

I met Mr. Dillwood. He is a bright, active young Scotch Half-breed. He informed me that his wife died about two weeks ago, leaving a baby about six months old. Who is came for by a Mrs. Cooper, a member of Henry Inlet Band. Mr. Dillwood says he never taught school and has no certificate. From what I saw of him and the conduct of his pupils, I will compare with any of the Pupils or Teachers I have met in my District.

Had you made your request before the summer holidays, the Department might have been able to secure one.\n\nAs the present teacher, Joseph Partridge, has been in charge of this school for the past seven years and a half, the Department would not feel justified in dispensing with his services without giving him reasonable notice.\n\nMr. Agent Logan will be asked for a report on your application and if a qualified teacher could be secured after the Christmas holidays, a change might be made.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

In the petition they state that a similar petition was sent you some time ago, but up to the present time they have received no reply.\n\nThe Department has informed the petitioners that it is doubtful if a teacher can be obtained for the school at this season of the year, and in any event could not dispense with the services of Mr. Joseph Partridge, the present teacher, who has been in charge of this school for the past seven years, without giving due notice.\n\nThe Department would like to have a report from you as to the manner in which Mr. Partridge has been carrying on this school, and also if there would be any possibility of securing a qualified teacher for this school after the Christmas holidays, and if so, on what terms.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

Very soon after, I received another petition signed by Chief Missabie and seven others, requesting that he be left alone as they were satisfied with him. Six of them had signed both petitions.\n\nThe trouble arose from the teacher reporting against the chief who was caretaker of the school, for neglecting his duty and a new man was appointed.\n\nI do not think there is any use bothering with them.\n\nThe attendance at the school is about as usual and it would be hard to get a teacher any better than the present one to stay there as it is a very lonely place.\n\nI am your Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Supt.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 21, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant in further reference to the appointment of another teacher to take charge of the Henvey Inlet School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has decided not to make any change of teacher at this school at present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nChief Peter Missabie,\nHenvey Inlet Reserve,\nByng Inlet P.O.,\nOnt.\nOttawa, October 21, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant in reference to the petition of the Chief and Indians of the Henvey Inlet Band asking for the employment of a qualified teacher for their school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of your report, the Department has decided not to make any change of teacher at this school, and the Chief has been so informed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nAlexander Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose to you copy of resignation of Joseph Partridge school teacher at Heavy Inlet, to take effect at end of June 1916.\n\nI am Your Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Supt.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIndian Agent's Office,\n\nHeavy Inlet.\n\nMay 20th, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby tender my resignation as teacher of the Heavy Inlet School, to take effect on the 30th June next.\n\nAllow me to thank you for the kind manner in which you have treated me during my engagement with you.\n\nI am, Yours truly,\n\nJoseph Patridge\n\nMr. Alex Logan,\nIndian Supt.,\nParry Sound.\nOttawa, June 6, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo enclosing copy of the resignation of Joseph Partridge, teacher of the Henvey Inlet School, to take effect at the end of this month.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this resignation is accepted and you will be good enough to take the necessary steps to secure the services of a suitable teacher to take charge of this school after the summer holidays.

Since then the attendance has been very good but there is still some sickness on the Island.\n\nMr. Partridge opened Shawanaga school on Nov. 25th and has 20 pupils attending. The influenza has been very bad at Shawanaga and over 100 cases sickness with seven deaths. Nearly all better now, no new cases developed this last two weeks.\n\nHeavy Inlet school was opened but only two pupils attending. There was a lot of sickness there also. I sent Miss Keesig up on the 7th Nov. and instructed her as the suggestion of Dr. Mason to perhaps help some of the sick people there. Get her house in order and open school as soon as she thought it wise to do so. School has been open now for two weeks and only one or two pupils attending.\n\nReports which I know to be true are very much against this teacher, who is an Indian girl from Cape Croker, and I would recommend that she be dismissed at once and school closed. She has been enticing an Indian from Parry Island who has been staying with her at Heavy Inlet. His name is Thomas Medwayosh. His wife had him in court today for non-support, self and child. He was ordered to pay costs of court, and $10.00 per week in default come up again for sentence. So under the circumstances I think it well that she be dismissed and the school closed until we can get a competent teacher, and enough children who are likely...\nOttawa, December 10, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant and in reference to that portion concerning Miss Kesig, who was recently appointed teacher of the Kenvey Inlet School, I beg to say that, in view of your report concerning the character of this girl, you will be good enough to inform her that her services are no longer required and she should be discharged at once.\n\nShe should forward a return showing the attendance and the days taught by her, when any amount of salary due her will be paid.\n\nYou should endeavour to secure the services of another teacher for this school, to begin duties, if possible, after the Christmas holidays. The name, age and qualifications of any applicants received by you should be forwarded for the consideration of the Department. Kindly give this matter your earnest attention, in order that this school may not remain closed for any greater length of time than necessary.\n\nIt is hoped that the recent epidemic, which visited this reserve, has now ceased and that there will be no further deaths from this cause.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAlexander Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose to you Quarterly school returns for Gibson, Parry Island, and Shawanaga schools. I have not received the report from heavy Inlet teacher as yet.

As a reminder, I may add that it will \"thus be seen by the determination of that Council\" that, at this time, namely, the summer of 1921, the parents were so appreciative of seeing their children progressing so splendidly in school, and that I obeyed their call and went there on my own risk, with my own means, to perform the duty laid down by them for me, despite all obstacles and slanders made and placed by a person against me without a justifiable cause its doing so, and whose name I will not mention here till the due time comes, when it will be proper to expose the shameful disgrace and slander he has been allowing.\nin order to injure and deface my character,\nand therefore any teacher undertaking this case\nwould have to make an uphill fight with\na determined effort to benefit those untamed\nchildren in as short a time as possible and\ngain a favorable eye and recognition for the\nservices rendered and would be engaged in\nwhat would be considered by persons as a\ndesperate undertaking.\n\nIt is a perfectly safe statement to make,\nthat any white person of thorough intelligence\nand the most keen business and professional\ninstincts, would consent willingly to name\na standard salary of Eight Hundred or a\nThousand Dollars a year, to any teacher who\nwould undertake a task for them in a similar\ndesperate situation and conditions that\nplace as Henry Inlet. Two miles to carry\nprovisions on foot, from the station and no fuel\nfor the school nor the teacher's house during\nthe Autumn season.\n\nIn calculating, therefore, I demand\na settlement & made on One Hundred and\nForty of Two Hundred teaching days at\nSeven Hundred Dollars a year amounts to\nFour Hundred and Ninety-Dollars past due.\nConcluding then, I beg to say, my dear sir,\nMr. Logan, that I am willingly to go back to\nthat Reserve and continue my teaching service\nthrough the summer holidays till the end\nof the year, as it is in the interest of the school\nwork that I want to resume my duties, and\nthe holidays taken during the summer\nmay be held during the winter months.\nAnd rely upon your highest\nconsiderations to be disposed this matter to\nthe Indian Department.\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nStarting J. Ritchie,\nByng Inlet,\nOntario.\nSir,\n\nI beg to make report on above and other correspondence re S.K. Richie who has been teaching school at Henry Inlet.\n\nThis man is an Indian half breed and is a cripple having both feet turned in, (club feet). He has some education and puts in most of his time advising the Indians in Indian law etc., and doing considerable correspondence especially with the kickers. He made himself very busy during the war by going around the several reserves collecting money and advising the young Indians not to join up, the result being, very few joining from this agency.\n\nAfter the war Richie settled on Parry Island and got into trouble and was charged with seducing a young Indian girl and was in Police Court but it was not proven and so he got off after being in jail sometime. Parry Island Indians run him off the reserve. He then drifted to Henry Inlet and the next I heard of him was that he had opened the school at Henry Inlet. I was not aware of it until June last when I received a letter from the Department. I was at Henry Inlet paying Robinson Treaty and expected to see him but he kept out of my way, as he was well aware I could not and would not recommend him as a teacher.\nSir,\n\nHowever I made some enquiries and found that he had some five or six pupils and the Indians thought he was doing fairly well. I expected they were going to pay him themselves and thought I would leave him alone as long as he behaved himself.\n\nI have never seen him until two weeks ago, he came into my office and said he wished to have me send in his report. I read the Dept. letter 22-2-1 to him and gave him a set of returns papers and asked him to make them out, giving all the information and I would send them to the Department. I received these papers from him on Saturday eve the 29th. of April with a long letter claiming to be paid at the rate of $700.00 per annum.\n\nI might say that I have not recognized him in any way as a teacher but when I was paying at Pickeril on April 26th. last month I took occasion to bring the matter before the Band and they were in favor of paying him $200 in full for his teaching while at Henry Inlet as they say he was not more than four months altogether.\n\nHe is not the calibre of a gentleman I think should be teaching school but as the Indians encourage him to some extent and as I have\nSir,\n\nI heard no complaints against him since he went there I would recommend that he receive at the rate of $50.00 per month while he taught.\n\nI trust this report will meet with your approval.\n\nI received no returns from him until he called at my office in April last with a report, at that time I gave him the school reports which I now enclose, received on April 29th. I am also enclosing his letter handed to me at the same time and saying in it that he wishes to go back which if the Department approves would probably be the best place for him to go if the Indians there are agreeable.\n\nI am Your Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept.of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Supt.\nOttawa, May 19, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department of Indian Affairs has decided to allow you, for your teaching activities at the Henvey Inlet Indian Day School, the sum of $665.45/8/11. This amount is being taken from Band funds account, as per two resolutions from the Council, dated June 10, 1921 and April 26, 1922. I am enclosing a copy of official communication to Chief Moses Missanbie, for your information.\n\nYour services will not be required as teacher of the Henvey Inlet, or any other, Indian day school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nSterling K. Ritchie, Esq.,\nByng Inlet,\nOnt.\nOttawa, May 19, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 9th instant, referring to Mr. S. K. Ritchie, who has been teaching school at Henvey Inlet. I have noted your remarks regarding this man, and I wish to state that the Department is writing him, informing him that we are making him a payment of $365.45-5/11 from Band funds, for his services. He is also being informed that the Department of Indian Affairs cannot accede to his request that he be formally engaged as Teacher for the Henvey Inlet Indian Day School. I am enclosing copy of official communication to Chief Moses Missanbie, for your information.\n\nI am forwarding resolution of the Council, dated June 10, 1921, which recommends that $165.45-5/11 be paid to Mr. Ritchie for his services as Teacher from April 19 to June 30, 1921. This resolution should be approved by you, if you are convinced that it is in order. If you believe it desirable, I will be pleased if you would have the Band pass this resolution again, so that payment of the above amount can be made to Mr. Ritchie.\n\nThe Department already has a resolution of the Band, which is quite in order, that Mr. Ritchie be allowed $200 for his teaching activities at Henvey Inlet. I am of the opinion that this is intended as his salary for the months of September to December, 1921. Upon receipt of a properly approved resolution similar to that of June 10, 1921, which I enclose, the Department is prepared to pay from Band funds a total of $365.45-5/11.\n\nAs you will note in the enclosed communication to the Chief, this Department is prepared to engage a teacher and operate a school for the Indian children at Henvey Inlet. You should make arrangements with the Council to pass a resolution in the immediate future, asking the Department to do this, and assuring us of their interest and cooperation. All expenses in the future will be met by the Vote for Indian Education.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nA. Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI have to refer again to your communication of June 10, 1921, and to official letter, of this file number, of June 15, 1921, both referring to the unofficial appointment, by the Council of the Henvey Inlet band, of B. K. Ritchie, as Teacher of the Henvey Inlet Indian Day School. You will remember that you enclosed minutes from the Council meeting, recommending, (1) that a salary of $700.00 per year be paid to Mr. Ritchie; (2) that he be paid $365.45-5/11 for his activity from April 19, 1921 to June 30, 1921; (3) that Mr. Ritchie be retained as teacher for the term commencing September 1, 1921\u2014all of which resolutions were not signed by the Indian agent.\n\nI have now to inform you that the Department has learned, from several sources, that Mr. Ritchie is not the type of teacher that we desire for our Indian schools. However, as he may have acted in good faith, considering he was hired by the Band, this Department is prepared to pay him for his services from April 19 to June 30, 1921, and from September 1, to December 31, 1921, the sum of $365.45-5/11. This money will be taken from the Band funds voted by the Council meeting held on June 10, 1921 ($365.45-5/11) and April 26, 1922 ($200.00). I am sending to Mr. Agent Logan the first mentioned resolution of the Council, and I am asking him to give it his approval if he believes the payment is in order.\n\nI wish to inform you that the Department of Indian Affairs is willing to meet the expenses in connection with the education of the Indian children of the Henvey Inlet Reserve. This will be done from the vote for Indian Education; but you should understand clearly that we will hire the teacher and give him, or her, all instructions. If you and the members of the Band are interested in the education of your children, you will, in turn, do your share by keeping up the attendance.\n\nAs mentioned above, $365.45-5/11 will be taken from Band funds as you, as a council, hired the teacher without the approval of the Department and as you have voted this amount. In the future, however, the expenses of operating the school at Henvey Inlet will be met by the Vote for Indian Education.\n\nI will be pleased if you will have passed in the Council a resolution, requesting the Department of Indian Affairs to re-open the school on the first of September, and giving us the assurance that the Council will give every assistance with a view to its successful operation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMoses Missanbie, Chief,\nHenvey Inlet Reserve,\nByng Inlet, Ont.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNo.22-241\nALSO\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER\nMay 19/22\n\nSir,\n\nA meeting of the Band held at Pickerel August 5th,\nto consider the resolution re Kelso Ritchie for teaching school\nat Beckonon during 1921.

Ritchie, was discussed and your letter read and interpreted to them.\n\nIt was moved by Jno. Wickemakey and sec., by Wilson Ashawasagai that Mr. Ritchie be only paid $200.00 in full of his claim as per resolution sent the Department sometime ago. This vote was unanimous and nearly all the members of the band living there, were at the meeting. They claim that Ritchie only lay around and did not teach but about two weeks, between September and December, and that he is well paid at $200 in full and that the band will not agree to pay him any more. They trust the Department will accede to their request in the matter.\n\nI am Your Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 21, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, enclosing a resolution of the Henvey Inlet Band, in which it was moved that the sum of $200 be paid to S. L. Ritchie who taught the school, that reserve during the year 1921 - the above amount to be payment in full for his services as teacher while at this school.\n\nA cheque for this amount is being sent you, under separate cover. You will be good enough to forward same to Mr. Ritchie, as we are unaware of his present address.\n\nI have also to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the above date, embodying a resolution of the Band in Council that the Department authorize the re-opening of this school about September first, next, and that the services of a qualified teacher be provided.\n\nIn this connection I beg to refer you to official letter of May 19th, last, in which you were informed that the Department would be prepared to engage a teacher and operate a school for the Indian children at Henvey Inlet, provided the Council would pass the resolution referred to and assure us of their interest and cooperation - the expenses in future to be met from the Vote for Indian Education.\n\nThe Department will approve of the re-opening of this school, provided you can obtain the services of a satisfactory teacher. I have to request that you will give this matter your attention and endeavour to secure a teacher to begin duties on or about the 5th of September next, or as soon thereafter he is possible. The name, qualifications and residence of the person selected by you for this school should be forwarded for the approval of the Department. The salary allowed will be at the rate of $600 per annum, supplemented by a bonus during the present fiscal year, ending March 31st, next, at the rate of $15 per month.\n\nI have to request that you will state the present condition of the school building at Henvey Inlet, also whether any repairs are required or any material such as school books, stationery, etc. If any repairs are needed to the school, these should be attended to at once, but, before undertaking same, you will kindly report what is necessary and the probable cost. You will be good enough to requisition for a supply of school material, text books, etc., which you consider necessary if a teacher is secured. As the Indians appear anxious to have this school re-opened, I shall be pleased if you will give this matter your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Having taught Indians a number of years in different times with success,\n\nI am open to take the situation at present engaged as a supply missionary of Parry Island and North Shore Mission. But my salary is inadequate for any support. I am willing to take up the above school, will teach four days in each week and take young ones to attend the school. Will teach on the minor holidays under the direction of the Indian Agent.\nwill work in harmony with\nthe Indians Agent who super-\nintends the School, and am\nwilling give the best of my\nservice for the improvement\nof the Indians under my charge\nas well. In this, if appointed\nwill commence of the 1st Oct.\n1924, as I have some engage-\nments to fill during the month\nof Sept. I commend myself\nunder your favorable consideration\nand have to remain\nfaithfully yours\nW. A. Ellis, M.A.\nShawnee OK\nMEMO.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nEnclosed you will find an application for position of teacher of Henvey Inlet. I should state that Mr. Elias is a product of the Anosy School, according to what he told me. I think that this is the best that can be done at Henvey Inlet, in the way of procuring a teacher. I cannot expect to get anybody worth while at the salary and I think that the salary is enough for all that there is to do.\n\nMr. Elias spoke to me about the position and I told him to send me a written application, which is the enclosed. He promises to work with me and he also knows that if appointed, I will expect him to give complete cooperation in the welfare of the school. I understand the missions not being able to start until 1st of Oct., that is owing to the missions, but I think that the missions can be cut short and I would be in favour of his appointment at a salary of $500.00, but no more, but of course the bonus to be added.\n\nI understand Mr. Elias and think that I can get results in Henvey Inlet School through him. Would you please, when considering this application, remember that this school is isolated all winter. When I visit it in winter, I travel on snowshoes.\n\nTrusting that you will consider this application favourably and allow no more than $500.00 as salary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\n\nR.T. Ferrier,\nSupt. Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 30th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 27th instant, with reference to securing a teacher for the Henvey Inlet Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the department approves of the appointment of Mr. W. A. Elias, at a salary of $500 plus bonus. Payment of both salary and bonus will be made on a basis of ten teaching months in the school year. Please advise the Department the date on which he commences duties at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReplying to yours of Aug. 30, 22-2-1, I beg to state that in a conversation with the travelling superintendent of Methodist Missionary Society here in Parry Sound, rep a pointment of Mr.W.A.Elias, we went into the subject very fully along with Mr.Elias and the conclusion we came to is that Mr.Elias would be able to look after the Henvey Inlet School for only four days in the week at a daily salary of $3.00. Of course he could not receive the bonus under these conditions. After carefully considering the situation, I feel that I am justified in recommending that Mr.Elias be appointed under these conditions, and we could try it out for a season.\n\nTrusting that the Dept.will seriously consider these altered conditions and accept Mr.Elias as teacher for the coming term. He would be able to start work on the 15th.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\n\nJ.D.McLean Esq.,\nSecretary Dept.Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 6th, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with further reference to the appointment of Mr. W. A. Elias as teacher of the Henvey Inlet Indian Day School for the present school year.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of your recommendation, the Department will allow Mr. Elias salary at the rate of $3 per day for each day he conducts the work at this school. We note that he will only be able to teach 4 days each week, beginning the 18th instant. As Mr. Elias will be on a per ordinance basis, no bonus can be allowed. In preparing his quarterly returns care should be taken to show the actual number of days taught each quarter, in order that salary for that period can be paid. Please inform Mr. Elias of the approval of his appointment and the salary that he will be allowed. He should conduct the classes, if possible, four days each week.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJohn M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound,\nOnt.\nSir,\n\nThe March quarter return showing the attendance at the Henvey Inlet Indian School has just been received. It is noted that only eight pupils were enrolled with an average attendance of three.\n\nI would draw to your attention the attendance for the March quarter:\n\n| Name of pupil | Days present | Days absent |\n|---------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Thomas Nesabie | 43           | 3           |\n| Wilfred Revoir | 19           | 27          |\n| Thomas Naubush | 11           | 35          |\n| Lily Nesabie   | 14           | 32          |\n| Fanny Kewakunde | 25          | 21          |\n| Annie Kashyangie | 16        | 30          |\n| Mildred Elias  | 16           | 30          |\n| Winnie Nesabie | 4            | 42          |\n\nYou will see from the above that only one of the pupils attended regularly and the same applies to the return forwarded for the December quarter.\n\nIn view of the above, the Department considers it extremely doubtful if the attendance justifies the expense incurred in keeping this school open. Please report fully, as soon as possible, your views in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\n\nJohn M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Affairs,\nParry Sound,\nONT.\nSir,\n\nReplying to yours of April 2, 22-2-1, re-\n\nHenry Inlet School attendance, I regret to state that I have been very dissatisfied with the working of this school in this much that Mr. Elias was supposed to make his home there and he did not. His wife continued to stay at Shaganaga until I spoke to him rather sternly about the matter, and then she only stayed for about a month of the last quarter.\n\nThe arrangement of having Elias at Henry Inlet is not satisfactory in many ways, and I approve of the school being closed, as I consider it too expensive to run for all the attendance.\n\nThomas Missable is a bright boy and could be sent to Maganetowan or Pickeral to school. I will try to make arrangements for this boy. The other children are truants except Lily and Winnie Missable, who can go to Maganetowan school. They are the children of Charlie Missable. I have spoken to him often, and told him the school would be closed if he did not send his children. He seems all right but his life is careless about her children's education. Mr. Elias was here in my office today, and I explained to him that the school was closed now. I explained that it was costing the Dept. too much to run it. I also explained that in all probability the Dept. would send an official letter upholding my decision to have the school closed.\n\nTrusting that this will be satisfactory,\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nSecretary Dept. Indian Affairs, Sir:\n\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohn M. Daly\nAgent\nOttawa, April 9th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, in which you recommend that the Henvey Inlet Indian Day School be closed on account of the irregular attendance.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that you have informed the teacher, Mr. Elias, that the school was to be closed, and that you can arrange for the providing of educational facilities for several of the children. Please see that any school material on hand is properly stored or given to the other schools where it could be used.\n\nPlease state the date upon which the school was closed, and whether there is any balance of salary due Mr. Elias for any period he may have taught since the first of the present month. His salary has been paid in full to the end of March, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound,\nOnt.\nParry Sound, Ont.\nJune 19, 1930\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to report that in taking a census of the children at Henvey Inlet I find that by the end of August there will be ten children there, with no facilities for education.\n\nThe school and teacher's house are there, what would be required would be a teacher and supplies. The teacher's house would have to have some slight repairs.\n\nOne of the parents who has five children is anxious to know if they cannot have a school at Henvey Inlet, if he could get his children sent to Chapleau School.\n\nThe consideration of the Department at their earliest will be very much appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, June 23rd, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, regarding the reopening of the school at Hanvey Inlet in order to provide educational facilities for the Indian children residing at that point.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that our funds for the present year are limited, and we will be unable to provide the amount required in fitting up the school and teacher's house and in paying the salary of a teacher. It is considered that arrangements could be made to place the Indian children of school age, who are in good health, in the Chapleau Indian Residential School or in the Shingwauk Home at Sault Ste. Marie, where there will be vacancies for a number of children after the holidays. I would, therefore, advise that you take this matter up with the parents at the first opportunity and forward applications and doctor's certificates for the Indian children whom you can induce them to send to either of the above named schools. When these applications are received, you will be advised regarding the placing of the children in one or other of the residential schools mentioned above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\n\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\nEXTRACT OF RESOLUTIONS PASSED AT A MEETING OF THE HENVEY INLET\nBAND COUNCIL HELD ON DECEMBER 19TH, 1947.\n\nResolution No. 5\n\nMoved by Charlie Missabie\nSeconded by Henry Ashawasagai\n\nAfter a close inspection of the day school, we\nnoticed that the children are averaging about 3 or 4 hours of\nschooling per day and also they haven't learned anything since we\nhad this teacher. It is about time to ask the Department to\nreplace a new teacher to finish the rest of the season.\nParry Sound, Ont.,\nJanuary 17th, 1948.\n\nResolution No. 5 registers an objection to the school teacher. The teacher, Mrs. David, is at present laid up with a broken ankle. She has, however, been having the children come to her house and has been carrying on there. I do not think there is any occasion at present for the complaint.\n\n(signed)\nSamuel Devlin\nIndian Superintendent\n\nCopied:\nJGM\nOttawa, July 13, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER.\n\nIn view of the fact that you are running short of coding numbers for the different day schools in this Branch, please be advised that it will be in order to close the following schools and use their respective numbers for new schools that we created from time to time:\n\nNOVA SCOTIA.\nBear River 251\n\nNEW BRUNSWICK.\nIndian Island 279\n\nQUEBEC.\nCaughnawaga Bush 303\nWolf Lake 336\nSt. Francis Prot. 337\n\nONTARIO.\nBatchewana 379\nHenvey Inlet 397\nMattawa 406\nMichipicoten Harbour 407\nShogunindah Prot. 429\n\" R.C. \" 430\nSheshgwaning C.E. 431\nStoney Point 437\n\nMANITOBA.\nSandy Bay 548\n\nBRITISH COLUMBIA.\nFort Rupert 809\nMcDame 830\nOld Fort Babine 862\n\n(Sgd) Bernard F.

I would advise that the school house referred to has been abandoned for more than twenty years. It was a log building with siding on the outside and is now in a ruinous condition and of very little value excepting as salvage. The roof has partly fallen in and there is very little prospect that the building will ever again be used as a school house as the great bulk of the population have moved to their other Reserve on the Lower French a number of years ago. I would recommend that the building be given to Paul Contin without charge.\n\n(Sgd) Samuel Devlin,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nCopied: T.L.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. G. Armstrong, Welfare Division\n\nAs far as this Division is concerned, we have no objection to the old school house on the Henvey Inlet reserve being given to Paul Contin.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nParry Sound, Ont.,\nJuly 14th 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nEducational Division.\n\nThere is on the Henvey Inlet Reserve an old building which was at one time used as a teacher's residence. This building has been abandoned for possibly 25 years dating from the time when the Indians of this Band moved from that Reserve to the Lower French Reserve where the most of them now reside. I have a request from Henry Ashwassagai of that Band to obtain this building, as he intends to go back to the Henvey Inlet Reserve with the idea of curing timber there on premises which is a museum he has been engaged in on the Lower French Reserve. The building itself has been rapidly falling into ruin and about the only thing which he would get would be the walls, as he will have to build a new roof. I would suggest that he be permitted to take over this building without charge. I believe that I had already made application for the use of this building for Allen Ashwassagai but since then he has given up the idea.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Superintendent.\nJuly 21, 1949.\n\nSamuel Devlin, Esq.,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nParry Sound, Ontario.\n\nYour letter of July 14th, regarding disposal of an old building on the Henvey Inlet Reserve, has been received.\n\nI am advised by the Educational Division that it will be in order to turn over this building to Henry Ashwassagai, who proposes moving back to the Henvey Inlet Reserve.\n\nIt is noted that this Indian proposes wrecking the building and using the salvage material to build a house.\n\nH.

Parry Sound.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHolland & Graves\nMemo.\n\nThe Deputy Supt General.\n\nThere does not appear to be any previous correspondence on file showing that repairs are required at this school.\n\nThe school building is a log one 19 ft by 25 ft inside measurement and if now in the condition reported by the Indian Supt., and deteriorating to such an extent within the last year, it is questionable if the erection of a new building would not be more profitable than repairing this old log building, as a new frame one of about the same dimensions as this old one could be erected for very little more than required to put this building in shape.\n\nThe estimate sent in for repairs is not very definite and it is not clear if the plastering is included or if the paint estimated is to be put on the building or if it is intended to charge extra for the labor in this work.\n\nA short specification should be sent showing clearly the extent of the work to be done so that an estimate of the cost may be made.\n\n[Signature]\n\nFile I5458I-5\n\n25/06\nOttawa, July 26, 1906.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th inst., inclosing a communication from the Chief of the Henvey Inlet band in regard to repairing the school-house on the reserve, the cost of which will be in the neighborhood of $450.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is doubtful whether it would be wise to incur so large an expenditure in repairing this existing old log school-house, when a new frame building of the same dimensions could be put up for about $700. The estimate which accompanied your letter is not very definite, and it is not clear if the plastering is included or if the paint estimated for is to be put on the building, or whether it is intended to charge extra for the labour in this work. A specification should be sent showing clearly the extent of the work to be done, so that an estimate of the cost might be made.\n\nIn any event the Department would not authorize expenditure of the amount asked for without a resolution of the band approving of the same, and as the matter would have to be submitted to the Indian council it would be better to bring up both questions, that is the erection of an entirely new building or repairing the old, and it will be for the Indians to decide, as the necessary funds will have to be taken from their capital.\n\nW. B. Maclean, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the above date which refers to the proposed repairing of the School House at the Henvey Inlet Reserve I beg to say that I visited this reserve on the 2nd instant and while there examined the School House and am of the opinion that it would be better to build an entirely new building in preference to spending the amount of money that would be required to repair and rebuild the present structure. The building is a very old one and the sills and walls appear to be in a very rotten condition.\n\nThe Band desire to have a new School house built, but before anything is decided I would suggest that you have a drawing made of a suitable building so that I can call for tenders and find out what the building will cost. The measurements of the building required will be as follows: length 26 ft., width 20 ft., and height 16 ft., with a stone or concrete foundation.\n\nI might say in regard to the building of this school house that I think it will cost more than your estimate which is $700.00 as the Henvey Inlet Reserve is an inaccessible place. If the erection of this building could be delayed until the completion of the James Bay or Canadian Pacific Railways it would very much cheapen the cost of the building, as both of these roads run through the reserve, and the material would not require to be hauled more than 2 miles, whereas, at present, it can only be taken to the reserve by Sail Boats. Awaiting your further instructions in the matter I beg to remain.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Supt.\nOttawa, August 23, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your letter of the 26th ult. and previous correspondence regarding the school-house at Henvey Inlet, I beg to inclose herewith plans and specifications for a new school-house, on which you might call for tenders, and when the same are received the Indians could be advised of the probable cost, when it will be for them to decide whether they will grant sufficient funds from their capital to put up the new school-house.\n\nIf they agree to the work being done, a resolution to that effect should be sent to the Department along with the tenders received, together with a report from you as to the ability of the tenderors to carry out the contract.\n\nYou should have this matter attended to as soon as possible, so that the work may be let in time for completion before the season closes.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D.

I also wrote to Messrs Holland & Graves at Byng Inlet, which is adjacent to Henvey Inlet Reserve, asking them if there was any Contractor at Byng Inlet who would undertake the erection of this building, but they wrote me stating that they did not know anyone who would do this work. It therefore looks to me as if it is going to be a difficult matter to get anyone to erect this building at present, owing to the fact that there is so much work being carried on by all Building Contractors at Parry Sound and Byng Inlet that they do not care to undertake this work.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nW.B.

I may state that when I was at Henry Inlet School House on the 24th of July, the Chief called my attention to the condition of the foundation of the building which is falling away. Though the hewn pine logs in the four walls are in prime condition, if there was a stone foundation built under the school, legs, the porch & floors, and also the school room, and a new shingle roof, would put the building in good comfortable condition for a number of years. I may say that John Gaikayeyangai is a very fair stone mason.

Therefore we enclose requisition for supplies, trusting that our actions will meet with your approval. The improvements that we intend making are really needed, so the building is in a very poor state of repair.

You will be good enough to obtain this at your earliest convenience.

I mailed their account to your Department on the 18th January.\n\nOn the 26th January I received your letter in reply - No. 154571 - 5th January 24th 1905, asking to furnish a clipping of the advertisement which I did.

It requires re-shingling and wainscoting in the inside, on a heavy tar felt paper sheathing, with a new floor of inch lumber. The outside walls should be covered with tar felt paper. Boards and battens would make it a most comfortable building by putting a stone foundation under the building. The Body of House is hewed Norway pine and in good condition. The Size of the Structure is outside measurements 26 feet 6 inches x 20 feet 6 inches.\n\nHeight of Wall from sill to eaves 10 feet. I would recommend a Porch to be built in the front entrance and inch Board shutters to be put on the 14 Windows for protection.\n\nIf the above repairs will meet your approval, I think that this School House with an occasional\nIndian Office\n\nMEMO\n\n330610\n\ncoat of paint will fill the wants of the Henry Islet Band for twenty years or more.\n\nThe Teacher's Cottage requires some repairs\u2014a Porch at the entrance and three Storm Windows for the Winter, and have the four outside shutters with heavy Oil felt paper Boarded and battened on tops of the present walls. Would keep out the Wind and fine snow drifting through chinked Crevice and Cracks along the eaves. The W.C.'s at the School and Teacher's Cottage require some repairs\u2014The children during Vacation and the time there is no Teacher in charge, for the past year, have been careless and reckless in regard to the school property. I do not know what the regulations are concerning the duties of the School Caretaker. I would suggest that the Caretaker be responsible for damages. When he fails to find the culprit and recover the damages all is submitted to your approval. Am Sir your obedient servant,\n\nD.

No provision is made for excavating for foundation, and the estimate for concrete is insufficient and no estimate made for either painting or repairs to plastering.\n\nThe cost of making the repairs to the school including painting to outside and inside with repairs to plaster will be over Seven hundred dollars, $700.00.\nOttawa, August 30, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 1st and 5th inst., in reference to the repairing of the school-house and teacher's residence at Honvoy Inlet, and in reply I beg to say that, as the estimated cost of the repairs will amount to nearly the price of a new building, the Department has decided that it would be better to rebuild, and you are hereby authorized to call for tenders in accordance with the plans and specifications sent you by Postmaster on August 26, 1908.\n\nAny offers received should be forwarded here to be dealt with by the Department.

The Indians will do the work if the agent will supply the material. The present teacher at Harbordge is a good teacher and a married man. The house is only 15x17 and if it had an addition of say 12x16 it would make a much better house and would cost $300. The Harvey inlet school should have 16 double seats on each side. I would recommend the above improvements and seats to be purchased at once.\n\nChawunaga School should have a store to keep from getting under it so it is all open and must be very cold in winter. Also a teachers house should be built. The present one is in bad shape and not worth repairing.\n\n4. New desks are required for these schools. The old ones are no good and school chairs, frames and windows need replaced. Mr. Taylor the late teacher has resigned.

You should purchase all material at the closest possible price and be guided by the patronage list. The voucher for this material should be in full detail.\n\nWith regard to the new desks, I beg to say that the Department considers that fourteen (14) double desks would be quite sufficient and you may order these from the E.

You may also arrange for the work required in building the partition. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nRegarding the painting of the school house, both inside and outside, I beg to state that, before the Department can approve of this work being done, it will be necessary for you to state the approximate cost of same. You should state the cost of the paint, brushes, etc., and also the cost of the labour in having the painting done. The granting of authority for having the work done will depend upon the cost involved. If you will furnish us with the information asked for at an early date, there will be sufficient time, after the work is authorized, to have the painting done during the summer holidays.\n\nI would suggest that in future in making recommendations for repairs, you state approximately the cost of the materials and work, as the Department will then be in a position to decide whether the same can be authorised or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I roughly estimate that the painting and labour for same can be done for $55.00.\n\nIt is a small building but has not been painted for years. We might let the school go for this year, but it will have to be painted next year, as it is beginning to be the worse for weather.\n\nTrusting that the Department will see the necessity of having the teacher's house painted outside and inside.

The work should be done by day labour, and proper time sheets, in duplicate, should be kept. You should purchase the paint, etc., required, and have it delivered at the school. If possible, competitive prices should be obtained. We hope that you estimate the cost of the above work to be approximately $57, and the expenditure should be kept within that amount if possible. When the work has been completed, you should forward properly certified vouchers in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the paint, etc., as well as time sheets, in duplicate, properly certified, for the labour employed. This work should be carried out during the summer holidays, and should be completed to your satisfaction.\n\nThe painting of the school building will have to stand over until next season.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. S. Devlin,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nI have received an offer of $50.00 from the Algonquin Timber Company for the old school building on the Henvey Inlet Reserve. I have recently inspected this building and find it in a very dilapidated condition as it has not been in use for a great number of years. Practically all the Indians of this Band had moved to their other Reserve on the Lower French a number of years ago. With the prospect of work by the new licensee on the Henvey Inlet Reserve, some families are already moving back there. However, the trend of settlement now appears to be along the line of the railway which would be about three miles distant from the old school with a body of water (Henvey Inlet) in between.\n\nThe school building would have some salvage value in lumber which the Algonquin Timber Company could use in the construction of the camps, it being somewhat difficult to transport the lumber to this point. I consider that $50.00 would be the full salvage value of this building, although its value to us as it stands would be considerably more should we ever find it convenient to refit it as a school which, however, I consider unlikely.\n\nShould you decide to consider the offer made by the Algonquin Timber Company, please advise me as soon as possible.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 20, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nThere is an old building on the Henvey Inlet Reserve, in the Parry Sound Agency, Province of Ontario, which was formerly used as a day school. This school has not been in operation for several years.\n\nThe Indian Agent states that he has received an offer of $50.00 for it and he considers that this is full salvage value. It would be appreciated if you would obtain the necessary authority to allow the Agent to dispose of this building.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMemorandum:\n\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nAttention: Mr. Philip Phelan\n\nI acknowledge the receipt of your memorandum of the 20th instant, your file 22-2-5, requesting approval to dispose of an old building, formerly used as a Day School and now discontinued for several years. The old building referred to is on the Henvey Inlet Reserve in the Parry Sound Agency.\n\nDue to regulations governing the disposal of Crown Assets, it should be stated what funds were used for the original construction of the building, and the approximate cost involved to erect same. I presume no land is involved in the sale of the old building.\n\nIf the offer of $50.00 is accepted, will it include the cost of removal of the building from the property and the clearing up of the site to the satisfaction of the Indian Agent?\n\nPlease bear in mind that should approval be granted for the sale it will be necessary to have the cheque made payable in favour of the War Assets Corporation, Montreal, Quebec.\n\nKindly let me have full information concerning the building to be disposed of so that a submission may be made to the Deputy Minister for approval to accept the offer already made to the Indian Agent.\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nOttawa, July 26th, 1945.\n\nMr. S. Devlin, Indian Agent, Parry Sound, Ontario.\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to the offer you have received for the purchase of an old school building on the Henvey Inlet Reserve.\n\nI have taken this matter up with the Salvage Officer and he has requested the following information:\n\nDue to regulations governing the disposal of Crown Assets, it should be stated what funds were used for the original construction of the building, and the approximate cost involved to erect same. I presume no land is involved in the sale of the old building.\n\nIf the offer of $50.00 is accepted, will it include the cost of removal of the building from the property and the clearing up of the site to the satisfaction of the Indian Agent?\n\nHave you any information in your office showing whether this building was originally built from band funds or from appropriation? Our files are not clear on this point. Possibly you may have some information in your office also regarding the approximate first cost of this building.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, July 13, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER.\n\nIn view of the fact that you are running short of coding numbers for the different day schools in this Branch, please be advised that it will be in order to close the following schools and use their respective numbers for new schools that we created from time to time:\n\nNOVA SCOTIA.\nBear River 251\n\nNEW BRUNSWICK.\nIndian Island 279\n\nQUEBEC.\nCaughnawaga Bush 303\nWolf Lake 336\nSt. Francis Prot. 337\n\nONTARIO.\nBatchewana 379\nHenvey Inlet 397\nMattawa 406\nMichipicoten Harbour 407\nSheguiandah Prot. 429\n\" R.C. 430\nSheshegwaning C.E. 431\nStoney Point 437\n\nMANITOB.\nSandy Bay 548\n\nBRITISH COLUMBIA.\nFort Rupert 809\nMcDame 830\nOld Fort Babine 862\n\n(Sgd) Bernard F.

I have secured the services of Miss Ada McIntosh to resume charge of the Henvey Inlet School at the beginning of the New Year with the express understanding that the teacher's house will be completed & ready for occupation by that time, as she is probably the most competent teacher we have had at Henvey Inlet.

Maclean, Esq.,\nIndian Supt.,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nHenry [signature]\n[Date]\n\nW.B. Maclean\nIndian Sub.\n[Signature]\n\nDear Sir -\n\nYou said when you were here last why they brought\nto teachers house that all the men\nbelong to this land to help me something\nthe house. That was impossible to be\ndone as you said. The men said to\nme that they cannot do it - Furthermore\nthey have enough work for their families.\nSo I thought the best thing can be done\nis to get two or three men to finish the house\njust like he they can work. We paid\nthem for sixty dollars to complete the\nwork. Can you advance the same\nas asked by for these men engaged to\ndo the work.\nJust a word in regard to our surrender these men who had permission to cut timber near our river he has a leader and we need one to go to scale the land loss. We request the Indian Department to send us one. They know when would be right to scale the logs.\n\nYours Truly\n\nChief Joe & Ashenweskey\n\nMark\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose you herewith a letter received from Chief Joe Aheahawasagai of the Henvey Inlet Band, the first part of which refers to the completion of the school teacher's house, lumber & material for which are now on the ground.\n\nThe understanding in regard to the building of the house was, that the men of the Band were to do the work required in completing the building, & they promised to do so when I visited the Reserve in August last. It is quite evident however from the chief's letter that they do not now intend to carry out this promise, & as it is most important that the work of completing the house should be done at once, before the cold weather sets in, I beg to recommend that the chief's request that the sum of $60 be paid to the three men to finish the house be granted.\n\nI may add that the teacher Miss Ada McIntosh will undoubtedly resign her position unless the house is completed, & it will be a most difficult task to induce anyone to go there to take charge of the school, unless there is a house for the teacher to live in.\n\nIn regard to the chief's request that a scaler be sent up to scale the logs, now being taken out on their Reserve by Miss Burton & Son, on behalf of the Band, I beg to say that I do not consider\nSir,\n\nit necessary to have a scale set up for this purpose, for the reason that the logs are being taken out by contract by Thomas Wilcox of Parry Sound, & the experience of lumbermen in this District who have taken out logs by contract has been that the contractor always gets a good scale for the logs he takes out. I therefore think that the scale now being made by an Ontario licensed scaler will be a correct one & cannot see the necessity of appointing another to scale on behalf of the Indians, unless there are good & sufficient reasons given why such action should be taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Maclean\nIndian Dept.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 28th November, 1900.\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nMr Superintendent Maclean of Parry Sound forwards a letter from the Chief of the Henvey Inlet Band referring to the completion of their school teacher's house. The Chief requests that $60.00 be allowed as wages for three men to finish the house, which the Band will not do although they promised the Superintendent to complete the work. Mr Maclean recommends that the Chief's request be complied with, as the teacher cannot remain without suitable accommodation. The necessary material has been purchased by authority of the Department and I think that the Superintendent should be instructed to have the work finished at once.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOTTAWA, 28th November, 1900\n\nSIR,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th instant enclosing a communication from the Chief of the Nauy Inlet Band, which refers to the completion of the school teacher's house; and in reply I beg to say that you may, as recommended, authorize the employment of three men to finish the house for the sum mentioned, namely $60.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nW.H.

Lime = $1.75\n- Labor 1 day for 1 man at $1.50 = $1.50\n- Freighting material from Byng Field = $3.00\n\nTotal Cost = $24.75\n\nWhen I visited Henry Inlet in July last I noticed that there was no brick chimney at the teacher house, the stove pipe being merely run through the roof, which is\nIndian Agent's Office,\n\n263798\n\nMost dangerous, so that a brick chimney is absolutely necessary for safety.\n\nThe interior of the house is not plastered; the walls being sheathed boards. Painting the walls & floor will make the house much more habitable & more easily kept clean & this is a consideration which will make it easier to secure a teacher for the school at this Reserve.\n\nI have secured a teacher to re-occupy the Henry Inlet School on October 1st in the person of Miss Ada Mcintosh who has formerly been in charge of this School, & I desire to have the improvements completed before her arrival at the Reserve. I will therefore thank you to authorize me to have the work done as soon as possible.\n\nI wish Chief Joe Akahawaragai on the 1st met about this matter & attach herewith his reply.\n\nAll of the materials required can be purchased at Kyng Inlet but will have to be freighted to the Reserve in a sail boat a distance of 15 miles.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nW.Maclean\n\nIndian Dept.\nOttawa, 18th September, 1903.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 15th instant, submitting an estimate of the cost of improvements and repairs which are required to be made to the teacher's house on the Henvey Inlet Reserve, and in reply I beg to inform you that you may have the work done at the price mentioned by you, namely $27.75.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK REDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nW.B.

The outside walls are built of inch lumber, and the joints are battened; the inside walls are dressed lumber, and the joints have shrunk. The house, after the fire goes out in winter, is very cold, and uncomfortable for the persons domiciled there in. I would suggest that while Mr. White is on the ground constructing the schoolhouse, that he be engaged to put on a sheeting of tar felt paper on the outside, with a covering of inch lumber and battens as is at present. I think the work can be done cheaper at present under the circumstances. The matter of fuel, keeping up the warmth of the house is a drain on the Teacher's Salary.\n\nHoping this suggestion will meet your approval, before Mr. White leaves the village.\n\nI am Sir your obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMcDonald\nOttawa, July 13, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th inst., suggesting certain repairs to the Teacher's cottage at Henvey Inlet.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, before authorizing this work, the Department will require an estimate of the amount of material needed and the cost.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nD.

It will be necessary to remove the walls and cover the walls on the outside with shingled building paper, two thicknesses and cover same with pine siding also put platform across front of building 6' in width floored with pine flooring also build porch 14' x 16'. The steps inside will again be replaced with two thickness of building paper and covered with matched boards, also new set of steps to platform at front door.\n\nI am prepared to do this work at once and furnish all material for the sum of One hundred and twelve Dollars ($112.00).\n\nP.S. The size of building is 15' x 17' with walls 13' high.\n\nGeorge W.

I may say that building is all completed and makes a very much needed improvement in the teacher quarters.\n\nThe signal arrangements are that the Dept. was to supply the material and the Indians do the work. After materials were sent they refused to go on with the work. I wrote the Department for authority to engage a White man (contractor) to work up but found the lumber was still lying at the wharf and the building place not being very desirable he came back. So I went up and arranged with the Indians to go ahead with the work and engaged a few them about half what the White man wanted. I shall the teacher help there time and allowed them 15 cents per hour which was I think about a normal amount to generally get the job done but I think in future it would be better to let the work be given White men or Indians by contract\u2014it would be more satisfactory as it takes too much looking after. In this case the teacher Joe Partridge is a very honest fellow and as he was anxious to get the job done took considerable interest in the work and charged out three or four times to make things come into all right.\n\nI am your obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n**INFORMATION**\n\n| DATE | AMOUNT |\n|------|--------|\n| Dec 19/12 |        |\n| Authorised by Dept.

General of Indian Affairs,\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter, addressed to me,\ndated 2nd July last, File No. 153, 879-18 instructing me,\nme in consultation with Mr. School Inspector Grant, to\nobtain the services of a properly qualified teacher for the\nStone Indian School after the Summer holidays. I beg to\nreport that we both failed to secure a teacher till about\nthe latter end of August when Miss Maggie, the former\nteacher, applied to be again appointed to the School.\n\nSome correspondence took place in the course of which\nI stated \"you may resume your School at once but\nyour salary for the September quarter will be according\nto the proportion of days you actually teach in the quarter.\"\n\nShe commenced her work on the 14th September and\ntaught 13 days. Her salary is $200 per annum.\n\nA difference of opinion exists between Mr. Grant and\nmyself as to the amount of remuneration to which this\nteacher is entitled.\n\nI consider that she should receive $\\frac{13}{216}$ of $200\nthus being 216 teaching days in the year or the sum of $12.44\nMr. Grant considers that we should find the average number\nof teaching days in the September quarter and pay her\naccording to the proportion of days she has taught to that\nnumber.\nMy objections to his contention are that it is rather difficult to find the number of teaching days in a September quarter\u2014that she was not engaged till the 14th September when she assumed charge of the School and has not consequently any right to receive advantage of the Summer holidays for that she would thereby receive $25 for 13 days' work which seems unreasonable.\n\nHis objections to my contention are that Miss Maguire having taught during the first and second quarters of the present year and part of the third quarter namely, 135 days is entitled 5/6 of the annual salary, that is $125\u2014that she has received $100 and is therefore justly entitled to $25. He puts it in another way as follows\u2014That teachers in the employ of the Department receive the full salary of the September quarter for teaching from 26 to 30 days and that she having taught 13 days is justly entitled to half the quarter's salary namely $25.\n\nMr. Grant ignores the fact that the teacher completely severed her connection with her School on the 30th June and entered into a totally new engagement on the 14th Sept.\n\nWhile I do not admit that the adjustment of an Indian School teacher's salary comes within the province of a School Inspector's duty, I think it proper, lest any injustice be done either to the teacher or the Parry Island Interest fund, to lay the matter before you for decision.\n\nI have, of course, sent in the teacher's salary requisition according to my view of the case.\n\nI also send in a requisition for school materials.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMrs. Walton\nIndian Agent\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant relative to the salary due the teacher of the Skene School for last quarter; and in reply I have to say that Miss McQuire will be paid the amount asked for in your requisition. Her engagement being considered as a new engagement she is only entitled to payment for the actual number of days taught during the quarter. Should she continue to teach to the 30th June, the end of the school year, she will be paid a year's salary $200 the difference being paid with the last quarter's salary.

I tried the District exam at Lindsay in 1906.\n\nMy teaching experience extends over three years. I taught for one year at Madawaska, one year at Goderich, Lake of Bays, Muskoka, and I have taught the Gibson Indian Reserve school in Muskoka, as you know. I left the same to take stenography which does not agree with my health. I am of Scotch parentage and of Presbyterian persuasion.\n\nI will endeavor to do my best by the Indian children, regardless of their religious persuasion!

In neither Miss Forrest's nor your communication is any reference made to the salary. As you are aware a salary of from $400.00 to $500.00 was offered for a qualified teacher. In view of the fact that Miss Forrest has had considerable experience, although she is not the holder of a professional certificate, the Department will allow her a salary at the rate of $400.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nD.

Taylor arrived from Toronto on Friday 4th and I sent him to Perry Island on Saturday. He left school on Monday I wrote down on Monday afternoon and found his failing letters blue. It is certainly a tiresome place for a white woman, and will be hard to keep a teacher there. Most of the Indians there can speak English and do not seem to try to. There is no cow nearer than 5 miles and Perry Island is 9 miles.\n\nI tried to advise her to stay, and I would recommend that she get salary $450 per ann. She does not want to stay for any less. I think it would be a good idea to have school kept going during July. We have been so long vacant, if Mr. Taylor stays at all I think we can get him to keep school open during July if children will attend. Let me know what you think of that. There are some small things wanted for teacher's house. Door, a 1/2 opening for bed, 1 mattress, 2 chairs, 2 doors, 4 window screens, 2 window shades, a few cups, plates, 1 fork, knife and some dishes.

Taylor as teacher of the Skene School, Parry Sound Agency. Mrs. Taylor is the holder of a limited Third-class certificate. She took up her work on Monday, the 27th of May and the Agent visited the school that afternoon. It is a very lonesome place for a teacher to live. Mrs. Taylor is not inclined to stay unless she gets a salary of $450.00 per annum. The agreement was to pay her $400.00. The Band contributes $150.00 towards the salary of the teacher of this school. In view of the extreme difficulty that we have in securing qualified teachers, I am of the opinion that it would be well to allow Mrs. Taylor the salary asked.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, June 14, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 26th ultimo I beg to say that the Department has decided to pay Mrs. Taylor, teacher of the Shene School, at the rate of $450.00 per annum.

In the meantime Miss Desire might be given the position temporarily, with salary of $300.00 per annum, upon the distinct understanding that she will vacate the position should the services of a qualified teacher be obtained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA.

The appointment of Miss Decaire was only temporary and Mr. Superintendent Logan will be informed that her services will not be required after the Christmas holidays.

Mr. Inspector Moore reports that the present teacher, Miss Decaire, has no professional qualifications and is lacking in scholarship and he has offered to try and secure a qualified teacher if the Department is willing to pay a salary of $500.00. Mr. Moore has been advised that the Department will be glad to accept his services in this direction.\n\nYou are hereby authorized to inform Miss Decaire that her services will not be required after the 31st of December, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

I have to buy for all the necessaries, and wood beside, and the living is so high.\n\nIn conclusion I find that the fixed salary are not sufficient to keep for one going. I feel I ought to be earning more $40.00 at least. Perhaps when you take into consideration the fact that I have been devoted my time to what few scholars there is in this lonely spot, I assure you no qualified teacher would devote their\nTheir time, more than I do and you will not think this is unreasonable request, and be inclined to grant. I need not say that in any case while I remain in this place my best energies will continue to be as they have hitherto been, devoted to their entire interests.\n\nTrusting to be favored with a kind consideration regarding this matter,\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMary D. McCaig\nI beg to enclose an\nenclosed report of Plain School\nParry Island. I am also enclosing a letter\nI received from the teacher. You will notice\nin the report there are only 45 children attending\nschool. That is all the scholars that are available\nand I am quite sure it will be almost im-\npossible to get a qualified White Woman to\nstay there especially in the winter time\nand $500.00 with the necessary expenses of\nrunning the school rather high for the number\nof pupils. Miss Dickens is an Indian girl\nfrom Bathurst Reserve and she is anxious\nto keep on. If she could get an increase of\nsalary say $50.00 The parents of the\nscholars she has say they are pleased with\nher and would like her to stay in the winter\nand I think under the circumstances the\nDept should give her $50.00 more and keep her\non in the winter. Notwithstanding the above\nthe Inspector approves. He wants me to advocate\nand offer $50.00 (If your Department thinks it\nbetter I'll do so.) Kindly let me know and\nI will try through the proper papers. But I\nthink it's a needless expense.\n\n[Signature]\nSam Jones, Assistant Agent\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa, November 13, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant enclosing a communication from Miss Decaire, teacher of the Skene School, in which she asks for an increase in salary to $350.00.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to grant this increase. As you were informed in letter of October 5th, last, it is desirable that a properly qualified teacher should be secured for this school, if at all possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

As the pupils will be graduating next month from the various normal and model schools it might be possible at that time to secure the services of a satisfactory, and you might advise Miss Decaire that should the Department be successful in obtaining the services of such a person hers will not be required after the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

It would hardly appear advisable to keep the school open for this small number unless there are others at a greater distance who might attend. It is presumed that those who have moved to be closer to work at Depot Harbor and Parry Sound might arrange to have their children attend the white schools and the children that are left might be provided for in one or other of the industrial schools.

Pupil desks and seats require renewing, as the present desks are in a dilapidated condition; as they are old and homemade.

In regard to the desks the number needed should be stated and shipping directions should be given, in order that they may be forwarded by freight.\n\nIn reference to the Ryerson school the Department does not understand the recommendation of the Council that dressed lumber be supplied for the desks, as it is not considered advisable to put home-made desks in the school. In regard to the repairs the same detailed information should be obtained and your communications should be kept separate.\n\nThe Department does not appear to have any record of a report from you as to the urgent necessity for these repairs.\n\nWith regard to the desks for the Skene school I may say that on May 7th, last, you were asked to obtain a diagram of the school-room, showing the location of the desks, the number of rows and the number of seats in each row.\n\nD. J. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nrow and to give directions to have them forwarded by freight. This matter evidently was not attended to.\n\nThe Department will expect to have the detailed information asked for above at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSkene School\n\nIndian school, Parry Island.\n\nThis school is about nine miles from the Ryerson School. Mr. Kelvie is in charge of the school and holds a Third Class Provincial Certificate, and has been in charge for over five years. The few children who attend school through the teacher's persuasion, are making some progress in their studies.\n\nThe school house is built on a slight sandy slope in front of a large lumber harbor, with spacious play grounds. The structure is built on cedar posts, which makes it very cold in the winter. The cold draft coming through floor necessitates a continuous heavy fire in the stove. If a concrete or stone foundation was built under the building room, the expenditure would be saved from the extra fuel that is consumed in keeping the school room warm.\n\nThe wood shed built last fall, has proven a boon in keeping the wood dry and fit for fuel.\n\nThe water closets are dilapidated. The two compartments are joined in fact there is no privacy or seclusion in the present closets.\n\nThe school should be repaired with a new floor and paint and other minor repairs. Then the Skene School would be a substantial and comfortable building for years to come.\n\nThe fence around the teachers house requires some repairs. Also, if a small wood shed was built for the teachers use, with a door and lock thereon, would prevent the pilfering of wood.\n\nD. Macdonald\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of No.\n\nRyerson, and Stone Schools Parry Island Reserve, Shawanaga Indian School, Henry Inlet School, and the Watha Band School Gibson Reserve. And I herewith inclose you a Copy of the same Ryerson and Stone Schools I will visit the Schools and send you an approximate Estimate of the Costs made by a master mechanic. Hoping this will meet your approval.\n\nI am Sir\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nD.J. Macdonald\nIndian Agent\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 8th February.\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter regarding the Ryerson and Stone Indian Schools on Pany Island Reserve. In reply referring to the \"Stone School\" and the seats which are of the Old Home style, made when the school house was built. Some of the seats are somewhat rickety. But there are sufficient seats for the number of pupils attending this school. The average attendance never exceeds 10 pupils - from five to seven are about the weekly attendance. And there are sufficient seats to serve their purpose until the midsummer holidays. The school requires a new floor laid before any desk seats could be placed in proper form. There are eight double seats in fair shape; it is the warped and uneven floor that causes the trouble.

Your remarks have now been carefully noted and the Department will await your estimate of the cost of a new floor, a suitable foundation, the erection of new closets, the painting, repairs to the fences, the erection of a small woodshed for the teacher, new window sashes, clapboarding, etc., etc. This information should be in detail and should be such as will enable the Department to come to a decision in the matter. It is presumed that the best time to do this work will be during the next summer holidays.\n\nFrom your report it is evidently not necessary to take any action in respect to supplying new desks at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

It reached here late on Sat last & have waited so often since that I could see you. I am sorry to say that I did not find matters so satisfactory as I could have desired. In the first place I never thought to find me bedding furnished. I did not think that the teacher would be supposed to bring bedding or any household utensils with her. I might have asked Mr. McLean about that sort of thing but never thought such would be in the cottage.\n\nNow Chief, I should like to ask your opinion about the matter. I thought perhaps you might deem it advisable to furnish bedding & all other necessaries to work with, and have them\nleft in the cottage so that they might be available for all your teachers, as it is quite a little expense for the teachers on such small salary.\n\nI am confident if you do so you will find everything in first-class condition when I leave your school.\n\nKindly allow me to submit a list of such articles as are really necessary\u2014 I. For bedding\u2014\nThink 2 pairs of flannel sheets, a good pair of heavy blankets, 4 or 2 comforters, 2 pillows with covers\u2014I could make the covers and sheets if you preferred\u2014this seems to me to be the very least that should be put along with. Do you not think so?\n\nMr. James will tell you the conditions the cottages is in.\n\nII. There the dishes here comprise 3 bowls. There is needed a few everyday cups, saucers, knives, forks, plates, sugar cups, milk jug, pepper caster, dishpan, tea pie, bake plate, dust pan, oil can, wash board, broom & lamps and towels. When the chairs. We have no one to wash the floor with.\n\nThe cottage needs a thorough cleaning & the stove & fires need blacking to make the\nplace at all presentable or to give any assurance\nof our good faith to him in his former offer\nto come into it. I have looked over the school\nroom and it is entirely clean.\n\nNow Chief may be reassured by the hope that\nmy opinion about the matter may coincide\nwith yours.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted,\n\nJ.E.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. Peter Pamasigi,\nChristian Island, Ont.\nAt the Council meeting held at Parry Sound Nov 2nd, 1915.\n\nMoved by James Walker seconded by Phillip Menomenee that this Council resolve that the teacher's house for Skene School at the Lower Village be sold to Samson Chechockconce for two hundred dollars ($200.00) and the above amount to be paid from their interest money that comes every six months.\n\nCarried.\n\nAlexander Logan,\nIndian Agent.\nParry Sound, November 24th, 1915.\n\nAt the Council Meeting held at Parry Sound on Nov 2/15.\n\nYou will see that the principle business was the disposal of the teachers houses now vacant at the Lower and Upper Villages. There has been a lot of rivalry among them about the purchase of buildings.\n\nI would recommend that Samson Checkoonce offer of $200.00 be accepted for Skene teacher's house at Lower Village. I don't suppose it will be used any more as the most of the Indians are locating nearer to Parry Sound at the Upper end of the Island.\n\nAlso that Chief Megis and Phillip Menomenee's offer for Upper Village teachers house be accepted. It is better that those buildings be occupied, if the Department is satisfied as to system of payment. Samson Checkoonce receives four shares twice a year, interest money while Chief Megis receives one share and Phillip Memomenee one share twice a year. The Chief is willing that his salary of $50.00 per annum be applied also.\n\nI would suggest that old school house at Lower Village be given to Roman Catholic for the use of the priest when he visits there and the Upper Village school house be given to the Methodists. They want to use it in connection with their Church. I think these buildings had better be put in charge of some person at once.\n\nTrusting all the above may meet with your approval,\n\nYours etc.,\nAlexander Logan,\nOttawa, December 3, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo submitting minutes of the Council Meeting of the Parry Sound Band in which they recommend that the residence in connection with the old Skene School building be sold to Samson Chookoonce for the sum of $200.00 and that the teacher's residence in connection with the old Ryerson School building be sold to Chief Negis and Phillip Menominee for the same amount.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of these resolutions and payment may be made as recommended by you.\n\nWith regard to your suggestion that the old school buildings should be set apart, one for the use of the Roman Catholic priest and the other for the use of the Methodist minister, I beg to say that the Department will have no objection to this arrangement, but the consent of the council should be first obtained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The balance due amounts to $25.00 and it is considered that the woman should be able to make payment of the same at an early date.

Mr. Loiselle's remarks on the September Quarterly Return, 1896.\n\nThe number of pupils present at school is very small indeed at present some were still in the States some were working at home other have parents too careless to send their children to school. There ought to be something done to compel children to attend, it is a great pity to see so many children wasting their time in such a way as this.\n\n(sgd) H.O. Loiselle.\nTeacher.\nSir,\n\nMr. Loiselle, the teacher of the Church of England School at Pierreville in his report states that the number of pupils present is very small at present owing to the carelessness of parents.\n\nThe Department would like you to use your influence to induce parents to send their children to school regularly. You might inform them that unless a marked improvement takes place, the Department will be compelled to enforce the regulations relating to the education of Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.

Mr. Loiselle the new teacher of the Protestant School at St. Francis, you cannot without further orders forward a requisition for his salary as Teacher. I beg to say that on the 6th of June last (P.O. No. 12848) you were officially notified that the Revd. H.

And the agent that I've force them to send their children to full time. They would send them to the Porhain School. I went to the Agent on the third thereof and he refused squarely to give me a permit to proceed so I can not do anything.\n\nAnd three of them pupils are attending the Porhain School because they are allowed to attend school only two hours a day. Let me tell you also that the Agent went to consult the prior before take in his final step. But I see by the action of the Agent that he is determined to put aside all the school laws. So if he is not compelled by this Department to respect their laws we will never have any justice in this place. I am sure that he shows partially by allowing these pupils to attend Porhain School only two hours a day. Would he not have done some other own school?\nas well as in the Roman.\n\nI would ask you, Sir, to attend this matter at your earliest convenience. I have fixed for my interview with the Agent.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Johnson, Truant Officer\n\nP.S.

J'esp\u00e8re que cette ann\u00e9e encore je serais bien fait pour surveiller (ma\u00eetre officier) pour l'\u00e9cole publique du village.\n\nIl y a quelques temps Jean Thibault est venu se plaignir d'une qu'il avait quelques enfants qui ne assistaient pas r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole.\n\nMalgr\u00e9...\nQuelque ses av\u00e9rifications,\net il demandait en m\u00eame\ntemps decrire aux personnes\nen charge de ces enfants la\npour les avoir qu'elle r\u00e9p-\npassent \u00e0 avoir du d\u00e9sagr\u00e9-\nment et elle n'avaient pas\nr\u00e9guli\u00e8rement leurs enfants\n\u00e0 \u00e9cole. C'est ce que je fis et je\nleur \u00e9crivis.\n\nQuelques jours plus tard,\nplus \u00e9videmment revint Andr\u00e9\nque c'\u00e9tait toujours la m\u00eame\nchose, et il voulait prendre les\nproches en justice contre ces\npersonnes l\u00e0. Je l'aidais alors\nd'apporter un peu, je j'allais\naller moi-m\u00eame voir ces per-\nsonnes l\u00e0 afin de leur faire\ncompte pour qu'elle raisonne\nelles ne se conformaient pas\n\u00e0 nos av\u00e9rifications.\nJe fis deux voyages \u00e0 cet effet.\nJe vis l'institutrice le M. B.\nLaizelle, je consultai le journal\nde cette ville, je vis les personnes\ndont on parlait, je vis aussi\nd'autres personnes dignes de\nfai, elles ont le chef Joseph\nLavert et Hubert et voici\nelles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 les informations\nque j'ai recueillies.\nJ'avoue que je ne peux pas dire\nde Louis Denis, qui garde chez\nlui\nLui est un descendant de Louis Pigeon.\n\nLouis Denis est un catholique qui est mari\u00e9 avec une personne dont le nom est Marie. Louis Denis est le p\u00e8re de Louis Pigeon et le fr\u00e8re de Thomas Pigeon. Louis Denis est protestant de naissance mais il ne fait pas profession d'aucune religion. Il conna\u00eet Marie depuis longtemps. Thomas Pigeon, qui est un enfant de plusieurs enfants, est un voyageur en train parce qu'il gagne sa vie en travaillant. Il est une personne qui accepte de lever ses enfants, qui sont gar\u00e7ons et filles chez elle. Elle est la m\u00e8re de Louis Denis et elle travaille \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de lui. Louis Denis est n\u00e9 \u00e0 Saint-Denis-de-la-Plaine et il est mari\u00e9 \u00e0 Marie Pigeon. Louis Denis est un homme de bonne r\u00e9putation et il est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un bon p\u00e8re. Louis Denis est un homme de bonne r\u00e9putation et il est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un bon p\u00e8re.\nfigura durant l'espace de deux heures avant-midi et au-\nvant apr\u00e8s-midi, il ne le\nreste du temps, il le gardait\nchez lui, pour lui aider \u00e0\ntravailler les autres, afin\nde se d\u00e9barrasser un peu\ndes d\u00e9penses qu'il faisait pour\nla navigation et la construc-\ntion, et qu'il manifesterait les\nmaisons de garder compl\u00e9-\nment pour rien, il ne\nen autre qu'il en avait parl\u00e9\nau M. M. Lucille l'entendre\net que ce dernier lui\navait r\u00e9pondu qu'il ne plus\nfaire pas de cela \u00e9tait de chose\nde vis le M. Lucille, qui\nl'avait une fois Louis Denis\ndisait \u00eatre la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et que\nil ne serait pas en qui se plaignait\nde vis alors le surveillant\nJean Th\u00e9venant, il lui dit\nque qu'il ne lui faudrait pas\nraisonnable de prendre les\nproc\u00e8s contre Louis Denis,\net qu'il \u00e9tait difficile d'exiger\nde ce dernier plus qu'il ne\nfaisait. Mais Th\u00e9venant ne\nfait pas de cette opinion-l\u00e0,\nil continua \u00e0 discuter\nDenis et lui faire des\nmenaces.\nAu bout de quelques jours\nje les vois encore et demeure\ntoujours alors que je ne peux pas\nme rappeler pas \u00eatre fran-\n\u00e7aise et avoir la pri\u00e8re de la\n\u00e9cole protestante. Il \u00e9tait\nd\u00e9j\u00e0 trop tard pour passer au\nniveau catholique. Je me rap-\npelle que c'\u00e9tait une affaire\ndifficile et que m\u00eame le p\u00e8re\nPeyre ne pouvait pas\nl'\u00e9cole catholique.\n\nElle qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 la plus\navant tout, mais pas\nde la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, en disant que\nc'est moi qui a envoy\u00e9 les\nenfants \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole catholique,\nmais bien s\u00fbr pas de leur\nplaisir.\n\nD'ailleurs, elle est partie\nprotestante en pleine \u00e9cole\ncatholique, elle y a dans le village\nd'autres familles protestantes\nqui perdent encore leurs\nenfants, soit \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole catho-\nlique du village, soit aux couvents\nde St-Fran\u00e7ois-du-Lac.

Accordingly I did so.\n\nSome days later Jean Tahamont came back and told me that the same state of affairs continued, and that he wished to take legal proceedings against these persons. I then told him to wait a little, as I would go myself and see these persons, in order to find out why they did not comply with our notification. Twice I went on this business. I saw the teacher, the Rev. H.O. Loiselle; I examined the\nschool register; I saw the persons complained of; I also saw other persons of worthy character, such as Chief Joseph Laurent and others; and the following is the information that I gathered.\n\nThe Truant Officer complained first of Louis Denis, who has living with him one of his grand-nephews, Louis Paquette. Louis Denis is a Roman Catholic; he is married to a Protestant. His grand-nephew, Louis Paquette, is the child of his brother-in-law, Thomas Paquette, who is nominally a Protestant, but who in fact does not profess any religion; I have myself for a long time known Thomas Paquette, who is a widower and who has several children; he is a drunkard and drinks all that he earns when he works, and he does not take any trouble about his children, who are scattered amongst people here and there. Louis, the one in question, has been living with his uncle Louis Denis for three years. Louis Denis tells me that his brother-in-law, Thomas Paquette, promised to pay him for board and maintenance for his child, but that he has never done so. Thomas Paquette has now been gone for some time; I cannot say where he is.\n\nLouis Denis told me that he sent his nephew, Louis Paquette, who is about fifteen years of age, to school every day for two hours in the morning and for as much in the afternoon, and that during the rest of the time he kept him with him to assist him in his work of basket-making to do a little towards meeting the expense involved in his board and maintenance, and that he had not the means to keep him altogether for nothing. He told me, moreover, that he had spoken about him to the Rev. H.O. Loiselle, the teacher, and that the latter had replied that he was not complaining of this state of affairs. I saw the Rev. Loiselle; he told me that what Louis Denis had said was the truth and that it was not he who was complaining.\nI then saw the Truant Officer, Jean Tahamont, and I told him that it did not seem reasonable to me to take legal proceedings against Louis Denis, and that it was difficult to exact from the latter that he should do more than he was doing; but Tahamont was not of this opinion and he continued to bother Denis and to threaten him.\n\nAfter some days I went back to see them again and Denis told me then that since he could not have peace and quietness with a Protestant school he had decided to send his nephew to the Roman Catholic school. I told him that was his business; and for some time Louis Paquette has attended the Roman Catholic school.\n\nWhoever made the complaint to the Department has not told the truth in saying that it was I who sent the child to the Roman Catholic school; Louis Denis did so of his own free will.\n\nMoreover this is not the only Protestant who attends the Roman Catholic school, there are other Protestant families in the village who prefer sending their children either to the Roman Catholic school in the village or to the Convent of St. Fran\u00e7ois du Lac. They are not solicited in this regard by the Roman Catholics, but the Rev. Sister who directs the school does not refuse to admit those who present themselves; nevertheless she abstains from speaking of religion to the Protestants, contenting herself with teaching subjects in which religion is not concerned.\n\nAs for my personal opinion, I think it would be an encroachment on the individual liberty of the parents to wish to compel them to send their children to one school rather than to another, and I do not believe that I have the power to do so. That is why, so long as children go to school, I do not think it my duty to interfere with them.\n\nAs for Louis Denis, I think he has been doing...\neven more than his duty, and that in the position in which his nephew is he should have been able to keep him with him for two weeks each quarter in accordance with the provisions of the compulsory clause of the regulations in regard to the education of Indian children.\n\nSome people tell me also that Jean Tahamont seems to wish to make use of his position to satisfy his personal dislikes.\n\nIf the Department desires to have fuller information on this subject, I shall give myself the pleasure of forwarding the same.\n\nHoping, however, that these explanations will be satisfactory to you, I beg to subscribe myself,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nA.O. Comire,\nAgent.\n\nN.B.\nThe Department did not tell me in its letter and of the 5th March inst., who it was who complained in regard to what child the charge was made, but if I have gone off in a wrong direction, please give me fuller explanations.\n\nA.O.C.\nJ'ai le 13me jour de janvier 1877 visit\u00e9 l'\u00e9cole des langues protestantes tenue par le M. M. H.O. Loirette et j'ai constat\u00e9 les progr\u00e8s bien satisfaisants, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves sont plus assidus que par le pass\u00e9. Cette \u00e9cole fonctionne bien maintenant.

Loirette et j'ai constat\u00e9 les progr\u00e8s satisfaisants. Cette \u00e9cole est sur un meilleur pied qu'elle ne l'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9. Quinze \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 l'examen.\n\nJ.E. Belcourt\n\nDonn\u00e9 \u00e0 Perceville\nCe 25me jour de mars 1901\nH.O. Loirette\nInstituteur.\nSir,\n\nI am aware the agent has written to you to justify himself in permitting Protestants to send their children to Roman school and permitting them also to attend school only part of the day. He says about the guardian of the boy referred to previously could not keep the boy and send him to school the whole day, for he must work for his board and clothing.\n\nHas he told you that the father of the boy gave him clothes for the worth of thirty dollars. Since three months ago that guardian cannot keep him and send him to school all the time. Naturally the agent would be justified in doing so, that is, sending him only part of the day. But an excuse of that they would take him cloth hide and send him to school all the time. For that man is ready to take the boy at any time. Remember the boy if question will be sixteen years of age in the month of June. I state the agent cannot be justified in doing so. Another thing or reason why he should not do so is because there are seven other children in the same case, that is, are looked after by guardians, and\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nsame right as that one. And what shall we do? and every parent will claim the same rights. What will be the consequences of that? The school will be greatly injured by it, and these children will be robbed from their education. I do not want to leave this Department in the impression that I am too strict about the parents and the laws. Should I see or should it be necessary for the maintenance of the law I make a concession I would be very glad to do so. But he can have a home right off and go to school all the time. Should the present guardian not able to do so, who has to blame the fact? To have allowed the law and the other two refused to previously attend school only part of the day. If already the attendance in our school is not so good as before, you will see that fact in the report of the present teacher. These disturbances our school is made to suffer by and the disturbances among the people in the place are only the result made by our own breaking the laws of this Department. Another thing is that some people claimed their children were sick and kept them away from school. At the same time they were playing outside every day. I know very well they were not sick to prevent them going to school. They were not sick but talk I can prove that. I am sure of that is that they soon they allowed to attend. However, they ought certainly every day.\npart I say no, and have seen proofs that only in the short time that the people thought the Agent would put them into force. We would ask this Department what was the use of existing these laws? That was the use of selecting a Survey Officer to carry the same into effect. We are not to put them into force. Again I mention had the Agent told the people that should they not comply to the laws as far as they can the laws would that would have sufficed to maintain the laws and afford attendance at school.\n\nNow I enclose two of the recording notes of the school inspectors at his visits to our school from time to time by comparing them you will see again effects of the school laws when they where supposed to be in force.\n\nRather than I claim the school laws do not permit Protestant children to attend Roman schools. And the Agent should be made to justify his intrusion to that effect. Should it be necessary to permit pupils to attend school only partly the day. Why did not the agent keep in our own School? He is showing partiality in doing as he did. And we Protestants do want such intrusion in our schools and believe the Department will give justice in that matter.\n\nI am for your obedient\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 29th March, 1901\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nAbout a month ago John Tahamont, truant officer for the Protestant school at St Francis, complained that Mr Agent Comire failed to cooperate with him in his efforts to secure a regular attendance at the school, and also that he had taken it upon himself to send a Protestant child to a Roman Catholic school. The Agent was asked for a report in the matter, which has been received, in which he admits that several Protestant children are attending the Roman Catholic school, but not with his connivance, they having been sent there by their parents, owing to the over-zealousness on the part of the truant officer, who wishes them to attend full time although by Section 4 of the Regulations children whose services are urgently required may be exempted from attendance.\n\nThis is the gist of the complaint and the Agent's defence. I do not think that the Department should be called upon to carry out the views of the truant officer, as it would only lead to a repetition of the religious troubles which have taken place frequently on this reserve. The teacher of the Protestant school might be instructed to make the same concession as to hours of attendance as allowed by the Roman Catholic teacher, and probably this would obviate the difficulty.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Oliver\nOTTAWA, 3rd April, 1901.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th instant in further reference to the complaints made by you against Mr Agent Comire of his having failed to assist you in carrying out the regulations relating to the education of Indian children.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a report on this subject has been received from Mr Comire, which puts the matter in a very different light and exonerates him from the charge of having connived at the sending of Protestant children to the Roman Catholic school.\n\nIt would appear from Mr Comire's report that it was owing to your over-zealousness that these children were sent by their parents and guardians to that school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Tahamont,\nTruant Officer,\nSt Francois du Lac,\nQue.\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nSecretary\nOTTAWA, 3rd April, 1901.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd ultimo reporting in regard to the complaints made against you by the truant officer for the Protestant school at St Francois that you have failed to co-operate with him in his efforts to secure a regular attendance and that you took it upon yourself to send a Protestant child to the Roman Catholic school.\n\nIn reply I beg to enclose herewith for your information a copy of a letter of this day's date addressed to the truant officer in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D McLEAN\n\nSecretary\n\nA.O. Comire, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt Francois du Lac,\nQue\nPierreville, Que. April 1st, 1901.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs Ottawa.\n\nSir,\n\nAs I had not space enough in the Report for my remarks, send them separately. As I have often warned this Department that except there would be laws compelling pupils to attend school, the attendance would never be satisfactory.\n\nI am now able to speak with knowledge of the facts. We have had the School laws into force for nearly three quarters. We have had these laws into force so far as to have a Trustee appointed to look after the pupils and it has proved to be the means to secure a good attendance, far better than before. And this fact is proved by comparing the attendance of a number of pupils of the last quarter (the ending December 1860) and the average attendance out of ten is nine. The same pupils in the last quarter have attended an average of\nThere has been no sickness among them to detain them at home.\n\nI am convinced the falling off in the attendance at school is due to the laws not having been upheld by the agent. He has permitted three of our pupils to attend Roman school and to attend the school only part of the day.\n\nThe consequences are that the pupils think they can enjoy the liberty. So they absent themselves from school very freely and very frequently without any good reason.\n\nI may mention also a good number of the parents of my pupils have no education and consequently do not value education in the full extent, and that is why the laws should be put into force here in this place. I would also say with the Agent Officer that the agent has certainly thrown himself very partially regarding the way he dealt in the matter. Especially sending our pupils to Roman school. I would beg this Department to come to our help, and the agent be compelled to bring back our pupils.\nI have spoken to the Agent that I was an unjust way of dealing with us by taking our pupils from our School. That it was against the laws of the Department to do so.\n\nAnd since he wanted to break the laws he could as well do so in our School by permitting the pupils to attend school only part of the day. He thought the Truant Officer wanted to be too strict. I do not think he was, because the pupils refused to go back to school very well. They told the Agent they were sick but were not suffering they were we would not ask them to come to school. For had they been sick they would not have been able to play out every day.\n\nI am speaking with knowledge of the facts. I am their teacher and missionary and would not deal unfairly with them. I would also do all in my power to prevent the Truant Officer of being so harsh with them.\n\nI am. Sir, your obedient servant\n\nH.O. Lisselle\nOTTAWA, 10th April, 1901.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the last instant in reference to the enforcement of the regulations relating to the education of Indian children on the St. Francis reserve and in reply I beg to inform you that Mr. Agent Comire has reported on the complaints made against him by the truant officer appointed to look after the pupils attending the Protestant school taught by you, in which he denies emphatically that he took it upon himself to send any Roman Catholic Protestant child to a Roman Catholic school, and attributing the fact that the children referred to were sent to the Roman Catholic school by their parents and guardians on account of the over-zealousness (not to say officiousness) of the truant officer, who was nagging at the parents. You will see by reference to the regulations, paragraph 5, that the truant officer is to perform such services as may be deemed necessary by the Indian Agent, by whom he is appointed, and by Section 4 of such regulations.\n\nRev. H.O. Loiselle,\nProtestant Missionary and Teacher\nPierreville, Que\nregulations, that the Indian Agent is authorized, when he is satisfied that the services of a child are required at home for household duties, etc., to relieve such child from attendance at school for a certain period.\n\nThe Agent states that the services of the children referred to were actually necessary for a portion of the day at their homes, and that, if the same concession had been allowed them at your school as at the Roman Catholic school their parents would not have removed them.\n\nI may add in conclusion that the Department desires, if possible, to avoid any religious clash on this reserve, and it thinks that if you would see the Agent personally, the trouble complained of might be amicably settled.\n\nA copy of this letter will be sent Mr Agent Comire, who will be requested to co-operate with you in trying to arrange this difficulty.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary\nOTTAWA, 10th April, 1901\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of a letter of even date addressed to Rev. Mr. Loiselle, teacher of the Protestant school on the St. Francis Reserve in further reference to the complaints made against you by the truant officer appointed to look after the pupils attending his school. The Department would be glad if, as suggested, you would be good enough to consult and co-operate with the teacher with a view to arriving at an amicable settlement of the difficulty.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nSecretary\n\nA. O. Comire, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Francois du Lac,\nQue.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reference to the statements in your letter, that the Agent has not taken upon himself to send pupils to Ponsonby school, that they were sent by their parents or guardians, on account of the unreasonableness of the Trustee Officer.\n\nI may state, sir, that it was through the Agent's zeal for his religious principles.\n\n1st. In the statement of the Agent, he says that he has not taken upon himself to send pupils to Ponsonby school. One of the guardians who has sent his boy to Ponsonby school told the school teacher the Agent told him to do so, and there was a person present at the time. And this witness says even more than that; he says the Agent told the guardian to send his boy to Ponsonby school, that the Trustee Officer would have no more power over either the guardian or the boy, nor have any sufficient corps to show the Agent has done so.\n\n2nd. Having broken the laws, first by taking pupils from our school, he went off, he followed them by pupil to attend school only two hours a day while the laws say, if any pupils are urgently needed at Ponsonby, they\nThey could be relieved from attendance at school for two weeks each quarter. It would be found that these pupils that are attending Roman Catholic have not attended the third of the last quarter, and in the present one there has not been no school twice and the other do not attend half the time.\n\nThe effects on our school are that the pupils are not regular to attend school, everywhere and always come late. I will take such pains to inform the Department regarding our school. This because we have the education of our youth at heart more than any Agent which is nothing except their success.\n\nWe hope that you will take into consideration this request by ordering the Agent to report the facts regarding schools where they are so much needed in this place, as well as regarding the Attendance at school and the Protestant pupils attending their own schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Tahamont, Agent\n\nLewis Water, councillor\nPeriville May 15th 1907\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs Attache\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your letter of April 27th\n\nNo 154520 I must say:\n\n1st To the statement that the agent has not taken upon himself to send Protestant pupils to Roman School. The proofs are clear enough to show that know the facts. The guardian of one pupil told me himself that he had sent his boy to that school on the advice of the agent who told him that if he send the boy there the Indian Officer would have no more jurisdiction over him.\n\nThere was also a person present at the time who says the same thing as the guardian. He says even more, that if he send the boy to Roman School he would give him a paper allowing him to attend school only part of the day. I think there are good proofs. I have another proof it is myself. I went to the agent the day before he gave permission to the guardian to send the boy to Roman School.\nI confided with him what plan should be best to adopt to secure a good attendance at school and I was assured that he was to tell the people to send the pupils to school unless there are urgent cases to keep them at home and I was convinced that this would have been enough. Accordingly he came the next day, he went to one of the guardians and came to my school my school after and told me the boy would be sent to Roman School and there would be no more trouble about him. We got these feet enough proofs to show that he has told the guardian to send the boy to that school? They are sufficient I think to convince any one that are not partial in the matter.\n\n2nd In your letter you refer me to the regulations of the school laws that the agent is authorized when the services of a child are required at home for household duties, he may be relieved from attendance at school for any period not exceeding two weeks during each of the four school terms. The truant officer has never tried to deprive parents or any guardians of that right.\nright. And as teacher I know that the boy was attending school not even a third of the time so there was insufficient reason to think a better attendance at School. When I knew he would have attended school more than he did. Do these regulations mean anything? It appears they do not. Again I say why has not the Agent gave the boy the same allowance in our School as he does in the Romanes?\n\nThis shows partially on the part of the Agent. And I ask why should the Department allow the Agent to do such an injustice to the Delicatant body in this place?\n\n3rd. As such proceeding our School is made to suffer, the attendance of other pupils is not near as good as before and the pupils do not come in time either, they are kept from school for the least little thing which would be done after school hours as well.\n\n4th. According to your advice, I have seen the Agent and asked his cooperation to have a better attendance at School but there is not any change in the matter. I am sorry he has not\nnot taken the right steps at first. It would have been so easy at first. Besides there is the lack of the pupils' interest in their education which I have at heart.\n\nI have asked the agent to follow the same reasoning that Protestant children should be sent to Protestant school. He said he would do so if he was asked by the Department to do so. So I would beg of the Department to ask him to do so.\n\nNow I want the Department to know that in making these statements I have no other interests than the good of the pupils and progress in the school. If I were not convinced that what I require is absolutely necessary I would not ask for them. You have before you by previous correspondence and state of the school and officer, the views that we require. And you have also the testimony of the School Inspector that there have been good progresses made in our school of late years. Would it not be too bad if we let everything fall back where it was before? These are the\nThe reasons that induce me to plead for a better attendance at school. And I have taught here seven years and if I do not know where the fault is in the school and what should be best to remediate it. Does the agent know it better?\n\nI am, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nH. O.

Apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9ception de cette lettre du 10 avril dernier N\u00b0154520, afin de me conformer \u00e0 vos suggestions, j'ai eu le P\u00e8re H. B. Laizelle, Directeur, pour le compte de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'\u00c9ducation des Enfants de la Nation. Il m'a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 de faire une visite \u00e0 la fin des cours de l'ann\u00e9e scolaire. J'ai donc visit\u00e9 les \u00e9coles, afin que je puisse voir les parents de ces enfants. Je leur ai donn\u00e9 les noms de leurs enfants suivants : Samuel Walker, enfant de Sam Walker ; Edwin Waggoner, enfant de J. B.

Carri\u00e8re\nAgent.\nAbenakis Agency,\nSt. Fran\u00e7ois du Lac, 27th May, 1901.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to reply to your letter, No. 154520, of the 21st May inst.\n\nOn receipt of your letter of the 10th April last, No. 154520, in order to comply with your suggestions I called upon the Rev. H.O. Loiselle, the teacher of the Protestant school, and asked him to give me a list of the children who were not attending regularly, in order that I might see the parents of those children. He gave me the names of four children, namely, Solomon and Samuel Watso, children of Sam. Watso, Edwin Nagazona, son of J.B. Nagazona, and Maud Paquette, granddaughter of Robert Paquette, junior.\n\nI told him that I was going to see the parents of those children, and that, if the attendance were not better, if he would inform me of the fact, I should see about taking more energetic measures; but I have not had any further news since, although on several days since that time I have passed through the village in order to take the census of the tribe.\n\nI have seen the parents of the above mentioned children. Some of them told me that their children had been sick; another told me that he absolutely required his children to assist him in gathering drift-wood, which passes at this time in quantities down the river, and that\nhe was unable to let them go while he was collecting his fuel for the following winter. I told them all that they must send their children regularly to school without fail. They promised me to do so, and, as I stated above, I have not had any other news.\n\nI do not see how the truant officer and the teacher can complain that I refused to assist them in obtaining regular attendance of the children at school. I refused permission to the truant officer to interfere with Louis Denis in connection with his nephew Louis Paquette referred to in previous correspondence, because I consider that in that case he had no right, and I am still of the same opinion.\n\nThere appears to be a conspiracy against me in order to discredit me with the Department. You will understand that the agent cannot always please everybody, God Himself does not succeed in that, and in some of the duties that I have to discharge sometimes it happens that there are some discontented people, for instance when I have to act in the capacity of Justice of the Peace and to condemn to prison some members of the band.\n\nI believe in the education of children as much as any person, and I have given proof on many occasions by the sacrifices that I have made with that object; for eighteen years I was Secretary Treasurer of the School Commissioners of St. Pie de Deguire, a neighbouring parish, and I am at present and have been for three years President of the School Commissioners of the village of St. Francois du Lac. Of my six children two are at the Nicolet College, one of the best in the Province of Quebec, the third is in a first-class private school, and the three younger are boarders at the Convent of St. Francois du Lac. It seems to me that these are sufficient facts to testify as to my love for education.\nThe complaints brought against me are vague and have nothing precise in them; it is rather difficult to reply to them in a satisfactory manner.\n\nPlease tell me who is the guardian whom I advised to take his children from the Protestant school and send them to the Catholic school?\n\nIf I had precise and detailed charges, I could give you more complete information in regard to each case.\n\nPlease also tell me what is the section of the law that forbids parents sending their children to a school or institution of their choice for them to be educated there, in order that I may myself be able to explain to the parents in regard to these complaints, that would be more satisfactory to them, and would give greater effect to my instructions in this matter, for it may happen that these parents have not decided to change the school once more.\n\nThe law in regard to the Indians, and particularly the compulsory clause, is made for the whole Dominion, but it may be that the means that would suit the Indians of the Northwest Territories or Manitoba would not be suitable for the Abenakis of St. Francis, who are as much civilized as white men and who have for the most part half or three-quarters of white blood in their veins.\n\nIn my humble opinion I believe that it would be better to try gentleness and persuasions again before resorting to rigorous measures.\n\nAgain, it is possible that the Rev. Mr. Loiselle may not possess in a sufficient degree the aptitude and ability necessary to make a good teacher in order to draw the children to the school and to make them like the school. It seems to me that it would have been much wiser\nif Mr. Loiselle had known in his capacity as minister of\nthe Gospel and as school teacher how to induce the children\nto come to school through love of the work and of the study\nwith which he should have inspired them rather than to wish\nto have them made come to school by means of the lash.\n\nI trust that you will be able to send me the\ninformation asked for,\n\nAnd I subscribe myself,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O. Comire,\nAgent.\nSir:\n\nIt was charged by Tahamont that the Agent took children from the Protestant school and placed them in that of the Roman Catholics. I sent for the parents of the children and at the Protestant mission house, the missionary, Agent, and Tahamont being present asked him why his children were taken from one school and put into another. He said it was because he himself wished to make the change.\n\n(sgd) J.A.

H.O. Loiselle, teacher of the Protestant school on the Abenakis reserve, I beg to say that upon enquiry the Department does not consider that any further action is necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nMr H.L.

No. 154520.\n\nI thank you very sincerely for your kindness in giving me the conclusion arrived at regarding the charges against the Protestant school teacher here. What you have decided may be a wise measure, I do not know. Whatever it be, I must give it up.\n\nI had wished you would probe that matter to the bottom and follow the more cautious policy of His Grace. However, I suppose that His Grace the Archbishop has made a strong prima facie case, and you have accepted his ipse dixit. There is however nothing sure as a gun, it is that if His Grace had any children of school age, he would not want Mr. Leisselle to teach them. There are likewise 5 Protestant heads of Indian families here who don't want Mr. Leisselle at all, to teach their children. There are 7 in number and are attending P.C. schools. The parents of Mr. Leisselle's other pupils are against him also.\n\nMr. Leisselle\nMr. Leviselle is a clergyman\nand whatever he does is right in\nfact, although it is not the kind\nthat makes the most\nAn investigation would have\nshown me down to the ground\n\u2014 I am disappointed but not\ndiscouraged. I know that\n\"when hell is hot, boots will\nand I believe that Mr. Leviselle\nwill get \"get the mittens\" ex-\ncept if no other man can be\ngot to carry on school & Church\nwhich, I admit, is quite doubt-\nful\n\nJame obedient Servant\n\nH. L. Martin\nExtract from records column of the St. Francis Protestant school for the quarter ended Sept. 30th/04 as forwarded by the teacher on his quarterly return.\n\n---\n\nSir:\n\nOn the request of the parents of the pupils defined the school only on the 12th Sept., the number of attendance as you can see is very small. Notwithstanding a good number of them who are in the status with their parents there are three others who could have attended school but did not on account of the parents being neglectful. They have not attended school since the 10th June last.\n\nExcept the Department takes steps to remediate in this case and many others which are so often repeated, the school attendance will always be neglected; experience has shown that fact. Inaugur officials are no one in this place.\n\n(Signed)\n\nH. O. L\u00e9onelle\nTeacher\nPerceville\n\nA. O.

Leiselle et la famille de Samuel Watse depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es d\u00e9j\u00e0 et qui va toujours en s'aggravant de plus en plus, \u00e0 tel point que vers la fin de l'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re il y eut entre eux une petite bataille, et ils se sont poursuivis mutuellement devant les tribunaux et le proc\u00e8s doit se plaider dans le mois prochain.\n\nL'instituteur dit que les enfants de Watse sont paresseux, qu'ils ne savent jamais leurs le\u00e7ons, et il les punit, d'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, Watse pr\u00e9tend que l'instituteur est trop s\u00e9v\u00e8re, trop strict, et qu'il punit ses enfants injustement et comme cons\u00e9quence il ne veut plus envoyer ses enfants \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole et quelques uns des parents de Watse, par sympathie sans doute, ont suivi son exemple.\n\nIl est assez difficile, au travers de tout cela, de savoir\nqui a tort et qui a raison; il est possible qu'il y ait\ndu peur et du centre des deux c\u00f4t\u00e9s.\n\nDepuis l'hiver dernier, je suis all\u00e9 moi-m\u00eame plusieurs\nfois, voir l'instituteur et Watse chacun leur\nteur, afin de t\u00e2cher de r\u00e9tablir l'accord entre eux; j'em-\nployai tous les moyens de persuasion \u00e0 ma disposition et\nsur mes instances, Watse consentit une fois, le printemps\npass\u00e9 \u00e0 renvoyer ses enfants \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole mais cela\nne dura pas longtemps.\n\nMonsieur Samuel Bray, lors de sa visite \u00e0 la r\u00e9serve,\nl'\u00e9t\u00e9 dernier, sur ma recommandation, alla aussi les voir\ndans le m\u00eame but.\n\nMonsieur H.L. Masta le surveillant (truant officier) me\nme dit avoir fait les m\u00eames d\u00e9marches plusieurs fois,\nsans plus de r\u00e9sultat, de sorte que derni\u00e8rement il me\ndit qu'il pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait me donner sa d\u00e9mission de surveil-\nlant (truant officier) plut\u00f4t que de prendre des pr\u00e9c\u00e9-\nd\u00e9s de rigueur, qui disait-il n'auraient pas de meilleurs\nr\u00e9sultats; c'est aussi mon opinion.\n\nWatse est tr\u00e8s ent\u00eat\u00e9 et il ira en prison et payera l'a-\nmende plut\u00f4t que de renvoyer ses enfants \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole, tant\nque le Rev. Leiselle sera l\u00e0 et je ne conseillerais pas,\ndu moins pour le pr\u00e9sent de recourir \u00e0 ces moyens l\u00e0; je\npense que cela ne ferait qu'empirer les choses.\n\nJe les ai revu encore une fois tous les deux la semaine\npass\u00e9e, mais je n'ai pas mieux r\u00e9ussi; comme j'insistais\nautres de Watse, sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 qu'il y avait peur lui,\ndans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de ses enfants, de les envoyer \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole, et\net de ne pas les laisser grandir dans l'ignorance, quand\nm\u00eame il n'aimerait pas l'instituteur, il me r\u00e9pondit qu'il\navait besoin de ses enfants pour lui aider \u00e0 arracher ses\npatates et qu'ensuite il les enverraient dans une autre\n\u00e9cole, mais je pense qu'il ne l'a pas encore fait.\n\nDans le moment, je ne vois pas de rem\u00e8des \u00e0 la situation\nPeut-\u00eatre que ce sera plus facile lorsque leur proc\u00e8s sera fini.\n\nMais \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent, aucun d'eux ne veut abandonner ce qu'il pr\u00e9tend \u00eatre ses justes r\u00e9clamations contre l'autre.\n\nVous pourrez avoir de plus amples d\u00e9tails sur cette affaire l\u00e0 de Mr. Samuel Bray qui a entendu le pour et le contre l'\u00e9t\u00e9 dernier.\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\n[Signature]\nSt. Fran\u00e7ois du Lac, October 26, 1904.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of I.A.\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, No. 154520, of the 20th inst., and in reply I beg to say, in fact, the attendance at the Protestant school in the Abenakis village has not been satisfactory, especially since the latter part of last year and the beginning of this year.\n\nIt would take too long to explain to the Dept. all the details of this matter; it is sufficient for me to say that the principal cause of the trouble is the difference which exists between the teacher, Rev. Mr. Loiselle, and the family of Samuel Watso for several years, and which is getting worse all the time, to such an extent that about the end of last year they had a fight, and they have entered actions against each other and the trial will take place next month.\n\nThe teacher says that Watso's children are idle, that they never know their lessons, and he punishes them; on the other hand, Watso maintains that the teacher is too severe, too strict, and that he punishes his children unjustly, and he will not send his children any more to the school; and some of Watso's relatives, through sympathy no doubt, have followed his example.\n\nIt is rather difficult, in the face of all this, to know who is right and who is wrong; it is possible\nthat they are both partly right.\n\nSince last winter I have gone myself several times to see the teacher and Watsc in turn, in order to try to establish peace between them; I employed all my powers of persuasion, and at my instance Watsc consented once, last spring, to again send his children to the school, but that did not last long.\n\nMr. Samuel Bray, at the time of his visit to the reserve last summer, also went to see them with the same object.\n\nMr. H.J. Masta, the truant officer, tells me that he has also made an attempt several times with no better result, so that lately he says that he would sooner give hand in his resignation as truant officer than take severe measures, which, he says, would have no better result; this is my own opinion.\n\nI again saw both of them last week, but I had no better success; when I insisted with Watsc on the necessity, in the interests of his children, of his sending them to school and not allowing them to grow up in ignorance because he himself did not like the teacher, he replied that he had need of his children to aid him to take up his potatoes and that afterwards he would send them to another school, but I think that he has not yet done so.\n\nAt present I do not see any remedy to the situation; perhaps this will be more easily seen when the trial is over.\n\nBut at the present time neither of them wishes to give up what he contends to be his just claims against the other. You will be able to get full details of the matter from Mr. Samuel Bray, who heard both sides last summer.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nA.O. Comir\u00e9,\nAgent.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 26th October last regarding the trouble between Mr Loisel, teacher of the Protestant school in the Indian village, and Samuel Watso, I have to request that you will be good enough to inform the Department what was the result of the trial when you then stated was to take place. Judging from the teacher's remarks on his school return for December quarter last, the relations are still strained and Watso does not send his children to school. The Department would like you to inform Watso that his children's education must not be neglected on his account of his personal animus against the teacher, and Mr Loisel should be told that he should make every effort to secure the good-will of the parents and that if he cannot succeed in doing so his usefulness is gone.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O. Comire, Esq.\nSecretary\n\nIndian Agent,\nSt Francois du Lac, Que\nTranslation\n\nSr., \u2014 Je me hais de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 votre lettre No. 154520, en date du 19 janvier dernier, comme suit :\n\nLe proc\u00e8s survenu entre le R\u00e9v. H.O. Leiselle et Samuel Watso, a eu lieu vendredi le 10\u00e8me jour du mois de f\u00e9vrier courant, mais les t\u00e9moignages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tellement contra-dictoires que le juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 Sorel, devant qui ce proc\u00e8s a \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9, s'est trouv\u00e9 embarrass\u00e9 pour rendre son jugement et il a pris la chose en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9; le jugement n'est pas encore rendu.\n\nQuant \u00e0 Samuel Watso, le R\u00e9v. Leiselle m'a dit qu'il envoyait ses enfants \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole catholique du village des Ab\u00e9naquis, depuis lundi le 13 f\u00e9vrier courant.\n\nA propos de Watso, le D\u00e9partement me permettra de faire quelques remarques, afin de lui faire conna\u00eetre l'homme dont il s'agit; il vit en concubinage public, depuis un grand nombre d'ann\u00e9es, avec la femme de Frank Od\u00e9od\u00e9, avec laquelle il a \u00e9lev\u00e9 une nombreuse famille.\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.C. O'Donnell\nPierreville, P.Q., April 16, 1905.\n\nFrank Kelley Esq.,\nDeputy Chief, General of I.R.,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nMay it please you to take knowledge of this communication and to verify the facts mentioned therein.\n\nThe Protestant school of the Algonquin Indians of Pierreville, P.Q., has no longer its former usefulness. The fact alone that the teacher, H.O. Lepelte, does not know how to make the children and parents respect and like him is enough to cause his work to be of no value. He incurs the hatred of the Indians that he has drawn on himself by his dishonesty, his insolence, his sarcastic humour, his insulting and bitter language \u2014 the deep-rooted hatred of the Indians that he has incurred by his low and obvious villainy \u2014 this implacable hatred demands not only that this wicked hypocritical schoolmaster be discharged, but also that he cease\nthe place, or this mortal hatred will cry for vengeance. His great villainy will be unmasked.\n\nH.O. Loiselle has for several years associated with his agent, a young Indian woman, always promising to marry her, but he has not kept his word. His object evidently has only been the better to entitle his immediate position. H.O. Loiselle has succeeded by one means or another in inducing two other girls to come and sleep in his presbytery parsonage.\n\nOnce when they were undressed and in bed, he went and found them. In accordance with his custom to the better to succeed in his criminal plans, he again proposed marriage to one of these young girls. This girl afterwards married a stranger, and he had a great deal of trouble with his wife. She often ran away from him. One evening when he was looking for her, he heard and thought she was hidden in H.O. Loiselle's house the house of H.O. Loiselle, who is an old bachelor living alone in his house. The husband went there, forced\nopen the door, and actually found his wife in the house. A frightful uproar followed. Several persons went into the house; the door was wide open. There was horrible swearing and cursing, and at last a frightful fight in which several took part, including the schoolmaster himself.\n\nH.O. Lisselle also made love to a married woman.\n\nTo certain other Indian women who will liquor H.O. Lisselle supplied the means of obtaining the same, namely, certificates written and signed by himself in his capacity as missionary, certifying that they required liquor for medical reasons, when there was no sickness among them except the desire to drink. He has also given proof of this kindness to some Indians (men).\n\nH.O. Lisselle is an infamous swindler: his house is filled with things such as organs, watches, guns, men's hats, &c., &c., for money that he has lent at an exorbitant rate. He goes to his neighbours' houses on Sunday just as old\nother days to carry on his bargains\nof lending or pawn.\n\nH. O. Lisdell is a trickster.\nHe loves legal proceedings and\ndeception to cheat his neighbours,\nto cheat everybody, that is his\ndelight. He has even insulted\nand injured without any provocation\nwhatever the R.C. priest, and\nhe almost jumped on the latter\nto make him get out of an Indian\nhouse where the latter had\nentered very politely.\n\nH. O. Lisdell is a lazy man.\nHe sleeps profoundly a great part\nof the time in school, and thus\nnearly every day rises or lays. He\nis a wicked, brutal man. He beats\nthe children worse than if they were\ndogs. He also calls them all\nkindly named bad names\u2014\nreflecting on the character & reputation of their parents, which\nis very offensive to the children as\nwell as to the parents. He closes\nthe school when it pleases him\nfrom day to day, and does not come\nfor the last time. He is not regular\nin opening and closing the school\nat the hour. He has lost the atten-\nand confidence of both children and parents; as a result of which many of the pupils no longer attend his school, but go to R.C. schools.\n\nIf the Deptt. should think proper to hold an investigation to prove the truth of this charge, it would be desirable that the commissioner be a Protestant.\n\nWe intend to have justice some day, and we shall have it. It is perhaps premature to speak of it, but we should prefer an English-speaking schoolmaster, because we do all our business in English.\n\nAwaiting your reply, we are\n\nYour devoted servants,\n\nLouis Wattez, constable\nSamuel Nodougeyis\nCouncillor\n(and eight others; for signatures, see original)\n\nAs many of our people are soon going to the United States, we ask that the investigation be held in October next.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 5th May, 1905\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nA letter has been received from Louis Watson and nine other Indians of Pierrerville in which most serious charges are made against Rev. H.O. Loiselle, missionary and teacher of the Ch. of England school on this reserve.\n\nThere has been serious trouble between Watson and Mr. Loiselle for some time and Watson bears a bad character and is said to be very unreliable, but I think the charges are grave enough to warrant an enquiry and I would suggest that Mr Agent Comire be asked for a report on the contents of Watson's letter.\n\nIt appears to me that it would be to the interests of the school and the reserve if Mr. Loiselle were replaced, but before communicating with the Ch. of England authorities in Montreal, it would be well to have Mr Comire's report.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Brown\nOTTAWA, 11th May, 1905\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith for your report on the statements contained therein a letter from Louis Watson and nine other Indians of St. Francis in which most serious charges are made against Rev.

Loiselle;\nil y a aussi Louis Watso, fils de Sam, qui a des enfants\net qui avant de partir pour les \u00c9tats-unis, les envoyait\n\u00e0 l'\u00e9cole catholique, probablement pour faire comme son\np\u00e8re; tous les autres signataires n'ont pas d'enfants, en\n\u00e9tat de fr\u00e9quenter l'\u00e9cole.\n\nSam.Watso vit en concubinage, depuis de longues ann\u00e9es,\navec la femme de Frak.Ododson, et ce sont quelques ans\ndes enfants qu'il a eu avec cette femme l\u00e0 qu'il envoie\n\u00e0 l'\u00e9cole.\n\nSamuel Masso-\nSamuel Msadoquis est un protestant mari\u00e9 avec une catholique, tous ses enfants sont catholiques et vont \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole catholique.\n\nRobert Paquette est un veillard de 64 ans qui demeure avec Sam.Watso; il est le p\u00e8re de sa concubine et il a probablement sign\u00e9 sans savoir au juste ce qu'il faisait; dans tous les cas, je ne crois pas que ce soit lui qui ait sign\u00e9, car je pense qu'il ne sait pas \u00e9crire.\n\nJ.B.Watso est le fils de Sam Watso; c'est un gar\u00e7on qui demeure avec son p\u00e8re.\n\nLewis Tahamant n'a pas d'enfants.\n\nAlfred Msadoquis n'a que deux ou trois enfants dont le plus vieux n'a pas quatre ans.\n\nWilliam Paquette lui-m\u00eame n'a pas d'enfants; il est mari\u00e9 \u00e0 la veuve de feu Cesar Hannis, qui elle a quelques enfants, mais elle est aux \u00c9tats-Unis depuis assez longtemps avec une de ses filles, un autre de ses gar\u00e7ons est b\u00e9d\u00e9au \u00e0 l'\u00e9glise catholique et un autre gar\u00e7on est \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole de r\u00e9forme \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al; d'ailleurs, \u00e0 part William qui lui-m\u00eame protestant et qui demeure seul dans la r\u00e9serve, tous les membres de sa famille sont catholiques.\n\nJohnson Tahamant est mari\u00e9, mais il est seul dans la r\u00e9serve; sa femme est aux \u00c9tats-Unis, avec ses enfants depuis longtemps.\n\nJe donne ces d\u00e9tails au D\u00e9partement, afin de le mettre \u00e0 m\u00eame de juger par lui-m\u00eame, de la valeur morale de ceux qui ont sign\u00e9 cette plainte et de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat qu'ils peuvent avoir au bon fonctionnement de l'\u00e9cole.\n\nJ'ai pris la peine d'aller voir en particulier chacun des signataires et de leur demander quels sont les griefs qu'ils ont contre le R\u00e9v. Loizelle; voici un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des r\u00e9ponses.\nr\u00e9ponses que j'ai eu de chacun d'eux:\n\nJEAN TAHAMANT.\u2014Il se plaint que le R\u00e9v. Loiselle ne tient pas le temps r\u00e9gulier \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole et qu'il finit souvent avant l'heure r\u00e9glementaire; il a entendu dire par les enfants que le R\u00e9v. Loiselle dort durant l'\u00e9cole; pour lui, il n'aime pas le ma\u00eetre d'\u00e9cole et il n'enverra plus son enfant l\u00e0.\n\nALFRED MSADOQUIS.\u2014Pour lui, il n'a aucune plainte \u00e0 faire contre le R\u00e9v. Loiselle; il n'a pas d'enfants en \u00e2ge d'aller \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole; il dit que lorsque Louis Watson a \u00e9t\u00e9 le trouver pour lui faire signer cette plainte l\u00e0, il ne l'a pas lu, mais que Watson lui a expliqu\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait une lettre \u00e0 l'\u00e9v\u00eaque \u00e0 propos d'une assembl\u00e9e concernant l'\u00e9lection des marguillers.\n\nWILLIAM PAQUETTE.\u2014Il dira ce qu'il sait lors de l'enqu\u00eate, si elle a lieu.\n\nSAMUEL MSADOQUIS.\u2014Est actuellement absent de la r\u00e9serve; il est employ\u00e9 comme guide, dans le nord, pour des chasseurs; sa femme qui est catholique et dont tous les enfants sont catholiques ne conna\u00eet rien de cette affaire l\u00e0.\n\nLOUIS TAHAMANT.\u2014Lui-m\u00eame n'a pas d'enfants et il n'a aucune plainte personnelle \u00e0 faire contre le R\u00e9v. Loiselle, cependant il a entendu dire par les enfants qu'il dormait durant l'\u00e9cole.\n\nROBERT PAQUETTE.\u2014N'a aucune plainte \u00e0 faire contre le R\u00e9v. Loiselle.\n\nJOHNSON TAHAMANT.\u2014Il demeure avec son p\u00e8re; sa femme est aux \u00c9tats-Unis, avec ses enfants depuis longtemps; il a entendu dire par les enfants que le R\u00e9v. Loiselle dormait durant l'\u00e9cole; il n'a pas d'autres plaintes \u00e0 faire.\n\nSAM. WATSON.\u2014N'a pas voulu rien me dire; il r\u00e9serve cela pour l'enqu\u00eate, si elle a lieu.\nJ.B.Watso.-C'est le fils de Sam.Watso; il est gar\u00e7on et demeure avec son p\u00e8re; je n'ai pu le voir, parce qu'il est actuellement absent de la r\u00e9serve, employ\u00e9 comme guide, pour des chasseurs, dans le nord du St.Maurice.\n\nLOUIS WATSO.-Il est parti pour les \u00c9tats-Unis et je n'ai pas pu le voir; c'est le fils de Sam.Watso et le grand-p\u00e8re de Jean Tahamant, deux des signataires de la plainte.\n\nAvant de partir, il envoyait ses enfants \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole catholique, parce que, disait-il, ses enfants n'apprenaient rien \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole protestante; ce n'est que peu de temps avant de partir qu'il a envoy\u00e9 ses enfants \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole catholique. C'est lui qui a \u00e9crit la plainte, si je puis en juger par son \u00e9criture et c'est lui qui a pass\u00e9 parmi les protestants pour les faire signer, cependant ce ne doit \u00eatre lui qui l'a r\u00e9dig\u00e9, si je puis en juger par le style, il ne sait pas assez le fran\u00e7ais pour cela.\n\nJ'ai vu aussi quelques uns des autres membres de la bande qui ont des enfants qui vont \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole du R\u00e9v. Loiselle et voici un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de leurs r\u00e9ponses:\n\nGEORGE PAQUETTE.- Il a trois enfants qui vont \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole du R\u00e9v. Loiselle et il en est bien satisfait, il dit que ses enfants ont fait beaucoup de progr\u00e8s; il dit aussi que le R\u00e9v. Loiselle tient le temps correct \u00e0 son \u00e9cole; ses enfants n'ont jamais rapport\u00e9 que le ma\u00eetre dormait durant l'\u00e9cole.\n\nVICTORIA ANNANCE \u00e9pouse de Daniel Emmett Sr., dit:\n\nElle a un petit gar\u00e7on qui va \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole ainsi qu'un autre petit gar\u00e7on qu'elle a actuellement en soin et elle bien satisfaite de la mani\u00e8re dont le R\u00e9v. Loiselle fait son devoir; elle dit que ses enfants font beaucoup de progr\u00e8s; l'\u00e9cole commence toujours \u00e0 l'heure r\u00e9glementaire.\net finit de m\u00eame.\n\nSOLOMON BENEDICT.\u2014 est un protestant mari\u00e9 \u00e0 une catholique et dont les enfants sont catholiques; cependant il demeure tout pr\u00e8s de l'\u00e9cole et il dit que l'\u00e9cole commence et finit toujours \u00e0 l'heure r\u00e9glementaire; il n'a pas voulu signer la plainte lorsque Louis Watson a \u00e9t\u00e9 le trouver dans ce but.\n\nMaintenant je vais prendre chacun des griefs de la plainte en particulier et vous dire ce que j'ai pu apprendre \u00e0 ce sujet.\n\nIl y a certainement quelques uns des membres protestants de la bande qui n'aiment pas le r\u00e9v. Loiselle et surtout Sam Watson, qui se plaint depuis longtemps que le r\u00e9v. Loiselle maltraite ses enfants et qui a eu avec lui un proc\u00e8s qu'il a perdu toujours \u00e0 propos de l'\u00e9cole et de ses enfants. Le r\u00e9v. Loiselle dit que ces accusations l\u00e0 ne sont pas vraies et qu'il a trait\u00e9 les enfants de Watson comme les autres; et il m'a \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible de d\u00e9couvrir lequel des deux qui dit la v\u00e9rit\u00e9.\n\nEn outre de cela, le r\u00e9v. Loiselle me dit que H.L. Watson a l'ambition de le supplanter comme instituteur et que c'est lui qui travaille en dessous pour lui causer tous les embarras et que de doit \u00eatre lui qui est l'auteur de la plainte bien qu'il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 assez prudent de ne pas la signer. H.L. Watson, malgr\u00e9 que sa conduite ne soit pas exemplaire, jouit, \u00e0 cause de son instruction, d'une certaine influence parmi les membres protestants de la bande, et le r\u00e9v. Loiselle dit qu'il se sert de cette influence ou \u00e0 pour lui causer des embarras.\n\nL'organiste, dont il est question dans la plainte, est justement une des filles de Sam Watson; quand m\u00eame le r\u00e9v. Lois...\nLoiselie l'aurait fr\u00e9quent\u00e9e, je ne vois pas un grand mal \u00e0 cela; seulement il y a une contradiction, la plainte accuse le R\u00e9v. Loiselie de ne pas avoir voulu la marier, et lorsque j'ai questionn\u00e9 la femme de son fr\u00e8re \u00e0 ce sujet, elle m'a dit que c'\u00e9tait la fille qui n'avait pas voulu du R\u00e9v. Loiselie.\n\nLa plainte dit aussi que le R\u00e9v. Loiselie aurait des jeunes filles \u00e0 venir coucher chez lui. \u00c0 ce propos voici les explications que m'a donn\u00e9 le R\u00e9v. Loiselie et qui sont corrobor\u00e9es par le t\u00e9moignage de Hermine Paquette, \u00e9pouse de Clitus Gauthier, Marie-Jeanne Paquette \u00e9pouse de J.B. Nagazon et Marie Nagazon fille du pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent.\n\nLa petite Marie Nagazon demeurait chez le R\u00e9v. Loiselie, une Dello Anna Blouin, pensionnait l\u00e0 aussi; un certain soir, elles eurent la visite de la fille de Hermine Paquette et comme il pleuvait \u00e0 torrents apr\u00e8s la veill\u00e9e, la petite Marie Nagazon, invita sa cousine \u00e0 rester \u00e0 coucher, ce que cette derni\u00e8re accepta et elles couch\u00e8rent toutes les trois dans le m\u00eame lit et la petite Marie me dit qu'elles n'eurent pas connaissance que le R\u00e9v. Loiselie soit venu les trouver.\n\nCette fille d'Hermine Paquette (Pamela Gauthier) est celle dont la plainte dit qu'elle ne maria plus tard \u00e0 un \u00e9tranger, un am\u00e9ricain d'origine allemande, du nom de Rainey Schmink; elle eut souvent des querelles avec son mari, qui \u00e9tait dit-elle ivrogne ou jaloux; ils s'entra\u00eenaient tous deux chez Clitus Gauthier \u00e9poux de Hermine Paquette et p\u00e8re de la jeune femme (Pamela Gauthier).\n\nUn jour que Schmink avait f\u00eat\u00e9 toute la journ\u00e9e et n'\u00e9tait pas revenu \u00e0 la maison depuis le matin, sa femme partit vers 4 heures de l'apr\u00e8s-midi, pour aller se promener.\npromener chez sa tante, Marguerite Dupuis, \u00e9pouse de J.B. Nagasoe; le soir lorsque Schminke revint \u00e0 la maison, il demanda o\u00f9 \u00e9tait sa femme et apprenant qu'elle \u00e9tait, il partit avec sa balle d'or pour aller la chercher; en arrivant chez Nagasoe, Schminke commen\u00e7a \u00e0 faire du tapage et \u00e0 vouloir battre sa femme; alors cette derni\u00e8re en compagnie de sa m\u00e8re, se r\u00e9fugia chez le R\u00e8v. Loiselie, o\u00f9 il y avait Marie Nagasoe et Anne Blouin; Schminke ayant appris que sa femme \u00e9tait rendu chez le R\u00e8v. Loiselie, il y rendit, les portes \u00e9taient ferm\u00e9es mais elles n'avaient pas barres; c'\u00e9tait vers 6 heures du soir et tout \u00e9tait l'automne; en arrivant l\u00e0 Schminke entra d'abord dans le passage sans frapper, puis il frappa \u00e0 la porte de la salle et entra; en apercevant son mari la jeune femme se sauva dans la cuisine ou il la suivit, il parlait fort et avec animation ce qui attira les curieux des environs, et comme les portes \u00e9taient rest\u00e9es ouvertes quelques une entr\u00e8rent, entr' autres Louis Watson qui essaya de calmer Schminke; enfin ils partirent tous ensemble, au bout d'environ dix \u00e0 quinze minutes.\n\nLa plainte accuse aussi le R\u00e8v. Loiselie d'avoir courtis\u00e9 une femme mari\u00e9e, malgr\u00e9 nos informations, je n'ai pu rien y apprendre \u00e0 ce sujet.\n\nQuant \u00e0 l'histoire des certificats, le R\u00e8v. Loiselie dit la chose compl\u00e8tement et je n'ai pu rien apprendre \u00e0 ce sujet.\n\nP\u00e2tes sur gages, usure, etc.; le R\u00e8v. Loiselie a chez lui un orgue qui appartient \u00e0 la famille de Louis Demers; plus tard cette famille souhaitait porter pour les \u00e9lections et n'avait pas d'argent; apr\u00e8s beaucoup d'insistance, le R\u00e8v. Loiselie consentit \u00e0 leur avancer $50.00, qui devaient \u00eatre rembours\u00e9es dans l'automne et qui le furent en\neffet durant le cours de l'\u00e9t\u00e9, seulement l'orgue est encore l\u00e0 tout simplement parce que la famille n'est pas encore venue le reclamer.\n\nMont\u00e9e: Alfred Maodoquis avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en gage une montre chez un monsieur Shomer de Pierville pour la somme de $6.80; comme Maodoquis \u00e9tait aux \u00c9tats-Unis et qu'il ne pouvait retirer sa montre, il \u00e9crivit \u00e0 quelqu'un de ces amis de la retirer et de la garder, ce que ce dernier fit; plus tard le R\u00e9v. Loisel le lui acheta de lui et depuis il l'a revendu \u00e0 un autre. C'est l\u00e0 tout ce que j'ai pu apprendre \u00e0 propos des pr\u00eats sur gages.\n\n\u00c0 ma connaissance le R\u00e9v. Loisel a eu un proc\u00e8s avec Sam. Watson l'hiver dernier; le R\u00e9v. Loisel avait gard\u00e9 les enfants de Watson apr\u00e8s la classe pour leur faire apprendre leurs le\u00e7ons; Watson se rendit \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole pour avoir ses enfants et sur le refus de l'instituteur, il s'en suivit une querelle, d'o\u00f9 est r\u00e9sult\u00e9 le proc\u00e8s que le R\u00e9v. Loisel a gagn\u00e9, du reste.\n\nInsulte au pr\u00eatre catholique romain: Le R\u00e9v. de Gomagne \u00e9tait \u00e0 faire la visite des familles de la r\u00e9serve en m\u00eame temps il entrait chez Sam. Watson, une famille protestante, il y rencontrera le R\u00e9v. Loisel, qui lui aurait dit-on parl\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re un peu inconvenante.\n\nQuant au temps d'\u00e9cole perdu par le R\u00e9v. Loisel, le D\u00e9partement n'a qu'\u00e0 consulter les rapports de ce dernier pour se renseigner exactement.\n\nC'est l\u00e0 tout ce que je peux apprendre au D\u00e9partement \u00e0 ce sujet.\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nH.O. Ouiie\nSt. Francois du Lac, May 26, 1905.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of I.A.,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter, No. 154520, of May 11, the following is the information that I have been able to gather on this subject:\n\nI would remark in the commencement that of all those who signed the complaint, there is only one who has children going to Mr. Loiselle's school; that is Jean Tahamant, who is raising one of the illegitimate children of one of his daughters. Of the other signers in the list, Sam. Watso has some children, but he has sent them to the R.C. school since the suit that he had with the Rev. H. Loiselle last winter and which he lost; there is also Louis Watso, son of Sam., who has some children and who, before setting out for the United States, sent them to the R.C. school, probably because his father had done so. None of the other signers have children able to go to school. Sam. Watso has been living in concubinage for many years with the wife of Frank Ododson, and it is some of the children that he has had by this woman whom he is sending to school.\n\nSamuel Meadoquis is a Protestant who is married to a Catholic; all his children are Catholics and go to the R.C. school.\n\nRobert Paquette is an old man, 84 years of age,\nwho lives with Sam. Watsc; he is the father of Watsc's concubine and he probably signed without knowing what he was signing; in any event I do not believe that he signed, for I do not think he can write.\n\nJ.B. Watsc is the son of Sam. Watsc; he is a young man, who lives with his father.\n\nLewis Tahamant has no children.\n\nAlfred Msadoquis has only two or three children, the eldest of whom is not more than four years of age.\n\nWilliam Paquette, himself, has no children; he is married to the widow of the late Cesar Hannis, who has some children, but she has been in the U.S. for a long time with one of her daughters; one of her sons is beadle of the R.C. church and another son is in the reformatory in Montreal; besides, with the exception of William, who is a Protestant and lives alone on the reserve, all the members of his family are Roman Catholics.\n\nJohnson Tahamant is married but he is alone on the reserve; his wife has been in the U.S. with her children for a long time.\n\nI give these details to the Dept. in order that it may judge for itself the moral standing of those who signed this complaint and the interest they might have in the good government of the school. I have taken the trouble to go to see each of the signers individually and ask them what are the grievances that they have against Rev. Mr. Loiselle; the following is a synopsis of the replies I received.\n\nJean Tahamant. He complains that the Rev. Mr. Loiselle does not keep the regular school hours and that he often closes before the maximum hour set by the regulations; he has heard the children say that Mr. Loiselle sleeps during school hours; as for himself he does not like the master of the school and will not send\nhis children there.\n\nAlfred Msadougis.\u2014For himself he has no complaint to make against the Rev. Mr. Loiselle; he has no children of school age; he says that when Louis Watso came to him to have him sign this complaint he did not read it but that Watso explained to him that it was a letter to the bishop with reference to a meeting concerning the appointment of churchwardens.\n\nWilliam Paquette.\u2014He will tell what he knows when there is an enquiry, if such should be held.\n\nSamuel Msadougis.\u2014He is at present absent from the reserve; he is employed in the North as a guide to the hunters; his wife, who is a Roman Catholic and all of whose children are Roman Catholics, knows nothing of the affair.\n\nLouis Tahamant.\u2014He, himself, has no children and he has no personal complaint to make against the Rev. Mr. Loiselle; however he has heard the children say that he slept during school hours.\n\nRobert Paquette.\u2014He has no complaint to make against the Rev. Mr. Loiselle.\n\nJohnson Tahamant.\u2014He lives with his father; his wife has been in the United States with her children for a long time; he has heard the children say that the Rev. Mr. Loiselle slept during school hours; he has no other complaint to make.\n\nSam. Watso.\u2014He did not wish to say anything; he would reserve that for an enquiry if one should be held.\n\nJ.B. Watso.\u2014He is the son of Sam. Watso. He is a young man and lives with his father. I could not see him because he is away from the reserve at present, employed as a guide to the hunters north of the St. Maurice.\nLouis Watson.\u2014 He has gone to the U.S. and I was not able to see him; he is the son of Sam. Watson and the son-in-law of Jean Tahamant, two of the signers of this complaint. Before going away he sent his children to the R.C. school, because, he said, they were learning nothing at the Protestant school; it was only a short time before going away that he sent his children to the R.C. school. It was he who wrote the complaint, and who passed it among the Protestants for them to sign; however, it cannot have been he who composed it, if I can judge from the style: he does not know French well enough for that.\n\nI saw, also, some of the other members of the band who have children going to school to Mr. Loiselle, and the following is a synopsis of their replies:\n\nGeorge Paquette.\u2014 He has three children who go to Mr. Loiselle's school and he is well satisfied; he says that his children have made good progress. He says, also, that Mr. Loiselle keeps the correct hours in his school; his children have never reported that the teacher slept during school hours.\n\nVictoria Annance.\u2014 She says that she has a small boy who goes to the school as well as another small boy at present in her care and she is well satisfied with the way in which Mr. Loiselle performs his duties; she says that her children are making great progress. The school commences at the regulation hour and ends the same.\n\nSolomon Benedict.\u2014 He is a Protestant married to a Roman Catholic, whose children are Roman Catholics; he lives very near the school and says that he begins at the regulation hour and ends every day at the same hour; he was not willing to sign the complaint when Louis Watson came to him with this object.\nNow I am going to take each of the grievances in the complaint individually and tell you what I know in the matter.\n\nThere are certain Protestant members of the band who do not like the Rev. Mr. Loiselle, always with reference to the school and their children, especially Sam. Watso, who has been complaining for a long time that the Rev. Mr. Loiselle maltreats his children. The Rev. Mr. Loiselle says that these accusations are not true and that he treats Watso's children as he treats the others; and it has been impossible for me to find out which is telling the truth.\n\nBesides that, the Rev. Mr. Loiselle tells me that H.L. Masta desires to supplant him as teacher and it is he who is working underhand to cause him all the trouble, and that he must be the author of the complaint, although he was prudent enough not to sign it. H.L. Masta, notwithstanding that his conduct is not exemplary, has, on account of his education, a certain influence among the Protestant members of the band, and Mr. Loiselle says he uses this influence to cause him trouble.\n\nThe organist, referred to in this complaint, is in fact a daughter of Sam. Watso; even though the Rev. Mr. Loiselle does associate with her I do not see any great harm in that; only, there is a contradiction here, the complaint accuses the Rev. Mr. Loiselle of not wishing to marry her, and when I questioned Watso's wife with reference to this she told me that it was the girl who did not wish to marry Mr. Loiselle.\n\nThe complaint says also that Rev. Mr. Loiselle induced some young girls to come to sleep at his place; with reference to this the following are the explanations given me by Mr. Loiselle and corroborated by the evidence of Hermine Paquette, wife of Clitus Gauthier, Marie Jeanne Paquette, wife of J.B. Nagazoa, and Marie\nNagazoa, daughter of the former. Little Marie Nagazoa was living with Mr. Loiselle and Miss Anna Blouin was boarding there also; on a certain evening they had a visit from the daughter of Hermine Paquette and as it rained heavily in the evening Marie Nagazoa invited her cousin to remain over night, which, the latter accepted, and they all three slept in the same bed and little Marie tells me that she had no knowledge that the Rev. Mr. Loiselle came and found them.\n\nThis daughter of Hermine Paquette (Pamela Gauthier) is the person who, the complaint says, afterwards married a stranger, an American of German descent, named Ranny Schminke; she often had quarrels with her husband, who was, she says, a drunkard and jealous; they both resided at the home of Clitus Gauthier, the husband of Hermine Paquette, and father of the young woman, Pamela Gauthier.\n\nOne day when Schminke had been drinking all day and had not come back to the house since the morning, his wife went out about 4 P.M. to walk to her aunt's house, Marie Jeanne Paquette, wife of J.B. Nagazoa. In the evening when Schminke returned to the house he asked where his wife was and on learning where she was he went with his mother-in-law to look for her. On reaching the Nagazoa house Schminke began to make a row and wanted to beat his wife; then the latter in company with her mother escaped to the house of the Rev. Mr. Loiselle, where were Marie Nagazoa and Anna Blouin. Schminke having learned that his wife had gone to Mr. Loiselle's house went there. The doors were closed, but not locked; it was about eight o'clock in the evening and late in the fall. On arriving Schminke entered at once into the hall without knocking; then he knocked at the door of the hall and then entered. On perceiving\nher husband the young woman escaped to the kitchen, where he followed her. He spoke loudly and excitedly, which attracted the curious people of the neighborhood; and as the doors had remained open some of them came amongst others Louis Watson, who tried to quiet Schminke; finally they went away all together after about ten or fifteen minutes.\n\nThe complaint also accuses the Rev. Mr. Loiselle of having made love to a married woman; in spite of my enquiries I have not been able to learn anything on this point.\n\nAs for the story about the certificates the Rev. Mr. Loiselle denies the thing completely, and I have not been able to learn anything from the others.\n\nLoans on pawn, usury, etc.\u2014 The Rev. Mr. Loiselle has in his house an organ belonging to the family of Louis Deny. One spring this family wanted to go off to the U.S. but having no money, after much urging, the Rev. Mr. Loiselle agreed to advance them $50, which was to be returned to him in the fall and which was in fact returned to him during the course of the summer, and the organ is still there, simply because the family has not yet come to claim it.\n\nA watch,\u2014 Alfred Msadoquis deposited a watch on pawn at the house of Mr. Shooner of Pierreville for the sum of $6.50. As Msadoquis was in the U.S. and as he was unable to withdraw his watch he wrote to one of his friends to withdraw it and to keep it, which the latter did. Later the Rev. Mr. Loiselle purchased it from him and afterwards he resold it to someone else. That is all that I have been able to learn in regard to loans on pawn.\nTo my knowledge the Rev. Mr. Loiselle had a suit against Sam Watso last winter. The Rev. Mr. Loiselle had kept Watso's children after school to make them learn their lessons; Watso went to the school to get his children and on the schoolmaster's refusing, a quarrel ensued, resulting in the suit, which Mr. Loiselle won.\n\nInsult to the R.C. Priest.\u2014The Rev. Mr. deGonzague was making a visit to families on the reserve, and when he entered the house of Sam Watso, a Protestant family, he met there the Rev. Mr. Loiselle, who, they say, spoke to him in an unsuitable manner.\n\nAs for the school time lost by Mr. Loiselle the Dept. has only to consult the report from the latter to inform itself exactly.\n\nThat is all that I am able to inform the Dept. in regard to this subject.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nA.O. Comire,\nIndian Agent.\nOTTAWA, 9th June, 1905\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, reporting upon the charges made by Louis Watson and other St Francis Indians against the Rev. H.O. Loiselle, missionary and teacher of the Ch. of England school on that reserve; and in reply I beg to say that as the Watsons have asked for an opportunity to prove these charges, the Department has informed them that it will not object to any investigation being held in October next, when these Indians will have an opportunity of producing their evidence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. STEWART\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.O. Comire, Esq.:\nIndian Agent,\nSt Francois du Lac, Que.\nExtract from \"Remarks\" of today on the September quarter's return of the St. Francis (Prot.) school.\n\nThe number of pupils is very small on account of the people having not returned from the States yet, and Sam Water continues to send his children to the Roman school. Why do the Department allow that? I would ask the Department if the Protestant school has any reason to exist? If so, why do not the Indians send their children to it, especially when they have no good reason to keep them from. I am rather surprised that such a man as Water is allowed to do this.\n\nH. O. Lorette\n\n[Signature]\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, November 25, 1905.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\u2014\n\nI see from a requisition lately received from the Protestant school at St. Francis that it is now in charge of a new teacher. We have had no official notice of how the Rev. Mr. Loiselle was disposed of, but he has gone and it is a good thing that he was got rid of so quietly.\n\nShall I make enquiry of the Agent as to why the change was made?\n\n[Signature]\n\nArthur Benson\nPierreville P.2. Feb. 14th 1906\n\nSir,\n\nIt seem too bad that we are not having school regularly as it should be when the Rev. H.O. Loisele thought school he missed a good many days and he did not fill all the time he lost. And our new teacher the Rev. H. Coffin is doing the same thing he has lost a good many days since he began to teach school. He lost a whole week just the week before Christmas and he was away again the 6 day of this month and the children did not have any school until the 12th that keeps the children back from their studies as they do not have school regular. He told the children that he got a word from the Bishop and that he was going away and we do not know when we will have another teacher no school.\n\nYour truly,\n\nJohn Tahamont Counselor\nPierreville P.2.

Sir,\n\nI have the honour to inform you that this Department has been advised by its Agent at St. Francis that Mr. Hubert Coffin, who replaced the Rev. Mr. Leiselle as teacher of the Church of England school on the Abenakis reserve, has been ordered to another charge, leaving the school without a teacher.\n\nThe Indians are anxious to have the school reopened without delay, and have suggested that Mr. H.L. Masta be appointed. The Department wishes to leave the nomination of a teacher for this school in the hands of the Church and would be glad to know whether you are prepared to provide a substitute at an early date, as it thinks the school should be continued without any break, if possible.\n\nOur Agent will be written to and informed that you have been communicated with on the subject.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D.

Dean Evans, of Montreal, has been asked to nominate a teacher for this school and requested to do so at an early date, as the Department considers it should not be closed for any length of time.\n\nA letter and telegram have been received from John Taharont, councillor of the Abenakis band, on the subject of the appointment of a teacher, who says that it is the desire of the Indians to appoint Mr. Masta to the position. You may inform this councillor that there was no necessity for his telegraphing on this, as a letter would have reached the Department within twenty-four hours of its being written. You may also tell him that the Department has taken steps to have the vacancy filled, and that it is the wish of the Department that he would communicate with it through you in future.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nA.

It shows that the Bishop has no man at his disposal to send to this place.\n\nRevd Mr Britten is the assistant of the Bishop. He says they can't think of any man whom they can send here.\n\nRevd Mr Gauthier is a Frenchman who has a mission at Gardner Door Co. Wisconsin. Should Mr Gauthier hear when the call of our Bishop, he could not at any rate come here before three months as he must give a notice to his Bishop of his intention to leave, not only his mission, but also the Diocese wherein he is working and thus we are pretty sure that he would not take charge of the school for he told us so when he was here.\n\nAt all events the school work should be carried on in the meantime. If you have any objection to Mr. Macdonald teaching the school, please appoint some one else at once to fill up that position.\n\nIt is desirable to have a man who can teach both English and French.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Tahamont Councillor\nST.

Mr. Boyce will enter on his duties at once.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nArchbishop Bishop of Montreal\n\nThe Secretary of the Dept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, May 5, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to the memorandum left by you in the Department regarding the teacher of the Church of England school on the St. Francis reserve, I beg to say that as Mr. Boyce has only been in charge of this school since March 12, last, the Department is not prepared to criticize his qualifications until after the receipt of the Inspector's report.\n\nYou are mistaken when you state that Mr. Laurent and yourself were forced to give up this school for the want of a Model School diploma. There were other causes which led to the change in the teachership.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ. D. [Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nMr. H. L. Masta,\nPierreville, Que.\nChippewa P.O. 11 April 1906\n\nS. D. McLean Esq.,\nDept. Ind. Aff.\n\nIn favour of the 5th inst. No. 154520 duly received with thanks. They have to say that I am not all surprised at your reply for it is somewhat as I imagined it would be. \"The Dept. is not prepared to criticize his (Mr. Boyce's) qualifications etc.\"\n\n\"Quirks & quibbles have no place in the search after truth.\" We found the justification of our nonconformity on the \"quicks quirks.\"\n\nIn my humble opinion, it would be of good policy to know the teacher's qualifications before he is employed. The Dept. however has made the same mistake once before, that was when it first employed Mr. Lament & myself respectfully as teachers of the Government Roman Catholic Protestant Indian schools here, but we were so employed only a short time, & then were both dismissed, for the want of Model school diplomas. I contend that there were then no other causes which led to the change in the teachership. The proof is that I became again its teacher, as soon as I had passed an examination before a regular Board of Examiners, at three times, & obtained a Model school diploma.\nboth in French & English.\n\nWe were made to understand that it was the immovable purpose of the Dept. not to employ any but qualified teachers. Mr. Boyce was not being prepared to pass an examination, nor willing to begin his studies, was forced to give up his school as aforesaid notwithstanding the recommendations of the priest & the bishop as to his ability.\n\nBesides that a man who has a license from some religious denomination, to preach the Gospel, is ipso facto, qualified to teach school, has no foundation. I have seen the license of the Rev. Mr. Bennett. It is not to be believed Mr. Bennett, for I admire his dignity, but I must say that, he has learning whatever name he calls it a school-teacher.\n\nWhat do we need of the Inspector's report, when Mr. Boyce himself is ready to admit that, he knows not a word of French & that at best he is only a poor English scholar.\n\nMr. Boyce is a very nice man and we are very much pleased with his teaching, but we would sooner be without a preacher than a good school-teacher. We beg the Dept. to give us one.\n\nThe statement that there were others who had to change, in the teachership, must have allusion to the change which took place, when I gave up school.\nThe second time. It was reported that the cause in this case was drunkenness but I denied it & deny it again. It was simply trouble in my family.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nN. L. MacKee\nOttawa, May 15, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th inst., in reference to the Church of England school on the St. Francis reserve.\n\nI return herewith the license issued to the Rev. Peter Emmott, which accompanied your letter.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nMr. H. L. Masta,\nPierreville,\nQue.\nBank Bealy Esq. Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nSir, and is that the way we got to live. If some one had pity on us poor Indians they would send us a better school teacher one that is able to teach the children and keep the school in order. There is money enough so we could have a good teacher. Those people that look for money not look in pity in us. Please answer.\n\nYour Truly,\n\nJohn Tahamont Sub Chief.\nOttawa, January 28, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, undated, with reference to matters in connection with the St. Francis (Protestant) school, and in reply I beg to say that the same will receive consideration and you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nSecretary.\n\nMr. John Tahamont,\nCouncillor,\nPierreville, Que.\nOttawa, January 28, 1907.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to inspect the Pierreville schools at your earliest convenience. Your last inspection of these schools was made on May 30, 1906, unless they were inspected during the last half year and your report has not yet reached the Department. If this be the case, it will not be necessary to inspect them at once.\n\nThe Department is particularly anxious to have a full report on the work that is being done by the present teacher at the Protestant school on that reserve.\n\nA supply of blank forms on which to make your reports is being sent you under separate cover; and I have to ask you to make a separate report on each of the schools and not a combined one as previously.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nSecretary.\n\nJ. E. Belcourt, Esq.,\nPublic School Inspector,\nNicolet, Que.\nOttawa, March 14, 1807.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nThe Protestant Indians of the St. Francis reserve complain of the incompetency of the present teacher, who is also the Church of England Missionary there. Mr. Inspector Belcourt, who visited the school on January 30, last, says that the children have not advanced any in their studies but rather gone back since the Rev. Mr. Boyce was put in charge.\n\nMr. Boyce is apparently lacking in ability to teach and cannot maintain proper discipline. It seems a pity that the Church of England, who have been allowed the privilege of nominating a teacher for this school, should not endeavour to get someone who is able to instruct the Indians, and as they are an intelligent band they can readily see the difference between this and the Roman Catholic school on the same reserve.\n\nI would suggest that Bishop Carmichael's attention be drawn to the unfavourable reports regarding this school and that he be asked to make a change at least after the summer holidays; sooner, if possible.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Benson\nOttawa, March 30, 1907.\n\nRight Reverend Sir\u2014\n\nI have the honour to inform Your Lordship that the Protestant Indians of St. Francois complain of the incompetency of the present teacher. On the strength of these complaints the Public School Inspector was requested to make an inspection and his report, which is now before the Department, goes to justify the dissatisfaction of the Indians, as it states that the children who have attended this school have not advanced in their studies but have rather gone back since the Rev. Mr. Boyce was put in charge.\n\nIn view of the unsatisfactory condition of affairs at this school the Department would be pleased if Your Lordship would endeavour to secure a competent teacher to instruct these Indians, as they are intelligent and can easily see the difference between this and the Roman Catholic school on the same reserve.\n\nThe Department would like a change to take place not later than after the summer holidays.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nH.D. McLean,\nSecretary.\n\nThe Right Rev. Jas. Carmichael, D.D., D.C.L.,\nCoadjutor Bishop of Montreal,\nSt. George's Rectory,\nMontreal, Que.\nPicarville P.Q. March 25th 1906\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI thought I would drop you these few lines to you again. It is a shame to have that kind teacher. We can have a very good teacher for that money, but our self we can not help our self. Most we take every thing has it comes if so we will say nothing more. Some children there able to pay. They send them away to school and some to Roman Catholic School.\n\nYour Truly,\n\nJohn Tahamont Sub Chief\nOttawa, April 6, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 25th ult., I beg to say that the Department has taken action with a view to having a change of teachers at the St. Francis (Protestant) school.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nMr. John Tahamonts,\nCounsellor,\nPierreville, Que.\nDear Sir,\n\nWe see that Montreal people do not want us to get good education. Now I report Rev. Benoit came here to the council. I told him, if it was Montreal park, I don't do right go round collecting money for the poor Indians for teaching them when they got true building and we won't send our children to school he charge us $10.00 a month. He told me I do not collect for only Indians. White people too they don't want us to have good education. They don't look after our good. They don't care for us. They care for the money, and they send us H.O. Lovell to teach school over 10 years. We report him many times they only say he is a good teacher and at last we got him in a corner, and they took him away. If he was a good teacher he could give some boys Deplume. It is very hard to give Deplume when the teacher don't have it. If he was a good teacher they would have him at Sabine School teaching. And they send us S.J. Boyce to teach school. If I owned the school I would turn him out next day because I think great dear for children days. If they want our children to have good education they would send a better teacher. If we would name our teacher, Some one that has Depl...\nEnglish and French. We want to look after our good they do what they like they leave school when they like many times we went away May 20 and came back 25. H.O. Louissell do the same we are tired of this kind work If they send that kind teacher we will put it in the papers.\n\nJohn Johnson Sub Chief\nMontreal,\n\n16th June 1897\n\n313498\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI regret that the Rev. Mr. Royce's work has not met with the approbation of the School Inspector, but I will move him to send me another efficient teacher.\n\nIt has to be borne in mind that an Indian desires the post of teacher, that he has much influence on the reserve, so that it is very hard for even an efficient teacher to face the opposition. The school board did not consider this Indian for many reasons, the main for the post, nor do I. I will however make the change as soon as possible thanking you for the courtesy of your letter, & apologizing for delay in answering due to my absence from Canada.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJames Bishop of Montreal\n\nSec'y Dept. Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, June 13, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th inst., in further reference to the Church of England school on the St. Francis reserve, and in reply I beg to say that a new teacher will be placed in charge of this school after the summer holidays, and the department trusts that the change will be satisfactory to the Protestant members of the band.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nMr. John Tahamont,\nCouncillor,\nPierreville, Que.\nOttawa, June 13, 1907.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 8th inst., in which you state that you will be prepared to make a change of teachers at the Church of England school on the St. Francis reserve after the summer holidays; and in reply I beg to say that the Indians will be advised accordingly, and the department hopes that under the new teacher they will have no further cause of complaint.\n\nI have to request that Your Lordship will notify the Department of the name of your nominee and state his qualifications, so that the Agent may be advised in time to have the school reopened about August 30, next.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Right Rev. Jas. Carmichael, D.D., D.C.L.,\nCoadjutor Bishop of Montreal,\nSt. George's Rectory,\nMontreal, Que.\nI beg to nominate as school teacher at Perrville Church of England Indian School Mr. Richard E. Page Associate of the College of Preceptors London, who has been teaching for 6 years both in England & Canada. Mr. Page speaks French as well as English & is a young man of high character. He will act under my licence as Substitute to the Indians Congregation.\n\nI trust that the Government will make the usual grant to Mr. Page so that he may begin his work.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJames Bishop of Montreal\n\nI would respectfully ask the Dept. of Indian Affairs to allow Mr. Page's grant to date from the present, as I am afraid I may lose his services if he had to wait until 20 Aug. He is ready to begin at once.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indians.\nOttawa, June 19, 1907.\n\nRight Reverend Sirs\u2014\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 17th inst., nominating Mr. Richard E. Page as teacher of the Church of England school on the St. Francois reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Page's services will be accepted by the Department, but, as the current quarter closes on the 28th inst., Mr. Boyce, the present teacher, will be entitled to draw his full salary for this quarter. After that date the school will be closed for the summer holidays, and the services of another teacher will not be required until it reopens about the 20th of August. The salary grant of $300 a year is payable quarterly, but a new teacher commencing after the holidays is only paid for the actual time he teaches during that quarter, and to entitle him to the full grant he would have to remain on till June 30, of the following year, when the difference between the amount of the annual grant, $300, and the sum received will be paid him, provided the school has been kept open the required number of teaching days in the year.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sirs,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Right Rev. Jas. Carmichael, D.D., D.C.L.,\nConsecrated Bishop of Montreal,\nSt. George's Rectory,\nMontreal, Que.\nDear Sir,\n\nI come again to complain of our school teacher Mr. Page, and of the Montreal people that is the bishop who advises and directs Mr. Page.\n\nThis teacher, Mr. Page is not filling his time of teaching. For instance: in New Year vacations he spent three weeks not teaching at all. In February he did not teach at all in the first week, so in the second week of March and also the third of April. And since May has begun he lost a day and a half.\n\nNow Mr. Page is well paid to teach all the year round. We are poor protestants and always ill-treated by those Montreal people. Are we going to be humiliated very long by them?\n\nThese people will bring forward some good excuses, as they desire to. But excuse are no more gratifying. What we want is school, not excuses.\n\nMr. Page, like his predecessors, is both a teacher and a preacher of the gospel. He ought not exercise those two functions because necessarily he must neglect teaching the work he is paid for by the Department.\nThe sum of three hundred dollars ($300.00) is paid by the Department for a teacher for Protestant boys & girls. For this amount of money we can get a first class teacher and she can live out of it without being obliged to preach.\n\nNow those Montreal people should be pleased and satisfied if I had a good report in their favor for the Department, but I cannot report good when it has been so bad for our old School.\n\nHoping the Department will favor these remarks, suggested by a sincere wish to see our children making progress at school,\n\nI remain\n\nYour Humble Servant,\nJohn Tahamont Sub Chief\nOttawa, May 30, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th inst., complaining that the teacher of the Protestant school on the St. Francis reserve has taken more than the authorized number of holidays.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the quarterly return received through the Agent does not bear out this statement, and the Public School Inspector, who visited the school in February, last, reports the school as satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nSecretary.\n\nMr. John Tahmout,\nCouncillor,\nPierreville, Que.\nOttawa, May 26, 1908.\n\nRight Reverend Sirs\u2014\n\nI have the honour to inform Your Lordship that the Protestant Indians of St. Francis complain that Mr. Page, the present teacher of their school, absents himself frequently to the detriment of the children. They admit, however, that he is a competent teacher, but, owing to his apparent lack of interest in the school, the progress is not satisfactory.\n\nSome of the Protestant Indians, who were at the Department today, assured me that Mr. Page was constantly late in opening the school and closed it frequently before the usual hour and that he was absent many entire days during the term. Mr. Page's quarterly school returns do not account for this unauthorized absence nor do they show the school to have been closed on any teaching day.\n\nThe Department would be glad if you would refer this matter to Mr. Page for any explanations he may have to make. If Mr. Page is in the habit of taking unauthorized leave, the sooner a new teacher is placed in charge of this school the better, and if the clerical duties interfere with the work as teacher they will have to be disassociated, as it is of prime importance that the teaching\n\nRight Rev. James O'Connell, D.D., D.C.L.,\nCoadjutor Bishop of Montreal,\nSt. George's Rectory,\nMontreal, Que.\nshould go on without interruption. The Department considers that the Indians are quite justified in complaining as to the way the school has been managed for some time past and it thinks that the best solution of the difficulty would be the appointment of a teacher who would devote his or her whole time to the work of the school, and it is assured that a competent teacher could be had for the salary allowed.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\nDear Sir;\u2014\n\nIn answer to yours of the 26th. of May, I would beg to say that I have forwarded the complaint to the present teacher of the Indian school, the Rev. W. Page, and told him to send his explanation at once to the department.\n\nWhether the present mode,\u2014so long in existence\u2014of making the clergyman of St. Francis the teacher of the school is the best one is open to question, but the Government have to bear in mind that the object of the Indians on the reserve is either to get an Indian teacher for the school or someone who would naturally carry out the wishes of the Indians.\n\nIt always appeared to the late Archbishop and to myself, that the only prospect of making an educational effort in any way a success would be through having a teacher who was not an Indian; hence the amalgamation of the two positions at the beginning. I am still of the same opinion that it would be a mistake to have an Indian teacher or one under the control of the Indians in the locality.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJames, Bishop of\u2014\n\nThe Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nSince writing to you on the 14th instant our school teacher has again closed his school 5\u00bd days. If his quarterly return does not show the time during which the school is closed, then I suppose his journal does not show it either, or the inspector would not report the school as satisfactory.\n\nThe teacher does not care for the place and school any way and would only be glad if removed. The teacher should be appointed by the Government and not by the Bishop.\n\nThere are two protestant denominations here, and we ask the government for no preacher. What we want is a good teacher.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nJohn Tahamont, Ind.\nOttawa, June 33, 1908.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nComplaints have been received from some of the Protestant Indians of St. Francis that their teacher has taken more than the authorized number of holidays and that he does not keep the school open during the prescribed hours.\n\nBishop Carmichael, of Montreal, who was written to on this subject, replied on the 27th of last month, stating that he had forwarded the complaint to the Rev. Mr. Page, the teacher, telling him to send his explanation at once to the Department. Up to the present time he has not done so and, as he has had ample time, the Department should deal with this matter.\n\nMr. Nasta, who was in Ottawa about the first of this month, assured me that it was quite true that Mr. Page paid very little attention to the school and expressed the wish that the appointment of a teacher should be made by the Department and that the offices of teacher and missionary should not be combined.\n\nPierreville is very advantageously situated for obtaining the services of a competent white teacher and I am certain it would be to interests of the Indian children to give them a teacher who would devote his whole time to the work. The Department pays the salary and, if a teacher belonging\nbelonging to the Church of England were appointed, the Bishop should have no cause for complaint. Up to the present time he has had the nomination, and virtually the appointment, of the teacher, as his nominee has always been accepted. The school has been unsuccessful for some years past, owing to the fact that the missionary teacher considered himself under the immediate control of the Bishop of the diocese and not of the Department, and it is time that this was remedied. Mr. Masta also told me that they would much prefer to have a qualified teacher than a missionary, if they could not have both. At Present a number of the Protestant Indian children are attending the Roman catholic school there, and they would like to have a teacher of their own faith.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Benson\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\n[Handwritten note]\n\nReport from Mr. Brown\nwhether urgent he had at once; if not dept will take matter of appointment in its own hands\n\nOttawa, June 23, 1908\nOttawa, June 24, 1906.\n\nRight Reverend Sirs,\n\nReferring to Your Lordship's letter of the 37th date, in which you advised the Department that you had notified the teacher of the Pierreville Church of England school to send his explanations regarding the Indians' complaint as to his neglect of duty at once to the Department, I beg to say that, up to the present time, no communication has been received from Mr. Page, the teacher, and unless he complies with your orders without any further delay the Department will at once take action.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nRight Reverend Sirs,\nYour obedient Servants,\n\nJ.

R. E. Page at Pierreville just before leaving Canada, but in some way the letter must have miscarried, for it was returned to Bishopscourt from the Dead Letter Office a short time ago. It has now been handed, with other papers relating to the subject, to the Dean of Montreal, the Bishop's Commissary, but he also is absent from the City at the moment. If the papers have been forwarded to him, he will no doubt give the matter his immediate attention.\n\nIf you will kindly defer action until the Bishop returns, or the Dean communicates with you, we shall be greatly obliged.\n\nAm, my dear Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

If things are going on the same next term, the parents will be obliged to send their children to some other school. We sincerely hope we shall have a successful reply.\n\nWe remain your obedient servants,\n\nJohn Johnson, Sub-Chief\n\nSolomon Benedict, Grand Chief\n\nE. Cliff, Sagamore\n\nLouis Lagrange\n\nDavid Benedict\n\nGeorge Paguelto\n\nPeter Emmett\n\nDaniel Emmett\nOttawa, July 8, 1908.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nOn May 26, last, Bishop O'michael was informed that the Protestant Indians of St. Francis had urged complaints against their teacher, Mr. Page, and he was asked to obtain any explanations from Mr. Page that he might have to make. The Bishop acknowledged this letter and stated that he had told Mr. Page to send his explanations at once to the Department.\n\nHis attention was again called to this matter on the 24th ult., when a reply was received from the Secretary of the Diocese of Montreal, stating that the Bishop was absent in England and that the letter to Mr. Page had been returned from the Dead Letter office.\n\nDean Evans of Montreal has also written on this subject, stating that through some oversight Mr. Page had not been informed of the complaints made but that he is instructing him to reply and asks that the Department delay action long enough to allow him to answer the complaints.\n\nI think that the Dean might be informed that the Department will give Mr. Page till the 15th inst. to answer the charges, but in the interests of the school I consider the present mode of appointing teachers most unsatisfactory. The Indians have sent\nin several communications to the effect that they wish to have a teacher who will devote his whole time to the work instead of having his duties divided between missionary and school work, and they prefer that the appointment should rest solely with the Department and that they might be given an opportunity of recommending the teacher. Neither the Church nor the Indians contribute anything towards the teacher's salary and if the Department decides to take the matter of appointment out of the Church's hands it should have full control. As I stated in my previous memorandum of the 33rd ult., there should be no difficulty in obtaining a properly qualified teacher to take charge of this school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Beaven\nOttawa, July 8, 1906.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ult., with reference to the charges preferred against Mr. Page, teacher of the St. Francis Church of England school, by the Indians, and I reply I beg to say that the Department will take action still after the 15th inst.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Very Reverend Lewis Evans, D.D., L.L.D.,\nDean of the Diocese of Montreal,\nMontreal, Que.\nfor which I knew of no immediate remedy was discouraging to any earnest teacher. The want of cooperation from parents in the pupils' home studies does great damage to their advance. I have been told by the pupils that Mr. Masta once taught has counseled them to rebel against my decisions. He also said that they told me the Inspector had granted them, but he spoke in such a way and indirectly, so I did not understand him. I would not at first grant it, but Mr. Masta told them to take it.\n\nI have done my best to help the boys and girls. I have had the greatest trouble at another time. I think there may be a few days at that time which may have been misstated as I find only one week marked as absent during that quarter when there should be two.\n\nDuring this last quarter I was absent a week at Easter, when Easter holidays were on. And one week for examinations. There were also two days given loss by the Government Inspector for the good results at times.\n\nYou say Mr. Page took unauthorized leave, from whom should I ask leave? I thought that it was permissible to absent myself and that of the days would\nnot be made up part of the teacher's salary would be deducted.\n\nI may say that my absence has not impeded the advance of my pupils in comparison with past years as the Inspector's report, a copy of which is enclosed, will testify.\n\nThe Inspector says as follows:\n\n\"I visited the school on January 19th, 1908, visited the school of the Indians at Pointe-au-P\u00e8re, and I have been satisfied with the result of the teaching, the progress of the pupils and the discipline of the school.\"\n\nJ.B. Belcourt\n\n\"I visited the school on June 16th, 1908, found the classes present - proper conduct - they were very satisfactory.\"\n\nJ.B. Belcourt\n\nThe standard of education has been raised. I have had shorthand, bookkeeping and French, besides the usual subjects on the curriculum. I have also helped some of my pupils as William Watts in the evening and taught adult pupils which I thought to some extent compensated for my absence, which was not caused by church duties but seldom.\n\nI suppose it is correct to report that Rosa Maria and Clarence Tahamont have been about during the last few months more often than present.

Richard Page, giving explanations asked for by the Department.\n\nYour, &c.,\nA. O. Comire,\nI. A.\nOttawa, October 5, 1908.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nSeveral complaints having been received regarding the unsatisfactory manner in which Mr. Page conducted the Church of England school on the St. Francis reserve, the late Bishop Carmichael, of Montreal, who nominated him, was written to and Dean Evans replied for him and on the strength of his communication Mr. Page was given another trial.\n\nSince the reopening of the school after the summer holidays complaint has been made that Mr. Page has absented himself and Mr. Agent Comire, who was written to on the subject, incloses a letter from him, in which he admits that he was absent at least four times during the month, in all about ten teaching days. His explanation is not at all satisfactory and he says he is going away again on Church matters and he seems to be very indifferent whether his services are retained or not and asks to be informed whether he is to teach till arrangements separating the school and missionary work are made or whether his services are to be dispensed with immediately.\n\nHe has entered on a new quarter and I think Dean Evans should be informed that the Department considers the present school arrangement most unsatisfactory and that a new teacher will have to be provided, who\nwill devote his full time to this work. It is most unfair to the Indians that the present arrangement should continue.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Benson\nOttawa, October 8, 1906.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nReferring to our conversation of yesterday in regard to the Church of England school on the St. Francis reserve I beg to say that the Department agrees with you that it would be better to allow Mr. Page, the present teacher, to retire at once and, pending the appointment of a new teacher, the school may be temporarily closed and the local Agent will be so advised.\n\nThe Department would be obliged if you would notify Mr. Page that his services as teacher of this school are no longer required and trust that you will be able to nominate a successor at an early date and consider that one with provincial qualifications should be secured.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Very Rev. Lewis Evans, D.D., L.L.D.,\nDean of the Diocese of Montreal,\nMontreal, Que.\nOttawa, October 8, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nIn connection with previous correspondence regarding the Church of England school on the St. Francis Reserve I beg to say that it has been arranged by the Church authorities that Mr. Page, the present teacher, is to give up the school at once and they will notify them to this effect.\n\nThe school is to be closed on Mr. Page's retirement, pending the appointment of a new teacher, and you will be good enough to advise the Indians accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. STEWART\n\nA.O. Comte, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Francois du Lac, Que.\nOttawa, November 24, 1908.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nChief Solomon Benedict has just called here in reference to the Protestant school at St. Francois, which has been closed since Sept. 30, last. In fact it was only open a few days since June 30, as Mr. Page, the missionary who taught the school, was unable to attend to it on account of his other duties.\n\nDean Evans, of Montreal, was asked to nominate a successor on October 8, last, but up to the present time no reply has been received from him and Chief Benedict says that the Indians are anxious to have the school reopened at once and recommends that Mr. Henry Masta, who is a member of the band and a well educated Indian be appointed teacher. Masta taught the school many years ago but his services were dispensed with on account of his habits and mode of life. I understand that since then a great reformation has taken place in Masta and the Chief assures me that he has not used intoxicants for twenty years, and although he is separated from his wife he is living morally.\n\nThe Indians have for some time past complained of\nof the teacher's and missionary's work being combined, as the school suffers in consequence, and they wish to have a teacher who can devote his whole time to the work. Benedict says, and I have been informed by other Indians, that of the two they would rather have a regular teacher than a missionary, as they could always obtain the services of a clergyman by paying for them. It seems too bad that the education of the Protestant children should be neglected, owing to the inability of the Church of England to provide a suitable teacher. The Department Pays the teacher's salary and in the interests of the Indians I think it should appoint one without further delay, as the Church has had ample warning and opportunity. If Masta was given the appointment temporarily, he could reopen the school at once, and as none of the Protestant Indians, I am informed, would object to the appointment, it is for you to say whether he might be given a trial or not.\n\nMartin B. Cameron\nOttawa, November 26, 1908.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nI beg to call your attention to the letter of the 8th ult. written you in regard to the Church of England school on the St. Francis reserve.\n\nThe Department is informed that the school has been closed practically since the summer holidays and the Indians whose children should attend complain bitterly that they are left without a teacher and have requested the Department to appoint Mr. Henry Masta, who is a member of the band and a well educated Indian, as their teacher.\n\nIf you have no qualified teacher in view who would be able to take charge of this school at once, the Department would like to know if you would object to Masta's being employed temporarily, as the school should be reopened immediately.\n\nThe Department would be much obliged if you would give this matter your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Very Rev. Lewis Evans, D.C.L.,\nDean of the Diocese of Montreal,\nMontreal, Que.\nRef. to\nNo. 154570\nNov. 26th\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am reply to your favour of\nlast 26th. I think he would be\nvery happy in having Mr.\n[illegible] charge of the school\nat St. Francis. If you permit\nhe is very appointed temporarily\nand at the pleasure of your\ndepartment. The experiment will\neither prove that he is the right\nman, or as I think more likely\nwill satisfy the Indians that he\nhas, and will make it easier\nfor us to make a new satisfactory\nand permanent arrangements\n\nJune 19th\n\nIndian Affairs, School Files,\n\nIndian Affairs, School Files, (AG 10), Volume 6022, File 297-1, part 1)\n\nDem.

Mr. Inspector Belcourt, in his last report on this school, which was received in the Department today, states that \"Mr. Masta is by far the most competent teacher for this school and it would be most regrettable if he were to give it up.\" He endorses the application for an increase, saying that his salary is not sufficient and that $300.00 a year for a man teacher is no longer adequate.\n\nAs Mr. Masta's services have been so satisfactory I consider that it would be only right to recognize them by giving him an increase of salary.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nI think allow $300.00 from 1 year.\nOttawa, January 3rd, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th ultimo applying for an increase in salary as teacher of the Protestant school on the St. Francis reserve, and in reply I beg to say that the Department will grant you an increase of $50.00 from the first of the current quarter, January 1st.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nHenry Masta, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nPierreville, Que.\nChinewill Jan. 10-1910\n\nJ.

As your visit to Ottawa has been undertaken for a personal matter, the funds of the Band cannot be used to pay your travelling expenses.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAas't Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. Solomon Benedict,\nOttawa.\nPeriville Jan. 10 - 1911\n\nTo Mr. McLean Esq.,\nActing Deputy Chief, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nWe, your humble petitioners, parents of school children, and other Indians professing the Protestant faith do hereby respectfully present that our school teacher Mr. Masta has accomplished more in one year than any of his predecessors did in two years at school.\n\nThe children like him to the extent that they would sooner please him than their parents. They need now no coercion and no reminder to go to school, for they themselves even those under age want to be there, as soon as the bell rings. The attendance is regular and has increased in number over two or more years.\n\nIt is a well known fact that Mr. Masta has some magnetic power or influence over his friends and acquaintances, but especially over his pupils and own children. As a matter of fact, we all like and esteem him very much.\n\nHe is a man who has a great interest in the education of the children and who loves to impart knowledge to everyone and all of us generally. And he has such a way of doing this that we are always interested and pleased to listen to him. A man with his qualifications could easily obtain a salary of $700.00-$800.00 a year, in some of the Western Provinces, but he prefers to work amongst his own people, for less money.\n\nBut Masta's salary is far from being a just distribution for his services, for as we have said, he does twice as much work as any man we have had so far, and by right he ought to get a twofold compensation.\n\nPeriville, the Aboriginals\nIndians do not now live the Indian mode of life. Formerly we lived in our own wigwam or log cabin. It was a kitchen but answered all other purposes as well. It was used as a sitting room, parlor and bed rooms. The furniture consisted in one rustic bedstead and table, and a couple of chairs or benches of some make.\n\nOur dwellings, now, are so good, comfortable and convenient as those of our White brothers. The Lord Bishop Farthing, the Venerable Archdeacon Norton and other clergymen are well pleased and satisfied with the accommodation and entertainment they received at Mr. Masta's while visiting here.\n\nHereafter, everyone deported to this place by the Dept of Indian Affairs would likewise be welcome to Mr. Masta's hospitality. We dare say that while luxury is wanting, you there would find better accommodation than can be got at the hotels here.\n\nAnd dear Mr. Mclean we wish to remind you furthermore that, the Dept has done nothing towards providing this suitable dwelling for our teacher Mr. Masta, nor for the furniture and heating of said dwelling, as in the case of other teachers, or this and other reserves. The Dept does not spend a cent either for our church, that is for the salary of our missionary while all the other missionaries to the Indians in Canada receive a certain stipend from the Government. In consideration of all these facts, we your humble petitioners hereby respectfully beg of you to increase our teacher's salary. We ask not as at first intimated that a twofold compensation be given him; but we do most sincerely ask that his present salary of \u00a335 be raised to \u00a350 at least, or that \u00a315 extra be allowed him for his house, furniture and fuel. We earnestly beg leave to offer you, Mr. Mclean, our school children who cannot but say that their teacher deserves all\nDear Sir,\n\nWe leave it to your own judgment who is the man, an Indian or any one else following the European style or manner of living, that can subsist on $56 a year, taking into account the extraordinary cost of living now a days. Your humble petitioners dole ask moreover that the travelling and other expenses of our delegate Mr. Solomon Benedict be paid by the Dept. with our own share of the Band's fund.\n\nWith a feeling of gratitude that our demands are just and reasonable, and assurance that they will be fully complied with, we wishing you just a happy and prosperous New Year, subscribe ourselves\n\nYour humble petitioners and obedient servants,\n\nSol Benedict Councillor\n\n1.

Carri\u00e8re\nAgent des Sauvages\nJune 21st, 1911\n\nTo-day I visited the Protestant Indian School at St. Francis Reserve. By the kind permission of the teacher, Mr. Henry R. Masta, I examined the pupils' progress in Reading, Writing and Arithmetic. The result in each case was highly satisfactory, especially in Arithmetic, which included a seven test in Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division of Vulgar fractions. The pupils, most of whom are very young, seem to be very intelligent, diligent and obedient. The school is very neat, and the general culture seems to be very good. The discipline seems to be excellent, and manifests itself in the respectful tone and orderly deportment of the whole school.\n\nMr. Masta seems to me to be an efficient teacher. Including the subjects mentioned on the scale of Proficiency, he can teach English and French, and is able to explain matters to his pupils in their mother tongue. It is equally evident from the high average attendance that his pupils like him, and that the parents are well satisfied with his work.\n\nHaving taught and inspected schools for a number of years before I entered the University, I think I can speak from experience and am confident that I know a well equipped school when I examine it.\n\nUnder these circumstances I have no hesitation in characterising the Protestant Indian School at St. Francis Reserve, as well equipped.\n\nThe principles of rational inquiry and systematic ethical instruction which must necessarily be combined in order that the advancement of education be achieved, are obvious in this school.\n\nI consider the school as I observe it.\nexaminations and was leaving the school. I asked Mr. Masta the Teacher what his salary was per annum, and he replied, \"three hundred and fifty dollars per annum\". I could scarcely credit it; and do here and now deem it a crying shame that a man doing such excellent work should be paid what he termed \"merely starvation wages\". I therefore strongly recommend that the Protestant Teachers salary be increased, to at least five hundred dollars per annum.\n\nSigned M. W. Waughton C.L.K.\nIncumbent\n\nCertified true copy:\nC. H.

He is at present paid at the rate of $350.00 per annum. Mr Masta is a well educated Indian and is recommended for an increase by Mr School Inspector Belcourt, the Rev. Mr Norton, incumbent of the parish, Mr Cormier, our agent and the chiefs and councillors of the band. $500.00 is the amount suggested by Mr. Belcourt, who states that he can certify that Mr Masta's pupils have made very marked progress since he has had charge of the school and that it would be just and reasonable that his salary be increased to at least $500.00 per year. He also says that he does not believe that there is a single teacher in the Province of Quebec at present, drawing less than that amount.\n\nMasta is a good teacher and although the attendance is small the average is large considering the small number\nnumber of protestant Indians on the reserve.

Ce sera la m\u00eame chose pour la rentr\u00e9e des classes au mois de sept. La famille Dionne, qui sont aux \u00c9tats-Unis, ne seront pas de retour avant le 8 ou le 10 sept., alors ceux qui ne vont pas aux \u00c9tats-Unis, ne peuvent pas \u00eatre de retour en classe avant le autre \u00e9coliers.\n\nJ'ai pas voulu leur donner course et une remise \u00e0 leur demande, si vous voyez que l'\u00e9cole ouvre le 1er sept. ou plus tard, vous voudrez bien m'en dire un mot.\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nJoseph Cole\n\n[Signature]\nPierreville June 24th 1912\n\nJos. Cote Esq.\nIndian Agent\n\nSir,\n\nThe schools in the Reserve and the neighboring villages, and in fact in the whole Province\u2014all except ours\u2014close on the 21st of June. We have studied hard all winter and we want to be out now, same as all other pupils.\n\nOur teacher is very good and kind to us but we don't see why he insists on keeping us in to the last of this month.\n\nPlease tell him to close up today\u2014please do.\n\nWe are only one boy and two girls to school at present\u2014the others are gone to the United States for the summer.\n\nYour little servants,\n\nFred Watson\nBeatrice Nolette\nTranslation.\n\nAbenakis Agency,\nPierreville, June 27, 1912.\n\n406301\n\nSir,\n\nI inclose herewith a letter from the two last pupils of Mr. H. Masta. As you see, they are not numerous and they would like to finish their year about June 28; that is the date on which all the other schools close. It will be the same thing about the re-opening of the classes in the month of September: the Abenakis families who are in the United States will not return before September 8 or 10; then those who do not go to the United States would like very much not to return to the school before the other pupils do.\n\nI did not wish to give them holidays and to comply with their request. If you require that the school should open on September 1 or later, will you be kind enough to send me word.\n\nYours, etc.,\n\nJos. Cote.\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 3, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 27th ultimo in reference to the dates of opening and closing of the schools on the Pierreville Reserve I beg to say that the Department wishes its regulations in this respect adhered to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJos. Cote, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPierreville, Que.\nI had the day the pleasure of visiting the Protestant School at St. Francis Reserve, and heard the children read and write, and examined their work in writing, arithmetic, grammar, geography and history. The results were very satisfactory. The younger children showed a knowledge of figures in addition and multiplication, which surprised me. And for the older ones, here a fair knowledge of grammar, geography and Canadian history. They seem to have the dates of important events well in hand. The children are well conducted.\n\nThere is none of that restlessness and wantonness which one sees so much in country schools\u2014which I have no doubt is due to the influence of the teacher, Mr. H.C. Watts. Mr. Watts is an Indian, and can converse fluently in the English and French languages. I consider this a great boon especially for the younger children to whom he can explain matters in their native tongue.\n\nThe good result of his work is shown in the fact that one of his pupils in 1910-11 is now working on his Matric.\nfor Dartmouth College. In the midst of childhood and youth\u2014which is our essentially formative, definitive, and instructive period\u2014there is no hour of it lost to something with eternity\u2014it is a good thing to have a teacher who inspires his pupils to seek the best in life.\n\nThe school is clean, neat, and very comfortable. Mr. Watts has informed me that a new screen door, new screen windows, a new platform, and some repairs to the roof have been added this year. I am of the opinion that the salary accruing from this work ($150.00 per annum) is not by any means sufficient for a man who devotes all his time and energy to the task. Therefore going to a correct account of affairs so they appear to me.\n\nRobert Ritter D.T.C.\nMissionary.\nOttawa, July 6, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your memorandum attached to the quarterly report of the teacher of the Protestant School on the Pierreville Indian Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, while the Department appreciates the fact that Mr. Masta is doing good work at this school, the attendance is not such as to warrant a further increase in his salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev.

Mr. Ma\u00eetre, bien a fait cette le\u00e7on, parce que\nnous avons parl\u00e9 de choses qui nous ont donn\u00e9 une\nsatisfaction. On me dit que le professeur qui est charg\u00e9\nde cette \u00e9cole, avant de commencer \u00e0 faire\navant les enfants \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole et aussi que le professeur\n\u00e9tudiait \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s rien; ceci explique facilement\net ainsi la raison principale d'apr\u00e8s moi : les jeunes\nAlgonquins, \u00e2g\u00e9s de dix ans, encore, ne savent pas\nce qu'ils doivent faire dans une \u00e9cole. Si les Algonquins,\nceux-ci ne savent pas que la langue Algonquine, de sorte\nque ces enfants qui se pr\u00e9sentent \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole, ne savent\npas l'algonquin et le professeur qui ne peut pas l'algonquin\npeut pas difficilement \u00eatre fait comprendre. D'apr\u00e8s moi\nc'est l\u00e0 la principale cause des insucc\u00e8s des professeurs\nqui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 Mr. Ma\u00eetre. Je consid\u00e8re que Mr. Ma\u00eetre\na un grand avantage : celui de parler l'algonquin \u00e0 ces\njeunes enfants, et de ce fait, leur faire comprendre ce qu'ils\nne comprennent pas. Il doit avoir un professeur ne\nparlant pas l'algonquin, je ne peux pas \u00eatre plus de\nd\u00e9tails, que je devrais le faire, mais c'est afin de\nvous faire appr\u00e9cier davantage les travaux de Mr. Ma\u00eetre,\nparlant le fran\u00e7ais, l'algonquin et l'algonquin.\n\nJe crois que ces explications vous aideront \u00e0 vous\nrendre \u00e0 la demande de Mr. Ma\u00eetre, \u00e0 savoir, lui\naccorder une augmentation de salaire.\n\nJoseph Cole\n\n[Signature]\nDear Sir,\n\nI am most anxious to obtain for our teacher, Mr. Henry L. Meade, an increase in salary. He is methodical and careful in his work, loved by the children and respected by the parents. I think I know the minds of the parents in the matter and they are absolutely no complaints but all are satisfied with his work. He has at the present time fourteen pupils which is an increase. I believe he had eight previous to this.\n\nI think you would be justified perfectly under limits to grant him at least $600 per annum.\n\nSincerely,\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister,\nIndian Affairs Dept.,\nOttawa.\n\nYours very Truly,\n\nPeter Leslie,\nMoosonee.\nPimicville Dec. 23 - 1912\n\nTo the Secretary Dept. of Indian Affairs Ottawa\n\nSir,\n\nI respectfully refer you to the reports by the school inspector, Mr. Blevins, the Indian agent, Mr. Cole, and the Rev. Mr. Little, of the Protestant Day School here, for the quarter ending Dec. 31st 1912, of which I, your humble servant, am the teacher.\n\nI am so full of the good work done that I am confident these reports will warrant the Dept. to increase my salary at least $100 per annum. Your servant has worked hard in and out of school, striving not only with the pupils but with their parents as well, in order to secure a good and regular attendance at school. The number on the roll has considerably increased and so has the average attendance. The parents are now alive to the importance of their children's education and the pupils themselves, through emulation, are doing as much as can reasonably be expected.\n\nConsider also the cost of living. It has increased about 15% so that a man is not any better off now at a salary of $600 than some years ago at $500.\n\nFuel, i.e., coal or wood, has doubled in price. Water is another thing that has become very dear. Lapierre Bros. ask me $100 just to connect my house with the main water pipe. I cannot afford to pay that much, and so have to go without their water system.\n\nI trust that this my humble petition will receive due consideration.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Note: The handwriting is difficult to read.]\nSir,\n\nIn accordance with your circulars in regard to schools, I went on Friday, Dec. 20, to the Protestant school, conducted by Mr. H.L. Masta. The pupils, boys and girls, to the number of fourteen, were all present. I spent an hour and a half with them. I got them to read; I questioned them on arithmetic, geography, and the history of Canada. Mr. Masta got them to recite some little pieces by heart, and made them go through some gymnastic exercises.\n\nI may say that they all gave me satisfaction. I am told that the teachers who taught at this school had much difficulty in getting the children to attend, and also that the progress was almost nil; this is easily explained, and the following is the chief reason in my opinion: these young Abenakis up to the age of about ten years do not go away at all, but live with their mothers, Abenakis; the latter speak to them only in the Abenakis language, so that these children who attend the school knowing only Abenakis and the teacher speaking only English, he can only with difficulty make himself understood. In my opinion this is the chief reason for the lack of success on the part of the teachers who preceded Mr. Masta. I consider that Mr. Masta has a great advantage\u2014that of speaking Abenakis to these young children, and that this fact makes them understand what they would not comprehend if they had a teacher speaking only English.\n\nI am giving you perhaps more details that I ought; but it is in order to make you appreciate the advantage of the services of Mr. Masta, speaking French, English and Abenakis. I believe that these explanations\nwill assist you in complying with the request of Mr. Masta, namely, to grant him an increase of salary.\n\nYour, &c.,\nJoe. Cote,\nAgent.\nOttawa, January 9, 1913.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Masta, teacher of the Protestant School on the Abenakis Reserve at Pierreville, has renewed his application for an increase in salary. He has been receiving $450.00 a year since July, 1911, and he considers that the increased attendance and high cost of living should entitle him to a further increase.\n\nRev. Mr. Little, Church of England Missionary, speaks very highly of Mr. Masta's work and says that he thinks it would be within perfectly proper limits to grant him at least $600.00 a year. Mr. Cote, our Agent, writes to say that he visited the school late last month and found fourteen pupils present and was very much pleased with the manner in which Mr. Masta was conducting the school and the progress made by the pupils and endorses Mr. Masta's application for an increase in salary.\n\nThe attendance at this school is much improved since Mr. Masta has taken charge and his services have been most satisfactory to the Department and the Indians on the\nreserve and I think the Department would be quite justified in giving him an increase of $50.00, bringing his salary up to $500.00 a year, which is little enough as prices are at present.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, January 9, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 23rd ultimo applying for an increase in salary as teacher of the Protestant school on the Abenakis Reserve I beg to say that the Department will grant you an increase of $50.00 from the first of the current quarter and Mr. Agent Cote will be so advised. This will make your salary $500.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. L.

The children at this school who speak their maternal language receive instructions in their own language and this makes their progress easier.\n\nMr. Masta complains of the smallness of his salary and in this I agree with him. The cost of living has increased so much that the teachers of this province have demanded an increase in their salaries and the minimum for salaries has been placed at six hundred dollars ($600.).\n\n(sgd.)

I noticed with pleasure the progress made by the pupils since my last visit to this school. Mr. H.L. Masta exercises much zeal to obtain such good results.\n\nI also consider that Mr. Masta deserves the highest possible salary to reward him for his work. A salary of six hundred dollars a year would, certainly, not be too high, especially because this is the salary paid to teachers in the neighboring localities.\n\nJoseph Cote,\nIndian Agent.\nSt. Francis Indian Village\n5th January 1914\n\nAfter an interesting and prolonged visit at the Indian school on the St. Francis River, which took place today, it gives me great pleasure to record my satisfaction at finding everything in such good order. The clean comfortable well equipped school rooms; the intelligence & discipline shown by the pupils; the many indications of general progress being made; these all combined in impressing most favourably the interested outsider.\n\nAs Anglican missionary here, having my own children in school; and, knowing what I write, it is only fair to say that Mr. Henry L. Marta is fitted to be congratulated upon his efforts being crowned with such success in educating the young on this reserve.\n\nI would like to add further, that it is most fortunate for the community that the services of Mr. Marta are available for the position of teacher here. He is in the prime of life; held in the highest esteem by all; has great influence over both parents & scholars; converses fluently in French, English & Indian. He is thus able to fill a most difficult position with profit & skill. To me, it seems that $600.00 per annum is the very lowest salary such a man should be asked to accept.\n\nAllan E. Mount,\nMissionary.\nDear Sir,\n\nAs I already intimated, with my present salary, it is impossible for me to lay up anything for evil or rainy days. And as my means are limited, my trade with the Indians is very insignificant too.\n\nFor the last 35 years, I have suffered from no illness, for which I am very thankful; but as I am now pretty well advanced in age, I cannot depend entirely on my good health. I don't want to go to a poor house and if I fall sick, I would have to be a charity patient somehow. I pray you therefore to increase my salary to $200.00 a year, if you consider that I deserve it.\n\nEnclosed are 3 testimonials from the Rev. Mr. Munt, Mr. Cote Indian Agent and Mr. J.B.

I know that the lay teachers of this province have, everywhere, asked for an increase in their salaries and I would recommend at least $600.\nMEMORANDUM,\n\nMr. Scott,-\n\nMr. Masta, teacher of the Protestant School on the Apenakis Reserve, has applied for an increase in his salary and forwards testimonials from the Church of England Missionary, the Indian Agent and the School Inspector as to his efficiency and success. Mr. Inspector Belcourt, in his last report on this school, says that the teacher complains of the insufficiency of salary and, in consideration of the good results at this school, he would recommend an increase in salary. He adds that the lay teachers of the Province of Quebec everywhere ask for an increase in the salaries and he recommends that he should be given at least $600.00. Mr. Masta has been teaching this school for a number of years and lately the average attendance has been more than doubled. His salary was increased from $450.00 to $500.00 last January and, in view of the recommendations above referred to, he is deserving of a further increase.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, January 27, 1914.\nOttawa, January 30, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant applying for an increase in your salary as teacher of the Protestant School on the Pierreville Reserve, together with testimonials from the Church of England Missionary, the Indian Agent and the School Inspector.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that it cannot meet your wishes at present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. L. Masta, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nPierreville, Que.\nChiniville, April\n\nD.C. Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Chief, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nBeing well qualified and well recommend-\ned and knowing that the minimum salary of teachers\nfor the country elementary schools in the province of\nQuebec is $600.00 and in the City of Montreal $1500.00,\nI sent in my application, sometime ago, for an in-\ncrease in salary. It is true that my school is\nsmall but all agree to say that it is doing re-\nmarkably well. The progress is not accomplished\nonly through teaching in the school but I do a lot\nof work outside as well. I go from house to\nhouse pleading with the parents to see that their\nchildren attend school regularly. I am interested\nin the education of my fellow Indians. I often bring\nthe important question of education before the long\ncouncil of the band, in the interest of both schools.\nThe Dept. however did not see its way clear to grant-\ning my request, but I hope and pray that my\npetition will receive reconsideration.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nH. L. Maaske\nOttawa, April 14, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant again applying for an increase in your salary as teacher of the Protestant School on the Abenakis Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department, as you have already been informed, cannot grant you any increase.\n\nIn regard to your statement that the minimum salary for teachers in the country elementary schools in the Province of Quebec is $600.00 per annum, you have evidently been misinformed, as the last Annual Report of the Superintendent of Public Instruction for the Province of Quebec on file in the Department shows that there are few if any of the teachers in rural schools in the Province of Quebec receiving as high a salary as you are.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. L. Maste, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nPierreville, Que.\nToday I visited the Indian School, conducted by Mr. H.J. Masta, on the St. Francois Indian Reserve, and it affords me great pleasure to report on its present condition.\n\nHaving been trained myself for the teaching profession and having taught several years afterwards, both in the elementary and advanced school, one might be permitted to say that one has a good idea of a well conducted school and its average ability of children.\n\nThe school building here is neat, clean, appears to be quite commodious. The seats are such as make children comfortable, which fact contributes much little to the good order and progress in school.\n\nThere is a good supply of maps and there is also a globe for use in teaching geography. The library contains quite a few books, but there do not appear to be many of the same kind, making it difficult to have more than two or three pupils reading the one lesson, whereas a reading room may enable to greater part of the whole school occasionally, and will be an advantage to all classes, particularly the lower classes. The English Grammar books are rather advanced. The school needs a supply of simple books for the smaller classes. I noticed all their arithmetic was of an advanced standard and not very suitable for younger children.\n\nI examined the classes in reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, history, and found them very good in each and all. I was particularly struck with their reading as each child read very distinctly. This is more surprising when one considers the difficulty of mastering the English language. This success is due, no doubt, to the ability of their\nTeacher, Mrs. Masta, & explain matters them in their native tongue. Their writing was good, showed good progress. In Arithmetic they are quite up to the standard; the older class worked some problems without any learning difficulty, under four simple rules, the Compound rule, Multiplication & Division, Addition & Interest etc. They also have a fair knowledge of Geography & Canadian History.\n\nIn appearance the children were tidy, very neat. They seemed very much at ease in school, showing that they were happy & at home with the teacher. Seeing such progress made in the school, one may inclined to say that it could be only a dream. They are very fortunate in having such an influential man as Mr. H.L. Masta, training children who will be future citizens of this great Dominion. These children are being influenced in every way for good. Mr. Masta is doing a large part toward forming a character of those who will be future inhabitants of this valley & he is to be heartily congratulated for his devotion to his people. The noble work he is doing.\n\nThe salary for Mr. Masta felt for this work is very small for a man of his ability, the Can. Church, fluent in the English, French, Indian tongues therefore could occupy a responsible position anywhere.\n\nI must protest to the statement made by my predecessor that six hundred dollars ($600) is too low toward salary such a man deserves, looked & accepted.\n\nDavid Combs\nMissionary in Charge\nOttawa, July 9, 1914.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th ultimo, and in reply I have to thank you for your interesting report on the work at the St. Francis Protestant School.\n\nIn regard to granting an increase in salary to Mr. Hesta, the teacher, I beg to say that he has been informed of the Department's attitude in this respect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. David Coombs,\nSt. Francis Indian Reserve,\nPierreville, Que.\nSt. Francis Mission\n1307-57\nPimicille\nJan 17, 1916\n\nDear Mr. [Name],\n\nMr. R. L. [Name] is on his way to Ottawa to request your Department for an increase to his salary as Protestant school teacher on this Reserve. His present salary $500 is really small for the good work he performs in the instruction of the children under his care. I can truly testify to the proficiency of the boys and girls from personal examinations on several occasions, when I could see their progress in the conduct of the School.\n\nThe amount allowed by the Department seems in no wise adequate for the results obtained in the schools which are good educated, and when it is considered that we must try to keep up a house outside the school grounds, it appears a just request.\n\nHope you may consider it, I thus advise your Department.\n\nYours,\n\nRespectfully yours,\nR.C. Brewer\n[Signature]\n\nBOOK COPY\nPineville O.T.

We waited for him until 11 o'clock and there being no likely hood of his coming that day\u2014the train that he was to come on was due here at 6:45 A.M. and the only other train from Nicola comes in at 3:30 P.M., but he would not come on this as it would then be too late for him to do any work\u2014and because my hired man with horses was waiting for us, we left at 11 o'clock and got back at 4 o'clock with 20 trees which we planted the same day.\n\nThe trip and work cost me $3.00\n\nMr. Belcourt dropped at the P.O. here, to my address, an Inspector's Blank Letter for me to fill up, with a note on the blank itself stating that at 2 P.M. he found the school closed but that he knew everything would have been right.\nright, had he come at the specified time.\"\n\nI filled up the blank according to instructions and returned it, but first wrote below his note the following:\n\n\"6 Mai 1916\n\ncher Mr Belcourt,\n\nNous devions f\u00eater la f\u00eate des Arbres jeudi le 4 courant, mais ce jour \u00e9tait sombre et froid avec apparence de mauvais temps, dans l'avant midi nous remimes la partie au lendemain.

It is my intention to go, having the New Year's Holiday, to Ottawa for that purpose, so both my colleagues would not be alone there.\n\nShould I pull through all right, but were delayed until one or two weeks after the 3rd of January, I trust the Dept. would not reckon with me for same, considering that my school has never been closed through any sickness of mine. And because my salary is very small, irrespective of the high cost of living, which, if accounted for, under it absolutely sufficient to meet other than small and ordinary expenses, I beg to ask The Secretary, would he be so kind as to consider, if the cost of my operation and other expenses in connection therewith, were paid out of the Relief Fund?\n\nI imagine that there may be a certain hospital where the employees of the Dept., when sick, are treated and fare off at a reduced price.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nHenry L.

Il ne va pas de soi dire que la situation ne fut pas bien longue sur un projet de solution urgente. Un bon nombre d'instituteurs souffrent d\u00e9j\u00e0 de l'exigu\u00eft\u00e9 de leurs revenus, et le mal va se g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisant de plus en plus.\n\nLa r\u00e9solution de l'assembl\u00e9e aux autorit\u00e9s scolaires est donc : 1o d'augmenter de $400 le maximum de chacun des divers traitements ; 2o d'accorder \u00e0 chaque professeur une augmentation annuelle de $100 au lieu de $50, et de donner \u00e0 chacun un minimum de $300 pour chaque classe de traitement et \u00e0 chaque instituteur, avec effet r\u00e9troactif \u00e0 partir du 1er septembre 1917.\n\nOn voit qu'il ne s'agit pas ici de protestations exorbitantes, car m\u00eame un salaire additionnel de $200 ne repr\u00e9sente que $3.84 par semaine. Depuis trois ans, le co\u00fbt hebdomadaire de la vie s'est s\u00fbrement accru dans des proportions plus fortes que ce maigre surplus de $3.84.\n\nAujourd'hui, nous avons besoin d'ajouter que la demande des instituteurs de Montr\u00e9al est non seulement justifi\u00e9e mais n\u00e9cessaire, eu \u00e9gard au prix \u00e9lev\u00e9 des choses essentielles \u00e0 la vie de garde, et, aux services pr\u00e9cieux qu'ils rendent \u00e0 notre population.\n\nNous nous vantons d'appartenir \u00e0 un pays d\u00e9mocratique et de ressources immenses, o\u00f9 la richesse mat\u00e9rielle est une possibilit\u00e9 pour le plus pauvre et le plus m\u00e9ritant. La carte affirme que nous sommes tous \u00e9gaux. L'ouvrier, du r\u00f4le peu enviable de simple man\u0153uvre, peut, \u00e0 certains moments, \u00e0 l'aise de circonstances favorables, s'\u00e9lever \u00e0 celui de patron ou d'entrepreneur. Le jeune homme qui agit comme commis dans une maison de commerce ou de finance, a le droit d'esp\u00e9rer qu'il jouera, plus tard, le r\u00f4le de son patron. \u00c0 ces deux classes de personnes nous permettons d'ajouter une troisi\u00e8me, qui peut \u00eatre appel\u00e9e \u00e0 l'avenir une, au moins, \u00e0 l'aisance. Seules, les personnes qui se livrent \u00e0 l'enseignement semblent accepter d'avance une carri\u00e8re de sacrifice et de renoncement, une situation tout au plus capable de la plus rare et de la plus inflexible loyaut\u00e9.\n\nEn ces temps o\u00f9 le mot patriotisme est employ\u00e9 \u00e0 tout moment, m\u00eame pour faire triompher des personnages sujets \u00e0 caution et des causes douteuses, ne serait-il pas temps de lui donner sa signification r\u00e9elle, de maintenir le sentiment du vrai et fid\u00e8le service de notre patrie, les instituteurs d\u00e9montrant qu'ils cultivent l'intelligence et le c\u0153ur de la masse, moyennant des salaires insuffisants, sinon ridicules ?\n\nQu'on le remarque bien, nos classes enseignantes ne sont pas seulement des sacrifices, depuis que la guerre est commenc\u00e9e. Elles ont de tout temps travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 vil prix pour procurer au peuple le bien le plus pr\u00e9cieux qu'il puisse conserver : l'\u00e9ducation qui est la base sur laquelle repose tout le reste. Ce n'est pas seulement un service, mais une mission, une pr\u00e9occupation qui doit \u00eatre assur\u00e9e, non pas par le seul moyen dont une nation puisse se servir pour s'\u00e9lever au point de vue politique et social et pour atteindre une position de force.\n\nPour toutes ces raisons, la requ\u00eate doit il est loi que cette requ\u00eate ne manquera pas d'\u00eatre vue d'un bon \u0153il par la Commission scolaire de Montr\u00e9al. Cette derni\u00e8re se compose, en effet, de personnes en \u00e9tat de pr\u00eater l'illustration \u00e0 ce qu'elle veut, et surtout, bien au contraire, de membres choisis de la classe enseignante, qui ont une exp\u00e9rience de premi\u00e8re main en mati\u00e8re de salaire et de mode de vie.\nJ'ai, le 24 d\u00e9cembre courant,\nassist\u00e9 en compagnie du P\u00e8re\nrend R.

I was engaged by me under the leadership of their teacher, Mr. H. G. Martin. These children were instructed in Scripture, History, Geography, Arithmetic, Grammar; they had a fair knowledge of Hygiene & Health direction. Their drill in Calisthenics was interesting. I found they were available both in conversation & in reading. While English is the language of the school, Mr. Martin is particular that his scholars shall be proficient in the Indian tongue. He wants them to retain the best Indian traits & characteristics. Our Indians will certainly not become Frenchified; to the loss of much of the Indian that is interesting & instructive.\n\nThe school premises are well kept in every way, & I can truly say, Mr. Martin has been most faithful in school matters.\n\nR.C.

I wish to point out that Mr. Dauphinais is at liberty to take this course if he so desires and there should be no interference on your part.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nH. L. Masta, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nPierreville Protestant School,\nOdanak, Que.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nYour letter of the 25th instant, stating that Mr. Joseph Dauphinais wishes to send his children to the St. Joseph's Academy and that I have been interfering with him, caused me no little surprise, because I hadn't even heard that Mr. Dauphinais wanted to send his wife's children to the St. Joseph's Academy nor did I even suspect that that was his intention.\n\nI asked Mr. Dauphinais to explain his irreconcilable course, and he was himself more than surprised. He emphatically denied having written you, or having authorized anyone to write in his name. Mr. Dauphinais then stated what had happened. The priest told him: \"If we once could get rid of Mattox, that little Protestant school would shut down; all the Protestant children would attend the R.C. School and we would then have every reason to believe and hope that, in a few years, all the Indians here will be Roman Catholics. Now, I ask you not to send your children to the Convent.\" Mr. Dauphinais replied: \"Yes, if the Protestant School should close up, we would send our children to the Convent, but so long as it remains open and have for its teacher Mr. Mattox, we will make no change.\"\n\nAllow me to relate another circumstance: J.B. Watts & Company\nProtestant married a R.C. girl. Their children, three in number need to attend my school regularly. The poor woman has been so stigmatized by the priest and other co-religionists that she would now rather be separated from her husband than to allow her children go to a Protestant school.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nI am\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

Martin, the school teacher, and can testify from frequent investigation that Mr. Martin has the scholars welfare at heart, strives his best to advance them in their studies. He is ever punctual, has good discipline and correct deportment in the school, when I have visited there, which is often, because of my interest in the boys and girls who are members of my church.\n\nA special feature of the school, besides English and French, is the fact that these children are taught their Indian language, and can converse fluently in that tongue, an essential matter in the conservation of the best traits of tribal efficiency and progress.\n\nR.C. Brewer\nAnglican minister.\nOttawa, July 13, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has been informed that the children attending the Protestant School on the Pierreville Reserve are being taught in the upper portion of the school building, while the lower floor is occupied by the teacher, Mr. Masta, as his living quarters.\n\nThe Department cannot consent to this arrangement being continued when the school re-opens after the summer holidays. It will, therefore, be necessary to fit up the class-room on the lower floor and Mr. Masta can use the upper portion for living quarters if he so desires. Under the present arrangement, if a fire should occur, it would be very difficult to get the children out of the school and for that reason the Department cannot allow the reopening of the school unless the lower portion of the building is used as the class-room. The Department will expect you to see that this arrangement is carried out before the school re-opens.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. D. McLean\nAsst.

Scott Esq.\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nAt our last meeting I told you why I was having my class-room on the second floor of the school-house and that the change was approved by the Rev. R.C. Brewer, the incumbent of the church of England and the overseer of the school, and also by the parents of my pupils.\n\nI also told you that there is not the least danger of fire knowing that the wide stairway is on the outside of the building, which is as good as any fire escape.\n\nYou told me you saw no fault in the class-room being upstairs. I am, therefore, very much surprised at receiving from the Indian Agent, a copy of a letter to him, from the Dept. No. 25-14, dated July 13-1920 which reads in part as follows: \"The Department cannot allow the re-opening of the school unless the lower portion of the building is used as the classroom. The Department will expect you to see that this arrangement is carried out before the school re-opens. It may be that the letter written to Mr. Riguet was sent without consulting you. Would you be good enough to take the matter up again and perhaps re-instruct the Agent according to...\"\nAs your opinion,\n\nThanking you Mr. Scott,\n\nI am,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nHenry L. Macle\nAugust 18th, 1920.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter of the 12th instant arrived just as Mr. Scott was leaving for the West. I showed it to him and he stated that you were under a misapprehension as it was not his intention to countermand the instructions given in the official letter of July 13th last. However an officer of the Department will be visiting Pierreville in the near future and will make inquiry into the matter of conducting the school in the upper story of the building. In the meantime the Indian Agent will be requested to take no action.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary to the Deputy.\n\nMr. Henry L. Mesta,\n5 Casino Arcade,\nWildwood, N.J.\nAugust 18th, 1920.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to official letter of July 13th, pending an investigation by an officer of the Department who will visit Pierreville in the near future, it has been decided to allow the class-room in the Protestant school building to be reopened after the holidays in the upper storey of the building.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary to the Deputy.\n\nHenri Niquet, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPierreville, Que.\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nIn the early part of April last, I wrote to the Dept., asking that alterations and improvements be made to the school house, in order that the teacher may have his living quarters in it. I represented that such a change would allow me to rent my house and thus create another small source of revenue, of which I am badly in need. If it were not a necessity, I would never give up the comfort I enjoy in my own house.\n\nUp to the 1st May I had received no answer and there was no other alternative but to lose the chance of letting my house or to move into the school building. I consulted the Indian Agent and while he did not authorize me to move into it, he said he saw no reason why the Dept. would not approve it and I fully shared his opinion, since the improvement would be for the teacher whom he may be. I employed the Department's contractors Mr. Chas. Ed. Desrochers to remove the school furniture upstairs and to make partitions on the first floor for a living room, kitchen and a bed-room which was absolutely necessary.\n\nHe had that much done when the Indian Agent visited me and the Dept. had written to say: \"No funds for that purpose.\" I personally submitted the case to Mr. Scott last spring and left with him the contractors bill certified by the Agent, amounting to about $150. Mr. Scott promised me that it would receive a good consideration. This promise with the reasonable belief of my petition, I believe, is equal to an assurance that the bill will be acquitted by the Dept., however.\nI pray you to again call the attention of Mr. Scott to this matter.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\nHenry L. Macta\nOttawa, October 15, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant with reference to the payment of the accounts for the alterations which you had made to the building at the Protestant School on the Pierreville Reserve, in order that you might provide living quarters for yourself on the lower floor and by this arrangement you would be able to rent your own house and live in the school building.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as these alterations were carried out by you without the authority of the Department and were to meet your personal requirements, the Department cannot undertake to pay the cost of having the alterations done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. Henry L. Masta,\nTeacher,\nPierreville Protestant School,\nOdanak, Que.\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter No. 23-1-1, dated Oct. 15, 1920, has caused me a great disappointment. I was going to ask also why the city water be brought into the school house, but what is the use, my petitions presumably are always unheeded, since they are invariably met with \"No funds for that purpose.\"\n\nBut the Church of England people who are a no mean factor in the make up of the present government and its maintenance in power, will see that their school and lands get due consideration from the Dept. of Indian Affairs. Why it is a shameful sight! The steps and fence of the C.E. school are down on the ground - rotten and beyond repair, and they can not be renewed because there are no funds for that purpose.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\nYour obedient servant,\nHenry L. Macle\n\n[Stamp: Schools Branch]\nOttawa, October 28, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is informed that the steps at the Protestant School on the Pierreville Reserve are in a poor state of repair, also that the fence is on the ground and requires to be replaced.\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to take immediate action to have the repairs necessary made to the steps of the school building. You should have the work done at the lowest possible cost and when completed, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nWith reference to the fence I have to request that you will furnish a full report regarding the matter and also give the cost of erecting a new fence. The number of feet of fencing required should be stated and also what kind of material you would recommend should be used in erecting a new fence. The Department will expect an early reply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. S. Williams\nFor Asst.

It should be brought to the attention of the Department early next spring.\n\nWith reference to the account of Charles Desgoutteaux for work he performed in fitting up the school as a residence for the teacher I beg to say that this work was ordered by Mr. Masta. The Department gave no authority for having the work done and the contractor will have to look to Mr. Masta for payment of his account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nHenri Niquet, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPierreville, Que.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have visited our school teacher, Mr. Mesta, and sending his annual report to your Department. I will also add mine at Mr. Mesta's request.\n\nMr. Mesta has regularly visited the school during the past year, and I have examined the scholars and found them well taught in English, French, and Indian. Mr. Mesta does not intend his children shall forget their native tongue. In all my visits I have found the school under good rule and discipline, and the school itself clean and everything in perfect order. Since the school was moved, the health of the children seems improved by the improved air, and in case of fire there would be plenty of room inside of the building. The children are regular in attendance, and a renewal of the old ones are taking a moral course, which will bring advantage to them if they take a higher course in education.\n\nYour Department will see that our school is progressing, much to our Bishop's satisfaction, who takes a great interest in this school, which he considers his church school on the Reserve.\n\nI am glad to send these words of appreciation regarding the school, and the careful teaching of Mr. Mesta.\n\nWishing you, Sir, Department, the season's compliments.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nP.C. Brewster,\nChurch of England minister,\nAbenaki Reserve.\nOttawa, February 15, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nIt has been brought to the attention of the Department that you were recently arrested and convicted of being drunk and having liquor in your possession in the school building of the Pierreville Protestant School.\n\nThe Department views your conduct with strong disapproval and, as teacher, it is expected that you will set a good example to the Indian parents and children on the reserve. In view of your past service, your breach of duty on this occasion is being overlooked, but, should this occur again, the Department will have no recourse but to ask for your resignation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. Henry L. Masta,\nTeacher,\nPierreville Protestant School,\nOdanak, Que.\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\nI beg leave to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 23-1-1 dated Feb. 23, 1921 and containing a very charitable warning as to intemperance in drinking, for which I am very thankful to you.\n\nI confess that I have done wrong and that I am very sorry for it. I had decided even before I received your letter that I would never again use any kind of intoxicating liquor for any purpose.\n\nI pray you listen to a little bit of explanation how it is just to settle my guilt, but only to show you how all this came about. Sometimes before the end of last quarter, I began to feel tired and weak and often with pain in my stomach. I was advised to take wine before meals, which I did, but unfortunately, I sometimes took too much of it, on Saturdays Sundays and it did me no good.\n\nNow, I assure you that no liquor was ever found in the school building and that I was far from being drunk when arrested, but I pleaded guilty because if not, that friend Thomas Ladouche would have handcuffed and lead me to Angel Court with his baton in hand, for such is his manner habit. I chose rather to pay fine than to be thus humiliated. It is my more nor less than a three cent fine. They entertain the foolish idea that if I were out of the school, there would be none take my place and that all the Protestant children would go to the R.C. School.\n\nBelieve me\nYour obedient servant\nHenry L. Masta\nimprovements were not only for Mr. Masta, who was the teacher for the time being, but were such as would serve any subsequent teacher and make it easier for the Department to secure a teacher.\n\nIt is an undeniable fact that the Department has provided residences at considerable expense for the women Catholic Teachers of day schools at Odanak, Caughnawaga and Lorette.\n\nIn view of these facts, I submit that the Department should pay the small amount of the bill for these alterations. I feel certain that if the matter were brought up in the House, the Department would be amply justified in paying this.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC/L.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am acting for Mr. Henry L. Masta, teacher of the Protestant Indian School at Odanak, Quebec, on St. Francis Reserve. In April 1920, Mr. Masta wrote the Department pointing out that no provision had been made for a residence for the Protestant School Teacher at Odanak; that on account of the meagre salary he was receiving he could not afford to provide a house of his own and in that letter he furnished a detailed statement and estimate by Contractor showing how improvements might be made to the schoolhouse at a cost of less than $100, which would enable him or any other teacher to live on the first floor of the building and utilize the second floor for the school, and in this way enable a teacher to live upon the small salary which is being paid.\n\nIn reply to this letter the Department wrote stating there were no funds for this purpose. On October 12th, 1920, Mr. Masta again wrote your Department stating that the Indian Agent at Odanak endorsed his suggestion as it would, in the event of Mr. Masta resigning, make it easier to obtain a new teacher and the Department's Contractor, Mr. Charles E. Desrochers removed the school equipment to the second floor and made such alterations on the first floor, when the Indian Agent was notified by the Department that there were no funds for that purpose. Subsequently Mr. Masta submitted the case to the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, who promised consideration to Mr. Masta's request for the payment of the expenses of alterations, amounting to approximately $100, which bill was certified by the Indian Agent at Odanak.\n\nIn reply to Mr. Masta's second letter of October 12th, 1920, the Department wrote stating that as the improvements were not authorized and since they were for his own personal needs, the Department could not afford to pay the costs thereof. The Department were evidently under a misapprehension as the\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,-\n\nJ. Ogle Carse, Barrister, Ottawa, requests that the expenses incurred by Henry L. Masta, teacher of the Protestant School at Pierreville, in fitting up living quarters in the lower part of the school building and moving the classroom to the upper floor be paid.\n\nThe history of this case is, briefly, as follows. In April, 1920, Mr. Masta stated that there was no provision made for a teacher's residence and that he was unable, owing to the salary he received, to continue keeping up his own house. He requested that permission be granted him to fit up the lower floor of the school building as a residence and to conduct the school on the upper floor and to make the necessary alterations for the purpose and, if this arrangement were approved, he would rent his own house and take his quarters in the school building. He furnished an estimate from a contractor showing the cost of the alterations. In reply he was informed that the Department had no funds available for the purpose. He, however, secured a contractor and proceeded with the work and, as you will remember, consulted you with a view to payment of the account. The cost of the alterations amounted to $98.71. Payment was refused on the ground that he had the work done without authority.\n\nMr. Carse requests that this claim be reconsidered and that the account for the repairs be paid. Our Agent has certified the account and the contractor has not yet been paid for his work. It is pointed out in Mr. Carse's letter that, as we have provided a teachers' residence for the Roman Catholic schools at Pierreville and Caughnawaga, we should provide living quarters for the teacher of the Protestant School at Pierreville.\n\nWhile Mr. Masta undertook the work of having the alterations made without authority, yet, as he points out, if another teacher is secured at any time living quarters will be available as a result of the alterations made. I would, therefore, recommend favourable consideration of the payment of this account.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nApril 19th, 1921.\n\nDear Mr. Carss,\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant with reference to Mr. Henry L. Masta. In reply I beg to say that Mr. Masta undertook to rent his house and take up his residence in the school-house of his own accord. He further, without the permission of the Department, changed the class-room from the lower to the upper storey in order that he might himself occupy the former. This was all done to suit his own convenience and as a matter of fact, the Department has considered making him remove the class-room to the lower storey in the interests of the children.\n\nI regret, therefore, that favourable consideration cannot be given to the request that he be reimbursed for any expenditure incurred.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

Sadoquis, ex-constable, Pierreville, telegraphed the Department stating that H. L. Masta, teacher of the Church of England Indian day school on the reserve, has been indulging in the use of alcoholic liquor for some days.\n\nI have to request that you will enquire into this matter and furnish the Department with full information. You should state whether the school was closed by Mr. Masta during the regular teaching days, and, if so, the number of days he did not teach.\n\nYou should also point out to Mr. Masta, if the information furnished is correct, the seriousness of his conduct and the bad example he is setting the Indian parents and children on the reserve.\n\nAn early reply is expected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

If you had any charges to make, you should have referred the matter to the local Indian Agent who could then have informed the Department.\n\nThe contents of your telegram have been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Smith, teacher of the Protestant school who declares:\n\n\"It is true that my school was closed during the week ending the 11th of March. I was sick but not through drinking. I used liquor moderately, only to assuage the pain. I was unable to work during that week, without or with the use of medical means; and since the benefits derived from the use of strong liquor is questionable, I am ready, for the sake of removing all offense with my view, to forego allowance and cease the use of it under any pretense.\n\nI was surprised to hear that Mr. Smith had been drinking as I have never seen him under the influence of liquor.\n\nHoping this explanation will be satisfactory,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Office\nOTTAWA, March 21st, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to the complaint made against Mr. H.

You should point out to Mr. Masta, however, that it is expected he will set a good example in future to the parents and children on the reserve.\n\nIn view of his past service, his lapse of duty on the occasion referred to is being overlooked, but any further complaints in this respect will meet with the serious displeasure of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Masta, is failing in his duty, for the last 8 days Mr. Masta has been in a state of intoxication; he is seen nearly every day on the street in a state of drunkenness, consequently his class is neglected.\n\nThe Council considers it is their duty to report the fact to the Indian Agent with request that this report should be addressed to the Department of Indian Affairs immediately.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nLouis Gill, Chief.\n\nCharles Nolett, Councillor\nAmbroise Obomawin\nNap.

Holidays were in the period of 8 days.\n\nK.T.F.\nOttawa, June 2, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nIt has been brought to the Department's attention by the Indian Agent and the Chief and Councillors of the Band that you have again failed in your duty to the Department and to the Indian children in attendance at the Pierreville (Protestant) Indian Day School.\n\nThe seriousness of such conduct has been drawn to your attention on several occasions: once as late as March of this year, and I must confess, in the light of your communication to Mr. Agent Maurault, of a few weeks ago, that I am somewhat surprised and deeply indignant.\n\nI wish to inform you at this time that you no longer will receive my support with the Department of Indian Affairs, and another occurrence of intoxication on your part will mean your discharge with some despatch.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

L. Masta, Teacher of the Pierreville (Protestant) Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply, will you thank the Chief and Councillors for bringing this matter to our attention, and kindly take note of the attached copy of official communication to the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nEncl.\n\nBenj. Maurault, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPierreville, P. Q.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am sending herewith a copy of the annual school meeting held on May 22.\n\nAnother scholastic term has come, I am again attending our annual examinations. I am delighted to notice the great improvement in these children, especially the little ones. The ABC's all show how carefully they have been taught. I am pleased to see how disciplined the school is kept. The children show in their deportment the care and attention which has been given them.\n\nMr. H. L. Martin, teacher, is admirable in his instructions. Direction, I am very particular in having him, as I have noticed before. These children while studying in English and French, are also taught in their native tongue, so that they are kept alive to the advantages of such instruction.\n\nThere is often disappointment everywhere. I must regret that some of our young girls, even the children, are obliged to withdraw from school to learn to Braid or make moccasins.\nTo make money to live I think the Government should see the Indians women are properly supplied with these necessaries of life because too often times sensitive to ask for help, so we are in need. They believe the Indians of Canada have not received their due.\n\nI am also glad to add my appreciation as to the progress in our school.\n\nP.S. I am an Indian minister at this Reserve.\n\nR.C. Brewer\nMy dear Sir,\n\nYour favor of the 2nd inst was duly received with thanks. Our enemies have long since been waging a sure persecution against our church & school; the unwavering aim of the priest & council is to have both of these institutions shut down\u2014saying that then the Protestants at Odanak would all become Roman Catholics. I thank God that with His grace, their direct blow on me, as teacher, will only make me stronger.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nI am\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nH. L. Masta\nTeacher\n\nO.S.\n\nI don't see on what grounds the Indian Agent can put in an accusation against me. I would be very much pleased to get a copy of his letter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJUN 13 1922\nMEMO.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of June 23-1-1 (Copy) I am surprised to see that you refer to the agent as having brought to the Department's attention that he had been placed in his duty. I certainly could not make a report on a thing I ignored absolutely.\n\nAll I did was to send the Department the complaint laid by the council, and do not desire in any way to assume a part of their responsibility.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs - School Files - (GC 10), Volume 6022, File 23-1-1, part 2\nOttawa, October 17th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nEnclosed herewith you will find a letter written by Napoleon R. O'B., which it is impossible for us to decipher.\n\nWill you kindly interview the writer, and report to the Department about his complaint.\n\nKindly inform him also that all future correspondence should be sent through the Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActg. Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nBenj. Maurault, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPierreville, Que.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your's Oct 17th accompanying a letter from Capt. R. O. Bonsalini which nobody could decipher.\n\nI am Mrs. O. Bonsalini, the writer who tells me all she wants to know is if Mr. Smith teacher at the Protestant school has the right to lend money charging 20% interest. She tells me Smith is trying to buy sugar by advancing them money and taking mortgage on their property which they cannot redeem at times.\n\nAfter taking information at the agency here I learn that Smith has a permit to transact with the Indians.\n\nShe may be proceeds in the agency's trading is normal and legal. She lends money takes a mortgage on the property and sells them the property at so much a month until they have repaid him.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs - School Files (RG 10, Volume 6022, File 23-1-1, part 2)\nMemo.\n\nWith respect to Mr. Obonsewin's enquiry as set forth in agent Laurault's letter hereunder of the 30th ultimo as to whether Mr. Hasta has the right to loan money at 20% interest, I beg to refer hereto the Money-Lenders Act, Revised Statutes, 1906, Chap. 122 and particularly to Sections 6 and 11 thereof as follows:\n\n\"6. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Interest Act, no money-lender shall stipulate for, allow or exact in any negotiable instrument, contract or agreement, concerning a loan of money, the principal of which is under five hundred dollars, a rate of interest or discount greater than twelve per centum per annum; and the said rate of interest shall be reduced to the rate of five per centum per annum from the date of judgment in any suit, action or other proceeding for the recovery of the amount due.\"\n\n\"11. Every money-lender is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, or to a penalty not exceeding one thousand dollars, who lends money at a rate of interest greater than that authorized by this act.\"\n\nA. Williams\nOttawa, Nov. 10, 1922.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, informing the Department of the complaint of Mrs. O'Bomsawin concerning the business transactions of Mr. H. L. Masta, Teacher of the Pierreville Protestant School. I have noted that in the opinion of the local notary the teacher's methods are legal.\n\nIn reply, I think it would be advisable for you to inform Mr. Masta that complaints have reached the Department, and that you have been instructed to intimate to him that we expect the teachers of Indian schools to be above reproach in their business methods.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nBenj. Maurault, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPierreville, Que.\nAt the request of Mr. H. L. Marta and my own keen interest in the education of children I examined the St. Francis Indian School on above date. Having a Registered Teacher's Certificate needless to say I am fully qualified to present this report; and I respectfully submit the same to the Schools Department of Indian Affairs on the splendid work carried on, much to the credit of the teachers.\n\nI found the building in very good condition as to repairs, and the interior, the model of cleanliness with neat little desks very suitable for their occupants. The ground is fenced round beautifully.\n\nThe work here is carried on with difficulty: 1. Some children return late in the fall and leave before the end of the school year, thus losing much valuable periods of instruction both at the opening and closing of the school year. This loss of time is almost irreparable, and a decided handicap to the children, and multiplication of work for the teacher. 2. Illness has seriously retarded the progress of one child. I found six children present.\n\nThe discipline was excellent and I have no hesitation in reporting that better could not be had anywhere. The writing of the children was bold and good, both in style and penmanship. The composition was fair, but rather too elementary for the ages of two of the\nmost advanced and biggest, girls.\n\nI observed an air of timidity among them, although this should not be so, seeing I am always among them in my pastoral duty, and this timidity may account for not being quick in answering questions of grammar and general knowledge of what they read.\n\nAnother good considering the handicap enumerated above.\n\nTheir knowledge of the Scriptures was very good. This I gathered in teaching them in the Church School. History and Geography were fair, and commerce of Canada good.\n\nOn the whole the work is satisfactory seeing that the surroundings are such which do not tend to foster a vigorous educational growth.\n\nThe work of the school speaks very favourably for the tact and judgment exercised by the teacher in his work and duty of moulding and fashioning the youthful lives for future service.\n\nRespectfully submitted by,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary in charge,\nIndian Reserve.\nOttawa, July 4th, 1924.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report on your visit and inspection of the Pierreville Protestant School on the 2nd ultimo.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the department is very pleased to note that the general conditions and the progress being made are satisfactory. It is further noted that the building and grounds around the school are kept in a cleanly condition, and that the teacher is performing his duties satisfactorily.\n\nI have to thank you for your report on this school and the work being performed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. S. M. Aug. Leman,\nMissionary in Charge,\nIndian Reserve,\nThe Rectory, Odanak,\nQue.\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nSir\u2014\n\nThe French people of Pierreville have found out that they cannot get along very well in business without some knowledge of the English language and I am sometimes asked whether it would be all right if they sent two or three big boys at a time to the C.C. School here. Presently a prominent man in the Liberal Party, Mr. Eugene Simonneau is quite persistent in asking for his sons admission into this school.\n\nThe boy is 16 years of age and formerly a student at St. Bernard's College, Saint John. He may want to pay for the tuition of his son. I told him that I could not comply with his request without the consent of the government whose servant I am.\n\nPlease advise me what to do.\n\nYour obedient servant\nHenry L. Macle\n\n[Signature]\n\n23-1-1\nOttawa, January 25th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, regarding the request made to you by the French people of Pierreville to allow their children to attend the Protestant school on the Pierreville Reserve in order that they might obtain a knowledge of the English language.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is regretted that it will not be possible to comply with this request. This school is conducted for the benefit of the Indian children only, and it is necessary that the time of the teacher be devoted during the regular period the school is open to the classroom instruction of the Indian pupils.\n\nPlease inform the French people interested of the Department's regrets at being unable to comply with their request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Macleod\nOttawa, February 16, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, enclosing a communication from Mr. E. Simoneau, in which he asks permission to have his son attend the Pierreville C. of E. Indian Day School. In reply I have to inform you that the Department will allow the boy to attend your school, on condition that he conduct himself properly while on the reserve and do no hindrance to the studies of the Indian pupils. At the end of the academic year, he should pay to the Indian agent the sum of $1.00 for each month that he has attended. Mr. Maurault should then forward this to the Department, for deposit to Casual Revenue.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nHenry L. Martin, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nPierreville Indian Day School,\nOdanak, Que.\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring the past two years I have made several trips to the Reservation of the St. Francis Algonkian Indians near Riverdale, D.C., in the course of an ethnological investigation of this tribe, the results of which I hope to publish in the near future. The hospitality and cooperation rendered me by these Indians has been such that I wish to put the matter on record and to express the hope that the Department will encourage the few remnants of old native life which remain to be considered. This specially applies to the native language of the group, in which I have been specially interested. In this connection I should like to mention particularly the immense help which an acquaintance with Mr. Henry L. Martin has afforded me in my studies. He has been both generous in his time and cooperative in every way and possesses a scholarly grasp of the language which is unequalled by no one in the valley today. I also visited his school and his methods impressed me as being of a very superior order.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nA. Irving Hallowell\n\nFeb. 19, 1925.\nOTTAWA, February 21st, 1925.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant and note what you state in regard to Mr. Henry L.

McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. Irving Hallowell, Esq.,\nUniversity of Pennsylvania,\nPHILADELPHIA, Pa.,\nU. S. A.\nSir,\n\nIn view of the fact that most of the pupils that go to the Protestant School in the reserve are away in the United States and will not return before the latter part of September I think it would be to their advantage if school reopened only as or about the 16th of September and close later in June or in the first days of July.\n\nI suggest this to the Chiefs so I hardly think there will be any children to send school in the first days of Sept.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. Tell him to inform me.\nOttawa, August 25, 1925.\n\nSIR,\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, in which you recommend that the Pierreville Protestant Indian Day School be re-opened not earlier than after Labour Day.\n\nApproval is granted to open this school on the 8th of September and you should so inform Mr. Maste, the teacher.\n\nI note that there will be no children available for school during the first week in September.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

This amount should be paid to you and you should forward it to the Department for deposit to Casual Revenue. Permission is only granted on the understanding that the parents will pay the grant charged, namely one dollar ($1.00) per month and when they cease doing so the permission for him to further continue his studies will be discontinued.\n\nPlease state as requested in our letter of 21st instant whether any payment has yet been received from Mr. E.

The faith of the pupils would be entirely respected. A few hundred, I recommended that fusion, but myself, I do not see why about a thousand dollars is spent every year for that school when, very often, there is only one scholar present and, sometimes, none. A family by the name of Hagg, is not Amahk, but Amahk.\n\nI find it very duty to bring this to your knowledge.\nSt-Aim\u00e9, 11 juin, 1928.\n\nAu Tr\u00e8s Honorable W. L.

I may say that the reports on your inspection of this school receive careful attention. Consideration is being given to the question of the continuing in operation of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nP. J. Normand, Esq.,\nInspector of Schools,\nSt. Aime, Richelieu Co.,\nQue.\n9 juin, 1928.\n\nIl y a un bon travail accom-\npli en lecture, grammaire, histoire, geo-\ngraphie et arithmetique. Le pyramide\nrequiert bonne attention. Trois \u00e9l\u00e8ves\nassistaient \u00e0 l'examen.\n\nF.J. Normand, J.E.\nOdanak, Yamaska, P.Q.\nJune 14, 1928.\n\nOn the above date I examined the scholars at the Odanak Protestant Elementary School at the request of Mr. H. L. Masta the schoolmaster.\n\nI found that in the major subjects, reading writing and arithmetic the pupils displayed a marked ability and showed the results of careful teaching on the part of Mr. Masta.\n\nThe principal events in Canadian History and their significance to Canada have been carefully explained in such a manner that the young students could fully appreciate their importance and credit is due to their instructor.\n\nIn geography the class showed a fair knowledge of the boundaries of North America; the sources of the principal rivers and the position of the important lakes. The pupils answered readily to questions relating to the principal towns and cities of Quebec and gave reasons for their importance.\n\nAttention has been given to scripture and the newer subject of hygiene has been touched upon, and with reference to the latter the neatness of the scholars and the cleanliness of the school show the practical application of the subject.\n\nI was particularly pleased at the ability displayed in oral and written French and English, and as a university student can see readily that these important subjects have been carefully taught.\n\nFinally, I consider that the school at Odanak compares very favourably with the standard adopted in the city elementary schools and the pupils show equal intelligence.\n\nDonald Andrews, L.L.C.M., P.C.T.\n\nStudent in Charge,\nOdanak Anglican Church,\nYamaska, P.Q.\nOdanak, June 26, 1893\n\nMr. Secretary,\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to send you herewith the reports on my school, by Mr. Normand, the school inspector, and Mr. Andrews, student in charge of the Anglican church here, respectively.\n\nMy school closed on the 22nd inst., as all others in Yamaska, including the other one in the Reserve. From my past experience, I can truly say that it is practically impossible to keep one school open while the other one in the same locality is closed.\n\nI am consciously well satisfied with my work when looking back. I see so many of my former pupils doing wonderfully well. They have good responsible positions and command money. They are either the wives or the husbands, as the case may be, of respectable American or French Canadian citizens. They are \"des Sauvages\" no more.\n\nAnother sign of the prosperity of this school is the constant fight waged against it by the anti-Anglican. It is only a few days since Mr. Normand, the school inspector, has enlisted to carry on this hostility. Mr. Desbengue, the cur\u00e9, was overheard saying to Mr. Normand...\nNormand: We have tried, in vain, again and again for a long time to cause the closing up of this little Protestant school which is a sore to this community, but I do believe that it would be closed and remain closed if you only helped us. There are, here, only three or four pupils at the present time and they are not members of the Band. Mr. Normand then promised to do all that is possible in their favour.\n\nIt is true that quite a few of my pupils who are members of the Band are away during this quarter but will be back next fall. The mother of those present is an Indian woman, born though up here, has never lived here. Her father and mother were both members of the Band. She owns some property in the Reserve. There are at least ten full-blooded French pupils and about as many half-breeds, not members of the Band, attending the R.C. School in the Reserve. The parents of the Indian pupils complain that their children do not get as much attention as the French pupils, but that is none of my business and would have nothing to do with it.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nHenry L. Martin\nOttawa, Dec. Oct 5, 1928\n\nMr. Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Malta Durand, a resident of Pierreville wants to know if he could send his son - 12 years old to the C.E.

Malta\nOttawa, October 12, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, requesting permission for a son of Mr. Malka Durand to attend the Pierreville Church of England Indian Day School.\n\nPlease state whether this man is an Indian or a white man, also the religious denomination to which he belongs. If he is a white man, is there no other school to which he could send his son? Please also state the amount he would be prepared to pay for his boy's tuition at your school.

He sends his boy to the Oiceterville Parish School but is not satisfied with the teaching of English there.\n\nMr. Malika Durand would be prepared to pay to the Indian Agent one dollar a month for his boy's tuition at my school, which is the same as Mr. Lemineau paid for his son's tuition at my school, two years ago or thereafter.\n\nPersonally, I am not interested in any of these arrangements and cannot accept nor reject any application.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

Masta\n\nat one time Presiding Chief of the Abenaki Indians at St. Francis, Canada; now teacher in the Dartmouth school on the Reservation.\n\nOf the two hundred or more Indians who attended Moore's Charity School and Dartmouth College, not the least notable was the group which came from Canada. The Canadian regions had been traveled over by Frenchmen's explorers and teachers as early as 1700, and an account of the travels may be found in the Narragansetts. Several Indian boys were brought to Dartmouth by two teachers just previous to the Revolution, among them a member of the famous Gill family which had its origins from a Deerfield captive. Mr. Masta, who has taken up the Dartmouth succession as teacher on the Abenaki reservation (Dartmouth Indians having founded the school about the Nineteenth Century) writes for the Alumni Magazine a short account of these Indians who came to Dartmouth by canoe or horseback in the early days. The first Masta came to Dartmouth about 1809.\n\nTHE DARTMOUTH MEN\n\nIn reference to the men of this place (St. Francis, Canada) who were educated at Dartmouth, I beg to mention: Francis Annance, Daniel Katnash (Cartnanch), George Annance, Phillip Gill, Joseph A. Masta, John B. Masta, Peter Paul Osunkhirhine, alias Masta, and Simon Annance, but I would lay stress especially upon the last two, because, while those did wonderfully well in their several spheres, they did these goodly benefit of their education to their own people in their native land. Peter was a leader, and that also is the meaning of Osunkhirhine. He was the first Indian school teacher and minister of the Gospel here. He was about ninety years of age when he died and he had spent the first and best part of his life in teaching and managing his own people. He was interested in the education of all the young people of his tribe (Abenaki) but especially in that of his brothers Joseph and John Masta. He headed them to Dartmouth at Hanover, N.H., not so much by drawing along or going before as by instruction or counsel.\n\nAs the old saying goes: \"An Indian is always ready when about to go on a journey\u2014because he has nothing to pack up\"\u2014what he wears on his back is all that he carries. As for the Mastas they each had only a white blanket coat and toque with hawthorn prongs instead of buttons. They covered the whole distance on foot and they were amazed at their good reception, even as if they were rich. Everybody was good and kind to them. The students supplied them with clothing and shoes. The poor Indians in return did everything in their power to show their thankfulness while the invisible proof thereof was in their hearts never to be forgotten.\n\nWhile at school they were employed as boot-blacks, waiters, messengers, and jacks-of-all-trades. Simon Annance was the teacher of the protestant Indian school here for many years. I was one of his pupils when I was a little boy.\n\nTHE FAMILY HISTORY\n\nI was born in 1853. At 12 years of age I was sent to a Church of England Missionary school at Sabrevois, P.Q., where my studies were all in French. The fact that I did not understand much, either in French or English, was a great drawback to my success. However I studied there five winters and was then sent then for the spring stint to continue my studies at the Theological College attached to the University of Lenoxville, P.Q., or to leave the institution in order that\nWhen the Abenaki Came to Dartmouth\n\nBy Henry L.

He was much interested in the education of all the young people of his tribe (Abenaki) but especially in that of his brothers Joseph and John Masta. He headed them to Dartmouth at Hanover, N.

Their brilliant costumes, new to snow-sports in New England, caught the eye on every hill and distant prospect. The scarlet of McGill with its coat of arms in white aroused the envy of feminine eyes. At three o'clock a thousand spectators had gathered on the wet snow on the Golf Links to watch this first intercollegiate meet. The realization that here were contestants from another nation rising up under the American and Canadian flags brought a spontaneous roar of welcome from the crowd.\n\nThe cross-country snowshoers were soon away on a three-mile course out through the Vale in deep snow that made the race a rather contested. Trick racing-shoes were barred, and all runners wore a 13-inch identical shoe. Three Dartmouth men came back first, W. D. Kipp '17, C. B. Thompson '17, and M. G. Sherburne '17. The cross-country ski race over a short course was won by C. H. Paulsen, New Hampshire State '15, who romped in minutes ahead of Birks of McGill and Bowler of Dartmouth. He followed this success an exhibition of somersaults from a jump on the line which thrilled the crowd and threw the movie men into a frenzy of attempts to follow through with the camera without forgetting to crank. Dick Bowler and Johnny Carleton of Hanover High School started the event with the bronchial leaps into space from the new jumps. The size of these younger lads compared to the length of their jumps seemed impossible to be true to those not accustomed to the prowess of sons of the faculty. A comical stunt-race down slides, through barrels and amongst potatoes from the foot of the take-off gave B. N. Davis, W. D. Kipp '17, and A. N. Andrews '16 prizes. This was called an Obstacle Race and entertained the crowd when the Dartmouth-McGill relayers were out of the picture. This relay race, begun too late to be finished the same day, was the second dual meet of a series begun at Shawbridge the year before. N. Williams of McGill came in first, followed by O. Mack '16, D. O. C. Rut. C. P. Hubert '15 and O. J. Frost '16 were able to overhaul W. L. Rutherford and G. Thomson of McGill for a substantial lead. The darkness ended the race at that point and it was postponed until Saturday.\n\nIn an Alumni Gymnasium transformed into a shadowy evergreen wood the Outing Club dance became the Carnival Ball. Formerly for the moment, members of the club had worked their magic to produce a fairy glade. Hidden by interlacing fir trees over the deck walls and chest weights; gone were the steel girders, lost in the forest night. The mad revelers wore their complicated intricacies of one step, hesitation, and maxixe around the giant symbolic pine which from the center of the scene dominated the glade. More than 100 couples were presented to the patronesses, who were the wives of the officers and faculty of the College. The officers of the club were the ushers. In a beautiful setting, carnival had danced in celebration of its new proportions.\n\nA day of Hanover weather ushered in the second part of the competition and made fast going for all races. During the morning Bache-Wigg starting with a lead of 4.43 minutes over McLeod of McGill won the dual event while ski-relay. The dashes on skis were won by Dartmouth's five men of skill. In the hundreds N. Williamson, McGill, C. D. Horton '15 and J. P. Bowler '15 placed. In the furlong Opie Horton was first followed by the Hubberts, C. P. '15 and W. C. '18. In the snowshoeing L. D. Felton '18, W. D. Kipp '17, and M. G. Sherburne '17 in the first race, with Kipp, Sherburne and D. H. Reddick '17 in the second, shut out all of the Vermont runners. The crowd, now doubled in numbers, adjourned to the three new ski jumps for what was considered the cream of the sport. The dual meet between Dartmouth and McGill was the bone of contention, for no other team could even threaten that pair save the lone star of New Hampshire. In this contest McLeod won distance jump, 214.5, although Bache-Wigg jumped 65 feet, King 60 feet, McLeod, McGill, 58 feet in individual jumps. In the style of jumping Dartmouth won 556.3-492, with individual high ratings of 161.3 for W. T. King '17, 149.3 for G. Birks, McGill, and Bache-Wigg '15 145. In the distance open, Fisher of McGill jumped 60 feet, Bache-Wigg 59.8 and another of New Hampshire, in the style open, C. E. Frost '18, W. T. King '17 and J. Bache-Wigg '15 took all places for Dartmouth. Reddie of McGill received a special prize from Rev. John E. Johnson for the longest jump of 87 feet which was off the slope and beyond the landing hill. At the conclusion of the contest, Paulsen made a perfect somersault from the ski jump in the Vale, and landed successfully. This was the thrilling event of the day for the onlookers and served as the spur for many subsequent strivings on the part of many ski jumpers, little and big. Dartmouth had won the dual meet with McGill, and the intercollegiate meet. McGill was second and New Hampshire with her one man team was third.\n\nIn the evening the league basketball game with Yale was played in the Alumni Gymnasium to be followed by the Musical Clubs concert in Webster Hall. Ben W. Grills '15, president of the Outing Club, announced during intermission that Reverend J. E. Johnson '66 had presented the club with one thousand dollars as an expression of his desire to see the success of the carnival and of his desire that the activities of the club continue. This gift was the culmination of a year of generosity during which he had given the ski jump, toboggan chute, kiosk, funds for the pond work, and prizes for carnival.\n\nThus in five steps the Winter Carnival of the Dartmouth Outing Club had grown from a very small intramural contest to an occasion which was the final climax of the year, and which included an intercollegiate meet involving New England and Canada. It had drawn into its train all of the winter activities of the College and had become the pattern for many other carnivals in both the collegiate and civic world.\nsome other young man might be trained in my stead for the ministry. I decided to leave, but was then offered to stay until spring provided I would teach two hours a day, to which I consented. In the fall of the same year I was appointed teacher of French at the Pierreville English Academy. At the opening of the following year I took charge of the St. Francis Protestant Indian School and kept it ten years. In January of 1909 I was reappointed teacher of the same school and I am still at the desk. I have two children living, Mary Adelaide, and Alice. The former is in business for herself and the latter is a bookkeeper for the Department of Indian Affairs, Montreal's branch, Ottawa, Canada. She has held that position for the last fifteen years.\n\nMy mother's mother was Ursule Gill, and my father's mother Catherine Vassal. The Gills and Vassals intermarried. Samuel Gill and Miss James, two captives aged 14 and 10 years respectively, were brought here in 1711 from New England (according to reference to Mitchell's New General Atlas, County Map of Mass., Conn. and Rhode Island, 1864). The two captives were adopted by two women of the tribe as their own children and were treated with great kindness and affection. They soon picked up the Indian language, customs, manners. When they became of age to get married, the council decreed that the two couples should be joined together in matrimony in order to preserve the pure blood of their race and accordingly they were married. They never, after or before their marriage, manifested a desire to return to their parents. They both died here at St. Francis, he in 1738, and she twenty years previously.\n\nThere are over a thousand descendants from this family.\n\nMr. Vassal who married an Indian woman of this tribe was a colonel of the Carignan regiment, and my grandmother Catherine Vassal must have been his granddaughter. Stanislaus Vassal, Catherine's own brother, married Felicit\u00e9 Gill, the sister of my grandmother, Ursule Gill.\n\nHISTORY OF THE ABENAKI\n\nOdanak is the name of the Abenaki Indian village in St. Francis Reservation, near Pierreville, Yamaska Co., Province of Quebec, Canada. Odana means a village or city. Odanak means to or from the village or city. This place was formerly known as the mission of St. Francis de Sales. Abenaki from Woban-a-ki means Eastern land; woban is east or dawn; a is at or to, and ki is land; wobanakik is the people whose land is toward the east in reference to that of other tribes. The St. Francis Indians were also called Algonquins because they came from the Oyster River. Als or ela means oyster; also or ela means of oyster; guntekw means river. Aisiguntekw means Oyster River, which is very likely Ellis River, Maine.\n\nBy the treaty of Utrecht the King of France ceded to England all the territories of the Abenakis tribe of Indians, his faithful allies. The governor de Vaudrill when asked if this was not true replied that the possessions of Abenakis were not mentioned in the cession of land. The Abenakis nevertheless were deprived of their lands and had to choose either extermination or expulsion. They of course chose the latter. They left hesitatingly as they departed from their native land was a scene never forgotten, and to crown their misfortune as soon as they reached Canada, they were oppressed by the Algonquins who said:\n\n\"You are strangers. We do not want you here, and we will make a short story of you if you persist in occupying our lands.\"\n\nHowever they were allowed to stay a few days on trial and fortunately the two nations became friends in the meantime.\n\nThe first settlement of the Abenakis in Canada was at St. Joseph de Sillery near Quebec, the second at Chaudiere, and third and last at St. Francis.\n\nMr. Gill married Ursule Osunkhirhine, a woman to whom were born two boys, George and Frank, and one girl Catherine. Catherine became the wife of Osunkhirhine to whom were born Peter, Louis and Mary. The husband died and his widow married Toussaint Masta, a Frenchman, whose children were Joseph, John, Adeline, Ignace, Peter Osunkhirhine, Joseph and John Masta, Noel and Simon Annance, and a few others were educated at Dartmouth College, N. H. Peter Osunkhirhine became an ordained minister of the Congregational church and was the father of the protestant faith here.

He tells the story of his life and then goes on to make a complaint against his treatment by the missionary board. This paper is in two parts, and will be divided between two numbers before the actual journal is carried on again. In point of time the writing of the narrative follows directly after the trip to England, but the details he writes of go back some forty years previous.\n\nTHE DARTMOUTH CRADLE\n\nThe Old Moore School at Lebanon, Conn., has been renovated in recent years but much of the original building remains. Here Wheelock lived, and here Occum went to school.\n\nThe Reasons for the Autobiography\n\nHaving seen and heard several representations in England and Scotland by some gentlemen in America concerning me, and finding many gross mistakes in their account, I thought it my duty to give a short, plain and honest account of myself that those who may hereafter see it may know the truth concerning me, that it is against my mind to give a history of myself and publish it whilst I am still alive, yet to do justice to myself and to those who may desire to know something concerning me, and for the honor of religion, I will venture to give a short narrative of my life.\n\nS. Occum\n\nFROM MY BIRTH TILL I RECEIVED THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION\n\nI was born a heathen and brought up in heathenism till I was between 16 and 17 years of age, at a place called Mohegan in New London Connecticut in New England. My parents lived a wandering life, as did all the Indians at Mohegan. They chiefly depended upon hunting, fishing and fowling for their living, and had no connection with the English excepting to trade with them, in their small trifles, and they strictly maintained and followed their heathenish ways, customs, and religions, so there was some preaching among them; once a fortnight a minister from New London used to come up, and the Indians to attend; not that they regarded the Christian religion but they had blankets...\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM THOMAS SADOQUIS, CONSTABLE, ODANAK, QUE., dated June 4, 1929.\n\nI wish to inform you that the school teacher, Mr. H. L. Masta, was drunk during three days on the 29 - 30 - 31st of May, and I informed the Agent, Mr. Maurault, of this man's conduct. Mr. Maurault told me he would see Mr. Masta himself. I did not want to arrest him on account of his old age - he is 76 years old. He has caused scandal on the reserve by giving bad example to younger Indians who have just returned from the bush, where they were employed as guides.\nI have to inform you again that H. L. Masta continues to conduct himself in a scandalous manner on the reserve. He has been drunk for several days. On the 14th of this month he was summoned before the Agent, Mr. Maurault, in the public hall at 4 o'clock, p.m., for drunkenness. I delivered the warrant at his house. He was then drunk with his friend, Daniel Emmet, who was also drunk. He appeared the same day at 4 o'clock. He could hardly answer to Mr. Maurault's questions. The hall was full of people, Canadians from Pierreville, and Indians. Adolphe Allard, lawyer, was also there.\nOttawa, June 8, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nThe constable on the Pierreville Reserve informs the Department that Mr. H. L. Nasta, teacher of the Pierreville C. of E.

That witness could not prove as witnesses came to say that at nine A.M. on the 16th June Smith was sober although he must have had some liquor during the day, as when he came before me at four o'clock in the afternoon of the 16th June he had all the appearances of a man who had been indulging in something much stronger than water.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs - School Files\nIndian Affairs, School Files (AG 10), Volume 6022, File 23-1-1, part 2)\nPHYSICIAN'S CERTIFICATE OF INABILITY TO PERFORM DUTIES\n\nI, the undersigned, a duly qualified medical practitioner, hereby certify that I have personally examined the civil service employee named below and find him physically incapacitated for the performance of the duties of his position for the period and reasons set forth:\n\nPERSONAL DATA:\nFull name of employee: Henry L.

This school is not followed or at least during certain parts of the year, only but by a few pupils two or three. Would it not be wiser to consider if the moment has not come to close that school at least until there are a sufficient number of pupils to justify its maintenance. The annual expenditure is not justified if we consider the services rendered. It is not reasonable to spend $1200 to $1500 for the elementary education of two or three or four children, especially when there is at proximity a school ready to receive these children and give them at least as good an education.\n\nThis is not a question of religion, but one of good administration. I do not want to ask you to close that school, I simply wish to draw your attention on the way it is kept and I wish you would kindly ask for a full report on it necessarily from the point of view of attendance and I believe you will come to the conclusion that the department dispense with such expenditure.\n\nBelieve me, dear Mr. Scott,\n\nYours Truly,\n[Signature]\n\nM.

(signature)\nSeptember 5, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Boucher:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to the Pierreville Protestant Indian Day School. I may say that the Department has seriously considered the closing of this school, on account of the poor attendance, and it has been decided to discontinue the activity as at the end of the calendar year. Mr. H. L. Masta, the teacher, has given very faithful service to the Department and I wish to deal as generously as possible with him.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Indian Day School. The attendance has been far from satisfactory, as there are very few wards of the Department eligible for admission. It has been decided to close the school at the end of the calendar year, and I am writing now so that you can make your plans and to thank you for your many years of service.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Indian Day School is so small, that the Department has decided to close the school as on December 31st next. Mr. H. L. Nasta, the teacher, has been notified. Please make an inventory of the desks and other equipment, which are of value, and forward it to the Department, so that a decision can be made as to their further use. You might also report on what use, if any, can be made of the school building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nB.

School of which I am the teacher, at a time when things are O.K., and at a time too, when I expected a greater clemency than ever before, because of my misfortune. I spent most of my summer holidays in the Civic Hospital, having undergone two grave operations within three weeks, which cost me nearly $500. I am now all right to teach school, but not able to do any manual labour. I think my old age and my thirty-one years of faithful service should also be taken into consideration. There is no provision made for the support of old teachers, but being the only one throughout Canada who have served 31 years as school teacher, the Government might well grant me a pension equal to a half of my salary, for the rest of my days or at least allow me to continue my work, as long as I am efficiently able.\n\nThere are now 9 pupils on the roll, 7 of whom attend school regularly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHenry L. Masta\nNovember 14, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Masta:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, enquiring concerning the possibilities of a pension. I regret that there is no provision for the superannuation of teachers in Indian schools. Our teachers do not contribute to the Superannuation Fund. I may say, however, that the Department can give a small gratuity to teachers who have given lengthy service - two months' salary being allowed upon retirement. In cases like yours, it is a matter of much regret that more cannot be done.\n\nI doubt the advisability of reconsidering the decision to close the school at the end of the calendar year. The number who are strictly our wards who would benefit is so small, that the Department can hardly justify the expenditure.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nMrs. Henry L.

He promised to marry her as soon as he could obtain a divorce from his wife. She left him about two years ago with all their children. I have no doubt about the truth of this declaration.

For instance: Henry Waters my former pupil, through my own efforts and resources was graduated from the High School of Hanover N.H. He is now has been for a number of years employed by some newspaper concern in Boston, Mass., with a salary of $35 per week.

Six pupils were present at the time of my visit. There is an air of deterioration about the whole school. The building is dingy and neglected looking. There is no life in the classroom work and so far as I was able to judge, little or no progress being made. Mr. Masta is a very fine type of gentleman and met me very courteously but he impressed me as having lost his enthusiasm in teaching. If it is considered advisable to re-open this school after the summer holidays with a new teacher in charge, it will be necessary to spend about $400.00 in painting the building inside and out, cleaning up the grounds and providing some new equipment for the classroom. It is doubtful if any expenditure would be justified under present conditions.\n\nThos. McGookin,\nInspector.\nThe Honorable,\nThe Minister in charge of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy dear sir:\n\nLast year I had some correspondence with the Indian Department concerning the school at St. Francis Indian Village, Pierreville. Your decision then was to leave the school open for the present. I am taking it for granted that the school will be kept open next year for the session beginning in the Autumn. There have been nine pupils, I am informed, attending this school, and the only alternative is for them - should this school be closed - to attend the Roman Catholic schools. I understand that this will be contrary to the Act, and I am, therefore, taking it for granted that the school will be continued. There are other young children coming on.\n\nI am informed that efforts are being made to have this school closed, so that all the children on the reserve will be forced to attend the schools of the Roman Church. I trust that this information is incorrect, but in any case I feel sure that your Department will do that which is just to our Non-Roman Indians.\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohn Montreal\nOttawa, May 13, 1922.\n\nMr. [signature]\n\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\n[signature]\nMay 19, 1930.\n\nDear Bishop Farthing:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 12th instant, with reference to the Pierreville C. E. Indian Day School. I beg to assure you that in this special case, as generally, the policy of the Department is to protect the educational interests of the religious minority on the reserve. This is provided by statute. Very careful consideration will be given to the needs at Pierreville.\n\nNo doubt, Your Lordship is aware that, at the present time there are 9 on the school roll. Three are underage and, of the other 6, three, the Hiff children, are strictly not our wards. Would it not be advisable to place the physically fit Protestant children of school age on this reserve in one or other of our Church of England institutions? Your Lordship might consider this suggestion, which would be of greater advantage to the children in question than day school training.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRight Rev. J.C. Farthing, M.A., D.D., D.C.L.,\nBishop of Montreal,\nBishopscourt, 1444 Union Ave.,\nMontreal, P. Q.\nMy dear Mr. Scott:\n\nMany thanks for your sympathetic letter regarding the Indian children on the Reserve at St. Francis Village.\n\nOf course the younger children will soon be growing into school age, and there is no Boarding School near our Reserve. As far as I can make out we have no Anglican Boarding School nearer than the Mohawk Reserve, or the Sault, and that would be a very expensive thing to transfer the children there and back to their own Reserve for the holidays. It would be much cheaper for the Department to keep the Day School on the Reserve. We certainly have not enough children to warrant a Boarding School near by.\n\nWhat suggestion would you make regarding the children going to Boarding School? The parents might object to their going far away. Somebody would have to go with them, and altogether it seems to me a much more expensive proposition for the Department than to maintain a Day School on the Reserve even if it be only for a few children.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you regarding this.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nAugust 30, 1930.\n\nDear Bishop Farthing:\n\nI wish to refer to Your Lordship's letter of May 23rd, concerning the education of the Protestant Indian children of the Pierreville reserve. The Department is now making arrangements to have the next children placed in a residential school, and this will leave but two or at the most three Benedict children of school age.

A long rope hung from the bell to the ground. \"If any one does you a wrong, ring this bell,\" said the king, \"then I shall know that some one needs help.\"\n\nMany people rang the bell\u2014rich people and poor people, big people and little people. But at length\nthe rope was worn off till a man could hardly reach it. Some person, passing by, saw this and mended it with a long grape-vine.\n\nNot far from the town lived a faithful old horse. He had worked for his master many years, and now he was too old to work any more. This unkind man would not feed him, but turned him out on the street to starve.\n\nThe poor horse wandered about until he saw the grape-vine. He was hungry and tried to eat it. This made the bell ring, and the king came to see who needed help. When he saw the starving horse, he sent for his master.\n\n\"This poor horse has served you well many years,\" said the king. \"He is old now and cannot work. You must take him back to his stable, and feed and care for him for the rest of his life.\"\n\nThen was the man ashamed, but he led home the horse and did as the king had ordered.\n\nSNOW\n\nThis is the way the snow comes down,\nSoftly, softly falling;\nSo God giveth the snow like wool,\nFair and white and beautiful.\nThis is the way the snow comes down,\nSoftly, softly falling.\n\nWHEN'ER a snow-flake leaves the sky,\nIt turns and turns to say: \"Good-bye,\nGood-bye, dear cloud, so cool and gray,\"\nThen lightly travels on its way.\nTHE BRIGHT SIDE\n\nNanny has a hopeful way,\u2014\nBright and sunny Nanny!\nWhen I cracked the cup to-day,\nShe said, in her hopeful way,\n\"It's only cracked; don't fret, I pray.\"\nSunny, cheery Nanny!\n\nNanny has a hopeful way,\nSo good, and sweet, and canny;\nWhen I broke a cup to-day,\nShe said, in her hopeful way,\n\"Well, 'twas cracked, I'm glad to say.\"\nKindly, merry Nanny!\n\nNanny has a hopeful way,\u2014\nQuite right, little Nanny;\nCups will crack and break alway,\nFretting doesn't mend nor pay;\nDo the best you can, I say,\nBusy, loving Nanny!\n\nAlgernon Tassin\nOdanak, Dec.

Now this is a condition which I regret very much, as my main interest in living here was the advantages in education I received for my children, and the convenience of having the school close to home, where my children could be at home while attending school, as they must also have the advantage of their mother's care and training, as well as their training at school. I had four children attending school, and were doing remarkably well under Mr. H. L. Martin teaching, and it is regrettable that they have been compelled to lose even this much time. I also have two more smaller children, who will be\nattending school in a few years from now.\n\nBeing an Indian myself, also my wife and members of the Abenaki Band of St. Francis, I believe I am entirely within my rights in asking that this school be reopened for the education of my children.\n\nTrusting that you will give this letter due consideration, and that this school will be reopened in the near future,\n\nrespectfully yours,\n\nAlex Benedict\n\nO.

The average attendance was then 15. We had no school-house and no equipment. I received $100.00 per annum from the New Colonial Church and School Society of London, Eng., which enabled me to procure a room and fuel for the school. Things went on so, for three or four years. I then made application to the Government for a school-teacher's salary and received a grant of $100.00 per annum, but in a year or two the charity of the school-society was withdrawn and my salary was reduced to only $100.00 per annum as before; in the next two years, however, it was increased by $51.00 each year, my salary therefore was $200.00 per annum in 1883, when I quit teaching. It was what some people called a starvation salary and it really was so, but I did not mind it because I was interested in the education of my own people, irrespective of their creed. I received my education free from the Sabrevois.\nschool\nLakewois Mission Society and I freely passed it to others.\nSincerely the work I did at that period\u201418 years\u2014of my\nlife, which should be considered, for it was indeed a\nsacrifice of time and money too, worth more than a con-\ntribution to a superannuation fund.\nIn the meantime the above mentioned Lakewois mission\nschool society, complying with my incessant petition had\nbuilt us a nice little school house, which has since been\nrepaired and maintained in good condition by the Depart-\nment of Indian Affairs. The seats and desks were made of planed\nboards. A gentleman by the name of Colt gave $150.00 towards\nbuying books etc.\nIn 1904 I was re-appointed to take charge of the same school\nand kept it open till the 30th Sept last\u201421 years & 9 months\nand have given satisfaction to all the parents of my pupils,\nto the whole congregation of the Church of England here;\nto his Lordship the Right Rev. Bishop of Montreal and to\nall his ministers and missionaries who look after this\nMission.\nI have prepared several of my pupils for their entrance\nin a High School, have given preliminary assistance to\nsome of them to get through, who are now doing extra well.\nI have been teaching school here thirty-one years and\nnine\nnine months and besides taught French one year at the Berthierville English Academy.\n\nI am a regular school teacher having obtained a model school diploma for both French and English from the School Board at Three Rivers and have taught both of these languages besides our own Indian language so that my pupils will never lose their own tongue.\n\nI have spent more time teaching in Indian schools than any other in Canada.\n\nI shall be 74 years of age on the 9th of next March.\n\nI desired to be superannuated with a certain proportion of my last salary viz $550.00 per annum.\n\nDr. D.C. Scott, Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs, in one of his letters to me said: \"I regret that there is no provision for the superannuation of teachers in Indian schools. In cases like yours it is a matter of much regret that more cannot be done than two months' salary being allowed upon retirement.\n\nBut can it be impossible to create a fund for that purpose? It would not be a bad precedent if it induced young men to give lengthy services in teaching school, for it must be admitted that teachers are under-compensated for their services and it is hard to get and keep them at\nat any rate the Government would not be out of much money if they complied with my request for at 78 years of age we cannot expect to live much longer.\n\nThanking in advance my one who will be good and kind enough to present and plead my case and I am his\n\nSincere and grateful servant\n\nHenry L.

At that time, there were not a sufficient number of wards of the government to warrant continuing it. Arrangements were made to place a number of the children in Indian residential schools. I am not aware, at the present time, of the number of Protestant Indian children of school age on the reserve, who would be available if the school was re-opened. The local Indian Agent is being requested to report, giving the names and ages of the Protestant Indian children.\n\nIt might be difficult to arrange to re-establish this school, even if there are a sufficient number of Protestant Indian children available to warrant its opening. Order in Council No. 44/1930, dated June 14, 1930, does not permit an increase in establishment, and it would therefore be necessary to obtain the consent of the Treasury Board before a teacher could be appointed. When a reply is received from the local Agent concerning the Protestant children available, a further memorandum on the matter will be sent you. No request has been received from the Agent or the Indians to have the Protestant school re-opened.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, December 26, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to request that you will forward, as soon as possible, a list, giving the names of the Protestant Indian families on the Pierreville reserve, with the names and ages of their children of school age.

Of this number, three are enrolled at the Mohawk Institute, Brantford, Ont., leaving only two of school age, viz.: Florence, 11 years; and Francis, 6 years. The three youngest children of this family are under school age.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Fred Watson have four children, varying in ages from 1 to 6 years. Only one of these children, the eldest, is of school age.\n\nMary Lagrave has a child one year old.\n\nBesides the above, there is a family of half-breeds, viz.: Mr. and Mrs. Walter Hoff. There are 9 children in this family, from 8 months to 17 years of age. Four of these children are in residence at the Chapleau Indian Residential School, leaving at home George - 17 years; Gladys - 6; Priscilla - 4; Margene - 3; Ellen - 2 months. It will be noted that George is\nover school age and there is only one other child, Gladys, at home of school age.\n\nWhile the Department is under no obligation to provide educational facilities for half-breeds, this family have resided on the reserve for a number of years, living the Indian mode of life and the Department has undertaken the education of the children. For this reason, four of the children of this family were placed in the Chapleau Indian Residential School.\n\nFrom the above information, it will be seen that there remain only four Protestant children of school age on the reserve - hardly a sufficient number to incur the expense of conducting a school.\n\nAs pointed out in my memorandum above referred to, the re-establishment of the school would be difficult, as it would be necessary to obtain the consent of the Treasury Board to increase establishment before the services of a teacher could be engaged. As vacancies occur, arrangements could be made to have the few Protestant children, as they arrive at school age, placed in residential schools.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMay 19, 1936.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nWith reference to your recent inquiry regarding the proposed re-opening of the St. Francis Anglican Indian Day School, on the Pierreville reserve, No. 10, in the Surovell district of Temiskaming, I wish to refer you to my memorandum of January 22nd, last, for any further information than is contained in my memorandum of that date and the situation is unlikely to have changed in the interval.\n\nIf it is your desire, however, I shall be pleased to write the Indian Agent for any further information he may have.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMay 19, 1934\n\nDR.

She states that she is not in a position to properly care for her children and wishes them to remain at the Chapleau School. Unless you consider that these children should be returned home, they will be allowed to remain at Chapleau.\n\nPlease let me know at once if you consider the Benedict children should be returned from the Mohawk Institute.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I am very sorry to know this and I am making every effort to have my children remain in Chapleau by writing to you. It is for their welfare.\n\nUndoubtedly Bishop Forthing was misinformed about my willingness to have my children attend the school here should it reopen. Bishop Forthing comes here about once in three years and he most likely does not know our hardships and the real living of our children, for if he did he like myself would prefer that they remain in residential schools. Our schools they\nWe not only taught their lessons but also the correct way of living.\n\nWe are only two families who have children of school age. We are our relief and it is impossible to give our children the real necessities.\n\nI do not wish to say anything about home conditions but an investigation would show the advantages of residential schools. My children were to remain in the place five years; they have been there for three years and they are happy. Although I would like them with me I realize that I could not give them the love they now have and I trust you will not overlook my interest in them and my desire to have them remain where they are.\n\nThanking you for anything you might do regarding my request I am\n\nyours respectfully,\n\n(Mrs.) Carleton\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMinister's Office\n\nAugust 2, 1934\n\nMr. WILLIAMS\nActing D.S.G.\n\nAttached is a letter addressed to the Minister by Mrs. Carrie Hoff, of Odanak, Que., in which she requests that her children be allowed to remain in the Chapleau St. John School.\n\nThis is referred to you for departmental attention.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nEnc. (Lr.

I would consider it a crime to send these children here; and would recommend that the other children of this same family be sent to your boarding school as soon as they are old enough to go, so their mother can vote to consider it fit to bring up these children further.\n\nAs to the Benedict children; if the Indian Day School is reopened in the Reserve, I believe the children should be returned from the Mohawk Institute, as their father Alexander Benedict wants them to attend school here.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nAugust 9, 1934.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nSee memo of July 12th on this file; also authority of the Minister, to take the action considered advisable with reference to the children from the Pierreville reserve who are at present in residential school.\n\nIn view of the Agent's letter of August 6th, the following action has been taken:\n\n1.

Sisters on the reserve was discussed thoroughly with Mr. Benedict, father of the only protestant children who could follow the school. Mr. Benedict objected to his children going to the catholic school because he intimated, other children were calling names to his offsprings, vile beast names, and that the latter were submitted to bad treatment in the past. This we found to be greatly exaggerated and as we explained that the cost would be very large for just four or five children he agreed to send his children back to the Sisters' School. The Sisters on their part promised to give special attention to these children and would see that they are not ill-treated by other children at school. It appeared that the objections of the parents were caused by bad advises from strangers and outside influence used against the Sisters' school. Mrs. Hoff, the mother of the only other protestant children on the reserve, declared in the presence of the Agent that if the protestant school was reopened she would not send her children there for any consideration.\n\n(sgd) Henri Fabien\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nWith reference to the reopening of the St. Francis Anglican Indian Day School on the Pictonville Reserve No. 10, in the Federal District of Yamaska, I should appreciate if you would let me have the name of the teacher whom you wish to take charge of this school.\n\nRegarding the return of the Hoff and Benedict children to the Reserve, I would refer you to the Acting Deputy Superintendent General's memorandum of July 12th, last. In reply to this memorandum, you wrote as follows:\n\n\"School may be reopened, and investigation made by Dept. into advisability of returning Benedict and Hoff children to the Reserve to attend school.\"\n\nThe Indian Agent was written, and he reported as follows:\n\n\"Regarding the Hoff children, I beg to say that I certainly would not advise the Department to send these children back here. I would consider it a crime to send these children here; and would recommend that the other children of this same family be sent to some boarding school as soon as they are old enough to go, as their mother cannot be considered fit to bring up these children properly. As to the Benedict children, I believe the children should be returned from the Mohawk Institute, as their father, Alexander Benedict, wants them to attend school here.\"\n\nThe Department considered that your answer to our memorandum gave us permission to decide on the advisability of returning the children to the Reserve, and, in view of the Agent's report regarding home conditions, the Benedict children were returned to the Reserve, where they are at present, but no action was taken towards returning the Hoff children from the Chapleau Residential School.

It is considered in the interest of the Indians that the school should be re-opened.\n\nThe salary payable is $65.00 a month and funds are available to meet the expenditure in the appropriation for Indian Education.

The Department proposes to pay the School Teacher at the Pierreville Agency $65.00 per teaching month, and at the Onion Lake Agency $90.00 per teaching month.\n\nThe Department further reports that at the Pierreville Agency the school will replace one situated some distance from the location of the proposed new school closed due to lack of attendance and that the new school will be equipped by utilizing the furnishings of the closed school.

The amount mentioned is, therefore, considered adequate and compares favourably with salaries allowed at other Indian schools in the Province of Quebec.\n\nIt was proposed to pay $90 a teaching month at the Big Head Indian Day School:\n(a) This salary compares with the salaries allowed at other Indian schools in the Province of Saskatchewan and (b) the school is situated in an out-of-the-way place and, consequently, living expenses are higher.\n\nIt is recommended that these two positions be favourably considered in order that the educational requirements of the respective agencies may be met and that it be so reported to Treasury Board, the positions being additional to the present temporary exempt establishment.\n\nChief, Organization Branch.\n\nWBC/DH\n\n(See Examiner's Report on next page)\nCIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION\n\nOttawa, Dec. 5, 1934.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am directed to forward for your information the attached copy of an approved memorandum of the Civil Service Commission in connection with the creation of two positions of Teacher, Indian School, exempt.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEnclosure.

Agent\nPierreville\n\nMonseigneur\n\nPar le pr\u00e9sent je tiens \u00e0 vous informer qu'une jeune fille catholique attirante fr\u00e9quente l'\u00e9cole protestante de la R\u00e9serve pour l'instant qu'on y donne l\u00e0 une meilleure cours acad\u00e9mique qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9cole catholique dirig\u00e9e par des religieuses enseignantes. L'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 de bonne, elle est clairement \u00e9tablie qu'un enfant catholique ne peut pas fr\u00e9quenter une \u00e9cole protestante, de m\u00eame qu'un enfant protestant ne peut pas fr\u00e9quenter une \u00e9cole catholique. Cette loi est sage et nous devons \u00e0 ce qu'elle soit observ\u00e9e. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 un d\u00e9partement Indien d'avoir l'\u00e9cole protestante.\n\nC'est bien, mais en somme rien n'est fait, mais il faut que cette \u00e9cole ne serve que pour les enfants protestants seulement comme l'\u00e9cole catholique de la R\u00e9serve ne sert que pour les catholiques. Le m\u00e9lange de croiser les religions dans les \u00e9coles est une id\u00e9e de mauvaise nature et doit \u00eatre abandonn\u00e9. On entend que l'enseignement protestant donne un meilleur cours de la langue anglaise que nos religieux.\nenseignants; cette institution est jeune et ne suffit pas \u00e0 la charge de l'entretien. Nous avons ici dans la r\u00e9serve une acad\u00e9mie dirig\u00e9e par des religieuses enseignantes et d'autres religieux qui ont une bonne r\u00e9putation dans l'enseignement de diverses mati\u00e8res, de fran\u00e7ais et d'anglais, et cela avec tant de succ\u00e8s qu'\u00e0 tous les ans, plusieurs familles canadiennes de Pierreville sont afflu\u00e9es pour y placer leurs enfants. Un autre \u00e9tablissement de cette nature, c'est que nos religieuses sont dans une position difficile; le monde refuse la m\u00e9thode concr\u00e8te employ\u00e9e \u00e0 un enfant lorsque chez les parents du m\u00eame \u00e2ge, tout enfant de l'\u00e9ducation catholique peut \u00eatre plac\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole publique. C'est bien de choisir une m\u00e9thode plus longtemps.\n\nJe vous prie de me faire part de votre avis sur le sujet de la question qui demande de donner des instructions relatives \u00e0 l'article 18 de l'\u00e9tat des Sauvages, et cela par le bon ordre qui doit exister dans la Tribu.\n\nVoici tout d\u00e9taill\u00e9,\n\nCharles Notette, Chef.\nSir,\n\nPlease find attached a letter received from the Chief bringing my attention to the fact that there is a paternity suit pending at the B.C.S. school of this Reserve.\n\nShe belongs to this Reserve and up to a few months was frequenting St. Joseph's Academy, and she has no other reason to give for delaying relief except that she pretends that the English course given at the B.C.S. school is better and I am certain she is not kind of a judge in the matter.\n\nThe batteries are starting and I believe it would be better to act immediately and separate them as both parties are now grown.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPoveshell\nOttawa, February 14, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, in which you state that a child who is recognized as a Roman Catholic is attending the St. Frances C. E. Indian Day School.\n\nIn opening the St. Frances C. E. Indian Day School, the Department wished it understood that only Protestant children should attend the school. In this connection, I would refer you to official letter of September 20th, last, in which you were instructed to give Mr. Emmett the names of the Protestant children of school age on the reserve and to assist him as much as possible in seeing that these children are enrolled at this school. Children of Roman Catholic parents should attend the Roman Catholic School and you should instruct Mr. Emmett not to accept them at the Church of England School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Adam\n\nD\u00e9partement des Indiens\nOttawa\n\nMonsieur,\n\nJ'ai beaucoup de peine que le D\u00e9partement ait refus\u00e9 \u00e0 l'Agent des Sauvages oublieant mon enfant de sortir de l'\u00e9cole anglaise. Je crois que tout les Indiens avaient le droit d'aller aux \u00e9coles publiques pay\u00e9es par le D\u00e9partement.\n\nMa fille a dix-sept ans et veut se faire instruire seul.\nbon de valeur pour un ordre si faible incapable de donner \u00e0 son enfant l'instruction qu'elle lui demande.\n\nMonsieur Andrew Emmel,\nma\u00eetre de langue anglaise promet de donner \u00e0 ma fille un dipl\u00f4me sup\u00e9rieur anglais et fran\u00e7ais en deux ans.\n\nPourquoi lui faire perdre cette ann\u00e9e?\n\nJe ne veux pas m\u00e9priser l'\u00e9cole catholique, mais on enseigne seulement qu'une demi-heure d'anglais par jour ne m'est pas suffisant pour un dipl\u00f4me.\n\nMais s'il vous pla\u00eet,\n\npardonnez-moi si je vous demande l'autorisation de lever...\n\u00e0 cette \u00e9cole. Encore une fois, il nous pla\u00eet ministre des Indiens vers \u00e0 mon aide c'est l\u00e0 qu'on \u00e9prouve la justice. Et bien inform\u00e9 l'Agent ainsi que Monsieur l'Indien \u00c9tienne ma\u00eetre de l'\u00e9cole. Mais s'il y a difficult\u00e9s ou dommage pour le ma\u00eetre je ne peux pas \u00eatre me soumet aux lois du minist\u00e8re.\n\nUne autre question s'appr\u00eate par une Catholique comme moi que si une fille continue \u00e0 aller \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole on pourra mettre ma petite pension de 8.00 par semaine mais j'ignore cette question comme telle.\n\nSi nous pla\u00eet pardonnant un pauvre indien guisiano\nDemande une r\u00e9ponse personnelle que j'attendrai pour retirer ma fille de l'\u00e9cole.\n\nSi vous vouliez \u00e9pargner tout trouble imm\u00e9diatement\n\nBien \u00e0 vous\n\nEdouard Malaguer\nTranslation\n\nOttawa, Feb. 25, 1935\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nI am very sorry that the Department notified the Agent to exclude my daughter from the English school. I thought that all the Indians had the right to go to the public school paid by the Department.\n\nMy daughter is nineteen years of age and wishes to be educated; it is very sad that an Indian who is so poor cannot give his daughter the education she wants.\n\nMr. Andrew Emmet, teacher of the English school promises to give my daughter a superior diploma in French and English in two years. Why should you make her lose her future?\n\nI do not wish to run down the catholic school but they only teach half an hour of English a day and that is not sufficient for a diploma.\n\nPardon me please if I lack for the authorization to send her at that school. Once more Minister of the Indians come to my help, that would be an act of justice.\n\nConsequently inform the Agent and Mr. Andrew Emmet, school teacher; but if there are any difficulties or trouble ensuing for the matter, I do not want it and I would rather submit to the ruling of the Minister.\n\nAnother question is that I hear that if my daughter continues to go to the school my small pension of $3.60 per week may be withdrawn from me, but I do not know if this is the truth. Kindly pardon a poor\nSir,\n\nI am writing to you in response to your letter dated [date], which I have received today.\n\nI am writing to express my concern regarding the recent incident involving my daughter, Jane. As you may be aware, Jane has been attending this school for several months now, and she has always been well-behaved and attentive in class.\n\nHowever, recently, there have been reports of her misbehaving during class hours. This behavior is unacceptable, and I believe it is important to address this issue promptly.\n\nI request that you take immediate action to ensure that Jane's behavior improves. If necessary, I would like to discuss this matter further with you at your convenience.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\nOttawa, February 28th, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from E. M. Sadaquis, with reference to his daughter attending the St. Frances C. E. Indian Day School.\n\nIt is understood that this is the girl referred to in your letter of the 12th instant. If so, I would refer you to official letter of the 14th instant, which you should show to Sadaquis and inform him that the Department received his letter and has requested you to advise him regarding our wishes in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nB. Maurault, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPierreville, Que.\nMemo\n\nMr. McKenzie\n\nThe letter of Rev. de Gauzague to Senator P.E. Bowles is to protest against the admittance of catholic children to the protestant school of Odanak. He accuses the teacher of being over zealous and to entice catholic children to go to his school. The missionary claims that this is causing grave disorder on the reserve and is directly opposed to the doctrine and regulations of the catholic church in the province of Quebec.\n\nThe other document (typewritten) is a circular letter from the bishop of Nicolet, His Grace J. Hervieux Brunault, which was read in the church of Odanak forbidding the catholics from attending a protestant school, unless special permission is given by the bishop, under threat of refusal of the holy sacraments of the Church.\n\nHenri Fabien\nOttawa, March 14, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nIn opening the St. Frances C. E. Indian Day School, the Department wishes it understood that only Protestant children should attend this school. If there are any Roman Catholic children in attendance at the present time, you should send them home and advise their parents that you cannot accept them at the St. Frances C. E. School.\n\nIf application is made to you in future for the admission of Roman Catholic children, you should inform the parents of the instructions given to you in this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Meach\nCommanding \"C\" Division\nOttawa, November 1st, 1938.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSome time ago Miss Moodie recommended that Mrs. Emmett might undertake teaching the girls in your school the rudiments of domestic science, sewing, etc. She was informed that until we had knowledge of your own activities with the boys of your school no consideration could be given to providing other assistance. The matter was again brought to my attention a month ago and on October 7th we wrote you asking you to advise us what work is being done in your school along the lines of manual training. You were also asked to notify us what additional supplies you required.\n\nAlthough almost a month has elapsed no reply has been received from you. Please report immediately whether or not you have undertaken any manual training or basketry instruction for the pupils in your school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. Emmett, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nSt. Frances C.E. Indian Day School,\nOdanak, Que.\nOttawa, January 18, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMay I refer to departmental letters dated October 7, 1938, and November 1, 1938, to neither of which this Branch has received a reply.\n\nMr. W. H. Brady, in a report submitted to the Department immediately following the inspection of your school states:\n\n\"on the report form I have indicated the subjects for which no authorized text books or teacher's manuals have been supplied. There are some text books which have been discontinued for at least two years. The teacher, Mr. Emmett, stated that he had supplied the Agent with a list of text books needed but had not received any.\"\n\nI may state by way of comment the records here indicate that all text books requested for use at the Odanak C. E. School have been supplied promptly by this Branch. There is nothing on file to indicate that you have been refused text books or school supplies at any time.\n\nA number of reports have reached me during the last year with respect to your work at the Odanak School. These reports indicated that your work was in no sense satisfactory. I was particularly anxious, however, not to be harsh or unfair to you in any sense; consequently I had Inspector Brady inspect the school and submit to this Branch a special report on your work. I note the\n\nInspector's -\n\nA. Emmett, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nSt. Francis C.E. Indian Day School,\nOdanak, Quebec.\nInspector's report indicates that discipline, school management, preparation of lessons, community service and pupils' progress are particularly faulty. It is my duty to warn you therefore that it is not the intention of this Branch to keep in the service incompetent teachers, and it is certainly not our intention to employ teachers who refuse to reply to departmental correspondence. Unless I have an immediate reply to this letter and an explanation as to why you refuse to reply to the letters already mentioned, I shall have no alternative but to ask the Treasury Branch to suspend your monthly payments.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, January 18, 1935\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your report on the inspection of the St. Francis Church of England Indian Day School, Odanak, Quebec.\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of the letter sent forward to The Honourable Cyrille Delage. I should like to direct your attention particularly to the last paragraph of that communication.\n\nI must express regret that I did not succeed in communicating with you prior to your visit to Odanak. A number of reports had reached me to the effect that the work of the teacher in charge of the school there was in many respects unsatisfactory. I wrote to the teacher on October 7, 1934, intimating to him that this Branch would be glad to supply him with tools, text books, etc., suitable for the promotion of handicraft work and vocational instruction at his school. Mr. Emmett did not reply to this letter. I wrote to him again on November 1, 1935, and suggested that if he were willing the Branch would be prepared to employ his wife with the object of giving the girls at the school an elementary course in domestic science. Mr. Emmett again failed to reply to this letter, and recently I heard that he was not interested in departmental letters and that it was not his intention to reply to either of the communications.\n\nThe records here indicate that Mr. Emmett's requests for school supplies, text books, etc., have always been met promptly by this Branch. There is not a vestige of evidence on file to suggest that the teacher at any time requested -\n\nW. H. Brady, Esq.,\nInspector of Schools,\n4222 Old Orchard Ave.,\nMontreal, Que.\nrequested text books or school supplies that were refused.\n\nIt would be impossible for a teacher to behave in the sense that Mr. Emmett has behaved in a public school and still retain his position. In the Western Provinces when a teacher refuses to answer departmental correspondence the government grant to that school is suspended. I was very anxious however not to be unfair to this particular teacher - hence my request for a thorough inspection of his work at the school.\n\nMay I embrace this opportunity to thank you for your prompt action in undertaking, at our request, the inspection of this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, July 6, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI regret that you were not at home when I visited the Pierreville Agency on the 23rd ultimo. At that time I called at the St. Francis C.E. School and spent some time with the teacher.\n\nFrom the information that he gave me, I feel that he is fully qualified to handle a school of this size, but it is quite apparent that he is not taking as great an interest in the work as he should. However, it has been decided to continue his services during the academic year 1939-40, on the understanding that he makes a real effort to improve his work. He is being written to that effect, and the Department will expect you to give him every possible co-operation.\n\nRegarding the repairs to the building, the teacher mentioned a new floor. Personally, I cannot see any reason why we should expend money in replacing the floor. It appears to be in good condition, but apparently had not been washed for some time. Please make immediate enquiries and advise me what it would cost to redecorate the interior of the classroom.\n\nThe teacher also mentioned that there is a window back of the blackboard, which has not been properly boarded up, and as a result he states the building is very cold in the winter. You might let me know the approximate cost of having this window boarded up and a new window placed on one side of the building.\n\nThe teacher complains about the roof, but it was pouring rain the day I visited the school and no water was coming through, so I do not feel that we would be justified in making any expenditure in this connection. The painting of the exterior of the building will have to stand until later, as no funds are available.\n\nBenj. Maurault, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPierreville, P.Q.\nI will expect to hear from you at an early date regarding the repairs which I suggest be carried out during the present holiday period.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, July 7, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Emmett:\n\nIndian Agent Maurault is being instructed to obtain prices for decorating the interior of the classroom, also boarding up the window behind the blackboard and putting a new window on one side of the school.\n\nI did not see any great necessity for replacing the floor. It appears to be in fairly good condition but apparently had not been washed for some time.\n\nFrom the information you gave me, I feel that you are well qualified to handle the school. I felt, however, that you had apparently lost heart and were not devoting as much energy as could be expected.\n\nThe Department is anxious that the children attending your school receive every reasonable advantage along educational lines, and during the academic year 1939-40 we will expect you to put forth a great deal better effort than apparently you have done recently.\n\nWhile the classroom is sufficiently large for the number of pupils in attendance, I must say that it did not have a very attractive appearance. Redecorating this room should help, and in addition the Department will forward to you a picture of the King and Queen, as well as a number of other pictures, which you can have the boys frame as part of their vocational training activity and hang these pictures in the classrooms.\n\nI will look forward to visiting your school.\n\nA. Emmett, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nSt. Francis C.E. Indian Day School,\nOdanak, Que.\nduring the academic year 1939-40. At such time I trust there will be evidenced a distinct improvement. Otherwise the Department will be obliged to dispense with your services at the end of June, 1940.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 28, 1940.\n\nMemorandum for file:\n\nAttached are copies of letters dated July 6 and 7, 1939, addressed to Indian Agent Maurault and Mr. Emmett, teacher of the St. Francis C.E. School respectively.\n\nThe original letters are on 23-1-5 and on that file will also be found a copy of letter dated June 27 signed by the Minister and addressed to Rt. Rev. A. Carlisle, D.D., Bishop of Montreal, 1461 University Street, Montreal, Que.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nOctober 1, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: St. Francis C.M. School\nNo. 337-\n\nThis school was open for the month of September, 1940, and will be closed for the month of January, 1941. Consequently during the current academic year the teacher should receive salary at the end of the following months: September, October, November, December, February, March, April, May and June.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOEY\n\nI visited the St. Francis C.E. School yesterday and found only two pupils present although the teacher stated that the attendance had been very regular during the past month.\n\nThe teacher has decided to give up duties and has submitted his resignation.\n\nMr. Emmett's services have been very unsatisfactory during the period he was in charge of the school and he should not be re-employed.\n\nThere are only nine children who might attend this school if it were re-opened next year; namely, Samuel Watso aged 12 years, Fred Watso aged 10 years, Walter Watso aged 8 years, Dorothy Watso aged 13 years, Edward Sloui aged 8 years, Gladys Hoff aged 13 years, Priscilla Hoff aged 11 years, Marjorie Hoff aged 10 years and Eunice Hoff aged 7 years.\n\nI believe that it would be inadvisable to re-open this school for the academic year 1941-42 and consequently I recommend that no action be taken toward securing another teacher.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOdanak, Que.,\nJune 21st, 1941.\n\nDear Miss Moodie:\n\nI have not had a reply to my letter regards to the school. I am anxious to know what can be done, something has to be done as this cannot go on. It is not fair that Mr. Emmett should teach again as the children don't learn, perhaps some children are dumb again I do not think a child would take six years to learn how to read and write there are more than one thing he should not teach again, he is neglectful in many ways the children are cold in the winter and he rings his bell all hours to please himself and does not put in his hours in the last two weeks the school has been any hour he has them about one hour. We have little enough learning that we cannot have our children waste time and it is about time it is look into this matter in this letter everyone can tell you the rest. Now I would be grateful to you if you can tell me what can be done for this cannot go on longer and I know others are not satisfied as well. It was a mistake when this school open I always said it and will always say it however it is not fair to the children.\n\nI do hope you will be able to do something about it. I write you as I do not wish to take this up with our Agent he is sick.\n\nI hope you will be able to write me on this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nsgd.

Carrie Hoff.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Carrie Hoff complaining about Mr. Emmett, teacher of the St. Francis C.E. School. By the time this letter reached the Department we had received Mr. Emmett's resignation which has been accepted, as you were advised in official letter of the 24th instant. You might so advise Carrie Hoff and at the same time you should let her know that at the present time the Department does not contemplate re-opening the school for the academic year 1941-42.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Financial assistance to Diocese of Montreal for missionary work.\n2. Appointment of school teacher to replace Mr. Emmett, resigned.\n\nThe attached copy of a letter addressed to the Minister by the Rt.Rev. Arthur Carlisle, D.D., Bishop of Montreal, Sept. 29, has reference to the matters above, and explains itself.\n\nWhen due consideration has been given to the request, will you please let the Minister have a draft letter in reply.\n\nW.J.F. Pratt\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nEnclosure.\n(You may retain).\n\nDr. McGill -\n\nFor draft reply as requested.\nRt.Rev. Arthur Carlisle, D.D.\nBishop of Montreal\n\nOffice:\n1444 Union Avenue\nMontreal\n\n29th September 1941.\n\nThe Hon. T.A. Crerar,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy dear Mr. Crerar:\n\nFor many years the Diocese of Montreal has been specially interested in a little group of non-Roman Catholic Indians at Odanak, Que. We have been ministering to them in their small church Sunday by Sunday. This has been done at considerable expense but we have been glad to do it.\n\nI am writing to ask if it would be possible for the Department to give us even a little financial assistance for the carrying on of this work. With the many other demands made upon the resources of our people it is not easy for the church to secure funds for such missionary work. A grant of even $300.00 a year would be of tremendous assistance to us and would enable us without difficulty to carry on our ministrations to these people.\n\nThere is another thing which causes us some concern and that is that I have learned of the resignations of Mr. Emmett, the school teacher of that little Protestant group and so far I believe no successor to him has been appointed. Would it be possible to have this matter looked into and some provision made for the proper instruction of that small group of Indian Protestant children?\n\nI assure you that I will appreciate greatly anything that you can do in this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(signed) ARTHUR MONTREAL\nOttawa, October 4, 1941.\n\nMy dear Bishop Carlisle:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of September 20, in which you seek information with respect to the operation of the Indian day school at Pierreville, Que., and assistance that might be secured from the Department for the promotion of missionary work amongst the Indians on the Pierre-ville reserve.\n\nI regret to state that the Government has never at any time contributed to missionary effort amongst the Indians of Canada, nor is it possible to make such contributions from the appropriations voted by Parliament from year to year for the Indian service.\n\nThe records here indicate that the Indian day school at Pierreville had at the close of the last academic year an enrolment of 10 pupils and an average attendance of 8. We have not at this date succeeded in securing the services of a fully qualified teacher to take charge of this school; in fact there are at this date five Indian day schools for which we have failed to secure teachers. Should you be in a position to nominate a fully qualified teacher to take charge of this school, such action on your part would be very much appreciated by the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch. Mr. Emmett, who resigned from the position of teacher at this school a few months ago and whose work in many respects was far from satisfactory, was paid salary at the rate of $585.00 a year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRight Rev. Arthur Carlisle, D.D.,\nBishop of Montreal,\n1444 Union Avenue,\nMontreal, Que.\nOttawa, January 14, 1943.\n\nDr. H.W. McGill,\n\nRE: Pierreville Indian Agency.\n\nThe school was closed for the month of January, in order to minimize fuel cost, the school year having started in September 1942 instead of October 1st.\n\nJude Thibault,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, June 26, 1944.\n\nMr. B. Maurault, Indian Agent, Pierreville, Que.\n\nI am anxious to receive a report from you, indicating the number of white children in attendance at the Pierreville Indian Day School.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to state that the care and education of white children is not the responsibility of the Dominion Government. In view of this fact we decided about two years ago to discontinue the practice of allowing white children to attend Indian day schools at the Caughnawaga Reserve. If white children are at present enrolled at the Pierreville School, you should submit a list of their names for our consideration.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nRobert Sioui, member of Huron Band of Lorette and married to an abenaki woman, wishes to rent the protestant school-house for a home. This Sioui lives in Odanak since 6 or 7 years.\n\nHe says he come to an agreement with Rev. Legget of Sorel for the price of $6.00 per month, provided he does the necessary transformations at his own expenses. These reparations are a couple inside divisions and remove the stairs that is outside and bring it inside.\n\nHas Rev. Legget authority to dispose of this school-house that way? Or does this school belongs to the Department?\n\nIf this school is owned by the Department, would this one be willing to rent it to Sioui on the above mentioned conditions?\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. Michel Tetreault\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 3rd, 1945.\n\nMr. Michel Tetreault, Indian Agent, Pierreville, Que.,\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the building formerly used as a Church of England Day School in the Pierreville agency.\n\nI have reviewed several files and find that this school is the property of the Department even though we may not have spent much money in erecting it. We have kept it in repair for several years and as far as I can ascertain the land on which it is built was bought by the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nIf the building is allowed to stand idle much longer it will probably be useless. Consequently, if you consider that the amount of $6.00 a month is sufficient rent we have no objection to renting it to Robert Sioui provided that he is willing to make the repairs mentioned in the second paragraph of your letter at his own expense. Please let me hear from you with regard to this matter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nPierreville, August 9th, 1945.\n\nRe: Church of England Day School.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRobert Sioui has just left my office and we have discussed the renting of this school. The amount of $6.00 a month is sufficient if we consider the repairs Sioui intends to do. The house rents are not very high here in Odanak. This school house will make a tenement of only 4 rooms.\n\nThere are 12 or 15 desks and 2 blackboards to dispose of. Would it be a good idea to bring them to the R.C. school where shelter is available? The Sisters say they can use the blackboards right now.\n\nRegarding collection of the rent, I suppose I am the one designated to do it and forward it to the Receiver General covered with Form I.A.527, Credited to Abenaki Band.\n\nSioui is willing to pay the rent in advance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. Michel Tetreault\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 17th August, 1945.\n\nMr. Michel Tetreault, Indian Agent, Pierreville, Quebec.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant, it is noted that Robert Sioui is prepared to pay $6.00 month rent for the former Church of England Day School on the Pierreville Agency.\n\nThe rent should be collected each month and forwarded to this office to deposit to the credit of Casual Revenues.\n\nThe desks and blackboards and any other school equipment that happens to be in the building may be transferred to St. Francis R.C.

The Reverend Thomas Ligget, Rector of Sorel, is the present Incumbent. The school question is a source of some concern. There are nine children, from 5 to 14 years of age, belonging to four families. In the past when numbers declined some children went to Chapleau but both children and parents felt the long separation very deeply and, as I understand, the cost of any return to their homes during the school period had to be met by the parents.\n\nA possible solution was put before me recently wherein a teacher, at present in Sorel, might have been willing to undertake the position of teacher at the Mission. That, however, has not been found possible.\n\nI can readily appreciate the high cost of reestablishing a regular school for such a small number of children. Alternatively it means that the children will be forced to attend the Roman Catholic Convent or, if they are sent to Chapleau, they are cut off from their home for a long period of time because, even if they are permitted to return from time to time, the cost of such travel is beyond the means of their families.\n\nIn view of the saving to the Department in not maintaining a school at the Mission, could any consideration be given to the question of making it possible for the children to return occasionally at less cost to their parents in the event of their being sent to Chapleau?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

School here do hereby protest against the use of our school house for any other purpose than for school and prayer meetings. It is our school house. It was built for us by Anglicans. It is true that it was repaired and maintained in good condition by the Government but the money spent for that purpose was not a loan. As far as the land is concerned, I may say that it was never surrendered and it is not worth while to speak about it, as it cost only $14.00.\n\nThe equipment of the school is supplied by the Government but I pray the Superintendent of Indian Education to leave it with us, for sooner or later and before long, some religious society will be interested in us and will give us a teacher without pay, the same as when I first started to teach. The Colonial Church and School Society of London, England gave me $100.00 per annum to teach here, with which I was able to furnish a room and fuel for the school and things went on so for three or four years. There may be and there will be some other society that will do the same as the one above mentioned and I am sure that there will be some other man that will do the same as I did.\n\nIn the course of time the Sabrevois Mission Society built us a school house, which is the one we have now.\n\nI am sending you under separate cover a picture of said school house, of my pupils and myself.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) H.

There is no fence around the school ground.\n2. There is a porch or vestibule in front of the door, the inside of which is not finished. This is the first thing one notices on entering the school-house and it has a very bad appearance.\n3. A small bell is needed to be placed in the belfry.\n4. There were shutters on the old school-house, and, therefore, the contractor ought to make them for the windows of the second storey; but as these shutters are broken and they must be replaced, the contractor thought that it would be better to make Venetian blinds instead of replacing the old shutters, which are no longer in fashion.\n\nHowever, he has not yet made either the one or the other, and he is waiting until the Dept. decides before finishing that part of his contract. Please tell me whether the Dept. is disposed to approve these improvements that I have mentioned above.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nA.O. Comire, Agent.\nOTTAWA, 26th October, 1903\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant reporting that the removal of the Protestant school on the Abenakis reserve is now finished according to contract, but that the grounds require fencing; the vestibule needs finishing and modern venetian blinds are wanted, as well as a small bell for the belfry.

Head-chief of the Abenaki Band of Indians for twenty consecutive years, church-warden and secretary-treasurer for many years and school teacher for thirty-one years at St. Francis reserve, in my own name, in the name of the Church of England congregation and in the name of the pupils hitherto attending the C.E. school here do hereby protest against the use of our school-house for any other purpose than for school and prayer meetings. It is our school house. It was built for us by Anglicans. It is true that it was repaired and maintained in good condition by the Government but the money spent for that purpose was not a loan. As far as the land is concerned, I may say that it was never surrendered and it is worth while to speak about it, as it cost only $14.00.\n\nThe equipment of the school is supplied by the Government but I pray the Superintendent of Indian Education to leave it with us, for sooner or later and before long, some religious society will be interested in us and will give us a teacher without pay, the same as when I first started.\nstarted to teach. The colonial church school society of London Eng. gave me $145.2 per annum to teach there, with which I was able to furnish a room and fuel for the school and things went on as for thirty or four years. There may be and there will be some other society that will do the same as the one above mentioned and I am sure that there will come other men that will do the same as I did.\n\nIn the course of time the Cadoreois Mission Society built us a school house, which is the one we have now.\n\nI am sending you under separate cover a picture of said school house, of my pupils & myself.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

Crerar,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir-\n\nThere is in my Diocese the Indian Mission School of St. Francis at Odanak. Our clergyman at Sorel, the Reverend R. Emmett, came to see me the other day and told me that conditions in that school were very far from satisfactory. Representations were made to the Department of Indian Affairs some months ago by a Mr. Brady of the Protestant Board. Certain repairs to the building are very badly needed, and one case of a child who was in need of spectacles which were ordered months ago, has not yet received any attention. The Mission Schools under the same department at Oka and Cashmere also seem to be receiving generous consideration. Their teachers are paid higher salaries and are given an allowance for rent and fuel, but no such help is given to the master of St. Francis' School.\n\nWould it be possible for you to have someone review the whole situation and see if some consideration might be given which would result in the desired improvement in school conditions on that Reserve?\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nsgd) Arthur Montreal\nOttawa, June 17, 1939.\n\nMy dear Bishop Carlisle:\n\nI have for acknowledgment Your Lordship's letter of June 15, in which you seek information with respect to the operation of the St. Francis Church of England Indian Day School, Odanak, Quebec.\n\nThe records here indicate that the St. Francis school at Odanak was closed on September 30, 1920. Educational facilities on the Pierreville reserve were carefully reviewed at that time and it was discovered that there were not on the reserve a sufficient number of Indian pupils to justify the Department in keeping the school open for operation. It would appear, however, that one or two Indian families on the reserve continued to demand the re-opening of the school, with the result that the school was opened by my predecessor the Honourable Mr. Murphy in September, 1934. At that time a number of Indian pupils who had been enrolled at Anglican residential schools were brought back and provided with instruction at the day school.\n\nAt this date there is an enrolment at the school of twelve pupils and an average attendance during the last quarter of 9.6. Of these 12 pupils three are half-breeds and should be provided with instruction by the Provincial Government. They are in no sense the responsibility of this Department. It is the opinion of the officials that five of the remaining pupils should be provided with institutional care at an Anglican residential school. The mother\n\nRight Reverend Arthur Carlisle, D.D.,\nBishop of Montreal,\n1401 University Street,\nMontreal, P. Q.\nof these children died three months ago.\n\nI note with interest your reference to the special inspection of this school, made by Mr. Brady. This inspection was undertaken in response to requests that had reached the Department from individuals who took the position that the work of the teacher was in many respects wholly unsatisfactory, and I am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of the letter sent forward to the Inspector immediately following his report on the St. Francis school. The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nIn view of all the circumstances, it has occurred to me that it might be advisable to have conditions on the Pierreville reserve, and particularly conditions at the St. Francis school, investigated by one of the senior officials of the Department. I am, therefore, issuing instructions to have the Chief of the Training Division visit Odanak toward the end of next week. This official will be instructed to make a thorough investigation of existing conditions and recommend what steps should be taken to provide educational facilities for the children of the Anglican Church now resident on the reserve. Just as soon as this report reaches me, I shall be glad to communicate with you again.\n\nI regret to state that it is impossible for me to deal with the case of the girl who appears to be in need of glasses, referred to by Your Lordship in your communication. If the name of this girl is sent forward, I can assure you the case will be dealt with promptly. I should state, however, that on May 17 the Indian Agent was authorized by the Department to purchase two pairs of glasses for two residents of Odanak. It is just possible that the girl referred\nto by you was supplied with glasses at that time.\n\nMay I embrace this opportunity to thank Your Lordship for your interest in these matters and for the courtesy that prompted you to bring them to my personal attention.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, June 17, 1939.\n\nMy dear Bishop Carlisle:\n\nI have for acknowledgment Your Lordship's letter of June 15, in which you seek information with respect to the operation of the St. Francis Church of England Indian Day School, Odanak, Quebec.\n\nThe records here indicate that the St. Francis school at Odanak was closed on September 30, 1930.

It is just possible that three half-breed children now in attendance at the school should be sent to a public school and the remaining pupils enrolled at an Anglican residential school. The Chief of the Training Division, however, is not prepared to recommend that this step be taken for the time being at least. His recommendation is that certain repairs and improvements be undertaken immediately at the school and that the work of the teacher and the progress of the pupils be reviewed periodically during the coming year and a decision reached early in May of next year, with respect to the desirability of keeping the school in operation.

Crerar,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy dear Mr. Crerar:\n\nI want to thank you very much indeed for your letter of June 27th, which I received this morning. I appreciate more than I can tell you the kind interest which you are taking in the matter of our school at Odanak. The whole situation is new and strange to me. I expect to be in that part of my diocese very soon, and perhaps I may have an opportunity of looking the situation over myself. In the meantime I am most grateful to you and your department for this evidence of your desire to help us.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(sgd.) Arthur Montreal.\nOttawa, July 6, 1929.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI regret that you were not at home when I visited the Pierreville agency on the 23rd ultimo. At that time I called at the St. Francis C. E. School and spent some time with the teacher.\n\nFrom the information that he gave me, I feel that he is fully qualified to handle a school of this size, but it is quite apparent that he is not taking as great an interest in the work as he should. However, it has been decided to continue his services during the academic year 1929-40, on the understanding that he makes a real effort to improve his work. He is being written to that effect, and the Department will expect you to give him every possible co-operation.\n\nRegarding the repairs to the building, the teacher mentioned a new floor. Personally, I cannot see any reason why we should expend money in replacing the floor. It appears to be in good condition, but apparently had not been washed for some time. Please make immediate enquiries and advise me what it would cost to redecorate the interior of the classroom.\n\nThe teacher also mentioned that there is a window back of the blackboard, which has not been properly boarded up, and as a result he states the building is very cold in the winter. You might let me know the approximate cost of having this window boarded up and a new window placed on one side of the building.\n\nThe teacher complains about the roof, but\n\nBenj. Maurault, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPierreville, P. Q.\nit was pouring rain the day I visited the school and no water was coming through so I do not feel that it would be justified in making an expenditure in this connection. The painting of the exterior of the building will have to stand until later, as no funds are available.\n\nI will expect to hear from you at an early date regarding the repairs which I suggest be carried out during the present holiday period.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, July 7, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Emmett:\n\nIndian Agent Maurault is being instructed to obtain prices for decorating the interior of the classroom, also boarding up the window behind the blackboard and putting a new window on one side of the school.\n\nI did not see any great necessity for replacing the floor. It appears to be in fairly good condition but apparently had not been washed for some time.\n\nFrom the information you gave me, I feel that you are well qualified to handle the school. I felt, however, that you had apparently lost heart and were not devoting as much energy as could be expected.\n\nThe Department is anxious that the children attending your school receive every reasonable advantage along educational lines, and during the academic year 1939-40 we will expect you to put forth a great deal better effort than apparently you have done recently.\n\nWhile the classroom is sufficiently large for the number of pupils in attendance, I must say that it did not have a very attractive appearance. Redecorating this room should help, and in addition the Department will forward to you a picture of the King and Queen, as well as a number of other pictures, which you can have the boys frame as part of their vocational training activity and hang these pictures in the classrooms.\n\nI will look forward to visiting your school -\n\nA.

I note that on January 1, 1940, you sent forward a list of supplies necessary at the school. The supplies requested at that time consisted of 1 broom, 1 pail, 1 box of pipe varnish, 1 box of stove varnish, 4 window panes, 2 locks and \u00bd gallon of paint. You will note that there is no reference to an extinguisher amongst the list of supplies requested at that time. If you have not requested the fire extinguisher at any time recently will you please explain why you have failed to do so.\n\nInspector Houston, in his letter to the teacher, refers to a hand fire extinguisher of an approved type. I note that there is nothing in your letter to indicate what constitutes an approved type of fire extinguisher for the public schools of Quebec.

Corriveau\nAgent\nAberakis Agency,\nSt. Francois du Lac, 18th November, 1902.\n\nThe Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Protestant members of the band have decided to have the repairs made to their school-house which were authorized by your letter No. 152,859-5 dated the 13th June, 1902.\n\nTo begin with, they think fit to buy for the sum of fifty dollars a site belonging to Robert Paquette, Sr., situated in the centre of the village at the intersection of the four principal roads which traverse the village; this site is a little irregular in form; it is 24 feet on one side; 25 feet on another side, and 53 feet on the two other sides; there is on it a small house, old and almost uninhabitable.\n\nIf you desire to be instructed more exactly with regard to the position of this site, be good enough to consult the plan of the reserve prepared by Mr. C. G. DuBerger in 1897; the site is situated on the north side of the public road, opposite the Adventist Church, indicated on the plan by the No. 10.\n\nNow the Protestant members ask the Department if the choice of this site to which to remove their school is approved, and, if so, to name someone who shall be authorized by the Department to make the purchase of this land, for and in the name of the Protestant members of the band, and to make a notarial contract with the vendor.\n\nAllow me to suggest to the Department that either the Protestant Missionary, Rev. H. O. Loiselle, should be named, or the truant Officer of the Protestant School, Mr. H. L. Masta, ex-Chief.\n\nAs the season is advanced and time presses, an immediate reply from the Department will much oblige.\n\nYour, etc.,\nA. O. Comire,\nAgent.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 25th November, 1902\n\nAccountant:-\n\nPlease see letter under from the Protestant members of the Abenakis Band. They ask for $390.00 to remove and repair their schoolhouse, which includes $50.00 for the new site. The whole Band agreed to $250.00 being taken and the Indians say that a further resolution in council granting them an additional $75.00 was passed. If so it is not on file and at any rate there would be a balance of $65.00 to be found.\n\nThe Agent has written on this subject and says that the work should begin at once and that a notary would have to be employed to draw up the deed for the new site. This would cost $10.00 or $12.00 extra.\n\nThe order in council for $250.00 is turned out on file 152,850 herewith.\n\n[Signature]\nOTTAWA, 26th November, 1902:\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 18th instant, re repairs to the Protestant schoolhouse on the Abenakis reserve, I beg to say that the money now available for this work is barely sufficient to cover the cost and there is no margin left for the purchase of a new site, the necessity for which has not been made apparent to the Department. The distance from school where now situated to the proposed site is very short and the Department would require reasons for the change, even if funds were available; but they are not and the Indians will have to content themselves with the present situation. If they are satisfied, the work of repairing may go on.\n\nKindly advise the Department in this matter at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary\n\nA.O. Comire, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nSt Francois du Lac,\nQue\nOTTAWA, 3rd February, 1903\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to the proposition to move the Protestant school on the Abenakis reserve to a more central site, I beg to say that since you were written to on the 26th November last (to which letter no reply has been received) the Department has been advised that the location of the present Protestant school is very inconvenient and difficult of access, especially in winter owing to snow-drifts. The Department would like a report from you in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAM\n\nSecretary\n\nA.O.

Ross\n\nMonsieur,\n\nJ'ai l'honneur de vous informer de la r\u00e9ception de votre lettre n\u00b0 154520-5 en date du 3 f\u00e9vrier dernier. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette communication, je peux affirmer que le projet de chemin est effectivement dans un \u00e9tat d'avancement qui permet une utilisation pour les familles et les enfants. Le chemin est en effet suffisamment large pour permettre le passage de voitures et de chariots. La qualit\u00e9 du chemin est excellente et il est utilis\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement par les habitants.\n\nL'\u00e9tat actuel du chemin est satisfaisant et il ne pr\u00e9sente aucune difficult\u00e9. Le chemin est \u00e9galement couvert de neige et de glace, ce qui facilite sa navigation m\u00eame en hiver.\n\nJe serais heureux de recevoir une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette lettre du 18 janvier dernier, car elle serait certainement pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable \u00e0 une r\u00e9ponse plus tardive ou plus floue.\n\nPar la pr\u00e9sente,\nA. Ross\nAgent\nThe Abenakis Agency,\nSt. Francois du Lac, 7th February, 1903-\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of I.A.\nOttawa.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 154520/5 of the 3rd February instant, and in reply I beg to say that it is a fact that the Protestant school is situated in a position of difficult approach for the young children especially in winter, because, on account of the frequency of heavy snow, the road leading to it is often blocked up in bad weather and sometimes even impassable.\n\nLast Summer when it rained frequently, the road was soft and bad.\n\nThe site of which I spoke to you in my letter of the 18th Nov. last would certainly be preferable, more central and of easier access for the children.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nA.O. Comire,\nAgent.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 18th February, 1903\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nRe removal and reconstruction of Protestant School on the Abenakis reserve.\n\nYou will see from Agent Comire's letter hereunder of the 7th instant that he considered the present site unsuitable. The location selected will cost...........................................$50.00\nContractor's charge for removal and repairs..................................................$40.00\nNotaries fees for drawing conveyance, say....$10.00\n$400.00\n\nThe Band has voted for this purpose $325.00 leaving a balance of $75.00 which would have to be provided. The Protestant Indians are very anxious to have this work attended to as the Catholic Indians have had a new schoolhouse put up for them out of the Band funds, $1250.00 being voted for that purpose.\n\nShould the Department authorize the work to be proceeded with the first step to take would be the employment of a notary to prepare the papers.\n\nThe building could be more easily moved while the snow is on the ground and the matter should be attended to as soon as possible, if the additional $75.00 can be arranged for.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Brown\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL.\n\nFunds can be spared for this purpose from the vote for Schools, Ontario and Quebec.

The Department is willing to pay this sum, but before doing so it would require to have some conveyance executed by Paquette. Will you please advise me as to what form of transfer should be taken and to whom it should be granted for the use of the Protestant members of the Band for school purposes.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Oliver\nSurrender by Robert Paquette, Senior, for Abenakis Protestant Separate School.\n\nThe deed might be in the form annexed hereto.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, 11th March, 1903.\n\nSir:-\n\nIn connection with previous correspondence relative to the proposed removal and reconstruction of the Protestant School on the Abenaki Reserve, I beg to say that the Department has decided to allow the school building to be removed to the site chosen by the Protestant members of the Band, and a draft form of conveyance from Robert Paquette, Sr., to His Majesty the King is inclosed herewith for execution by Paquette. You will be good enough to prepare a description by metes and bounds of the land to be purchased from him, and to assist you in so doing a tracing of the plan of the Indian Reserve at Pierreville is also sent you, showing the triangular piece of land a portion of which is to be obtained for the new school site. In preparing the description you will be good enough to start from a fixed point and take the measurements in English feet around the four sides of the piece of land to be conveyed. The instrument should be signed and sealed by Paquette in the presence of a witness, who should make an affidavit of execution similar to the form attached to the deed, before a Notary Public. When the document is properly executed, you will be good enough to forward it to the Department, and, if it is found to be correct, a cheque in favour of Robert Paquette, Sr., for the sum of $50.00, the amount of the purchase money, will be sent you.\n\nThe Department also approves of the tender of Mr. Joseph Durocher for the removal and repairs of the building.\n\nA.

Conner\n\nN.B. L'entrepreneur est pri\u00e9 d'entamer les travaux.\n\nA.A. Scott\nTo the Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs\n\nMy dear Mr. Hinton,\n\nI have learned that an application has been made to the Crown for a piece of land at Bemerville for the purpose of a Protestant Separate School. For years past a school has been maintained for Protestant Indians at Bemerville under the direction of the Church of England Mission. Now, and on its property, the erection of another school is so small a community can only lead to inefficiency & trouble.\n\nOn representations of the Indians as to the situation of the school, I am willing to allow of its removal to another site, on condition (in accordance with the instructions of the Indians themselves) that the title of the school house be removed & the property on which it was placed shall remain with the Church of England as at present.\n\nI therefore ask that the proposal be not assented to nor the deed be accepted by the Crown.\n\nI am\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nW. B. MacNeil\nArchbishop\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 14th April, 1903:\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nWith further reference to the proposed removal of the Protestant school at Pierreville, I beg to say that a deed of the proposed new site from Robert Paquette, Sr to His Majesty, the King, has been executed and the consideration money, namely $50.00, should now be paid.\n\nA protest has, however, been received from His Grace, the Archbishop of Montreal against the transfer being taken in the name of His Majesty, claiming that the title of the schoolhouse so removed and the property on which it is to be placed, should remain with the Church of England as at present.\n\nAlthough negotiations for the removal of this school have been in progress for over a year, this is the first intimation the Department has received that the Church of England authorities were likely to raise any objection, although Mr Loiselle, the teacher, is also Church of England missionary there. The Department is paying for the site and the Indians are furnishing the money from their capital funds for the removal. There is a proviso, in the deed that the property shall so long as deemed expedient by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs be occupied as a site for a Protestant Separate school for the said Band with remainder for the use of the said Band.\nThe only cause of complaint I can see that the Church would have is that they would, to a certain extent, lose control of the school, but as the Department pays the teacher's salary, I do not see that they would be very much out.\n\nI am also doubtful whether an Indian on a reserve could sell direct to the Church of England without a surrender. The Law Clerk could decide this point if necessary.\n\n[Signature]\nOTTAWA, 16th April, 1903\n\nMay it please Your Grace,-\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Your Grace's letter of the 10th instant with reference to the proposed removal of the Protestant school at Pierreville, protesting against the transfer of the new site being made to His Majesty the King, instead of to the Church of England.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform Your Grace that the grounds of your protest will be carefully enquired into and you will be further advised.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour Grace's most obedient servant\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nHis Grace,\nThe Archbishop of Montreal\nBishop's Court\n42 Union Avenue,\nMontreal Que\nThe Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nSeparate school site Pierreville Reserve.\n\nI do not consider that an Indian could sell to the Church of England direct. There would be necessary a surrender by the band. In the present case the sum of $50.00 has been paid for the purchase of the Indian Robert Paquette's interest in the land. The money was not paid by the Church of England authorities; and I think the deed was properly made to the Crown in trust for the band of Indians to the end and intent that land should so long as was deemed expedient by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs be occupied as a site for the Protestant separate school with remainder to the use of the band.\n\nThere is no evidence before me that the land on which the school house formerly stood was held by the Church of England on any better title than the site now acquired. I notice from Mr. Benson's report of 18th February that the cost to the Band funds of the purchase of the Indian's interest and the removal and repair of the old school house has been $325.00. The advisability of the surrender therefore seems doubtful.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLaw Clerk.\nOTTAWA, 25th April, 1903\n\nMay it please Your Grace:\n\nIn further reference to Your Grace's protest against the transfer of the new site of the Protestant school at Pierreville being made to His Majesty the King, instead of to the Church of England, I have the honor to inform Your Grace that the Department does not consider that an Indian could sell direct to the Church of England without a surrender from the Band being obtained for this purpose. The purchase money for the land is furnished by the Department and it thinks that the deed was properly made out to the Crown in trust for the Indians to the end and intent that the land should, so long as deemed expedient by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, be occupied as a site for the Protestant school with remainder to the use of the Band.\n\nI may add that there is no evidence of record that the land on which the school house formerly stood was held by the Church of England on any better title than the site now acquired, and as the cost to the Indians of the purchase of the site and\n\nHis Grace,\n\nThe Archbishop of Montreal,\nBishop's Court,\n42 Union Ave.\nMontreal\nThe removal and repair of the old schoolhouse will cost the Board over $325.00; the taking of a surrender seems inadvisable.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nYour Grace's most obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 27th April, 1903\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nThe conveyance for the new site for the Pierreville Protestant school to His Majesty has been executed by Robert Paquette, Sr., and if the same is in order the purchase money, $50.00, should be paid. I would recommend that the deed be submitted to the Law Clerk.\n\nIf it is decided to pay the money the Agent should be instructed to arrange with the contractor for the removal of the building as soon as convenient, so as not to interfere with the class work of the school. As the summer holidays begin about the end of June, it might be as well to wait until then.\n\n[Signature]\n\nCheque No. [illegible]\n$50.00\nSent [illegible]\nSir,\n\nA complaint was made to me in connection with the new site which has been acquired or which it is proposed to acquire for the Protestant School on the Reserve of the Abenakis of St. Francois that it was either not described properly in the Instrument under which it was being acquired and which has been sent to the Department or that it was not pegged out in accordance with the terms of the Instrument, and in accordance with the intention of the meeting of the Indians at which the said terms were fixed.\n\nBy measurement it was found that the lot presented a width to the main road of 40 feet at its Westerly end and of only 39 feet at about two-thirds of the whole distance to the East, at a point where it commences to narrow, until it reaches its Easterly extremity. The peg was, therefore, moved by me so as to give a uniform width of 40 feet, and, as this afforded satisfaction to the disputants, the land should be described in the deed so as to agree with this settlement, if the description does not now do so.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt.

General,-\n\nReferring to Mr. Macrae's memorandum of the 28th ult. hereunder, I beg to say that the description of the land for the Protestant School in the Pierreville reserve which was put in the deed was made from measurements given by the Agent, and shown in the diagram in the margin.\n\nMr. Macrae has moved the point A, thus changing the two adjacent distances. If he can give these two measurements as they now are, that is after he has changed the point, a new description may be prepared and placed in the deed.\n\nIf it were certain that the angle at B is a right angle a description could be prepared without the above measurements being given, but the correctness of this cannot be gathered from the correspondence.\n\nI think it is not absolutely necessary, but it is probably preferable that a new deed should be prepared, if the same can be done without going to unreasonable trouble and expense.\n\nChief Surveyor.\nNo. 154529/6.\n\nOttawa, 5th May., 1903.\n\nDescription.\n\nAll that certain parcel of land of irregular form situated at the southerly angle of the triangle lying between the road to the ferry and the road to Pierreville, in the said Indian Reserve at Pierreville, described as follows:- commencing at the intersection of the westerly limit of the said road to the ferry with the northeasterly limit of the said road to Pierreville; thence northwesterly along the said northeasterly limit of the said road to Pierreville fifty-nine feet; thence at right angles to the said northeasterly limit forty feet; thence southeasterly and parallel to the said northeasterly limit twenty-eight feet more or less to the westerly limit of the said road to the ferry; thence southerly along the said westerly limit fifty feet more or less to the point of commencement, containing four hundredths of an acre be the same more or less.\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe original of this Document has been removed for retention in the Records of the Indian Land Registry.\n\nJune 9, 1972\n\nSignature\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 6th May, 1903:\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:-\n\nWith reference to the memoranda hereunder from Messrs Macrae, Rimmer and Bray on the subject of the new site for the Protestant school on the Agonakis reserve, I beg to say that as the Department has already accepted a conveyance for the land in question, and paid the purchase money, I do not see that much would be gained by having a new conveyance taken.

H.O. Loiselle, Anglican clergyman, and teacher of the Protestant school, tells me that some years ago the said Robert Paquette made a gift of this site to his daughter, Catherine Paquette, wife of Frank Odosan; and that Catherine Paquette is at present living with Samuel Watson, by whom she has raised a numerous family, and that he himself, the Rev. Mr. Loiselle, was called upon to sign this deed of gift, as a witness.\n\nNow please tell me whether I ought at once to hand over the said cheque to the said Robert Paquette, or whether you have any other proceedings to take before that is done.\n\nAn immediate reply will oblige\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nA.O.

The Department advised the Agent not to pay over the money until this matter was looked into and Mr Comire writes under date of the 11th instant, stating that Catharine Paquette is willing to execute a quit claim of her right in the property, and I would suggest that the Law Clerk be instructed to prepare the necessary document so that the matter of the school site may be finally closed.\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe form of quit claim deed for Paquette can be used with substitution of his name and any other names.

I was not able to see the contractors myself, for he was not working there that day.\n\nIn fact I might say to the Dept. that I do not know very much about this country because in this matter the Protestant members have corresponded with the Dept. direct and did not think it proper\nto advise me of what they had done in regard to the condition of the contract etc. (I do not care, however, for this as much; I see trouble for me and I have not been instructed by anyone to supervise the work.\n\nSome time ago the contractor came to see me before beginning the work to ascertain whether it would be I who would pay him, if not, by whom he would be paid. I told him in detail the amount that had been voted by the band for that purpose.

Nagazoa, the owner of the neighbouring land, would consent for the sum of $15 to sell in the rear of the school land a strip six feet in depth along the width of the school ground; this is not dear and it is indispensable for the school; we would be able to place there the closets, and we could at once have a proper place to make a fence to inclose the school land.\n\nPlease tell me, as soon as possible, if the Dept. approves this project, for we wait a reply before commencing to build the fence around the piece of land.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nA.O.

Nagazoa; it is not quite that way.\n\nThis strip of land was part of a lot sold by Catherine Paquette to her sister, Marie Jeanne Paquette, wife of J.B. Nagazoa, and they both reside there; but as this lot is not yet completely paid for, and as Marie Jeanne Paquette has not yet any title, the latter came to see me today to request the Dept. to make the cheque for $15.00 payable to Catherine Paquette on account of the payment of the said lot.\n\nAt the same time, if the Dept. wishes to make a contract of sale, or other title, for the said strip of land, it ought to be made with Catherine Paquette instead of J.B. Nagazoa.\n\nSend me immediately, by return of mail, the cheque for $15.00 and the contract that you desire to have signed by Catherine Paquette, for she starts in a few days for the United States, and it would be well to settle this affair before her departure.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nA.O.

For three lessons a week, each of an hour's duration, I should be satisfied with a remuneration of $10. a month throughout the school year.\n\nMay I add that, were such a monthly addition to our finances be forthcoming, the situation at home would be far less difficult for us. As we have two children to support, my husband's yearly salary of $600. is entirely insufficient to meet our needs.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nAlice Emmett.\nOttawa, August 29, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Minister is in receipt of a letter from Mrs. Emmett, wife of the teacher in charge of the C.

In this letter, Mrs. Emmett makes formal application for the position of sewing instructress at the school.\n\nIn view of this application, I am anxious to know from you the exact number of pupils that are likely to enroll at the Anglican Indian Day School when this school opens on September 5. It is my understanding that a number of the children who have been in attendance until now have made application for enrolment at a residential school. If such is the case, the enrolment at the day school will be substantially reduced. I am anxious that you should reply to this letter at the earliest possible date. You should also send forward the application forms for the admission of the pupils to the residential school, if you have not already done so.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Jos. de Gon-\nzague lui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9crit \u00e0 ce sujet, et sa r\u00e9ponse a \u00e9t\u00e9\nqu'elle consentirait peut-\u00eatre \u00e0 laisser avoir 5 pieds,\nmais seulement \u00e0 son retour \u00e0 l'automne, et \u00e0 condition\nqu'on ne lui en demande pas davantage.\n\nQuant aux 25 pieds dont parle votre t\u00e9l\u00e9gramme, il est\ninutile de tenter d'avoir le consentement de la m\u00e8re\nGlaude, elle ne consentira pas; si le D\u00e9partement croit\nqu'il est absolument n\u00e9cessaire de les avoir, il lui fau-\ndra prendre les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaires pour l'exproprier.\nMaintenant, il reste 21 pieds entre le couvent et la li-\ngne du terrain voisin, et les S\u0153urs consid\u00e8rent que c'est\nsuffisant pour le pr\u00e9sent pour y \u00e9riger l'addition pr\u00e9-\nvue.\n\nComme il serait tr\u00e8s important que les travaux commencent\nle plus t\u00f4t possible, afin de pouvoir les avoir pour l'ou-\nverture des classes cet automne, je crois qu'il vaudrait\nmieux se contenter du terrain qu'il y a actuellement, vu\nque les s\u0153urs s'en contentent de leur c\u00f4t\u00e9.\nLes ouvriers sont l\u00e0 qui attendent et perdent leur temps en attendant; en outre je vi ai vu aujourd'hui, l'un des vendeurs de grand bois de construction, qui avait demand\u00e9 $32,00 du mille pieds et qui m'a dit que maintenant, il serait en position de le laisser pour $30,00.\n\nC'est tout ce que je puis vous dire \u00e0 ce sujet pour aujourd'hui.\n\nVeuillez r\u00e9pondre imm\u00e9diatement et me dire si vous avez d'autres instructions \u00e0 me donner.\n\nSi vous d\u00e9sirez correspondre avec la m\u00e8re Joseph Glaude, voici son adresse:\n\nDame Joseph Glaude,\nHighgate Springs,\nVermont.\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur.\n\n[Signature]\nAbenakis Agency,\nSt. Fran\u00e7ois du Lac, July 16, 1909.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of I.A.,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your telegram dated yesterday relative to the acquisition of 25 feet of land on the lot bordering on that of the convent for the erection of the new addition to the said convent, I may tell you that the owner, the widow of Joseph Glaude, is at present in the United States, and the Missionary, the Rev. Joseph de Gonzague, has already written to her on the subject, and her reply was that she would consent, perhaps, to give up 5 feet, but only on her return in the fall, and on condition that she should not be asked for any more.\n\nAs for the 25 feet mentioned in your telegram, it is useless to try to get the consent of Mrs. Glaude; she would not agree; if the Department believes it absolutely necessary to have the 25 feet, it will have to take the necessary proceedings to expropriate. Now, there remains the 25 feet between the convent and the boundary of the adjacent land, and the nuns consider that it is sufficient for the present to erect the proposed addition there.\n\nAs it is very important that the work should begin as soon as possible, in order to have it done before the opening of the classes this fall, I believe that it would be better to be content with the land that there is at present, as the nuns are satisfied on their part. The workmen are there and are losing their time while waiting; besides, today I saw one of the dealers in large\nbuilding timber, who had asked $32.00 per M. feet, and he told me now that he is in a position to sell for $50.00.\n\nThis is all that I am able to tell you on this subject today.\n\nPlease reply immediately and tell me whether you have any other instructions to give me.\n\nIf you wish to correspond with Mrs. Jos. Glaude, Sr., the following is her address:\n\nMrs. Joseph Glaude,\nHighgate Springs,\nVermont.\n\nYour, &c.,\nA.O. Comire,\nAgent.\nSaratoga Village, the 22 July 1904\n\nTo Mr. Frank Padley, Deputy.\n\nMy dear sir,\n\nI enclose Mrs. Claude's final answer relative to the land. See how ridiculous. One hundred dollars for a strip of land of 5 ft. x 50. This is the situation; Mother Claude is simply under the pressure of the ex-chief Nicolas Vaudry who has hired her for the summer. The ex-chief's ambition is to annul every act of his antagonist. The present chief M. Malo - I find no other explanation of the existing difficulty.\nas I suggested some time ago, perhaps it would be better to build immediately on the twenty feet at our disposal in order that the building may be finished for the opening of school.\n\nYour truly,\n\n[Signature]\nElenoritis Village the 16th July 1904.\n\nTo Mr. Frank Ridley, Dept. Inspec. of Indian Affairs,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. Ogilvie is satisfied that we foresee 21 ft. 03 land on the north-east side of the school where it is desired to build an addition or window. Land is land and we would therefore need but a strip 5 x 50 ft. taken to build our annex of 25 x 50 ft.\n\nI have just written to the old lady for the second time begging her to sell this strip of land at a reasonable price. I even told her to come at once that her travelling expenses would be paid. I hope we will succeed.\nHowever if the old lady became obstinate, the ladies tell me they could arrange to have the pupils comfortably settled in the 20 ft. at our disposal seeing that we may take 5 ft. of the old school which would permit us to have good sized Class rooms, a sewing room, etc., for the girls are taught to sew and mend and so far every thing...the Library, the type writer, the sewing machine everything is piled into the school room. So we require 20 ft. by 50 in length. I enclose a little plan for better explanation. I am at your disposal for the success of this undertaking, if you need me. You have but to give your authorisation for the building of canvas and repairs to school before next week, we could go to work at once and have all\nCompleted by October.\n\nAllow me to call your attention to the real necessity of all this for teachers and pupils for they are certainly not properly lodged. They have been suffering for want of shelter for a long time.\n\nCounting on a speedy and favorable reply,\n\nI am, Sir,\nYour faithful and devoted\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. de Bagnere, Post, June.\nOttawa, July 27, 1908.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd inst., and in reply I beg to say that the plans for the addition to the St. Joseph's convent have been so modified that it will not be necessary for the Department to utilize the strip of land referred to in your letter.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Joseph de Gonsague,\nMissionary,\nPierreville, Que.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nActing Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nI have to report that the Indian school at Pierreville, which is one of the most successful conducted by the Department, is greatly in need of additional accommodation and it is proposed to erect a wing to the present building to provide class-rooms and an assembly hall and to make some necessary changes in the old building. As enlarged premises are greatly needed to contribute not only to the successful working of the school but also to better sanitary arrangements, the work should be carried out as soon as possible. Plans of the proposed addition have been prepared and the estimated cost is in the neighborhood of $2500.00. The improvements could be carried out by local contractors, of which there are four able and willing to undertake the work. Under the provisions of Revised Statutes Cap. 39 Sec. 36 Sub-section I we propose to ask these four contractors to submit prices on the plans and specifications, and not to invite tenders by public advertisement. I beg to request that this course be sanctioned as it is in the interests of the Indian service and in pursuance of the Section of the Public Works Act above quoted.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Owing to the importance of this matter I would strongly recommend that at least one fire escape of the type required by the provincial by-law be installed on the east side of the building as soon as possible.\n\nThe sisters have informed me that the arrangement for the delivery and weighing of coal were not satisfactory, and that some means should be taken next summer to verify the quantity and quality of coal being supplied to the school.\n\nEngineer and Architect.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. [illegible],\n\nIn reference to your memorandum of the 2nd instant in regard to the St. Joseph's Academy, I should be glad if you would let me know what style of fence you think should be placed around the school grounds and also give me a detailed estimate of the cost of erecting it.\n\nKindly let me have a description of the fire escape you recommend should be installed on the east side of the building and the cost of installing it.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, April 5, 1918.\nApril 29th, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has been informed that the rear portion of the school lot at the Abenakis Convent was not yet fenced, and that the neighbours' cattle were consequently allowed to roam about the school.

The parcel of land which is in my possession comprising an area of 28 ft. frontage by 156 ft. in depth, running along the present grounds of the St. Joseph Academy at Odanak. I would sell the grounds with the house on it for $400.00.\n\n(Signed) Anna Capino\nYou will please find attached a letter just received from Mr. Justice Roylance of N. F. Hall's warranty concerning a certain lot of land adjoining the current road, and also a summary description of said land by the owner Miss Coates.\n\nMiss Coates is willing to sell this land with the house built on it, and as the District had decided a few years ago to buy a part of this land from Miss Coates' aunt (the District's letter No. 23-2-9 dated), who was then willing to sell but who died the same day I received the District's letter, I think it would be wise to take this land while it is still a matter of fact the children have no ground to play near the current; all they have is a tract of land about the width of a farm road, and may, it is certainly not enough.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent\nOttawa, November 15, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, enclosing a communication from Rev. Sister M. Josephine relative to the purchase of a small parcel of land for the use of St. Joseph's Academy, Pierreville and also a communication from Miss Anna Capino, the present owner, in which she offers to sell same, including a building thereon, for the sum of $400.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that when this lot was first offered for sale by the late owner the price asked was $150. I may say that the Department does not require the building which is located on this plot of land, and the owner may remove same or otherwise dispose of it. Please inform Anna Capino that the Department will purchase this plot of land, but is not prepared to pay more than the price asked by the late Mrs. Anna Capino. We note that the lot in question is approximately 25' x 150'. You should take up the matter of the price asked with Miss Capino and inform the Department of the lowest price she will accept, after removing or disposing of the building thereon, and you should inform the Department accordingly. This matter should receive your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nB. Maugault, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPierreville, P.Q.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 15th instant, I offer Miss. Brown's house. I beg to say that this piece of land offered for $400 is what a part, but not all, of the land offered in my last letter. Miss. Brown is willing to remove her house and sell the land. Here the lot for $300. The land offered a few years ago by Mr. Brown contains about 2 acres. The present house was built on a small lot of land adjoining the barns and outbuildings.\n\nI am today offering a large lot of land included and it extends in the other direction long side of the present avenue for 150 feet, giving much more space to the children.\n\nHaving these informations will help the District to reach a decision. I remain\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent's Office\nOttawa, November 30, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, informing the Department that Miss Anna Capino will agree to the sale of the parcel of land which the Department desires to acquire for the use of St. Joseph's Academy, Pierreville. We note that she agrees to the sale of same for the sum of $300 and that she will remove the present building on this lot. Please inform Miss Capino that it is the intention of the Department to acquire this lot, and will allow her the sum of $300 therefor.\n\nThe Department will prepare a quit claim deed to be executed by Miss Capino, but, before doing so, it will be necessary to have a proper description of the plot of land by metes and bounds. You should state definitely the dimensions of this parcel of land, viz., width and length, starting at a point adjoining the present property of the Convent. This information should be forwarded as soon as possible, when the necessary documents will be prepared and forwarded to you for signature. You should also state how Miss Capino acquired this land from her aunt, and whether she is the sole owner and has the full right to dispose of same. As soon as the documents are signed by her payment of the purchase price of the land will be made.\n\nMiss Capino may arrange to have the building on this land removed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Sister Superior of St. Joseph's Academy, Okaak, in her annual report, states that it would be desirable to have the new lot of land, recently bought for the use of the school, levelled and fenced, in order to provide playground facilities for the children.\n\nIn this connection I beg to refer you to official letter of January 27th, last, in which you were requested to inform the Department of the amount of fencing required, the type and the approximate cost of same. I should be pleased to have this information at an early date. You should state the quantity of fencing posts and other material that would be required and also give the information as to the amount of levelling that would be required to the grounds, with an estimate of the cost. When we have full information, consideration will be given to authorising having the work carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Ass't Deputy & Secretary.\n\nB.

We have not on record enough information regarding elevation of the land along the bank of the St. Francis River from which a profile could be prepared. The survey necessary to obtain this information would, I should think, come properly under the duties of the departmental engineer.\n\nI shall be pleased to assist you in matters of this kind at times when you find you are too busy to attend to them yourself, but at the present time the work of this Branch is somewhat behind. This is partly due to the fact that Mr. White has been required to be absent on duty from the Department more than usual during the present summer, also partly on account of breaking in a temporary employee to the duties of Mr. Skelton, who has been lent to the Architect all this year, with the result that Mr. Patrick has not been able to devote much of his time to his customary duties. Mr. Fairchild, whom I would ordinarily have do work of this nature, should we be assisting you, is not expected from the West until the end of October, which from your memo I gather would be too late.\n\nI think you will realize from the above that this is an inappropriate time for me to attempt to assist you, unless you can wait until Mr. Fairchild returns from the West.\n\nChief Surveyor.\nOttawa, 4th September 1929\n\nSir,\n\nWould you be good enough to advise me if your records contain a plan of the land originally occupied in the Indian reserve at Pierreville for the purposes of a Roman Catholic school and if so, would you kindly supply me with a copy of this plan; a blueprint copy will be sufficient.\n\nI should also be pleased to receive a blueprint copy of that plan entered in the records of the Parish of St. Thomas of Pierreville under No. 1277. If a blueprint of this is not obtainable, please advise if Plan No. 1277 refers to all of that portion of the Indian reserve adjoining the Village of Pierreville or to only a part thereof.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Registrar,\nCounty of Yamaska,\nSt. Francois du Lac,\nP.Q.\n\n[L.J.

This specialist would be in a position to suggest some means which would be more economical than that projected by myself.\n\nI may say that there are some officers in the Mines Department whose duties are investigations of this kind, and who would attend to the matter if officially requested.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nTENDERS WANTED\n\nSEALED TENDERS addressed to the undersigned and enclosed on the envelope \"Tenders\" will be received for the erection of new school buildings at the reserve for the Indian village of Devon on the North Saskatchewan River.

We have no special plans of the reserve, only a copy of the parish map.\nOct. 5, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has been advised at various times that the land forming the embankment on the north shore of the St. Francis River on one side of lot 168 on which is located a government school, is gradually sliding in the spring, owing to the nature of the soil and its high elevation above water levels. The above mentioned lot is located in the Indian village of Odanak adjoining the town of Pierreville in the County of Yamaska. Upon having the land examined by an engineer of this Department it was proposed to erect a retaining wall built of concrete or timber with piles, etc. Before proceeding with work of this kind I should like to know whether it would be possible for one of your geologists to examine this locality and furnish me with a report as to whether the conditions of the ground are such as to necessitate protection work of some kind. I may add that the request for expert advice on this matter is due to the fact that the Sisters who reside in the building which is close to the embankment are anxious that some means be taken to properly protect the building in case further slides should occur.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

H. Collins,\nDirector, Geological Survey,\nDepartment of Mines.\n\nRe: Embankment of the St. Francis River adjoining the school in the Indian village of Odanak, Yamaska county, Quebec.\n\nThe school at Odanak is situated on the top and about 40 feet from the edge of the embankment adjoining the northeast side of the St. Francis river (see Photographs 1 and 2). The embankment at this point is about 75 feet high and forms part of a spur delimited on the southeast and southwest sides by steep terraces which formed during the erosion of the river when it stood at a higher level. The abandoned channel of a former meander of the river to the north of the spur can be observed on the right in Photograph No. 3. A number of islands occur in the river below the spur and local inhabitants stated that the main channel which now passes to the east or right side of these formerly passed to the left or southwest side. The freshly cut banks at the base of the embankment on the northeast side of the river also indicates that the river is now eroding on that side. The material composing the bank is stratified marine clay which, because of its fine grain and soft character when wet, erodes very rapidly.\n\nAn examination of the embankment of the river adjoining the school shows that it is receding in two ways, (1) by surface water erosion and sliding at the top of the embankment, and (2) by erosion at the base of the embankment (by the river) especially at the time of spring flood.\n\n(1) Surface erosion and sliding at top of embankment. The surface of the ground adjoining the school slopes gently to the top of the embankment so that in the spring and at times of heavy rain the surface water for a considerable area drains over the embankment at the rear of the school. An erosion gully, three or four feet deep and several feet wide, can be seen at this point. Considerable amounts of water also finds its way underground to this point, for water flows from the embankment in the spring and the Superior stated that at one time there was a well between the school and the top of the embankment. This water softens the clay causing it to slide.\n\n(2) River erosion at the base of the embankment. As previously pointed out the river is now actively eroding the base of the embankment below the school. It is probable that this erosion is very slow when the water is low but must be considerable at time of flood when blocks of ice impinge on the soft clay banks. How long it will take for this action to endanger the school can only be determined by measurements of the embankment over a period of years.\nRemedial Measures.\n\nAlthough the school is not yet endangered it is evident that it will be endangered in a very few years if the erosion and slumping at the top of the embankment continues. To prevent this steps should be taken to drain away all or as much as possible of the surface water from the territory adjoining the school and if necessary any water from the roadway that finds its way on the embankment across the school yard. If this is accomplished it will not only prevent surface erosion but the penetration of water to the embankment underground where it softens the clay and facilitates slumping. There is a gully crossing the road a few hundred feet south of the school to which it would probably not be difficult to drain the surface water from the school area and from the road opposite the school. It will be also necessary to fill in the erosion gully that has formed to the rear of the school. The top of the embankment opposite the school is now protected by posts and boards and it may be advisable to continue this southeastward if erosion furrows continue to cut down the edge of the embankment. The Supervisor stated that formerly the embankment was covered with trees, a few of which remain. If more of these were planted they would no doubt assist considerably in preventing slumping.\n\nThe remedial measures that should be taken to prevent erosion at the base of the embankment is an engineering rather than geological problem. There are at least three ways in which it may be prevented: by driving piles, by a network of mats cement blocks*, or by a concrete wall. Which of these methods should be used or whether they should be used at all will depend, of course, on the cost. It is possible that it may be cheaper eventually to move the school than go to this expense. Steps are taken to prevent the erosion of the bank by the river; the protection should cover the cut bank on the upper (southeast) side of the school as well as directly below the school and should be as high as the high water level of the river.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nM.

Wilson.\n\n*See reports of Mississippi River Commission, Washington.\nOttawa, November 20th, 1929.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour file No. 23-2-9.\n\nIn response to a request from Mr. J.

If you are in a position to do so, will you kindly proceed with this work at once and advise the Department accordingly?\n\nIn addition to the actual survey of the lots, a profile is required of the ground at the top of the river embankment fronting the school lot and extending beyond the cut bank on the up river (SouthEast) side of the school. It is requested that the elevations on this profile be plotted with reference to the high water mark and that the profile should also indicate the present river level. It is requested that your survey of these lots show a tie to some point on the road survey which was performed under instructions issued to you by this Department on October 5th 1928, the returns of which were forwarded by you on the 31st of that month.\n\nYour returns will consist of field notes of the survey of the lots, the profile mentioned above, and your account in duplicate, accompanied by duplicate vouchers for expenses incurred.

This tender is accompanied by the required deposit security of $400.00. The tender stipulates that the piles are to be 15 feet long placed at five foot spacing, instead of 10 feet as called for by the specifications.\n\nThe estimated cost of this work, according to my memorandum of the 9th of May, amounts to $4050.00. In view of the fact, however, that a pile driving apparatus will have to be secured from Jorel at an expensive price, there being no such apparatus in the locality, I feel to recommend that Mr. Desroches' tender be accepted, and that he be authorized to proceed with the work as early as possible, in order that it may be completed before the cold season sets in.\n\nAs the greatest amount of the work will consist in the laying of concrete, I would suggest that an inspector be appointed to supervise this part of the work only, and that I be furnished with the name of a person to act as Inspector.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nSeptember 26, 1930.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Chene\n\nMr. Charles Descoteau's tender has been approved by the Minister, as you will note from the attached memorandum.

Choisel, inspecteur de construction du dit mur. Nous avons constat\u00e9 une fissure dans un seul endroit du mur, au m\u00eame endroit o\u00f9 cette fissure s'est form\u00e9e presque imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s la construction; le reste du mur est en parfait \u00e9tat.\n\nLa cause est probablement la qualit\u00e9 du terrain qui est enclin \u00e0 contenir des quantit\u00e9s de eaux profondes et d'eau aux cours de surface qui malgr\u00e9 les drains actuels descendent en torrent jusqu'\u00e0 la c\u00f4te.\n\nEn effet, \u00e0 cet endroit du mur, il y a une quantit\u00e9 de petits cailloux qui s'allongent \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 du haut du mur.\n\nJe crois qu'il serait utile que l'inspecteur de l'\u00c9ducation fasse une inspection des lieux et d\u00e9termine vers ce qu'il serait urgent de faire pour am\u00e9liorer la situation s'il appara\u00eet.\n\nBenj.

Ed. Desrochers the builder of the said wall.\n\nWe found a crack in only one place in the wall, at the same place where such crack was noticed almost immediately after construction. The remainder of the wall is in perfect state. The cause is probably the quantity of earth which at that place contains a large quantity of deep water veins and also to the surface water which notwithstanding the present drains run down like a torrent down the slope. In fact at that place of the wall are running a quantity of small jets of water which are spread along the hill from up town. I believe it would be useful for the engineer of the Department to come and inspect the work and see what would be urgent to do to prevent matters to get any worse.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBenj. Maurault,\n\nIndian Agent.\nThe Department last year erected a reinforced concrete retaining wall in front of the school lot at the Abenakis Convent along the St. Francis River on the Abenakis Reserve. The work was carried out by contract and appeared to be satisfactory at the time of its inspection. It appears from a report sent in by the Indian Agent, hereunder, that additional drainage should be installed to take care of water which seeped through the filling behind the above mentioned wall, and which was not noticeable at the time of the construction of the wall. It is recommended by the Agent that the Engineer of the department make an inspection of the work in order to suggest what additional precautions should be taken to prevent the wall from being undermined or damaged by erosion or otherwise.\n\nIf you approve I could proceed to Pierreville during the course of this month upon my return from Doncaster next week, in connection with road work which is being carried out by the Provincial department of Highways on that reserve.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nOct. 2, 1931.\n\nMadam,\n\nI am sending you herewith copy of plan of the Abenakis School Convent lot, which I would ask you to keep in your office, for reference when officers of this department visit the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The Department is now advised by Indian Agent Maurault that the springs have almost ruined the foundation of this retaining wall, and he advises that some protection work should be undertaken at once to prevent it from being damaged beyond repair. It is also suggested by him that an Engineer be sent as soon as possible to make inspection of the present condition of the wall, in order to decide on the most effective and permanent way of putting it in a safe state of repair.\n\nIf you approve of the above mentioned suggestion I shall arrange to proceed with this inspection work at the beginning of next week.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\n23-2-9\n\nJune 13, 1932.\n\nMemorandum: Mr. Williams,\n\nWith reference to my memorandum hereunder, will you please advise if I can attend to this inspection work Thursday of this week, as I was compelled, as you know, to take holidays last week.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nPerth, N.B., June 3rd, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on conditions at Pierreville, Que.\n\nWhile at Pierreville, Mr. William Watson asked me if I would attend a meeting of the Indians at night as they had some matters they desired to place before me. As he called on me with the Chief I consented to do so. Mr. Watson spoke, but evidently dealt with only matters which he had recently been taking up with the department when at Ottawa. It may be as well to place a summary of his remarks on file.\n\nHe first spoke of the concrete wall, constructed about two years ago back of the school, stating that it had cost $4600.00 and was now falling down. I may say that I inspected this wall myself and found it to be in a very dangerous condition and liable to fail at any time. This is evidently due to imperfect drainage and possibly insufficient foundation. As it now stands it is a menace and liable to cause loss of life. If immediate renewal is not possible, owing to lack of funds, I suggest that the area be temporarily fenced off and warning signs placed in conspicuous places. I think that it is a matter which the Departmental Engineer should look into.\n\nC. C. Parker.\nInspector.\nMemorandum\n\nMr. Williams,\n\nAs authorized I last week made an inspection of the reinforced concrete retaining wall, which was erected by the Department in 1930, in front of the school lot along the St. Francis River at Odanak, on the Abenaki reserve. The wall referred to in my memorandum of June 4th hereunder, and I urge to make the following suggestions in order to prevent this wall from suffering from further damages, as well as the school property:\n\n1. Grading of the playground behind the School to prevent surface water from accumulating around the school buildings, and draining down the embankment towards the rear of the retaining wall causing erosion of the embankment and undermining the foundation of the wall.\n\n2. Construction of a culley 24\" diameter at the lowest point in the school yard, also the laying of 18\" drain from this culley as far as the bottom of the embankment or river shore.\n\n3. Installation of an eave trough in the rear of the laundry building with connection to the above mentioned culley.\n\n4. Laying of two rows of \"U\" drain tile in the rear along the retaining wall as an additional means of taking care of the surface running down the embankment.\n\n5. Erection of a small concrete curb between the laundry building and the fence of the school lot on the east side to prevent any water from running down the embankment after heavy storms.\n\n6.

I hope that orders will be issued in the course of a few days.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.F.

I would suggest, therefore, that only the most important and necessary work be carried out for the present by day labour under the supervision of a white foreman, employing Indian labour, with the understanding that the cost of the work is to be paid for from the appropriation for Miller. The works which I would suggest being carried out this year are as follows:\n\n1. Grading of the playground behind the school to prevent the surface water from accumulating around the school building, and draining down the embankment towards the rear of the retaining wall causing erosion of the embankment and undermining the foundation of the wall.\n\n2. Construction of a gulley 24\" diameter, at the lowest point in the school yard, also laying of 12\" drain from this gulley as far as the bottom of the embankment on the river shore, unless permission can be obtained to excavate an open ditch on the dividing line of the lot, which of course would be much cheaper.\n\n3. Building of a 6\" eave trough, galvanized iron, in the rear of the laundry building with connection to the above mentioned gulley, with 6\" vitrified drain pipe.\n\n4. Filling of the cavities which have been formed by erosion at certain places on the embankment behind the retaining wall, using earth from the grading of the school grounds.\n\n5. Construction of two reinforced concrete buttresses in front of the wall, one on the east end corner, and one in the centre where two cracks are located, these buttresses to be 3 feet thick from top to bottom of the wall, 5 feet in length at the top sloping down to a length of 10 feet at the base, with a slope of 45 deg., approximately. The buttresses to be reinforced with steel from the fence on top of the wall.\nThe total cost of the above mentioned work is about $1500.00.\n\nShould you approve of this work being carried out it would be of relief to the Indians who are practically without any means of sustenance at the present time. I would ask you to kindly give me the name of a competent white foreman to supervise the work, should you approve.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nAugust 11th, 1928.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Burwood -\n\nI beg to attach hereto an extract from Inspector Parker's report of the 3rd June with reference to the dangerous condition of the concrete wall at the back of the Indian school at Pierreville. Following this report Mr. Chene, Departmental Engineer, made an examination of the premises and obtained estimates from two different parties as to the cost of the repairs which appeared to be required. One estimate of the various repairs was $2,885.00 and the other $3,161.00; the Engineer considers these estimates excessive.\n\nI am enclosing copy of Mr. Chene's report of the 26th July in which he recommends that only the most urgent portions of the work be done at estimated cost of $1,500.00 - the only source of funds for this purpose would be the relief vote, and as we are now furnishing relief to the Indians of Pierreville to the extent of about $1000.00 per month, it is thought that this work might be carried out as a relief measure.\n\nThe work if undertaken, would be carried out by the Indians under the supervision of a white foreman. I should be glad to have the Minister's instructions as to whether we should proceed with this work, and as to who might be placed in charge.\n\nSome material will be required in connection with this work, such as drain pipes, cement and lumber for forms, and I should be glad to know with whom such an order might be placed.\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.S.

It was considered advisable, therefore, to ask the teachers, through the Superior, not to allow anyone in the building until further instructions had been given by the Department.\n\nIn view of these facts I would suggest that Mr. Chene be requested to proceed to Odanak next week, upon his visit to Saguenay, to examine the situation and advise the Department as to what should be done for the protection of the building. I would also ask that this officer be allowed to instruct the School authorities to temporarily close the School should he find that the conditions warrant this action, and until he has had time to furnish the Department with a report on his investigation.\n\nShould these suggestions meet with your approval I will confirm the instructions already given.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.S.

Consequently I beg you to give me the work in preference to the Canadian. Because I have good horses and wagons to do all the work on the reserve and that so as to be able to live and to help me.\n\nAnother favour which I also want to ask you, is, that if the contract is given to the Canadian who is mentioned for the work, that the laborers be hired from the Abenakis who are in greater need. The white people in work elsewhere without causing us much trouble in our great distress, this the Department knows as well as we do. Consequently I beg you to grant us that work to live.

Murphy, by Eddie Roberts, an Indian of Odanak on the Abenakis Reserve, offering his services in connection with the reconstruction of the wall along the school property at Odanak, which has lately been partly demolished.\n\nI would ask you to kindly advise the above mentioned Abenakis Indian that it is not the intention of the Department to reconstruct the above mentioned portion of the wall, and that if any repairing is undertaken for the drainage and improvement of the school property the Indians of Odanak will be given the preference whenever possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nBenj. Maurault, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPierreville, Que.\nMemorandum\n\nDr. McGill.\n\nIn accordance with your approval on Mr. Sutherland's memorandum of the 22nd ultimo, hereunder, I made on the 25th of April an inspection of the concrete retaining wall along the shore of the St. Francis River, in front of the School property at Odanak, which has been partly demolished, and I beg to give you the following information as to its present condition.\n\nThe portion of the wall which has been completely over-turned and washed down into the river is 34 feet long, starting from its west end. The earth filling, which had been placed behind this part of the wall for the grading of the embankment also slipped away covering the wall underneath the water. There is still a length of 26 feet of wall next to that demolished that is partly over-turned, and will have to be torn down owing to its dangerous condition. The rest of the wall, a length of 68 feet, which is the portion opposite the school building, is still in its original position and appears to be firmly secured in place, which means that it will continue to serve the purpose for which it was erected.\n\nFrom observations made while on the ground it seems to me that the main cause of the damages above mentioned are due to the fact that the foundation or concrete base has been gradually undermined by underground springs which run between a layer of marine sand forming the top of the embankment and a bed of clay underneath. The surface water running down the embankment from the school property, which is exceptionally great at certain periods of the year, also contributed to the undermining of the foundation of the wall. I would strongly recommend that the following works be authorized as early as possible, in order to ensure proper drainage of the school lot, protection of the remaining portion of the wall, and the improvement and grading of the embankment where the land slide occurred.\n\nDRAINAGE OF SCHOOL LOT.\n\nConstruction of gulley on the south side of Notre Dame road in line with the road leading to the school, this gulley to be connected to the main sewer pipe on the main road.\nConstruction of two gullies at low points in the school grounds to be connected to a main drain pipe placed along the east side of the school lot, as far as the bottom of the embankment or river shore.\n\nErection of a small concrete curb between the laundry building and the fence of the school lot on the east side to prevent water from running down the embankment after heavy storms or in the spring season.\n\nPlacing of 4\" eave troughing in the rear of laundry building with connection to the above mentioned drain pipe.\n\nPROTECTION OF EXISTING WALL.\n\nDemolishing portion of wall partly over-turned.\n\nConstruction of two reinforced concrete buttresses one on the east end corner and one at the centre.\n\nFilling of cavities which have been formed by erosion of the embankment behind the retaining wall, also grading of portion of embankment where the wall has been demolished, so as to give it a regular slope.\n\nPlacing of layer of large boulders at the base of embankment on top of the clay bed where the above mentioned grading is to be done, and the sowing of entire embankment with grass seed.\n\nErection of a fence at top of the embankment between laundry building and the eastern boundary of the lot as protection to the school children.\n\nThe above mentioned work will cost about $1,800 and could be carried out by day labour under the supervision of a white foreman as a relief measure to the Indians of Odanak, who are mostly all receiving assistance from the Department. If this meets with your approval, I would ask to be furnished with the name of a white foreman, in order that the work may be proceeded with as soon as ground conditions will permit.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nMay 13, 1935.\n\nMemorandum\n\nMr. Bushard,\n\nI beg to refer you to my memorandum of the end of November, 1935, accompanied by a report from the Departmental Engineer, with regard to the proposed work for the protection of the school property at Pierreville.\n\nAs it is important that this work be proceeded with as early as possible, I should like to be advised of the name of a person who may be employed as foreman to supervise the work in question.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMay 19th, 1933.\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nRe your memorandum of the 13th instant, your file No. 23-2-9, concerning protection work for the school property at Pierreville, Quebec, I understand Engineer Chene now has no objection to the employment of Mr. Desrochers as foreman on this work.

Working hours are to be from eight until five P.M.\n\nKindly advise me also as to when the work shall be started and the wages which are to be paid for Indian labour.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nBenj.

Moutault, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPierreville, N.B.\nPierreville June 17th 33\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of June 8th No. 23-2-9 I beg to say that Mr. Chas. Ed. Desrochers is ready to take charge of the work to be done to the school property at Edward, at the conditions asked by the Dept.\n\nWe will, as much as possible take Indian labour and will pay $1.27\u00bd an hour.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nJune 26, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to request that you arrange immediately to have the improvements shown on the accompanying list carried out in the school lot at Omaak, the work to be performed by Indian labour as much as possible, under the supervision of Mr. Charles Desrochers, who has consented to supervise the work as foreman, and in accordance with the instructions already given to him when the Departmental Engineer last visited the school building.\n\nThe rate of wages to be paid Mr. Desrochers is 40 cents per hour, in compliance with the regulations of the Department of Labour. The rate to be paid contractors and labourers is to be similar to those prevailing in the adjoining town of Pierrerville, less a deduction of 10%, which should apply also to the wages of the foreman. This 10% reduction is required by the Regulations issued by the Treasury Board regarding the Salary Reduction Act for 1935.\n\nIt is desired that you make frequent visits to the work and see that it is carried out as economically as possible, as the funds available are very limited. The work should be carried out in the order outlined in the list attached.\n\nThe amount available, namely $1,000, should not be over expended under any circumstances. I am enclosing herewith R.R. 875, which is your authority for this work, and it will be necessary for you to indicate this number on all pay lists, vouchers, accounts, etc., when submitting same to the Department.\n\nAn advance of $500.00 is being sent you under separate cover which should be used exclusively for the paying of wages. It is to be distinctly understood that the families of Indians employed on this work are not to receive any relief.\n\nCare should be taken in the purchase of material to see that the purchases are made at the lowest possible price. The accounts should be carefully checked, and verified and certified to by you before submitting same for payment.\nIt is also desired that the work be carried out as expeditiously as possible, and I would ask you to see that all the Indians who are willing to work are given an equal share of employment.\n\nKindly acknowledge receipt of this letter, and oblige,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nB. Maurault, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPierreville, Que.\nPROJECTS TO BE CARRIED OUT ON ABEBAKIS SCHOOL PROPERTY.\n\n1. The length of concrete wall, namely 24 feet, which is partly overturned shall be torn down with all possible care in order to avoid accidents and sliding of the earth behind it.\n\n2. Filling of the cavities which have been formed by erosion of the embankment behind the retaining wall, also grading of portion of embankment where the wall has been demolished so as to give it a regular and natural slope.\n\n3. Erection of a wire fence at the top of the embankment in line with the laundry building and the east boundary of the lot. This fence to be similar to that around the school property.\n\n4. Construction of two gullies at the lowest points in the school yard to be connected to the main drain pipe which will be placed along the east side of the school lot and continued downward as far as the bottom of the embankment leading to the river shore. The gullies are to be made of 18\" vitrified or cement pipes provided with standard cast iron perforated grates or covers, adjusted on concrete base, with a wide cement border all around, built in such a manner as to prevent the admission of earth, etc.\n\nConnection pipe from the gullies to the main drain is to be made of 9\" vitrified drain pipe, which should connect to the gully at least 18\" above the bottom to provide for its cleaning from time to time.\n\nThe main drain pipe above mentioned from the yard to the river, on a length of about 125 feet to be made of 18\" vitrified sewer pipe with necessary T-connections for the gullies. This main pipe should be given an adequate slope in order to ensure easy drainage of the water from the gullies to its outlet.\n\nA manhole should be constructed where the main drain pipe begins in the school yard made of concrete with cast iron or steel cover. The portion of this main drain down the embankment to the river shore on a length of about 100 feet should be made of 18\" corrugated steel pipe instead of the vitrified clay pipe, all of which should be well secured together and to the bottom of the trench. A concrete box shall be placed where these two different kinds of pipe converge together.\n5. Erection of small concrete curb between the laundry building and the fence of the school lot on the east side to prevent water from running down the embankment after heavy storms, or in the spring season. This curb to be 9 inches thick and about three feet high.\n\n6. Placing of 4\" galv. iron sewer-troughing in the rear of the laundry building, with connection to empty into one of the existing gullies.\n\n7. Construction of reinforced concrete buttress on the east end corner of the reinforced concrete retaining wall similar to the existing one.\n\n8. Repairing of the drain pipe from the roof of the building.\nI would ask you, therefore, to convey this information to the Mayor of Ste Lucie for the information of his Council.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nFr. Brisebois, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, que.\nJune 30, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to my letter of the 26th instant, authorising some repairs to the school property at Odanak, under the supervision of Mr. Chas. Desrochers, I beg to advise that the work outlined in item No. 7 for the construction of the reinforced concrete buttress on the east end corner of the reinforced concrete wall should not be started until the other work has been completed.\n\nKindly furnish me with a brief report as to the nature and amount of work carried out upon submitting the weekly return of labour forms.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Seal]\n\nF.
