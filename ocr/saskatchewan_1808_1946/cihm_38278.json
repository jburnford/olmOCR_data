BALDWIN\nPRESIDENT OF THE STATE NORMAL SCHOOL, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI.\n\nCANADIAN EDITION\n\nAdapted for use in the Schools and Homes of Canada\n\nBY\n\nR. DAWSON, B.A., T.C.D.,\nHEAD MASTER, HIGH SCHOOL, WESTON.\n\nSECOND EDITION\n\nTORONTO:\nWARWICK & SONS.\n1887.\nPREFACE.\n\nBaldwin's Art of School Management has been well and favourably known to the teaching profession in Canada ever since its first appearance, and the subject very properly has formed, and still forms, an essential part of the professional examination of candidates for certificates of qualification as teachers in the Province of Ontario. It has been found, however, that the book, in its original form, contains some things that are not so well suited to the wants of Canadian Schools and Teachers as they are to those of the neighbouring republic, and others that are not exactly in harmony with the School Law and Regulations of Ontario. The present edition has been prepared specially to meet these reasonable objections, and thus to render the book suitable in every way for use in the schools and homes of Canada. It is not a compendium of the original work, nor is it merely an abbreviated edition, made by the rejection of what appeared to be superfluous. Many of the sections have been entirely recast, especially in the earlier and more important portions of the work; and among these early chapters have been interpolated many of the ideas and suggestions scattered more or less through the later chapters of the work. A good deal of space has been gained by avoiding unnecessary repetitions, and by excluding a large amount of speculation on topics interesting enough in themselves, but bearing no direct reference to the subject of School Management. By thus relieving the teacher from the drudgery of mastering irrelevant subjects, by rearranging the important principles so as to exhibit their harmony with Canadian Laws and customs, and by carefully elaborating the Topical Reviews of all the chapters, the editor trusts that he has at least partially succeeded in making the Art of School Management easier and more interesting to his fellow-teachers in Canada than it was in its original form.\n\nThough it has been deemed advisable to harmonize the text as closely as the subject would permit with the School Laws of the province, it has not been considered necessary in any case to limit\nthe suggestions and recommendations for the management of schools to the compulsory requirements of the Law. These suggestions would in several things, no doubt, impose upon the teacher a heavier task than he is now required to perform; but though he is sometimes recommended to go further than the law, the book does not now contain any rule or recommendation at all contrary to the law, as it exists in Ontario. Wherever such recommendations have been found in the original text care has been taken to alter or expunge them. As an example of what is meant by going further than the law but not contrary to it, may be instanced the suggestions as to the Opening Exercises (Part II., Cap. IV., p. 68) where singing and the reverential reading of a suitable portion of Scripture are recommended in addition to the form of opening provided by the Regulations; here the recommendation goes beyond the legal requirement, but is very far from being contrary to it. Other instances will be readily detected by the reader.\n\nAn error, perhaps a little more than a clerical one, occurs in giving the number of cubic feet of air space for each pupil (Part I., Cap. II., p. 23); it should be 250 instead of 150, but, as the page was already printed before the detection of the error, I take the present opportunity of correcting it. In connection with the whole subject of school buildings and the health of the children at school, much useful information will be found in the pages of Dr. Hodgins' \"School Architecture and Hygiene,\" which contains all that is necessary on the subject of school-buildings, playgrounds, etc., in relation to the physical training of children; while Mr. Houghton's work on \"Physical Culture\" contains an admirable series of exercises for the systematic training of children in the playground. These works were not in my hands when preparing the sections referring to the subjects of which they specifically treat; otherwise, these chapters would have been more interesting and elaborate.\n\nThe addition of the Appendices containing the portions of the School Law and Regulations required of candidates for teachers' certificates will be appreciated by those careful students who desire to compare the requirements of our own Laws with the general principles of school government on which those Laws are based.\n\nR.

School Management Defined.\u2014School Management is the art of so directing school affairs as to produce System and Order, and thus to secure Efficiency. This art is sometimes called school economy, school discipline, or school government; but such titles are far too narrow, for School Management not only includes these subjects, but embraces, besides, all that pertains directly or indirectly to the successful education of children. Hence it has to deal with all the machinery of education as well as with the pupils to be educated, with the school-house and its surroundings, the furniture and equipment of the class-rooms, the subjects of study and the best means of studying, the rules of the school and the laws on which they are based, the relations of the teacher to his pupils, to his trustees, to the community, and to himself.\n\nII. The Art is based on the Science of Education.\u2014All true education is self-education, and the best method of education is that which guides, controls, and assists the unconscious process of self-education that begins with the infant in its cradle; so, too, the ideal method of school management is that which judiciously develops the power of self-government inherent in the child, and thus makes the pupil himself the unconscious instrument of his own self-control.\nIII. Essential to Success.\u2014School management is an essential part of the teacher's preparation for his duties. Without it there can be no order, and without order education is impossible. No matter how learned the teacher may be in the subjects to be taught, no matter how painstaking, conscientious, and zealous he may be in the discharge of his duties, yet if he does not possess the art of wisely adjusting the educational forces at his disposal nine-tenths of his labour will have been in vain. And not only will the pupils fail to acquire mere book-learning at the hands of such a teacher, they will miss the equally important education in the habit of self-control which ought to be one of the chief objects aimed at by every member of the profession. We send our children to school not merely that they may learn a certain modicum of facts, but that their latent powers and dormant faculties may be called forth, and that they may be so strengthened in the practice of habits of self-government and self-control as to be enabled afterwards worthily to take their proper positions in the world as the free citizens of a free community.\n\nIV. Successful Teachers.\u2014School Management demands ability and skill, and offers a wide field for the exercise of Originality, Independence, and Individuality. To organize educational forces and instrumentalities aright requires as much generalship and executive ability as to command armies or govern states. The time has come when we demand that our teachers shall be possessed of ability, culture, and experience; and no one need hope to succeed in the exercise of this profession who does not possess these requisites in at least a moderate degree. Exceptional facilities are now provided for the education of our teachers, and the chief aim of the present work is to assist the young teacher in acquiring that experience in the art of school management so necessary to success. It is not given to all to be equally successful as teachers, nor can any general method be laid down which would serve as a model for the guidance of every teacher. The utmost that can be done is to lay down a few broad, general principles, by the light of which each may be assisted in developing his own method, and in stamping his own individuality on the pupils for whose welfare he is responsible. But though all cannot be equally successful, all can succeed, if nature has endowed them with a love of children and a wish to make them succeed. Make yourself successful by endowing yourself with the qualities necessary for success; and then you may be sure that you will succeed in the art of school management.\n\nV. Methods of Teaching.\u2014We attempt to show what methods have been tried and results obtained by various teachers. We desire to encourage the use of systematic methods, and the individual teacher raised above the level of that which he might have sought to reach whether by the advance made by those who have acquired a better method, or by the fulfillment of a need arisen from his own observation of slight deficiencies in conditions and methods set up by others. We believe the methods of individual teachers are the most effective in dealing with his school, and that he had succeeded in making the ordinary methods generally used\nmake them happy and to do them good. This is the key to the successful practice of the teacher's art, and without this natural endowment no one can ever become a truly successful teacher; but if you feel that you have indeed this divine attribute of sympathy, you may rely on it that you possess the essential elements of success; and you may confidently enter the noblest of all professions in the full assurance that Faith and Feeling will enable you to conquer all your difficulties.\n\nV. Objection to Methods.\u2014It is frequently urged that attempts to systematise methods of instruction, or even to introduce method at all into the teacher's work, can only be productive of bad results. Such phrases as \"Cast-iron methods,\" \"Machine-made teachers,\" and the like, are glibly uttered, and we are assured that to encourage members of the scholastic profession to follow any system is the sure way to emasculate the intelligence and annihilate the individuality of the teacher. These objections are most frequently raised either by outsiders who know nothing whatever, practically, of that whereof they speak, and who will be found generally to have some sinister object in view, some ulterior purpose to serve, whether it be social, political, economical, or what not; or they are advanced by some of the old-fogy members of the profession, either by those who, having never had a method, are naturally averse to acquiring one, or by those who, being urged to exchange a vicious method of their own for a better one, find it easier to decry the usefulness of systems in toto than to acknowledge that their errors have arisen from a too fond attachment to the misshapen bantlings of their own creation. But whatever may be the causes of them, a very slight consideration of the subject shows not only that such objections are without weight, but that they have been long since given up by the best educators of our time. What would be thought of the man who would seriously propose as an axiom that the individuality of a general would be destroyed by a minute knowledge of the method of drill?\u2014that a physician would be unable to cope with disease because he had made himself acquainted with the system of his school of medicine?\u2014that the artist would cease to be original who had studied the principles of perspective, and become familiar with the optical theory of colour? It is undeniable that the most skilful generals have always been those who had familiarised themselves with\nsystems of tactics, and had learned all the details of a soldier's duty. The best and most original physicians, painters, engineers, and others have been those who have most carefully methodized their knowledge of the principles that form the foundations of their several professions; and so it is in the teacher's profession\u2014the best and most original teachers will be found to be those who have some well-considered system, or method, of government, and are able therefore to seize on any and every opportunity of stamping their own individuality on the school, and of developing such marks of originality as they may observe in their pupils. It is not well for the teacher to follow even the best system too slavishly and blindly in all its details, but it would be better for him to do even that than to have no system at all to follow.\n\nVI. The Plan of the Work.\u2014In the following pages it will be the aim of the Editor to present the subject in a plain, clear, conversational style; no effort shall be made at fine writing; nor shall anything be introduced that does not appear to be of special value to the teachers of Ontario. It is intended that the Book shall be useful;\n\n(a) as a Class-book for teachers in training at the Model Schools,\n(b) as a Text-book for discussion at Teachers' Institutes,\n(c) as a Manual for the teacher's guidance in the school-room,\n(d) as a Reference-book for trustees, parents, and other friends of education.\n\nSeveral topics that usually find their way into works on school management have been omitted in this edition, not because of any desire or intention to ignore their importance, but because they do not appear to come fairly within the scope of a work specially intended to meet the wants of the teachers of Ontario.\nPART I.\n\nEDUCATIONAL INSTRUMENTALITIES.\n\nCHAPTER I.\u2014School Grounds.\n\nII.\u2014School Buildings.\n\nIII.\u2014School Apparatus.\n\nIV.\u2014School Text-Books.\n\nV.\u2014School Hygiene.\nPART I.\n\nEDUCATIONAL INSTRUMENTALITIES.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nSCHOOL GROUNDS.\n\nSchool Grounds neglected in Rural Sections.\u2014In our cities and towns very many of the school grounds are laid down with considerable taste, and with due regard to the objects for which school grounds are intended; but in far too many of our rural sections, notwithstanding the cheapness and abundance of land, and the consequent facilities at the disposal of the school officers for securing desirable accommodation, so little attention has been paid to this matter that the school grounds may without any exaggeration be described as a disgrace to the community. That such a state of things should exist in the very earliest days of the infancy of civilization in a new country might naturally be expected, and ought at least to be tolerated if not condoned. But it is simply intolerable that any school should now exist in this country without being fully provided with the necessary accommodation in the way of school grounds.\n\nIn many sections, on the other hand, the people take a most commendable pride in their school and its surroundings, and the very fact that so many of our rural schools are situated in spacious, beautiful, and commodious grounds ought to be an incentive to those who have heretofore paid but little attention to the subject. What is possible in relation to this matter in one section is possible in all,\nand it is earnestly to be hoped that the day is not far distant when the schools and school grounds of Ontario shall be quoted as models for imitation by the inhabitants of other countries.\n\nWhether it be true or not that \"the school-building with its surroundings represents the average culture of the community,\" it is beyond question that communities are to a large extent judged by the mere appearance of their churches and their schools. And it is right that it should be so. Men have long since learned that they cannot afford to neglect the surroundings of their churches and chapels if they wish to maintain a character for self-respect; and just as little can they afford to neglect the school-grounds of their section, if they desire to secure the reputation of being affectionately anxious for the welfare, the comfort, and the happiness of their children.\n\nI. LOCATION OF GROUNDS.\u2014In selecting a site for the school house and grounds, particular attention should be paid to the following points. The grounds should be:\n\n1. Accessible and Central.\u2014The site must be accessible; and, other things being equal, that site should be chosen which is most easily reached by the largest number of the pupils. Consequently the centre of population, present and prospective, should be chosen rather than the mere geographical centre.\n\n2. Commodious and Suitable.\u2014Commodious school-grounds, adapted to educational ends, pay large dividends. Cities expend vast sums to secure large school-yards. Many of our towns and villages set apart from two to ten acres for school purposes. In the rural sections, not less than from two to five acres should be consecrated to child-culture. To restrict a country school to half an acre is a mistake and a misfortune.\n\n3. Healthful and Beautiful.\u2014Science has shed such a flood of light on sanitary measures that nothing short of inexcusable stupidity or obstinacy can explain the selection of an unhealthy site for a school-building. The healthfulness, and therefore, to a very large extent, the success of the school depends\n\n(a) on the nature of the soil;\n(b) on the elevation;\n(c) on the drainage;\n(d) on remoteness from marshy ground and stagnant water.\nThe soil should be dry and good; a sandy loam and a southern slope are in every way desirable. The elevation should be such as to secure pure, fresh air in unlimited quantity. The drainage should be carefully attended to; particular care must be taken to guard against the possibility of sewage or any other impurity finding its way to the pump or well. The vicinity of marshy ground or stagnant water should be rigidly eschewed; the malarial effluvia and the noxious insects engendered in such places very seriously impair the health no less than the comfort of the teachers and pupils.\n\nThough health must be the primary consideration, beauty of location should by no means be overlooked, and in general it will be found that beautiful surroundings, in which parents and pupils can alike take pleasure, will prove to be at the same time conducive to health.\n\nII. PLAN OF GROUNDS.\n\n1. Each Section should have its own Plan.\u2014Given plans are suggestive, but are never to be copied too closely. Individuality and originality should characterize the educational nurseries of the race. Here is an excellent field for invention and taste. The school-building and grounds should represent the highest culture of the neighbourhood; and all concerned should vie in their efforts to render the surroundings of the school, as well as the school itself, beautiful and attractive. The very best results may be obtained by taking advantage of such natural beauties as the ground itself affords, adapting the details of the plan to harmonize with the features of the locality rather than attempting to force nature into an unwilling conformity with some unsuitable model.\n\n2. Grass and Flower Plots should decorate all school grounds, however small. In no other way can so much be done at so little cost to foster aesthetic culture. These plots should be largely in front of the building, if the grounds will permit, and should be so arranged as to be easily kept in order. The care of them should be entrusted to the pupils, under the supervision of the teacher, and should form no part of the duties of the regular caretaker of the school.\n\n3. The Location of the Well is a troublesome thing in some sections. It looks well to place it in front of the building in a neat rustic arbor. Between the building and the walks to the well,\nflower-plots may be arranged. Two wells, one in the private play-\ngrounds for the girls, the other in the boys' private play-grounds,\ngive the best satisfaction.\n\n4. The Play-grounds are primary in the plan. In front of\nthe building and the evergreen hedges are the common play-grounds.\nHere the boys and girls freely intermingle. Here, under the eye\nof the teacher, refinement and social culture receive special attention.\nOn one side and in the rear of the building are private play-grounds\nfor the girls, and on the other side are the boys' private grounds.\nPlay-grounds should be supplied with such instruments and incen-\ntives as tend to cultivate gracefulness and give the fullest physical\ndevelopment. In the education of children, play is an important\nfactor. When we learn to lead children through play to work, we\nshall revolutionise our school processes, and make childhood truly\nthe happy seed-time of life.\n\n5. The Gymnasium need seldom be a much more elaborate\naffair than can be provided and maintained by the pupils, under the\ndirection of the teacher. Indian clubs and dumb-bells, horizontal\nand parallel bars, and good swings (not too high) for the little ones\nof both sexes can be procured at very little trouble or expense.\nThese last, especially, should be found in every play-ground. They\nare not only a constant pleasure to the children, but the necessity\nof waiting for their turn tends to form and strengthen habits of\nunselfishness and self-control.\n\n6. Trees. Forest-trees, such as the walnut, the elm, the\nmaple, should be interspersed with ever-greens; nor does there\nseem to be any valid reason why fruit-trees also should not be in-\ntroduced. The trees may be planted singly or in groups\u2014rarely in\nrows\u2014and must be arranged with reference to the play-grounds. For\nbeauty and comfort, the tree deserves a prominent place in all\nschool grounds. The bare, shadeless, shapeless grounds so often seen,\nare a burning shame and an inexcusable disgrace to the community.\n\nIII. IMPROVING AND PRESERVING THE\nSCHOOL GROUNDS.\u2014Every school officer, every parent,\nand every child should feel a peculiar interest in beautifying and\npreserving the grounds and the building.\n\n1. The Teacher is the natural Leader in this as in all\neducational work. He consults, plans, and directs. He enlists\npupils and patrons. He studies the plans of his predecessors, modifies, and perfects them. Here we find one of the many reasons for retaining the same teacher for a series of years.\n\n2. Each child is a Protector as well as a Constructor.\n\u2014The work should, as far as possible, be done by the pupils. Each one should be trained to protect every shrub and flower. Thus our Canadian youth may be educated to respect public property and public grounds. The vandalism that begins with cutting and marring the school desks and destroying the school shrubbery may thus in time be overcome. Children take a natural delight in cultivating and fostering the growth of what they have themselves assisted to plant; and the habit of protecting property, thus formed in childhood, will not be likely to die in the after years.\n\n3. The institution of Arbor-day in the schools of Ontario has already done something, and may reasonably be expected to do much more in the future, towards the ornamenting and beautifying of school grounds.\n\nIV. ADVANTAGES OF SUITABLE SCHOOL GROUNDS.\n\n1. Invigorating and healthful exercises are encouraged, tending to the development of better physical conditions.\n\n2. Quietness in the school-room results from the vigorous exercise in the play-ground, where the natural restlessness of the children finds its natural vent.\n\n3. Better results in study are attained in consequence of the improved physical conditions obtained in the play-ground.\n\n4. The cultivation of taste and refinement is fostered at an age when the pupils are most susceptible.\n\n5. The glad memory of the joys of childhood sweetens all the after life; and far from the least of these joys are the pleasure and happiness they may so cheaply receive in decorating and protecting beautiful school grounds.\nTopical Review.\u2014School Grounds.\n\nThe school grounds should be:\n\n1. Central and accessible.\n2. Commodious and suitable.\n3. Healthful and beautiful.\n\nPlan of school grounds:\n\n1. Each school should have its own plan.\n2. Grass and flower-plots.\n3. Location of well.\n4. Arrangement of the play-grounds.\n5. The gymnasium.\n6. Shade-trees and shrubbery.\n\nBeautifying and preserving school grounds:\n\n1. The teacher the natural leader.\n2. Each child constructs and protects.\n3. Aesthetic, intellectual, and physical culture, and glad memory the rewards.\n\nA Method of Conducting Professional Classes.\n\n1. Subject assigned\u2014School grounds: the members of the class will study the lesson as here presented, or as presented in some other work.\n2. With the plot of the school grounds drawn on the board, the topics presented in the chapter will be briefly discussed by the members of the class.\n3. The instructor, with his own plan on the board, briefly discusses the subject.\n4. A short time is devoted to criticisms, questions, and suggestions by the class.\n5. For the next recitation, each member of the class will prepare an original plot of school grounds, and also a short essay on the subject.\n6. At that time the lesson of the day previous will be reviewed, and as many of the essays will be read and criticised as the time will permit.\n7. The essays and plots will now be exchanged. The members of the class will examine and grade each other's papers. At the next recitation, as the roll is called, these grades will be reported and recorded. In small classes the instructor can examine all the papers.\n\nRemarks.\u2014By pursuing the above plan, very satisfactory results have been secured in the institute and normal school work. The professional instruction is thus made as interesting, as systematic, and as thorough as that in any of the sciences.\n\nIt has been found necessary, however, to vary the plan to suit the subject and the circumstances. It is due to say that other instructors, using widely different methods, have secured equally satisfactory results. Here or elsewhere, there can be no stereotyped methods of teaching.\nCHAPTER II.\n\nSCHOOL-BUILDINGS.\n\nI. HISTORY OF SCHOOL ARCHITECTURE.\u2014The nineteenth century is pre-eminently the age of progress, and in all our great centres of population the progress that has been made in school architecture has pretty fairly kept pace with that in other things. Vast, indeed, is the difference between the stately, well-equipped schools of our cities to-day and the old log school-house of the past, with its huge open fireplace, its puncheon floor, its clapboard roof, its old slab seats, and its general air of ugliness, discomfort, and neglect. Nor has the progressive spirit of the age failed to exert its benign influence, here and there, on the old seven-by-nine rural school of the last generation. Some of the country schools erected within the past few years are models of comfort, and reflect the highest credit on the enlightened trustees under whose auspices they have been erected. But these are, unhappily, the rare exceptions to a rule that is far too general. In many of our counties, the rural school is still comparatively a rude structure; unsightly, uncomfortable, and unhealthy; poorly lighted, poorly heated, poorly ventilated, and poorly adapted to school work. The resulting injury cannot be estimated in dollars and cents; thousands and tens of thousands of youth suffer a loss that cannot be repaired. The stern necessities of an infant community are the sole excuse we can offer for the existence of such eye-sores in the past; but the spirit that keeps them standing now is not only the falsest of false economy, but it is utterly at variance with the genius of the age. The earnest demand of the most enlightened of our people is for better school accommodation for our children, and it may be looked upon as absolutely certain that the next quarter of a century will witness the erection of new school buildings, to meet the requirements of a fast increasing population, in nearly every rural section in the province. It will be the duty, as it ought to be the pleasure, of every trustee and school officer to see that these structures shall be the best possible of their kind.\n\n[21]\nII. SCHOOL ARCHITECTS AND PLANS FOR SCHOOL-BUILDINGS.\u2014In the erection of school-buildings it will prove a wise economy to consult a competent architect, and to be guided by his advice. Only those who have made a profound study of school economy are prepared to plan school-buildings. In this age of specialists no trustee is expected to know how to draw the plans and specifications for a school-house and its surroundings, nor is it the least disgrace to him not to know anything whatever about it; it is not his business, and he will show his wisdom and his fitness for office by referring all such subjects to some upright school architect who has made this special study the business of his life. The cost will be but a trifle, and will be repaid a hundredfold in the increased blessings it will bring to generations yet unborn. Where immortal minds, the minds of our precious children are concerned, the best is ever the cheapest.\n\nFollow the Plan.\u2014The school officers have here an honourable field for the exercise of their zeal and watchfulness. The plans and specifications furnished by the architect are the result of long years of thought and patient study; they have been drawn up with special reference to school work, and any change may mar all. It is safe to follow skilled counsel, and the trustees should insist on having it followed implicitly.\n\nIII. BEAUTY AS WELL AS UTILITY.\u2014In the school-building utility and beauty should be combined. Everywhere nature teaches this lesson. \"Thousands for utility, but not a dollar for beauty,\" is not a fit motto for civilised communities; it is beneath the intelligence of the savage.\n\n1. The Cost.\u2014Beauty adds but little to the cost. It is an affair of proportions, of form, of adaptation, of colour. The style of school architecture should be simple and chaste. Nothing gaudy or extravagant is permissible.\n\n2. Beauty Pays.\u2014That \"a thing of beauty is a joy for ever,\" is nowhere truer than here. \"What a beautiful school-house!\" This emotion welling up in the heart and finding utterance on the lips of every child, of every parent, and of every passing stranger, is a perpetual joy. Such a building exercises a most potent influence on the character and conduct of children, alluring them by its silent\ngrace to a desire to prove worthy of their beautiful surroundings; it cultivates the taste of the entire community; it delights, it elevates, it pays.\n\nIV. SIZE AND PROPORTIONS OF SCHOOL-BUILDINGS.\u2014In general, a school-building should be commodious. As a minimum, 12 square feet of floor-space and 150 cubic feet of air-space should be provided for each pupil. The height of the ceiling should be from 12 to 14 feet. A room 26 x 28 x 13 feet will give nearly 150 feet of space to each of 64 pupils. When the number of pupils exceeds 50, another room should be added, and an additional room for each increase of 50. Commodious school-rooms give pure air and working space. Small, low, over-crowded school-rooms show wretched economy. A few paltry dollars must not be weighed against the comfort, the health, and the lives of our children.\n\nV. HEATING AND VENTILATING SCHOOL-BUILDINGS.\u2014Nothing connected with school architecture is more difficult or more important. How often pupils are called stupid and punished, simply because they are compelled to breathe impure air! It is frightful to contemplate the suffering and death resulting from the lack of proper appliances for heating and ventilating school-buildings. But a brighter era dawns. Inventive genius has given us the means by which almost perfect heating and ventilation may be secured; and the cost is lessened rather than augmented by these improvements.\n\n1. Ventilating Stoves.\u2014Where these admirable stoves are in use, pure air from without is constantly heated and thrown into the room. Like the old open fireplace, the stove also radiates heat and carries off impure air. All parts of the room are nearly equally heated, and the supply of pure air is steadily maintained.\n\n2. Ventilating Platform and Flues\u2014A platform, three feet wide and six inches high, passes around the two sides and back end of the room. The end platform has an open base. The platform thus constitutes a horizontal flue, leading to ventilating flues behind the stoves. The pipes from the stoves pass up through these brick flues, thus creating a strong and constant draft. What could be more simple? Yet by this arrangement we secure pure air of about the same temperature in all parts of the room. No better contriv-\n3. Window Ventilation.\u2014Fit a board, eight inches wide, on the inside and bottom of each window. See that the board fits perfectly. Raise the lower sash about eight inches. Where the lower sash overlaps the upper, a current of pure air will enter, ascending in a curve to the ceiling, thus obviating the direct drafts that are so dangerous from windows raised or lowered in the usual way. During mild weather the school-room may be ventilated by lowering the top sash and raising the bottom one. Both sashes should be hung with weights.\n\n4. Temperature.\u2014The temperature of the air in the school-room should be maintained at as uniform a degree as possible. Each room should be furnished with a thermometer and one of the pupils may be entrusted with the duty of regulating the temperature, which can be done without difficulty where ventilating stoves are used. A uniform temperature of about $67^\\circ$ F., in winter, will prove conducive to health and comfort, and consequently to steady work and satisfactory progress.\n\n5. Location of Stoves.\u2014Two small stoves will generally heat a room better than one large one. They should be placed in corners, and not standing out in the room, where they are decidedly out of place.\n\nVI. LIGHT.\u2014The steadiest and best light is that which is admitted by windows with a northern aspect. The pupils should never be seated facing the windows, unless there is a considerable distance between these and the desks; nor should the room be lighted from opposite sides. All the windows ought to be furnished with blinds, but especially those facing south.\n\nThe importance of the proper lighting of class-rooms can scarcely be exaggerated; in the erection of school buildings, therefore, great attention should be paid to the relative location of the seats, blackboards, and windows. (The Hygienic importance of light is discussed on pp. 38-39.)\n\nVII. PORTICOES, FUEL-ROOMS, AND OUTBUILDINGS.\u2014No little importance attaches to these addenda. They cost little, but they add much to the comfort, health, efficiency, and morality of the school.\n1. Porticoes.\u2014There should be separate entrances for the boys and girls, and a small portico at each entrance. These improve the appearance of the building, serve as storm-doors in bad weather, and are in every way desirable.\n\n2. Fuel-Rooms may be built in connection with the porticoes. The door from the fuel-room opens into the portico, never directly into the school-room. In these rooms may be stored fuel sufficient for months. It is a marvellous fact that, at the close of the nineteenth century, more than half of the Boards of Trustees in the rural sections leave their fuel without shelter, to the great inconvenience of the school, and at a considerable loss in the value of the fuel.\n\n3. Privies.\u2014A tight fence, covered with vines, passes from the rear of the school to the farthest extremity of the grounds, separating the private play-grounds of the boys and girls. Separate privies, or closets, with deep vaults, must be provided for boys and girls; they should be in the rear of the building, but not too far back, and should be screened from public view either by shrubbery, or high, close fences. They should be separated by a considerable distance, as well as by their respective fences, so that it would be impossible to see or hear anything from one to the other. In common with the rest of the school buildings, they must be kept scrupulously clean and free from pencillings or other marks; and the approaches should be in good order, so that they may be reached without inconvenience in any weather.\n\nVIII. LIBRARY AND APPARATUS ROOM AND CLOAK ROOM.\u2014Only teachers fully realize the value and necessity of these rooms.\n\n1. Library and Apparatus Room.\u2014This room should be immediately in the rear of the teacher's platform. With such a room, a library, a cabinet, and the necessary apparatus can and will be speedily accumulated and carefully preserved.\n\n2. Cloak Rooms.\u2014Every school should be provided with cloak rooms for the boys and girls. They should be entered directly from the porticoes, and need not be larger than 8 x 8 feet. One side of each room should have four tiers of boxes, 12 inches deep and 8 inches high; the other sides should be provided with hooks or pegs. The boxes and hooks should be numbered, and one of each should\nbe assigned to each of the pupils, who should have numbers to correspond. A place for everything is one of the indispensable conditions of order. In the near future we shall no more think of having school-houses without apparatus and cloak-rooms than without windows and seats.\n\nIX. DESKS AND SEATS.\u2014Competition and science have given us seats and desks almost faultless. It is economy to procure the best. School-desks with movable lids and seats are decidedly preferable. The desks must vary in height and proportions to suit the different pupils. The teacher's desk should be a model of beauty and utility.\n\nEvery school-room should also be supplied with at least three chairs\u2014one for the use of the teacher, and at least two for the accommodation of occasional visitors. (The subject is fully treated on pp. 37-38.\n\nX. PICTURES AND FLOWERS IN THE SCHOOL ROOM.\u2014It is an easy matter to cultivate the aesthetic part of man's nature. A vase or two of flowers on brackets or on the teacher's desk, and a few pictures to break up the dreary monotony of bare walls, address themselves to the vision, and produce impressions that work upon the thoughts and the sympathies. They arouse purer feelings and lead the mind to higher thoughts, enabling the pupil to appreciate the highest and most refined pleasures.\n\nXI. COST OF BUILDING AND APPURTEANCES.\u2014The cost of a good country school house, with such out-buildings and equipments as have been described, will vary from, say $800 to $1,500, according to material, style, and other circumstances. But even when it reaches the higher figure, it will be the best and most profitable investment that could be made with the money. Most people are glad to tax their property to secure efficient railroad service. A tax of about 5 per cent. on the property of an average school section would be sufficient to erect school buildings of which the members of the community might well feel proud, and for which their memories will be cherished by generations yet to come.\nTopical Review.\u2014The School Buildings.\n\nHistory of school architecture.\n1.

Good school-buildings pay.\nCHAPTER III.\n\nSchool Apparatus.\n\nNecessary in Elementary Public Schools.\u2014School apparatus embraces all that can be used in the school-room for purposes of illustration and explanation. It would be as reasonable to expect good work from a mechanic without the ordinary tools of his craft as to expect good results from a teacher without the ordinary apparatus of the school-room. Our High Schools are fairly well supplied with apparatus, though even in these there is still room for improvement; but in our elementary schools we find a lamentable destitution, notwithstanding the fact of its being universally admitted that it is in such schools apparatus is most needed. Concrete examples are more satisfactory than abstract theories to pupils of all grades, but in dealing with young pupils, concrete examples are absolutely necessary. All good teachers are now trained and skilled in the use of apparatus, and every school must be furnished with a fair supply if good results are to be looked for.\n\nI. THE BLACK-BOARD AND ITS APPURTE-\n\nANCES\u2014These are a necessity of every school; they are required, and they should be used, in the teaching of every subject; in fact the efficiency of a teacher might not unfairly be judged by the use he makes of his black-boards, crayons, and erasers.\n\n1. Extent.\u2014One black-board should extend across the room in rear of the teacher's desk, and there should be two others along the sides, extending at least half-way down the room. They should be not less than four feet wide, the bottom being between two and two-and-a-half feet from the floor. The walls below the blackboards should be wainscoted.\n\n2. Crayon Troughs.\u2014Each board should be furnished with a trough, or shelf, three inches wide and one deep, running along the bottom the whole length of the board. The erasers and a supply of crayons should be kept in the troughs, which are very useful, not only for this purpose, but also to catch the chalk-dust rubbed off.\nin cleaning the boards, and thus prevent its diffusion through the room and into the lungs of the pupils. The extreme ends of the troughs should be open so as to admit of their being readily brushed out as occasion requires.\n\n3. Erasers.\u2014A sufficient supply of these should be provided to furnish one to each pupil in any class that may be reciting at the board. They can be procured at a very trifling cost, or may be made by tacking pieces of sheepskin or coarse carpet-cloth on small oblong boards with edges and corners slightly rounded.\n\n4. Crayons.\u2014The common cheap crayon is the best. They can be procured from any dealer in school requisites; and trustees should never leave it in the power of a teacher to say that he could not make a proper use of his black-board for want of a sufficient supply of crayons. No expenditure for school purposes pays such an abundant profit as the small outlay required for the box of crayons. Common lump chalk should never be used; it creates clouds of dust, and is therefore unhealthy; it is clumsy and filthy, and so prevents cleanliness and neatness; and it rapidly wears out the black-boards, and is consequently expensive and extravagant.\n\n5.-Directions for Making a Black-Board.\n\n(a.) The back ground for the plaster of the black-board should be as firm and solid as possible; hollow or springy boards wear out much more rapidly than solid ones. Consequently, if the walls are brick, the plaster should be laid directly on the wall, and not on laths with a hollow space behind them, as should be the case with all other portions of the wall. In frame buildings the part to be used for black-board should be lined with good stout boards, to which the laths to hold the plaster should be firmly nailed.\n\n(b.) The plaster should be made with a large admixture of good plaster of Paris, so that when once dried and set there may be no subsequent cracking or scaling.\n\n(c.) The whole surface should be thoroughly polished with fine sand-paper before each coat of colour is laid on; at least three coats of colour should be laid on with a wide, flat varnish brush, each coat being thoroughly dried and sand-papered before the next is given.\n(d.) A good liquid colouring may be made by dissolving 4 oz. of gum shellac in a quart of 95 per cent. alcohol, allowing about twelve hours for the solution. Emery powder with enough chrome green to give the desired tint should then be stirred in till the mixture is of the consistency of thin paint, when it should be laid on with long even strokes of the brush, up and down, keeping the mixture constantly stirred all the time. Lamp-black is sometimes used instead of chrome green, but the latter is now very generally preferred.\n\n6. Use of Black-Board.\u2014The least competent and most obscure teacher now uses the board in Mathematics. The skilful teacher uses it in all recitations. In Language and Grammar the exercises are written on the board, and sentences are constructed, analysed, and parsed on the board. In Geography, maps are drawn and lessons outlined. In Reading, words are spelled and defined; inflection, emphasis, pitch, force, and quality of voice are marked. But it is needless to enumerate. The qualified teacher will no more attempt to teach without ample black-board surface than the granger will attempt to farm without a plough.\n\nPupils must be taught not to use the black-board except in class, or by direction of the teacher.\n\nII. MATHEMATICAL APPARATUS.\n\n1. The Numeral Frame is of the utmost value for class-work in all the elementary rules. A good, well-made frame should be procured, and should be constantly in use in every primary school.\n\n2. Bundles of small Sticks, or Splints, about six inches long, and of several colors, furnish an excellent means of illustrating many of the processes and operations of Arithmetic.\n\n3. A Box of Marbles of different sizes and colors, with little bags, or purses, will be found both useful and interesting in giving even very young pupils correct ideas of numbers, and enabling them to perform the elementary operations of Arithmetic with pleasure and success.\n\n4. Weights and Measures.\u2014Every school should be furnished with a complete set of the ordinary weights and measures, and also with a set marked according to the Metric system; and the pupils\nshould be taught to use them in all their operations with denominate numbers. Thus the drudgery of learning unnecessary tables by rote would disappear; the pupils would understand and take pleasure in their work; they would soon find out and demonstrate for themselves not only the tables, but the various rules resulting from them.\n\n5. Geometrical Forms.\u2014These forms are of great value in education. They cannot be dispensed with in any school where it is even pretended to give correct notions of the forms, and the modes of reasoning required in geometrical study. A small box of accurate forms can be got at a trifling cost, and the pupils should be encouraged to enlarge the collection by adding to it the products of their own skill.\n\nIII. GEOGRAPHICAL APPARATUS.\u2014The earth is the real basis of instruction in this branch. Each lesson is based on the child's observation and experience; correct teaching leads him to observe and discover for himself. Apparatus, however, greatly aids teacher and pupil.\n\n1. Globes.\u2014A globe from eight to twelve inches in diameter and a five-inch hemisphere globe are needed. With these nearly all geographical topics may be illustrated. The improved tellurian globes cost more, but seem almost indispensable.\n\n2. Geographical Board.\u2014This is very valuable. The board may be two by three feet, with water-proof strips around the edges. With sand, clay, and water, the continents, divisions of land and water, mountain ranges, river systems, etc., are constructed by the young pupils.\n\n3. Outline Maps.\u2014A set of outline maps, and local maps of the township, the county, and the province, may be advantageously used in recitation. The teacher will not, however, allow the use of these maps to prevent the frequent drawing of such outlines on the black-board, by himself and the pupils.\n\nIV. CABINET.\u2014A small collection, to illustrate the natural sciences, can be made by the teacher and the pupils. School-boards will gladly provide cases.\n\n1. Geological Specimens of the Neighbourhood can be Collected and Classified.\u2014Exchanges can be made with other schools. The pupils may secure the donation of some fine specimens. Many geological specimens may thus be accumulated.\n2. Botanical Specimens.\u2014The kinds of wood, leaves, flowers, grains, etc., of the surrounding country, may be prepared and arranged for the purposes of illustration. While affording recreation, the work of collecting and preparing these specimens will prove highly profitable. In the authorized text-book on Botany, the teacher will find full instructions as to the manner of preparing and preserving botanical specimens.\n\n3. Zoological Specimens.\u2014It is somewhat doubtful whether any advantage that might accrue from the acquisition of a fairly full collection of the birds, insects, &c., of the neighbourhood would not be more than counterbalanced by the lessons of cruelty learned by the young collectors. If such a collection be attempted, the utmost care will be necessary to guard against the development of cruel instincts in the children; they should be taught that when the death of any of God's creatures becomes necessary for the benefit of man, that death should be procured with the least possible pain to the unfortunate victim.\n\nV. HOW TO PROCURE SCHOOL APPARATUS.\u2014To thousands of struggling teachers this is an unsolved problem, but it is certainly not unsolvable.\n\n1. Create a Demand for Apparatus.\u2014So teach and so work that the pupils and the people will say, \"We must have apparatus.\" Secure a good lecture on the subject. Put strong articles in the local papers. Send an educational tract on the subject to each family, and visit them in person.\n\n2. The School Board will Purchase Apparatus as soon as the demand is sufficiently strong. This is the right plan. Stoves, desks, and apparatus should be procured on the same ground. The law makes it the duty of school-boards to furnish suitable apparatus.\n\n3. Purchase Apparatus with the Proceeds of Entertainments.\u2014This plan is objectionable in some respects, but sometimes it is the readiest way to reach the result.\n\n4. Let the Teacher Own the Apparatus.\u2014In exceptional cases this is possible, but in most cases it is utterly impracticable. Nor is it fair to expect it; with as much reason we might argue that the teacher should own the desks and the stoves.\nTopical Review.\u2014School Apparatus.\n\nApparatus is necessary in all schools.\n\nThe best teachers use it in all recitations.\n\nBlack-board surface.\n\n1.

As far as merely intellectual education is concerned, the most important lesson that can be learned by the pupils is how to use text-books to the best advantage. The treasured knowledge and wisdom of the ages is stored in books; and the secret of gaining this knowledge from their pages should be communicated by every teacher to every pupil.\n\nI. CHARACTERISTICS OF GOOD TEXT-BOOKS.\n\n1. School-Books should be Brief.\u2014They are text-books, not encyclopedias. Principles should be briefly presented, clearly illustrated, and carefully applied. The teacher interprets and supplements the book. Pupils are trained to utilize their own experience, to compare the book used with other text-books, and to refer to the dictionary, the encyclopaedia, and other books. They thus extend their knowledge beyond the book. A suggestive book guides and stimulates independent effort on the part of the pupil.\n\n2. School-Books should be Logical and Educational.\u2014Knowledge is both a means and an end, but culture is the great object in education. In all school-books, therefore, the subject should be logically presented, and the matter so chosen and arranged as to awaken thought and inspire effort on the part of the pupils. Every paragraph should show the thinker and the educator.\n\n3. School-Books should be Teachable and Learnable.\u2014With rare exceptions, successful school-books are prepared by practical teachers, by authors who understand, not only the plan of the subject, but also the plan of child-mind. The lessons are so presented that they can be easily learned and readily remembered. Poor books, written by mere theorists or blundering incompetents, are hindrances rather than helps.\n\n4. School-Books should be Models of Style.\u2014It is a very serious mistake to suppose that style is a matter of little\nconsequence in a school-book. Children, even young children, are shrewd critics, and very readily distinguish what is suited to their capacity from the sesquipedalian verbiage that soars beyond their comprehension. The language of a text-book should be correct and choice, and the style clear, vigorous, and vivacious. A text-book written in a style beyond the capacity of the pupil is not only useless, but positively injurious; since either the pupil becomes disgusted with the study and neglects it altogether, or he commits to memory the language of the book under the erroneous impression that he is acquiring knowledge, and thus his mental habits are seriously, if not permanently, vitiated.\n\n5. School-Books should be Models of Art.\u2014\"Nothing is too good for children,\" is an accepted maxim of the age; hence all the resources of art have been applied to the production of textbooks combining beauty with utility. The best material, clear, open pages, and choice illustrations are highly desirable features in school-books. Beautiful books allure the young disciple to study, they cultivate the taste, and are a constant source of pleasure.\n\nII. USE AND ABUSE OF TEXT-BOOKS.\u2014The wise use of text-books is an important feature of school management.\n\n1. Uses.\u2014Text-books are used: (1), to aid the teacher, by affording to the pupil independent sources of information and instruments of study, and by securing systematic work; (2), to aid the pupil, by enabling him to acquire habits of self-reliance in study, and to learn how to use books as a means of self-culture.\n\n2. Abuses.\u2014These are legion. (1), Committing the text to memory. Not what the book says, but what the pupil thinks about what it says, is important. \"Crowd not the memory, but develop the understanding,\" is sound doctrine. (2), Reciting the book. The subject, and not the book, is what we need to teach. (3), Confining the work to the book is a pernicious abuse. Nature should be made to supplement the book. The teacher needs to lead the pupils to combine experimental knowledge with book knowledge. (4), Studying the text-book to the exclusion of others is a great evil. Where the teacher knows but one book, he is likely to be narrow and dogmatical; and the pupils are liable to imbibe the spirit of the teacher. We need large, liberal-minded teachers who use books as helps.\n3. Oral and Objective Teaching can never take the place of text-books. At first, the living teacher and objects almost wholly engage the attention of the child; but, more and more, the pupil learns to gain knowledge from books, and the work becomes subjective as well as objective.\n\nIII. UNIFORMITY.\u2014All members of the class should have the same text-book. The widest experience verifies this statement. Some theorists claim that a variety of books may be used to advantage for reference. This is true, but it is not true so far as it refers to text-books. By some means uniformity should be secured. As a rule, the best teachers insist on all members of a class having the same book. Even where individual teaching can be largely employed, it is found by experience that a multiplicity of text-books tends to distract the attention and render the subject uncertain and indistinct. Where class instruction is the rule, as it is in Canada, uniformity is essential. Other books may, and ought, to be consulted both by teacher and pupils as aids to the elucidation of particular topics; but for the regular class work of the pupils, one text-book on each subject, and one only, should be used.\n\nTopical Review\u2014School Text-Books.\n\nDefinition.\n\nNecessity for text-books.\n\nCharacteristics of good text-books.\n\n1.

HYGIENE, OR THE ART OF PRESERVING HEALTH is the most important of all earthly arts that can be acquired by the pupils; it is the primary duty of the teacher to inculcate sound hygienic principles and to train his pupils to the habit of right living. The following pages are not intended as a substitute for the standard works on hygiene; we merely give a few of the most important conditions of sound health, to be observed by teachers and pupils during their connection with the school-room.\n\nII. HYGIENIC POSITION.\n\n1. The Erect Position in sitting, standing, and walking is as necessary to health as to gracefulness. \"Keep your back straight,\" were the last words of a celebrated physician to his son. The violation of this condition of health is one of the great hygienic sins of school life, occasioning untold suffering. Not for a moment must a stooping position be tolerated.\n\n2. Height of Seat.\u2014The child's feet should rest firmly on the floor. No child can long occupy a seat too high or too low and keep the spinal column erect. The shoulders fall forward, the chest is compressed, the breathing is defective, the circulation is impaired, and the child slowly becomes an invalid. See to it that the seats vary in height to suit your pupils.\n\n3. Curve of Seat and Slope of Back.\u2014Straight seats and backs, rendering an erect position difficult, are now inexcusable. The construction of desks that will foster an erect position has commanded the best efforts of able scientists. Some of our school-desks are admirable. The seat is curved and slopes upward. The back is curved to support the back of the child, and the slant is such as to favour the erect position. The old box desk, that cruel instrument of torture, like the old slab seat, belongs to a past age.\n\n4. Height of Desk.\u2014Curvature of the spine often results from sitting habitually with one shoulder higher than the other. In such\nan awkward attitude, neither the breathing nor the circulation can be normal. On this point the teacher cannot be too careful.\n\nThe Regulations of the Education Department of Ontario recommend the following as convenient:\n\n| Age of Pupils | Chairs or Seats | Desks |\n|---------------|----------------|-------|\n|               | Height | Slope of Back | Length | Width | Height next Pupils |\n|               | Front  | Rear         | D'ble. | Single |                  |\n| Five to eight years | 13 in. | 11\u00bd in. | 2 in. | 36 in. | 18 in. | 12 in. | 22 in. |\n| Eight to ten years | 13 \"   | 12\u00bd \"    | 2 \"   | 36 \"   | 18 \"   | 12 \"   | 23 \"   |\n| Ten to thirteen years | 14 \"   | 13\u00bd \"    | 2\u00bd \"  | 36 \"   | 20 \"   | 13 \"   | 24 \"   |\n| Thirteen to sixteen yrs | 16 \"   | 15\u00bd \"    | 3 \"   | 40 \"   | 22 \"   | 13 \"   | 26 \"   |\n\n5 Training is the Condition of Success.\u2014With all possible aids, constant watchfulness is needed to train pupils to the habit of maintaining an erect position.\n\nIII. VENTILATION OF SCHOOL-ROOMS.\n\n1. Importance of Adequate Ventilation.\u2014Pure air contains 21 per cent. of oxygen and 79 per cent. of nitrogen. Air once breathed becomes loaded with organic and other impurities. Breathing vitiated air enervates, impairs digestion, causes headache, renders the pupils listless and inattentive, and makes mental growth almost impossible.\n\n2. How to Secure Good Ventilation.\u2014In the chapter on School Buildings (Chapter II., Section V.), we have sufficiently indicated how good ventilation can be secured; we refer to it here in order to emphasise our conviction that its importance can hardly be exaggerated.\n\nIV. LIGHT IN THE SCHOOL-ROOM.\n\n1. Dark and Damp Rooms are a fruitful source of disease. The prevalence of weak eyes and short-sightedness is a sad commentary on our management with reference to light.\n\n2. Imitate Nature.\u2014The nearer the light of the school-room approaches that of the open air the better. Curtains or shutters are only used to avoid the glare of the sun.\n3. Position of Pupil.\u2014The light should not fall directly in front of the pupil. High windows, admitting the light from above and on the left side are best.\n\n4. Change Position.\u2014It is well so to place the pupil during recitation that the light will fall upon him from a different direction than during study. With a little care the teacher may observe this hygienic law.\n\n5 Look well to the Eyes of your Pupils.\u2014Not to do so is cruel. By judicious management many eyes may be improved, and nearly all may be saved from permanent injury. School-rooms should be lighted from the top, back, and one of the sides only. Pupils must not be permitted to face windows unless the room is sufficiently long to have the window at a considerable distance from them. As far as possible the light should come from above the level of the eye, and from the left side.\n\nV. CALISTHENIC EXERCISES.\u2014A well-arranged course of indoor exercises is of great benefit in any school. The books published upon this subject need to be used with care. Many of them multiply exercises unnecessarily. Some contain much that is objectionable, if not actually improper. Of the value of such exercises, judiciously directed, there can be no doubt.\n\n(1.) They supply a great want when outdoor exercise can not be taken.\n\n(2.) They can be used at any time to break up sluggishness.\n\n(3.) They call into activity all the muscles and hence promote health.\n\n(4.) These movements are regular and in time, and hence develop gracefulness.\n\n(5.) They train to prompt and exact obedience.\n\n(6.) They train the pupils to work in harmony with others, and thus prepare them for the great world without.\n\nVI. PLAY AND HEALTH.\n\n1. As a hygienic agency, nothing can take the place of amusements. Recreation is re-creation. Study exhausts; play rests. Many are utterly ignorant of the philosophy of recreation, and to not a few teachers recreation seems to be a lost art.\n\n2. Play-Grounds.\u2014Every school should be provided with ample play-grounds, and every proper form of out-door amusement\nshould be encouraged. Health is vastly more to be desired than the sham refinement and mock delicacy that forbid healthful recreation. School life is the time when, most of all, healthful amusement is needed; and it is the duty of the Trustees to provide the means for indulging in it.\n\n3. Plays for Boys.\u2014Hard, and vigorous games should be encouraged. We want strong men, able to do and to bear. The more studious the boy, the more vigorous should be the recreation. Cricket, foot-ball, lacrosse, baseball are well adapted to the wants of the senior pupils; even the younger pupils will enjoy these games, if they are allowed to play them without running the risk of coming into collision with those much bigger and stronger than themselves.\n\n4. Plays for Girls.\u2014For girls, nearly all schools, high and low, are prison-houses of decorum, repressing the glad activity necessary to physical vigor and happy lives. It is infinitely better to give our girls less music and less book knowledge, but more physical vigor. A teacher who does not stimulate the girls to \"romp\" and take abundance of outdoor recreation sins against the race; the girls are the future wives and mothers. Encouraged by teachers and parents, girls will usually select appropriate plays. Every play-ground should have a portion fenced off specially for the girls, so that they may enjoy vigorous outdoor exercises, undeterred by the presence and criticism of their more athletic fellow-pupils,\u2014the boys.\n\n5. Play is Spontaneous Activity.\u2014Pupils should be left free to select their own plays, provided only that they be neither unhealthy nor demoralising; unwittingly, they will bring into action all the principal muscles, especially those that are used least while in the school-room. The teacher may, and indeed should, be upon the play-ground, to suggest plays, and thus quietly secure the selection of refining amusements. He should not dictate in any respect, nor use authority while directing the pupils in their plays. \"The Philosophy of Recreation,\" ought to interest teachers and parents.\n\nVIII. HYGIENIC HABITS.\u2014Teachers and parents should assist and encourage each other in training the rising generation to convert hygienic laws into hygienic habits.\n1. Cleanliness.\u2014Order may be heaven's first law, but assuredly cleanliness is its second; soap and civilization are inseparable, dirt and degradation are the constant companions of the savage. Children should never be allowed to take their places in the school room with dirty hands or faces. The wise teacher will set his pupils an example of personal neatness, and insist on their following it. Not only will the appearance and comfort of the children be improved by cleanliness; it will greatly benefit their health also. A free use of water promotes mental growth as well as physical vigor, and is the best of all preventives of disease.\n\n2. Clothing.\u2014Proper attention to clothing conduces highly to the health and comfort of the wearer; and it is the duty of the teacher to give good advice and to set a good example to his pupils. It is not necessary that the clothing of children at school should be expensive; on the contrary, every tendency to extravagance in dress should be discouraged and repressed. The garments should be neat, clean, and appropriate to the season; the material should be suited to the circumstances of the parents; and the children should be taught that a neatly patched jacket is no cause of shame, whereas an unmended rent or rip is a piece of slovenliness for which there can be no excuse.\n\n3. Food.\u2014The wise man \"eats to live;\" the glutton \"lives to eat.\" Temperance in eating and drinking is essential to the enjoyment of good health; a few good lessons on the hygiene of diet might be given by the teacher, to the great benefit of the pupils, their parents, and the community in general. The quality and quantity of food, the mode of preparing it, and the times and manner of eating are the most important points on which instruction is required in this subject.\n\n4. Sleep.\u2014Abundant sleep is a primary condition of sound health and profitable study. It is nature's remedy for the exhaustion of mind and body, caused by study and physical exertion. It enables the system to repair the wasted tissues of the brain and muscles and to carry off the waste material, so that one in good health may rise up in the morning as fresh and vigorous as on the previous day. The great students and great workers have ever been good sleepers. Hard study hurts no one; but irregularity, dissipation, and late hours do incalculable injury, especially to the young. Some\nconstitutions require more rest than others, but an average of about eight hours sound, refreshing sleep will be found sufficient for most people. Every pupil should get to bed before ten o'clock and be up and washed and dressed by six o'clock.\n\n5. Cheerfulness.\u2014Youth time is the sunny side of life. Clouds will appear and do appear; but the teacher should endeavour to turn the silver lining to his pupils, and lead them to look upon that. Serenity and cheerfulness pay in effective work, and a good conscience usually means a long life and a happy old age. Cheerfulness is the best of all hygienic agencies. Those who are always glad are seldom sick. Of all places, home and school should be made most cheerful. A grim, cold, repulsive teacher chills the child to the bones.\n\nEducation comes from voluntary and glad effort. The teacher ought to be happy and glad, and ought to fill the school-room with an atmosphere of love and a glow of cheerfulness. In such a school, disease will be a stranger.\n\nVIII. SCHOOL PUNISHMENTS SHOULD BE HYGIENIC.\u2014The health of the teacher as well as of the pupils is often seriously injured by unwise punishments. Think of it. Study to make your pupils happy, not miserable. Even punishment should be full of encouragement. Its purpose is to reform, not to crush.\n\nIX. LAWS OF HEALTH.\u2014[Holbrook's \"Hygiene of the Brain.\"] These laws are stated from the educational standpoint.\n\n1. A Well-regulated Mind is the Most Important Law of Health.\u2014The proper object of life is the development of the mind. The brain requires constant exercise to maintain its power. The tone of the mind has the most potent influence on the health. If our pursuits are rational and in harmony with the laws of God, the self-satisfaction resulting has the most exhilarating influence on health.\n\n2. A Resolute Will and Ambition to Succeed in some Honorable Career is the Second Law of Health.\u2014A strong will has a wonderful effect on the health. A determination to live and work throws off diseases.\n\n2. Love in all Innocent Forms is the Third Law of Health\u2014Love of Friends, Love of Society, Love of Women, Love of God.\u2014There is no higher hygienic law than\nto love with our whole soul, and to work with all our might. The brute basks, man works. \"The bliss is in action, not in ease.\" God is love, and the superior man is godlike.\n\n4. Balanced Culture is the Fourth Law of Health.\u2014Muscular exercise must balance mental, and intellectual activity must balance emotional. Every muscle and every brain-cell needs to be daily used. Every power of the soul should be kept in action. Balanced culture gives a vigorous body and a vigorous mind. One-sided culture is a fatal mistake. Let the workingman devote certain hours daily to mental culture. Let the student devote certain hours daily to labour and recreation.\n\n5. To Resist and Throw Off Trouble is the Fifth Law of Health.\u2014Every species of uncomfortable sensation must be driven off. \"These miserable feelings MUST go!\" is better than all medicine. The great destroyers of life are care, misery, worry, fretting, crime, and dissipation; and not exertion, physical or mental. Fretting is a moral and physical sin, destroying health, usefulness, and happiness. None but a child cries over spilt milk. Let it go; only take care for the future. Always do the best you can, and never worry. Worrying undermines health and unfits the teacher for his duties.\n\nX. NEVER USE TOBACCO [Dio Lewis].\u2014I trust you will never learn to use tobacco. It is doing more to destroy the brains and nerves of American boys than any other agency that can be named. Within half a century no young man addicted to the use of tobacco has graduated at the head of his class in Harvard College, though five-sixths of the students have used it. If a man wishes to train for a boat race, his trainer will not let him use tobacco, because it weakens his brain and muscles so that he cannot win. If a young fellow would prepare to play a fine game of billiards, while he is training for the tournament his trainer will not let him use tobacco. And, as you see from the experience in Harvard College, if a man will train himself to graduate from a college with honor, he must not use tobacco. It is a powerful poison, and the brain can not escape if it is used in any form.\nTopical Review.\u2014School Hygiene.\n\nDefinition.\n\nImportance.\n\nHygienic position.\n\n1.

The office of the school is to promote the physical, mental, moral, and aesthetic development of the pupils, so as to fit them for positions in the world, alike creditable to themselves and serviceable to their fellow-men. To this end all the arrangements of the school are directed; everything is so adjusted as to remove friction, induce order, and secure cheerful and effective work. The proper organization of an ungraded school, even to the experienced teacher, is not an easy task. It would be simple enough if the teaching staff were so large as to allow a teacher to each class, alternately supervising its studies and conducting its recitations. But where the teacher has to give oral instruction to one class, and at the same time to keep a watchful eye on the many classes studying at their desks, it is obvious that thorough organization is an essential condition of success, and that the solution of the problem how best to organize his school is of vital consequence to teacher and to pupils. Defective organization is a fruitful source of failure in school management. No matter how sound may be the scholarship of the teacher, no matter how excellent his method of imparting\ninstruction, if he has not also the faculty of providing constant employment for the whole school, and the moral power requisite to keep its members cheerfully active in a right direction, his school will be a failure in every way. On the other hand, a well-organized school becomes a kind of mechanical power, having for its working force the exuberant energies of childhood and youth, and for its intelligent direction the boundless influence of the wise teacher.\n\nThe faithful teacher will devote all his efforts to securing right answers to the following questions, nor will he feel that he has done all that might be done for the organization of his school till every answer is perfectly satisfactory:\n\n1. Are your educational instrumentalities the best you can command? Are they sufficient to enable you, in the management of your school, to do justice to yourself and to your pupils?\n\n2. Are your business arrangements satisfactory?\n\n3. Have you mastered a good system of school tactics?\n\n4. Are your pupils properly seated?\n\n5. Are your pupils wisely classified? Is the classification the best that could be adopted for your school?\n\n6. Have you adopted sensible regulations? Do your pupils perceive the justice and reasonableness of your rules?\n\n7. Are your programme and time-table well planned?\n\n8. Do you make the best possible use of the opening exercises and of the recesses of the school?\n\nBefore entering upon the direct work of school organization, the following important preliminaries demand attention:\n\nI. TEACHER'S QUALIFICATIONS.\u2014The great want everywhere is competent teachers. Give us competent teachers, and all obstacles to educational progress can be overcome. The teacher should have:\n\n1. Vigorous Health.\u2014The labor is necessarily severe, taxing to the utmost the strongest men and women. There is no profession so exacting, none that breaks sickly men and women down so early, as that of faithful teaching. The cheerfulness, the vigor, the versatility, and the endurance essential to success can come of good health only.\n2. Knowledge of the Branches.\u2014The teacher needs not only to have a thorough knowledge of the branches to be taught, but also a fair knowledge of the cognate branches. To be able to teach well, one must be at once master of the text-book and the subject. It is worse than folly for one who is not a scholar to assume the responsibilities of the teacher.\n\n3. Skill in Teaching.\u2014Teaching is the art of human development. Methods of teaching are the ways in which educational means are applied to educational ends. \"In education method is everything,\" says Everett. From the want of method and skill, the most scholarly teachers often make the most striking failures; they know, but they cannot cause others to know. With them teaching is an undiscovered art. The teacher needs to observe, read, think, practise. He needs to sit at the feet of Jesus, of Aristotle, of Socrates, and of Pestalozzi, and learn methods from the masters.\n\n4. Skill in Management.\u2014Here good sense and tact have boundless scope. The successful teacher must combine the qualities of the statesman and the diplomatist\u2014he must be possessed of a natural or an acquired insight into the principles of government, and he must have learned the art of smoothing away the asperities of temper and removing the antagonisms of discordant elements. To manage a school well is hardly less difficult than to manage a state; it requires a maturity of judgment not to be expected in the inexperienced. To place a new recruit in command of an army would be eminent wisdom in comparison with the practice of placing undisciplined boys and girls in charge of our schools. Happily, the facilities provided for the training of teachers are doing much to supply the lack of experience. The conscientious teacher-in-training should do his utmost to profit by his opportunities in this respect\u2014opportunities the like of which were enjoyed by very few of his predecessors.\n\n5. Sympathy with Children.\u2014The true secret of success in the teacher's profession is love of children\u2014sympathy with them in their griefs and joys, their triumphs and defeats. Whoever possesses this, possesses all that is necessary to warrant him in entering on the study of the art of teaching with the fullest confidence that he will ultimately succeed; whoever does not possess it, had better give up at once all hope of attaining to any high degree of merit as a\nteacher\u2014had better retire at once from a profession of which he can never become an ornament. Sympathy with children wins their confidence without an effort, renders the study of child-nature easy and attractive beyond all conception, and immensely helps the would-be teacher in the study of the various branches in which he must be proficient.\n\nII. SECURING POSITIONS.\u2014Teaching is a business as well as a profession, and business principles should be followed in the dealings of the teacher with his employers, as they are between the physician and his patients or the lawyer and his clients. No legitimate effort should be spared by the teacher to secure a position where most good can be accomplished.\n\n1. Suitable Position.\u2014The right teacher in the right place is a desideratum in education. By attempting too much you may endanger all. You should have a school that you can manage and hold. This will enable you to grow, and to make a reputation.\n\n2. Line of Promotion.\u2014Beginners can afford to take humble positions and work up. The best officers often come from the ranks. An inspector is better for having taught in all the grades. A teacher should prepare himself for the best positions, and then secure a place, if possible, in the line of promotion. Merit and pluck will win. Large fields of usefulness, as well as fair salaries, await talent and well-directed effort.\n\n3. Few Recommendations.\u2014No one who has not taught successfully should ask a recommendation; and the pernicious dishonesty of giving high-flown testimonials to incompetent teachers, simply to get rid of them, should be sternly frowned upon by every lover of education. Life is too short to read bundles of recommendations. All you need is your professional certificate, and a single paragraph from a responsible educator as to teaching ability and success. The rest you must do for yourself.\n\n4. Apply in Person.\u2014As a rule, this is best for young teachers. Little attention is usually paid to applications by letter. The board want to see you and converse with you. Be modest in your pretensions and promises. You can safely say that you have tried to prepare yourself for the work, and that you will spare no effort to succeed. After you make a reputation, positions will seek you.\n5. Never Undermine or Underbid.\u2014You can not afford, directly or indirectly, to undermine or underbid a fellow teacher. As a band of honorable men and women, we must work together. We must scorn everything mean and unworthy. We dare not stoop to the low tricks of petty politicians. A teacher who would undermine the reputation or slander the character of another, would be a disgrace to a society of thieves.\n\n6. Permanent Position.\u2014Persistently seek promotion until you secure a satisfactory position. Make this permanent. To retain the teacher for a series of years is best for all concerned. The precariousness of the teacher's position is a blight upon the profession and upon the cause of education. Frequent changes are always a calamity, and are sometimes a disgrace. Secure a position that will require all your powers,\u2014one to which you can gladly devote your best efforts.\n\nIII. CONTRACT BETWEEN TRUSTEES AND TEACHER.\u2014All contracts should be in writing, signed by the teacher and by a majority of the board in rural sections, or by the teacher and the chairman and secretary of the board in cities and towns, and sealed with the corporate seal. They should be made in duplicate, one copy for the board, the other for the teacher.\n\n1. Yearly Engagements.\u2014The contract should be for one year, unless under exceptional circumstances, and should state the amount of the yearly salary, with the dates of payment, which should not be more than three months apart.\n\n2. Teachers must be and continue to be Qualified.\u2014The teacher agrees to conduct the school in accordance with the requirements of the School Law and Regulations. He waives his claim on the trustees in case of his ceasing to be the holder of a legal Certificate of Qualification as a Public School Teacher in Ontario, so that his claim for salary would lapse from the date of the expiration or cancellation of his Certificate.\n\n3. Legal Holidays.\u2014The Trustees agree to pay the teacher:\n\n(a) For all holidays and vacations, prescribed by Law and Regulations, occurring during his engagement;\n(b) For the days of his attendance at the Teachers' Institute;\n(c) For such period of sickness as may be provided for by Statute.\n4. Notice of Termination of Agreement.\u2014Either party to the contract may terminate it by giving to the other, in writing, such notice as may be agreed upon\u2014the notice to be given not less than one calendar month previous to the termination, and the engagement to end on the last day of a calendar month.\n\n5. Agreement Continues from Year to Year.\u2014The agreement should continue in force without re-engagement from year to year, until it is terminated by formal notice, given by either of the parties.\n\nThe foregoing are the provisions of the Contract between Teachers and Trustees in Ontario. For convenience of reference, the full form of Agreement provided by the Regulations of the Education Department is here given:\n\nForm of Agreement for Engagement of a Public School Teacher.\n\nMemorandum of Agreement made this \u2014\u2014\u2014 day of \u2014\u2014\u2014 18 \u2014\u2014\u2014, between the Public School Trustees of Section No. \u2014\u2014\u2014, in the Township of \u2014\u2014\u2014 [or the Public School Board of the City, Town or Village of] \u2014\u2014\u2014, and \u2014\u2014\u2014 (Name here) of \u2014\u2014\u2014, the holder of a \u2014\u2014\u2014 class Certificate of qualification as a Public School Teacher in Ontario, as follows:\n\n1. The [Trustees or Board of Public School Trustees] hereby employ for their said school such Teacher, at the yearly salary of \u2014\u2014\u2014 dollars, for the term of one year, beginning on the \u2014\u2014\u2014 day of \u2014\u2014\u2014, one thousand eight hundred and \u2014\u2014\u2014, and ending on the \u2014\u2014\u2014 day of \u2014\u2014\u2014, one thousand eight hundred and eighty \u2014\u2014\u2014, and further agree that they and their successors in office will pay such salary to the said Teacher at least quarterly, and will exercise all powers and perform all duties under the Public Schools\u2019 Act and Regulations of the Education Department, which may be requisite for making such payment.\n\n2. The Teacher agrees with the said Board of Public School Trustees to teach and conduct the said school during the said term, according to the said Law and Regulations in that behalf.\n\n3. The foregoing is subject to the following conditions: (1) That the teacher shall continue to be the holder of a legal Certificate of qualification as a Public School Teacher in Ontario. (2) That holidays and vacations prescribed by the Law and Regulations are excepted from the said term. (3) That the days on which the Teacher has attended the meetings of Teachers\u2019 Associations or Institutes, as certified by the Inspector or Chairman thereof, shall\nbe allowed him as if he had actually taught in the said school; and (4), That in case of sickness, as certified by a registered medical practitioner, he shall be entitled to receive his salary without deduction, for such period as may be authorized under the Statute in that behalf.\n\n4. The Trustees or School Board and the Teacher may, at their option respectively, terminate this engagement by giving notice in writing to the other of them at least \u2014 calendar months previously, and so as to terminate on the last day of a calendar month.\n\n5. This agreement shall also be construed to continue in force from year to year, unless and until it is terminated by the notice hereinbefore prescribed.\n\nAs witness the Corporate Seal of the said Trustees or School Board and the hand and seal of the Teacher, on the day and year first above-mentioned.\n\nTrustees. [Corporate Seal.]\n\nTeacher. [Seal.]\n\nIn presence of\n\n[Duplicate.] One copy to be retained by the Trustees and the other by the Teacher.\n\nIV. PLAN OF THE WORK FOR THE TERM.\u2014Before entering on the active work of the session, it is of great importance that the teacher should have carefully considered, and adopted, some general plan of operations. A few preliminary preparations may also be necessary, especially in a new situation. Success is more important than money, and the sooner the people understand that their teacher is acting on this principle the sooner will they begin to appreciate and second his efforts for the common good.\n\n1. The Building.\u2014Manage to have this put in good condition. Let the school-room be clean, orderly, and cheerful, to begin with, and keep it so.\n\n2. The Apparatus.\u2014If necessary, have the black-boards slated; secure erasers and crayons. If there is no library room, procure a case for the apparatus, and another for the library and cabinet. Have everything in readiness for use.\n\n3. Books and Slates.\u2014Precious time may be saved by making such arrangements that the children can procure their books, slates,\netc., for the first day. The dealers will be glad to procure the necessary supply, if you will let them know in time what books, and about how many of each will be required for the session.\n\n4. Enlist Trustees and Parents.\u2014They will gladly aid you if they see you mean business, that you are not afraid of extra work, and that you esteem success more than money.\n\n5. Programme and Time-Table.\u2014The prescribed \"Course of Study\" relieves you of the trouble and anxiety of considering what subjects you shall teach; the School Register, with such information as you can get from the Trustees and others, will give you a fair idea of the probable number of pupils in each class\u2014so that you can prepare a time-table beforehand, that will require but little change.\n\n6. Plan for Each Branch.\u2014The work you propose to do throughout the term should be well considered and wisely planned, and the what, the how, and the how much thought out in detail. What is your plan for Language Lessons? Arithmetic? Geography? Oral Work? Much must be left to be developed from week to week, but a well-matured general plan is essential to success. Mere text-book routine\u2014assigning pages and hearing recitations\u2014belongs to a past age. You must teach.\n\n7. Remove Obstacles.\u2014Stand above the petty quarrels and jealousies of the neighbourhood. Quietly make friends of all, and unite them in the school work. Prudently grapple with obstacles to success, and, if possible, remove them.\n\n8. A Good Boarding-place.\u2014The teacher needs much time for preparation and study. He requires a comfortable home, and must have a good, cheerful, airy room to himself. Growing men and women are the only companions fit for teachers. Growth implies study; study implies facilities. Even if the cost is greater, a good, home-like boarding-place is indispensable.\n\n9. First Day.\u2014Have your plan well matured for this day of days. Secure a large attendance at the beginning. When at all possible, each pupil should be in attendance on the first day. No effort to this end should be spared. Too much importance cannot be attached to the first day of school. Do the best work of which you are capable during this and each succeeding day, and you will not fail to win success.\nTopical Review.\u2014Preparatory Work.\n\nIntroduction.\u2014School Organization.\n\n1.

Proper school tactics save time, impart vigor, improve the appearance and spirit of the school, and train to the habit of exact and prompt obedience. Order results from system. A want of system in the movements of the school is a prolific source of confusion. The teacher, not less than the military commander, needs to be master of well-planned tactics. In organizing the school, from the first moment the pupils should be carefully trained in school tactics. They are indispensable in large schools\u2014it would be impossible to carry on the work without them. Though not so imperatively necessary in small schools, they are of great value as aids to discipline; and their employment in the smaller schools will help the aspiring teacher to carry them on efficiently in a larger one when he is promoted to take charge of it. Because of its neglect we emphasize this subject.\n\nSchool tactics should not be arbitrary. Principles should determine the movements and the signals. Even children ought to be able to perceive the fitness of the tactics.\n\nPRINCIPLES PERTAINING TO SCHOOL TACTICS.\n\n1. School Tactics should be Uniform.\u2014So far as applicable, the tactics should be the same in all schools. The tactics of the army are the same throughout the nation. The combinations and changes of teachers and pupils continually going on demand the same uniformity for the schools. Variety in instruction, but uniformity in movement, is a desideratum in school management.\n\n2. Each Movement should be necessitated by the School Work.\u2014All movements for mere display must be discarded. The necessity for each movement should be apparent. All changes should be effected in the shortest time consistent with propriety and good order.\n3. The Signals should be Few and Significant.\u2014The correctness of this principle will hardly be questioned, but in practice its violation is almost universal, and the consequent waste of time and energy is enormous.\n\n4. Each Movement should have its Own Signal.\u2014When a given signal is always used for the same movement, the pupils learn to respond almost mechanically. The constant association of the movement with its signal does away with all uncertainty and confusion.\n\n5. The Signal should be given with the Falling Inflection, and in a low, firm Tone.\u2014The elocution of the teacher is an important factor in the government of the school. Good elocution commands respect and obedience, whereas a thin, faltering tone and rising inflection generally cause even the children to smile.\n\n6. All Movements should be executed Quietly, Quickly, and with Military Precision.\u2014Movements executed in this way arouse and sustain the interest of the pupils; but the noisy, slovenly movements of some schools cause only disorder, lack of interest, and the formation of bad habits generally.\n\n7. Movements should Follow Signals.\u2014This principle requires the observance of the following points:\n\n(1.) No general movement must be permitted except in obedience to a signal. Otherwise confusion reigns.\n\n(2.) The movement ordered must be executed before the next signal is given. Allow sufficient time for prompt execution.\n\n(3.) Never for a moment tolerate disobedience, or carelessness, or slovenliness. One negligent pupil may demoralize an entire school.\n\nA SYSTEM OF SCHOOL TACTICS.\n\nI. CALLING SCHOOL. (Morning, Afternoon, and after Recesses.)\n\n1. Ring Bell.\n2. Give Time to Assemble.\n3. Attention (command by voice, or bell, or clock).\n\n1. Ring Bell.\u2014In small schools the teacher ordinarily rings the bell. If a pupil can be trained to do this, it is better, as it enables\nthe teacher to devote his time and energies to other work. But it must be considered an honor, and one pupil should not be continued in the position too long. No one is allowed to ring the bell except the pupil designated. At the first sound of the bell the pupils should instantly desist from their sports, &c., and take their places quietly in the lines.\n\n2. Give Time to Assemble.\u2014From two to three minutes are necessary to allow all to assemble. The pupils form in lines, march to their respective rooms, and pass to their places in an orderly manner.\n\n3. Attention.\u2014The clock indicates that the time is up. At the stroke of the programme clock, or at the word \"Attention,\" or at the tap of the bell, there is absolute stillness. The teacher gives the necessary directions, and all enter upon the work of the hour. Those not in seats when the signal for attention is given are marked tardy.\n\nII. DISMISSING SCHOOL.\n\n(At Recesses, at Noon, and at Close of School).\n\n1. School, Attention!\n2. (General Business).\n3. Arrange Desks.\n4. Ready.\n5. Rise.\n6. March.\n\n1. School, Attention!\u2014All sit erect and await orders. A slight tap of the bell may be substituted for this signal. The stroke of the programme clock is a still better substitute.\n\n2. General Business.\u2014Here the teacher makes such remarks as may be deemed necessary, and attends to matters pertaining to discipline, etc. Be exceedingly brief. Be certain you have something to say; otherwise say nothing.\n\n3. Arrange Desks.\u2014Books to be left are quietly placed in desks, and others are arranged for carrying. Division leaders distribute hats, wraps, etc. If the building is properly arranged, this is unnecessary, as each one can take his things as he passes out.\n\n4. Ready.\u2014All prepare to rise. All is stillness and readiness.\n\n5. Rise.\u2014Simultaneously all rise, and each turns in the direction in which he is to move. A signal for turning is unnecessary.\n6. March.\u2014It is best to count, 1, 2, 3, 4,\u20141, 2, 3, 4; and at the second 1 let all step off with the left foot, and keep time to counting. Let the divisions follow each other, so that all may move at once. Where the school has two cloak rooms and two entrances, the pupils can be dismissed quickly and without confusion or disorder. When there is a musical instrument (piano or organ) in the school, it has an excellent effect to allow the pupils to march to music.\n\nIII. CALLING CLASSES.\n\n1. Ready.\u2014For the first few days it may be necessary for the teacher to name the class referred to, before giving this signal. When the pupils become familiar with the time-table they will not require any warning. At the word \"Ready\" each member of the class instantly prepares to rise.\n\n2. Rise.\u2014All rise at the same instant, step into the aisle, and turn in the direction in which they are expected to move.\n\n3. Pass.\u2014The class passes quickly and in order to the board or recitation benches, as the case may be, when they quietly take their places facing the teacher, and await further orders.\n\nIV. DISMISSING CLASSES.\n\n1. Ready.\u2014The board will be cleared before this command is given. As this signal is never given except when the pupils are about to move, no misunderstanding can occur.\n\n2. Rise, or Turn.\u2014The pupils rise and turn if on recitation seats. If the class is at the board, Turn is the signal given.\n\n3. Pass, or Seats.\u2014In dismissing a class, Pass is always used; in sending the class from boards to recitation seats, Seats is the signal. The order of passing will be so arranged as to consume the least time and avoid confusion. Some teachers let the pupils stand after passing to desks, and at the signal Seats all take seats at once; but this is not necessary.\nClass Symmetry.\u2014Place the tallest in the middle of the class, and the others each way according to height. The reverse order is equally good. You secure symmetry, and each pupil always knows his place. Since \"turning down\" has been abandoned, this arrangement of classes is becoming general.\n\nPosition at the Boards.\u2014The pupils should stand in straight lines, i.e., in lines parallel to the boards. It will require some tact and training to induce them to keep this position constantly. The teacher should be careful not to make the recitations too long, so that the position may not become irksome. Lounging must not be permitted. Appearance as well as health requires the erect position. Make your pupils always stand and sit erect, and the position will soon become habitual.\n\nV. HAND TACTICS.\n\nI. UP.\n1. To Answer.\n2. To Criticise.\n3. To Ask Question.\n4. To Concur or Oppose\n\nII. DOWN.\n1. When Recognized.\n2. When one is Called.\n\nI. HANDS UP.\u2014No one speaks without permission. This regulation is imperative and absolute. In all cases the desire to speak is indicated by raising the right hand.\n\n1. The pupil raises his hand whenever prepared to answer the question or do the work required. All should be made to realize that it is wrong and dangerous to raise the hand unless prepared.\n\n2. Each pupil is held responsible for each answer. All that object to the answer given raise their hands; but no hands are raised till the pupil has finished; otherwise hand-raising becomes prompting. Any one wishing to offer a criticism raises his hand. A failure to raise the hand indicates approval.\n\n3. The pupil wishes to ask a question. The desire is indicated by raising the hand.\n\nII. HANDS DOWN.\u20141. Whenever the teacher recognizes the pupil, the hand is dropped. 2. When any one is called to answer, all hands are dropped.\nTopical Review.\u2014School Tactics.\n\nIntroduction.\u2014School Tactics.\n\n1. Definition. 2. Importance. 3.

The hand should be raised as high as the head, and held still. 2. Snapping the fingers must never be tolerated. 3. Pupils not raising hands should frequently be called. 4. The teacher should be wide awake, so as to see all hands as soon as raised. 5. Pupils must not raise hands except for good cause. Timid and dull pupils must be encouraged.\n\n[Board Tactics belongs rather to the Art of Teaching than to the Art of School Management. Each teacher can frame his own system to suit the use he makes of his black-board in teaching.]\nCHAPTER III.\n\nSchool Classification.\n\nSchool Classification is the grouping of the pupils for school work according to age, ability, and scholarship. Wise classification puts each child in its proper place. Two distinct plans are pursued\u2014close classification and loose classification. On the first plan the pupil makes equal advancement in the several branches of the course; on the second plan the pupil is permitted to advance in certain branches without reference to his attainments in the other branches. In all elementary schools the classification should be close; the loose system would waste most of the teacher's time, and keep his classes in a constant state of confusion\u2014it is being steadily superseded by the close method. As a basis, attention is invited to the following general principles and suggestions:\n\nI. PRINCIPLES RELATING TO SCHOOL CLASSIFICATION.\n\n1. Uniformity.\u2014The Several Branches should be kept Abreast. The phase of the several branches pursued must be the same. It is not uncommon to find pupils well advanced in Arithmetic, but extremely backward in other branches, or well advanced in Geography, but deficient in Arithmetic. These unfortunates should be so classed as to give the greater part of their time to subjects in which they are deficient. The application of this principle will work well in ungraded schools.\n\n2. Adaptation.\u2014The pupil should be placed in Classes adapted to his Ability and Advancement. If classed too low, the pupil is not stimulated to effort; if classed too high, he is apt to become confused and discouraged. Nothing succeeds like success. Each pupil should be so classed as to become a success in his classes. The application of this principle requires sound judgment and a profound study of child-nature. Classification can never be done by machinery. You must know your pupils before you can classify them to advantage.\n\n[62]\n3. Criteria.\u2014Age, Ability, and Scholarship determine the Classification. Other things being equal, older pupils are classed higher than younger, and strong, bright pupils, higher than delicate or dull ones. The reasons are apparent. To consider scholarship alone is a grave, though common error. Examinations, oral and written, give some of the conditions; but to ignore ability is to fail to reach the correct solution. Study the child.\n\n4. Standard.\u2014Reading and Arithmetic are made the Standard of Classification. All the pupils in the elementary school are in these branches. Ignorance of these bars progress in other studies. The judicious teacher will give due weight to the pupil's advancement in other branches; some may be worked up, others merely reviewed. Complete adjustment may be secured by firmness and a few months of hard work.\n\n5. Number of Classes.\u2014As few Classes should be Organized as is Consistent with good Grading. Upon this principle depends largely the efficiency of the ungraded school. Numerous classes fritter away the time of the teacher without producing satisfactory results. Uniformity of text-books, wise combinations, and practical devices enable the competent teacher to reach a high standard of efficiency even in a large ungraded school.\n\n6. Size of Classes.\u2014Medium-sized Classes are Best. Each Pupil must be reached Individually during the Recitation. In very large classes this can not very well be done. In very small classes it is difficult to maintain sufficient interest on the part of teacher and pupils. A class numbering from ten to thirty is most desirable. Avoid, if possible, organizing classes for three or four pupils. As a rule, from five to ten should be the minimum number in any class where the school is large.\n\n7. Adjustment.\u2014The Work must be Adjusted to the Abilities and Tastes of Different Pupils. Some, for example, excel in Language, but have little or no taste for Arithmetic. It would be manifestly absurd to attempt to make such pupils accomplished arithmeticians. The proper course would be to require of them the minimum amount of work in Arithmetic and the maximum in Languages. And so with other branches,\nII. TEMPORARY CLASSIFICATION.\u2014Permanent classification is not possible at the first. The teacher goes to work vigorously and approximates a proper classification. The young teacher may profit by the following suggestions:\n\n1. Follow the Classification of your Predecessor.\u2014If this has been reasonably good, it will give you a good basis on which to build. The pupils will readily fall into line, and further classification will not be difficult.\n\n2. Carefully Plan the Organization of a New School.\u2014Where the school has not been classified, you will need to be well prepared for the work. A week spent in the district before the term begins will enable you to secure the necessary data and form the necessary plans.\n\n3. Let it be Understood that the Classification is Temporary.\u2014This will prevent dissatisfaction. Very soon you expect to reach a proper classification. Endeavor to so classify the pupils that few changes will be necessary, and that changes will be promotions rather than demissions.\n\nIII. PERMANENT CLASSIFICATION.\u2014From day to day, as you learn the true places of pupils, you promote or put back until all are properly classified. This work should approach completion during the first week. As new pupils come in, you will take time and care to place them in the right classes. Pupils who show themselves worthy will be promoted whenever you deem it best. It is of the utmost importance that you should make a thorough study of your pupils, not only collectively, but individually. You must study the nature and the peculiar characteristics of each pupil, that you may know how to awaken their nobler emotions, and adjust the work to their wants. Your permanent classification will then be truly artistic; it will satisfy yourself, your pupils, and their friends.\n\nIV. CLASSIFICATION OF AN UNGRADED SCHOOL.\u2014You have studied the principles pertaining to classification, and are familiar with the condition of your school. You have your plans well matured. After the opening exercises you at once proceed to classify your, say forty, pupils.\n\n1. You First Classify in the Leading Branches.\u2014These are Reading, Arithmetic, Language Lessons, and for all except the\nyoungest pupils, Geography. If you prefer to classify according to the pupils' standing in only one branch, the Reading will generally be the safest guide. As soon as you have one of the divisions classified, set every pupil in it to work at once. Then proceed to the classification of the remaining divisions in the same way. About an hour should be long enough to effect the temporary classifying of the whole school.\n\n2. Give Each Class a Short Drill and Assign a Lesson.\u2014A short, lively drill, or review exercise, will help you to know more about each pupil, and to assign him to the proper class. Avoid embarrassing or confusing the pupils; your object is to find out what they know and of what they are capable. Assign a short lesson for study, with necessary directions as to how it ought to be prepared.\n\n3. Promote or Put Back as You find it Best.\u2014Pupils who are clearly in the wrong class should be changed at once, and without hesitation. The first day is by far the best time to make changes. Inform the pupils that other changes will be made as you find it necessary.\n\n4. During the first Half Day all the Classes may be Organized.\u2014During the first week each pupil may be permanently classed. A teacher who requires two or three weeks for the organization of a school evidently has mistaken his calling. It is better, at the outset, to put pupils in classes below their natural position than in those above it, for it causes less bitterness to promote to a higher class than to put back to a lower; but, with a little tact, the latter may be done without opposition. Let the pupil feel that the classification is for his good, and that you will be glad to promote him as soon as he is fit for it, and you will not only reconcile him to his present position, but also furnish him with a powerful motive for exertion.\n\nV. THE TEACHER CLASSIFIES.\n\n1. The Right of the Teacher to Classify is Unquestioned.\u2014The pupil is not prepared to choose his studies. The dictation of parents would render classification impossible. Schoolboards have no power to direct the classification; it is strictly professional work. All rulings or decisions to the contrary are discouraging and anti-educational.\n2. The Teacher should Conscientiously Classify his School, regardless of Fear or Favour.\u2014You have but one question to consider, \"To what class does the pupil properly belong?\" Your duty to the child and his parents, to yourself and the profession requires of you a correct classification.\n\n3. Uniform Promotion Examinations.\u2014On the completion of the course of study prescribed for any class, all the numbers of the class are theoretically supposed to be ready and fit for promotion to the division or class immediately above it; but practically this is found to be very far from being the case. Some will be found utterly unfit for promotion, and the conscientious teacher will be compelled to classify them again in the same division as before. Hence he will not unlikely be assailed with charges of partiality and prejudice. Under the system of uniform promotion examinations all the classes of the same standing in an Inspectorate, or in several Inspectorates agreeing to act jointly for the purpose, are subjected to a written examination at the close of term\u2014the same printed questions being supplied to each pupil\u2014and the result of the examination is taken as the basis of promotion. Though not free from objection, the system proves to be at least a valuable help to the teacher, and of course silences all foolish complaints of unfairness.\n\n4. Manage to avoid Conflicts with Pupils or Parents.\u2014Wise management will usually prevent such conflicts. Make no effort to force pupils into branches not generally recognized as elementary. If you show the advantages of these studies, and interest the pupils, it will remove objections. Introduce new things gradually, and with the approval of all whom you can interest.\n\n5. Shun the Clap-trap of the Demagogue.\u2014Classing pupils too high, rushing them through books, showy surface work, and promoting pupils when not prepared, are base, unprofessional tricks, and are characteristics of the demagogue. Popularity gained by thus swindling pupils and patrons will not last. Only by conscientiously doing thorough and good work can you win a reputation that will endure. If unusual pressure is brought to bear on you in order to induce you to promote unqualified pupils, it may be necessary to call in the aid of the County Inspector. It is his duty to assist you in removing objections and overcoming difficulties to the spread of education.\nTOPICAL REVIEW.\u2014SCHOOL CLASSIFICATION.\n\nIntroduction.\n1. Definition.\n2.

They may, however, be made of considerable value in discipline, besides exercising no little effect on the moral and physical education of the pupils.\n\nI. OPENING EXERCISES should be short, interesting, and appropriate. They should be of such a nature that the children may take part in them without violating the conscientious scruples of themselves or their parents; and where such scruples exist, the children should be excused from attending during the progress of the exercises.\n\n1. Singing.\u2014Vocal music will, it is to be hoped, soon be taught as generally in our schools as it now is in Germany. Its ethical and aesthetic value is universally acknowledged, and its place as a part of the opening exercises can hardly be called in question. If the teacher cannot lead the singing in person he will be unfortunate indeed if he cannot get some pupil to do it for him.\n\n2. Bible Reading.\u2014The reverential reading of a short, appropriate passage of Scripture should form a part of the opening or closing exercises of every school in this Christian land. The Bible is now read without objection in a vast proportion of the schools on this continent, and wherever else the English-speaking races live; but if any parents object to their children being present, they should of course be excused\u2014they may remain in the cloak-room, without suffering any injury, during the few minutes of the opening. The reading may be either by the teacher, or the pupils, or both. In either case it should be unaccompanied by any comment or remark whatever.\n\n3. Prayer.\u2014A short form of prayer, approved by competent authority, may be offered up by the teacher; after which the Lord's\nPrayer should be repeated reverently by the teacher and the pupils together.\n\n4. Roll-Call.\u2014Many teachers find it convenient to have their roll-call immediately after the opening exercises, allowing sufficient time for the excused pupils to enter and take their places. In small schools it is well to call the names of all the pupils; in larger schools the class monitors may give the numbers or names of absentees. As soon as the permanent classification is completed, the teacher will have the map of the pupils, as seated, in his mind's eye, and can thus at a single glance ascertain who are the absentees. It should not take more than a minute each day to mark the attendance of any school in the register.\n\nII. METHODS OF SEATING.\u2014The seating of the school is the embodiment of the teacher's ideal of symmetry and fitness.\n\n1. Seat with Reference to Size\u2014Because of convenience and symmetry, this plan is in general use. Accepting this as the basis, the thoughtful teacher will make many exceptions.\n\n2. Seat with Reference to Class.\u2014In an ungraded school the observance of this direction must, at best, be partial. It should be taken into consideration as far as circumstances will permit.\n\n3. Seat with Reference to Sex.\u2014The orthodox way is safest for the young teacher. The boys and girls are seated on opposite sides of the room, with a wide aisle between them. Having alternate tiers of boys and girls is found to work well in the hands of a teacher of culture and power. Some teachers secure the best results by having the boys and girls occupy alternate seats.\n\n4. Reserve the Right to Change.\u2014It should be well understood that the teacher may remove a pupil from his seat at any time, and without question. The change may be made for convenience, or to lessen temptation, or to place unruly pupils in the best position to be trained to correct habits.\n\n5. Make the Seating an Educational Means.\u2014Let the teacher study profoundly the problem of social and moral culture. It is within his power to render the seating an important educational means.\n\n6. Government by Seating.\u2014Control your school by seating it properly. As long as your room will admit of it, put but one pupil\non a seat. When a pupil becomes troublesome to his neighbours, remove him to another seat. Place weak pupils with strong ones. Place troublesome pupils in seats where they cannot give trouble.\n\nIII. RECESSES.\u2014Recreation is not less important than study. To properly manage recesses is one of the teacher's most delicate duties.\n\n1. Two Recesses, of not less than ten minutes each, during each half day, give the best results in elementary schools where the pupils are nearly all young; but in the average rural school it will be found better to have one recess of fifteen minutes during each half day. Recesses give an excellent opportunity for the thorough ventilation of the rooms, keeping the pupils all the time fresh, and in a fit condition for vigorous study.\n\n2. All should have Recess at the Same Time.\u2014It is an educational mistake to give the boys and girls separate recesses\u2014it prevents the ventilation of the rooms, throws the classes into confusion, and is objectionable in other ways. The grounds and out-buildings should therefore be arranged with this principle in view. Very little children should, however, be allowed recess more frequently; their work should, in fact, partake, as far as possible, of the nature and the appearance of play, and very much of their time may profitably be spent in the open air when the weather will at all permit.\n\n3. The Teacher Mingles Pleasantly with the Pupils, and watches over them during recess. Invigorating games are encouraged, rudeness and impropriety are checked. If there exists the proper feeling of respect and esteem for the teacher on the part of the pupils, and if he is imbued with a true sympathy in the joys and sorrows of his pupils, he may join frequently in their amusements without the slightest risk of injury to his authority or to his dignity. Nowhere is the presence of the cultured teacher productive of greater good than in the playground. He must carefully avoid the appearance, and still more the reality, of espionage on their movements. Pupils should be put on their honor, and made to feel that they are so put, as early and as far as possible. They will have confidence in the teacher who shows that he has confidence in them, and they will regard his presence in the play-ground as a pleasure rather than a restraint.\nTopical Review.\u2014Opening Exercises, Seating, Recesses.\n\nImportance of So-called Trifles.\n\nInfluence in moral and physical education.\n\nOpening Exercises.\n\n1.

A good beginning, giving favorable first impressions, is a leading element of success. The judicious teacher will leave undone nothing within his power to make his first appearance a success.\n\nI. BE EARLY.\u2014It is the teacher's duty always to be early; but it is his interest, not less than his duty, to be especially careful to be early on the first morning.\n\n1. To see that all is in Readiness.\u2014The house should be clean and warm; and the furniture and apparatus should be ready for use, especially the black-boards and appurtenances. The pupils will not fail to note and to be impressed by such evident proofs of their teacher's interest and desire to promote their comfort and welfare. And this, combined with a kindly greeting of each on his arrival, will predispose them in the teacher's favor.\n\n2. To Welcome the Pupils.\u2014A few kind words spoken to each one as he comes into the school-room will do much good. First impressions are lasting, and it is of vital importance to the teacher that he should produce a good first impression on his pupils; they will imbue their parents and friends with their own ideas, so that the teacher's character and reputation in the section may often be made or marred, according to the doings of the first day of school.\n\n3. To Preserve Order.\u2014While cheerful conversation and laughter are encouraged, no rude or boisterous conduct must at any time be permitted in the school-room. At the very outset it is well to impress the duty of protecting the school-room and its belongings. The children must be trained to treat their temple of learning with as much respect as they would the best room in their mothers' houses.\n\n[72]\nII. ADDRESS OF WELCOME.\u2014Order is promptly called. When all are quiet, you give a short talk, containing ideas something like the following: You are glad to meet the pupils. You will do all you can to help them. Do they wish to learn? Will each one help to make this the best school in the country? The address should be simply an earnest talk with the pupils, and of not more than five minutes' length. Find some topic on which you can make them feel that you are in hearty sympathy with them, and your brief address of welcome will have won half the battle. Short and appropriate opening exercises should follow the address.\n\nIII. FOLLOW YOUR PLAN.\u2014By following a well-digested plan, the young teacher may avoid a world of embarrassment. There is no hesitancy; not a moment is lost. Vigorous work forestalls mischief. The following outline will help the inexperienced teacher to arrange a plan of operation of his own; it is not intended as a model for exact imitation in every case, it must be so changed as to be made specific:\n\n1. After the opening exercises, seat the pupils.\n\n2. Classify the school, and assign lessons. As each class is called, give a short drill. This will require all of the forenoon.\n\n3. Have short recitations of all the classes during the afternoon. Follow a special programme.\n\n4. Make school tactics a speciality during the first week, devoting a few minutes, on each occasion, to drilling the pupils on the suitable tactics. The younger pupils will consider it great fun, and will enter into the drill with keen relish; the older pupils may be inclined to consider the tactics childish and trifling, but a few words on the importance and beauty of tactics in the army and navy, and particularly in the largest and best schools in the country, will bring them to your side.\n\n5. During the last half hour adopt the general regulations.\n\n6. Leave nothing foreseeable to the impulse of the moment. \"What to do,\" \"When to do it,\" and \"How to do it,\" must be thought out before entering the school-room. Observe and study the plans of others, but mature and follow your own.\nVI. SPECIAL DIRECTIONS TO TEACHERS. (Bell.)\n\n1. Upon no other day of the school year does so much depend. The impressions made the first day, especially the first morning, will be lasting, and will have a powerful influence for good or for bad upon all future work.\n\n2. Know definitely the organization of the preceding school, especially the classification, and the page to which each class had advanced. This information can be obtained from the records of the former teacher, or from the pupils. In some way, get the information.\n\n3. See to it that your school-house is in good condition before the school assembles.\n\n4. Prepare carefully your opening exercises, and make them brief. The opening \"talk\" should not exceed five minutes in length, and should be of such a character as to gain the confidence of the pupils and put them at their ease.\n\n5. Announce no rules of order, but say, \"I expect each pupil to do just what he thinks is right. This afternoon we may see about regulations.\"\n\n6. Begin as you expect to continue. Allow no liberty the first day that you do not expect to grant next week and next month.\n\n7. After very brief preliminaries, in the quickest way possible, give each pupil something to DO. One of the quickest ways to do this is to assign work in Arithmetic.\n\n8. Hear classes rapidly, and assign suitable work. A skilful teacher will never allow any of his pupils to become idle.\n\n9. The secret of success in organizing a school lies in the ability of a teacher to assign work promptly, and to keep the pupils busy.\n\n10. Follow as closely as possible the classification and programme of the former teacher, and make changes as experience dictates.\n\n11. Never waste time by taking the names of the pupils the first thing. Any other time is better.\n\n12. Study your work carefully, and have clearly in mind just what you are going to do, and how you are going to do it, before beginning. In this way you will gain and retain the respect and confidence of your pupils.\nTopical Review.\u2014First Day of School.\n\nFirst day most important of term.\n\nThe Teacher should produce a good first impression.\n\nI.

The problem to be solved by every conscientious teacher is, not simply \"How may I keep order?\" but \"How may I so develop the self-governing instincts of my pupils that orderly behavior shall become the chosen law of my school?\" The end of school government is to facilitate growth\u2014mental, moral, and physical; but this growth must be the result of voluntary and well-directed effort. The child is to be developed into the self-reliant, self-determining man. His vicious habits are to be broken up, and right habits formed in their stead. These results are not to be attained by force, nor by mere authority, nor by iron rules, nor by cruel punishments. It is, indeed, possible to \"keep order\" by such means; but it is the \"order\" of the slave, not of the loving subject. We have known schools in which the pupils had been reduced to a more than clock-work precision of uniform behavior by the terrorism of a martinet master; but the lessons of obedience and precision enforced by such discipline have seldom been lasting,\u2014their educational value must always be very slight. The teacher must constantly bear in mind that the future\nsuccess of his pupils depends not more on the intellectual progress they may make during their school years, than on the formation of such habits as will fit them for the proper discharge of their duties in the great world without. They must be led to love and choose the good, and to hate and reject the bad. By judicious, painstaking, conscientious training, principles must be converted into habits. As the best instructor is the one who renders his pupils independent of himself, so the best disciplinarian is the one who trains his pupils to govern themselves,\u2014who creates such a love of order throughout the school that the disorderly or disobedient pupil would find himself at once discredited by the public opinion of the little community around him.\n\nGoverning power, in its educational sense, is ability to train to the habit of self-control. It is the capacity to marshal and render effective all educational resources. The teacher spares no effort to master the elements of governing power, and, thus armed, he assumes the responsibility of child-culture with reasonable hopes of success.\n\nI. SYSTEM IS THE FIRST ELEMENT OF GOVERNING POWER.\u2014System characterizes all good government, human and divine. It is a condition of success in all fields of human achievement. The three factors in system are Time, Place, and Method.\n\n1. System means a Time for Everything.\u2014Order, regularity, and promptitude are the pillars of government. How admirably ordered is the well-regulated household! The rising, the retiring, and the meals, occur each at its appointed time, and thus confusion is prevented and comfort produced. A network of railroads is a grand exhibition of the power of system. The time-table has revolutionized society, and the nations have learned to move to the rhythm of the rail. Napoleon once said to his officers, \"Give your men plenty to eat and plenty to do, and you will find little difficulty in governing them.\" \"Steady and congenial employment for the people\" is the profoundest maxim of human government. \"Keep the pupils interested and busy\" is the best rule ever given for the management of schools. The school programme, by providing congenial employment for each pupil during each portion of the school day, lays the foundation for good government.\n2. System means a Place for Everything.\u2014\"A place for everything, and everything in its place,\" is as important to the teacher as to the housekeeper or the mechanic; it enables him to secure good order with great readiness. The teacher's desk, the pupils' desks, the apparatus, the school-room, and the grounds, should be models of order and neatness. The pupils being thus trained to habits of order in the school-room will be prepared to carry their orderly habits through life.\n\n3. System means Method in doing Everything.\u2014All general school movements and exercises,\u2014such as calling and dismissing school, class tactics, drill and calisthenic exercises,\u2014should be conducted with military precision. Time is thereby gained, the harmony of concerted movement is secured, the interest of the pupils is assured, they thus acquire habits of prompt obedience, and learn to move to the rhythm of society.\n\nII. ENERGY IS THE SECOND ELEMENT OF GOVERNING POWER.\u2014Energy is the magic wand to which all obstacles yield. System plans and organizes the work of the school; Energy inspires and maintains its motion.\n\n1. The Teacher should possess Boundless Energy.\u2014A well-ordered school is like a mighty engine, equipped with all the requisite machinery, but wanting the application of the steam power to be ready for the performance of its work. The energy of the teacher is the steam power of the school, and he, the engineer who applies it. Energy keeps the grounds, the house, the furniture, and the apparatus in the best possible condition. Energy prepares all available means of illustration, infuses the utmost life and vigor into the recitation, and meets and overcomes difficulties. Energy studies the disposition and capacity of each pupil, and adapts the management and work to each. Energy evokes and directs every power of every pupil. Indomitable energy compensates for many faults, and almost compels success.\n\n2. A Lazy Teacher is an Intolerable Nuisance.\u2014He keeps his seat through the livelong day. He prepares no lessons and gives no illustrations. In sleep-producing monotones he drawls through the weary hours. Under his administration dulness or disorder reigns, mischief and meanness flourish. He may \"keep\nschool,\" but he can never educate. The school is a failure in his hands, and he is a pauper supported by the public funds.\n\nIII. VIGILANCE IS THE THIRD ELEMENT OF GOVERNING POWER.\u2014\"Eternal vigilance is the price of victory.\" However perfect the engine, and however great the energy of steam, the constant vigilance of the engineer is indispensable. However systematic the organization, and however intense the energy of the teacher, no school can be successfully managed without untiring vigilance. It is needed for the prevention even more than for the correction of disorder, and should be exercised to discover merit not less than to detect wrong.\n\n1. The Teacher must know his School, and hence must use his eyes and ears. To govern well he must know his pupils, their feelings, their purposes, and their aspirations. He must be thoroughly in sympathy with them so that he can see and hear in detail all that happens, and thus be able to correct disorder. His observation of his pupils and their doings should be that of a kind, judicious, sympathetic friend, not that of a lynx-eyed, list-slipped detective.\n\n2. Vigilance Prevents as well as Corrects Faults.\u2014Careless government fosters crime in the State; it encourages disorder in the school, and renders its punishment unpopular and ineffective. On the other hand vigilant government anticipates and prevents crime; the eye of the watchful teacher dissuades from doing wrong, discovers and encourages every effort to do right.\n\n3. The Vigilant Teacher seldom finds Fault.\u2014Fault finding is one of the most hurtful habits with which any teacher could be cursed; and he who indulges in it will soon find that his constant complaints and reproofs are utterly void of effect, and that his influence over his pupils has vanished. So many of the faults of children arise from mere childish giddiness that the judicious teacher will find it politic as well as humane to pass them over without notice of any kind whatever. But serious faults should invariably meet with serious reproof; violation of principle, with suitable punishment.\n\n4. The Vigilant Teacher Watches to Encourage.\u2014As the judicious teacher should frequently ignore the unintentional\nerrors of thoughtless childhood, so ought he on the other hand to be constantly on the alert to discover every sign of honest effort to do right. Nothing can well have a better effect in strengthening the half-formed good resolutions of the pupils than the consciousness that a kind, wise, sympathising friend is ever on the look out, not to detect and punish, but to encourage and assist by a kindly word or look.\n\nIV. WILL POWER IS THE FOURTH ELEMENT OF SUCCESS.\u2014Will may be termed decision of character\u2014persistency of purpose\u2014the unflinching determination to succeed, that bears down all opposition and makes success an almost foregone conclusion. In all ages it has been the iron will that has mastered the world, and has stamped the impress of its personality on the laws of the nations. The laws of the School should be so administered as to show that a resolute will as well as a kindly heart is possessed by the teacher who controls it. Law pervades the universe. The child must be taught to know law, to love law, to sustain law.\n\n1. School Management must be Uniform and Certain.\u2014System must be strictly enforced. A vacillating, temporizing policy is as fatal to good scholarship as it is to good government. A good easy teacher is generally good for nothing. The determined teacher will hold the reins firmly, and will train to orderly habits and efficient work.\n\n2. The Teacher needs a Powerful Will.\u2014This trait characterizes the great men and women of all ages. To resist opportunities, to counteract fickleness, and to train to form and follow plans, requires the utmost firmness. To develop decision of character, to infuse iron into child-nature, and to fit youth for achievement, is possible only to the teacher with great will power.\n\n3. The Firm Hand is best for the Pupils.\u2014The teacher kindly but firmly holds the pupil to systematic work. The soldier obeys without question. The pugilist submits absolutely to his trainer. How much more should the pupil yield implicitly to the requirements of a loving teacher! Have your plans and purposes clearly defined and arranged, and then carry them out without flinching. Firmness will do much to secure the confidence of your pupils, and to render the work of government easy and effective.\nV. SELF-CONTROL IS THE FIFTH ELEMENT OF GOVERNING POWER.\u2014The great general remains calm in the midst of the battle. The statesman is not excited by the tumult of partyism. Still more does the teacher of youth need to be calm amid all storms. He moulds as well as governs. To teach his pupils the lesson of self-control is his highest duty, and before he is able to teach the lesson to others he must have thoroughly mastered it himself.\n\n1. Self-Possession greatly Aids Self-Control.\u2014The teacher needs to keep all his powers well in hand, ready for every work and prepared for every emergency.\n\n2. Anger must be Crushed.\u2014Exhibitions of temper do incalculable injury. The violent teacher loses the respect of his pupils\u2014loses all moral power over them. If he succeeds at all, his must be a government of force, blunting all the finer feelings and susceptibilities of his pupils, and rendering them morose, discontented, and deceitful. The importance of avoiding all exhibitions of anger can hardly be too earnestly urged.\n\n3. Impatience must be Repressed.\u2014A hundred things occur daily to render the teacher irritable and impatient. To yield is ruin. The teacher needs a world of patience. Child-nature is full of perversity, and child-mind develops slowly. Wesley's mother would tell him the same thing twenty times; and many children of the present day require equal patience.\n\n4. Antagonisms must be Suppressed.\u2014To suffer antagonism to spring up between yourself and a pupil or a patron is a serious mistake. Control yourself and thus control others. Never wilfully excite the antagonism of others, if you can avoid it without sacrifice of principle or loss of self-respect. A deservedly popular teacher will find numberless opportunities of doing good not only to his pupils but throughout the section.\n\n5. Cheerfulness Helps Self-Control.\u2014Cheerfulness is an electric power. There is no one thing that will do more to make a well-qualified teacher successful than cheerfulness. As the cheerful mother will do much to make sunshine and happiness in the home circle, so the teacher who can be habitually cheerful will be very sure to have a pleasant, happy, and successful school.\nVI. CONFIDENCE IS THE SIXTH ELEMENT OF GOVERNING POWER.\u2014There should be reciprocal confidence between the teacher and all who come within the sphere of his operations,\u2014the pupils, parents, trustees, and residents of the section. If the teacher is fit to hold his position it is only fair that he should enjoy the confidence of the community in return. Next to an implicit faith in the love of a Higher Power, the teacher will find his strongest support in the assurance that he deserves and enjoys the affection and esteem of those among whom his lot is cast.\n\n1. Confidence in the Pupils.\u2014The surest way to render your pupils worthy of confidence is to trust them. You will seldom find your confidence mis-placed, and if you should occasionally be deceived it will still be better that your pupils should consider themselves acting \u201con honour\u201d than that you should prove the impossibility of being over-reached, by adopting a system of espionage, eaves-dropping, and mistrust that would disgrace the secret service of a despotism. Let the pupils know that you expect them to act honorably, and they will generally do as they are expected to do. They will appreciate at its true value the vigilance you may find it necessary to employ in guarding them from evil; and you will have the satisfaction of seeing them grow up into open-hearted, generous, whole-souled boys and girls. Suspicion is the mark of a weak, cowardly, cruel disposition; it can only produce falsehood, injustice, and treachery. We want our Canadian youth to grow up with the constant feeling that they are expected to do right, and are for this reason trusted by their teachers.\n\n2. Self-confidence means a well-grounded assurance on the part of the teacher that he is able to do what he undertakes; it is very far from being synonymous with overweening egotism, or inordinate self-esteem. It must be based\u2014(1), on sound scholarship; (2), on knowledge of child-nature; (3), on familiarity with the principles and practice of school management. With a fair amount of self-confidence the well-prepared teacher may reasonably expect to succeed; without it success is impossible. He must, however, carefully guard against allowing his self-confidence to degenerate into an offensive self-assertion. Human nature will not accept the arrogant assumption of superiority without protest or resentment.\nVII. POWER TO PUNISH JUDICIALLY IS THE SEVENTH ELEMENT OF GOVERNING POWER.\u2014Punishment, as an educational means, is essentially corrective, its main object being to lead the pupils to see their faults and correct them; it should also be preventive, having the effect of deterring possible offenders from the commission, or at least from the repetition, of offenses, by proving to them that the violation of rules is not only wrong but is inevitably followed by punishment as its natural consequence.\n\n1. The necessity for punishment becomes less and less in proportion as the teacher possesses the other elements of governing power; but no teacher need expect to be able to succeed without at times inflicting punishment of some kind. He should earnestly strive to carry on the work of education with as little help from punishment as possible; and when it is necessary to inflict it, he should see that it be judicious and judiciously administered.\n\n2. The Art of Judicious Punishment is a rare accomplishment. It means the ability so to punish as to increase the pupil's respect and love for you, and at the same time to awaken in him a resolve to forsake the wrong and do the right. He must be convinced that the punishment is inflicted for his good, that it is just, and that it is the natural consequence of his fault.\n\nVIII. CULTURE IS THE EIGHTH ELEMENT OF GOVERNING POWER.\u2014Culture of mind, culture of manners, and culture of voice vastly augment the teacher's power to govern.\n\n1. Culture of Mind.\u2014Thorough scholarship commands respect. We honor men and women with well-developed and well-stored minds. The ignoramus is despised, and soon comes to grief.\n\n2. Culture of Manners.\u2014The teacher is a model. Pupils tend to become like their teacher. Hence, our teachers should be refined ladies and gentlemen. The coarse, ill-mannered, dowdyish teacher not only fails to govern, but also becomes a positive influence for evil, in the school and in the section.\n\n3 Culture of Voice.\u2014The human voice is one of the grandest instruments devised by the Creator for government and instruction. Everyone feels and acknowledges the power of correct elocution\nand judicious selection of words; and yet, how few teachers think it necessary to attend to these matters in the daily routine of the school-room. In the training of dumb animals we recognize and act on the necessity for correctness of articulation, tone, pitch, emphasis, etc.; it is surely of no less importance to attend carefully to these things in the control and education of the rational beings who look up to, and, consciously or unconsciously, imitate the manners, language, and even the very tones of their instructors.\n\n4. Practise what you Teach.\u2014Good manners and a pleasing elocution are very important parts of an education, and their possession wonderfully increases the teacher's power to govern.\n\nThe best governed schools are often found in charge of girls under twenty years of age. Gentle manners, with a low, earnest voice, largely explain the mystery. Rough, double-fisted men are no longer selected to master the unruly boys of the section.\n\nIX. HEART-POWER IS THE NINTH ELEMENT OF GOVERNING POWER.\u2014This means the ability to win and to retain the respect, the confidence, and the love of all\u2014colleagues, teachers, parents, and pupils; it is the power of governing through the highest and most ennobling motives. The worthy teacher invariably possesses this power in some degree, as a gift of nature, which he may cultivate and improve; the charlatan never possesses it, never succeeds in his endeavours to imitate it.\n\n1. The Teacher must Work for his Pupils.\u2014His days and nights must be consecrated to their interests, his constant thoughts must be employed in devising means to make them happy and to do them good. The school-room and all its surroundings should be made and kept as beautiful and as attractive as his ingenuity can make them; and the daily feast of learning should be as palatable and as instructive as his most earnest efforts can render it.\n\n2. The Teacher must Love his Pupils.\u2014\"We love God because he first loved us.\" The loving teacher, ever affable, kind, and considerate, is certain to win respect, confidence, and love. Love wins love. Kindness, combined with judicious executive ability, will govern a school better than all arbitrary law possible,\n3. Despotism is a Mistake.\u2014The cold, repulsive tyrant may have forced quiet, and may compel good lessons; but he creates an atmosphere in which all hateful passions and habits are fostered.\n\n5 Obedience should be Cheerful and Glad.\u2014In the sunshine of confidence and love, all that is lovely in child-nature buds and blossoms and bears fruit. Lessons are a feast and an endless delight. The teacher is a kind, loving friend, leading pupils up to all that is beautiful and desirable.\n\nHeart-power renders school government easy; but the wise teacher will not make it his sole dependence. All the elements of governing power should be employed.\n\nX. TEACHING POWER IS THE TENTH ELEMENT OF GOVERNING POWER.\n\nTeaching Power is the ability to enlist and direct the whole energies of the learner\u2014to secure such effort as will result in culture and in scholarship. Good teaching requires good scholarship, though good scholarship by no means necessarily implies the power to teach well. Genuine teaching arouses, interests, and directs the pupil, makes him eager to learn, and finally causes him to know what will render him a powerful, useful, noble member of society. To be a thoroughly successful governor of a school, it is often sufficient to be a thoroughly good teacher; for the good teacher is able to enlist the energies of the pupils so deeply in the cause of study that they will neither have time nor inclination for the ordinary disturbing influences of the school-room. They catch the enthusiasm of the teacher, and order is the natural result of their cheerful, earnest work. The enthusiastic teacher must not, however, rely entirely on his teaching power; he will find it useful, if not absolutely necessary, to utilise the other elements of governing power in order to produce the highest and best results.\n\nXI. MANAGING POWER IS THE ELEVENTH ELEMENT OF GOVERNING POWER.\u2014Skill, wisdom, tact, common sense are some of the terms by which this element of power is designated. It has a world of meaning.\n\n1. The Teacher should be a Man among Men.\u2014He not only manages the children, but also directs the educational work of the section. He is the natural leader in all movements that tend to improve and elevate,\n2. Co-operation must be Secured.\u2014One can not do much. It is co-operation that builds railroads, manages school systems, and establishes States. To make a school successful demands the hearty co-operation of the entire section. To secure this requires tact, management. While guiding, the teacher must often seem to follow.\n\n3. Everything must be Turned to Advantage.\u2014Defeat must be changed to victory. The angry opponent who comes to give trouble must be sent away a warm friend of the teacher. Misconduct must be made the occasion for deepening the love of right. Evils must be attacked and conquered in detail. Opposing forces must be made to counteract each other, and thus promote the welfare of the school. Every agency must be utilized for the development and discipline of the natural powers of the pupils\u2014to lead them onward and upward to higher and still higher platforms of excellence, removing the evil and cultivating the good, as the child grows into the youth, the youth into the man, armed and equipped at all points for the great battle of life, the battle that must be fought by every child of Adam.\n\nConcluding Remarks.\u2014Teaching is incomparably the greatest work on this earth. The noblest creations of Art fade and crumble. Cities and nations and worlds grow old and pass away. Minds only are immortal. The teacher\u2019s work alone endures. Minds grandly developed; hearts attuned to the true, the beautiful, and the good; lives devoted to every ennobling work; spirits occupying a lofty position among the eternal tenantry of God\u2019s boundless universe\u2014these are to be the everlasting monuments of the teacher\u2019s labours.\n\nTopical Review.\u2014Elements of Governing Power.\n\nIntroduction.\n\n1.

Wise regulations establish and foster system. The old schoolmaster, with all his rules and all his rods, belongs to the past. Though often a blundering despot, he did what he could. Peace to his ashes. The goodish modern teacher, with no rules and no rods, is the opposite extreme. The efficient teacher will equally avoid these dangerous extremes. The coming teacher, with necessary regulations, wisely enforced, is the true mean.\n\nThe object of School Regulations is not simply to keep order, but rather to facilitate the moral training of the pupils, to develop the sense of right and duty, and to strengthen the innate power of self-control.\n\nI. PRINCIPLES RELATING TO SCHOOL REGULATIONS.\u2014Great principles underlie all educational processes. Principles, and not whim or caprice, determine plans and test methods.\n\n1. Few.\u2014School Regulations should be Few, but Exhaustive. Simplicity is of primary importance in school management. Many rules occasion much friction, and cause a vast amount of waste labor in education.\n\n2. General.\u2014School Regulations should be General rather than Special. They should be such as apply to all pupils and all schools. Special regulations with specific penalties should be exceptional.\n\n3. Popular.\u2014School Regulations should Merit the Approval of All. They should be so evidently just and proper as to command the approval and support of all\u2014teachers, patrons, and pupils. The influence of public sentiment is immense.\n\n4. Practicable.\u2014School Regulations should be such as the Teacher can and will Enforce. Rules or laws not enforced tend to bring all rules and laws into contempt.\n5. Educational.\u2014All Regulations should aim at the Formation of Right Habits. It must be constantly borne in mind that the mere acquisition of book lore is only one of the purposes for which pupils attend school. The object of school-life is to prepare for real life, to make ready for the discharge of the duties and responsibilities of citizenship.\n\n6. Positive.\u2014Regulations should be Positive, not Negative. Prohibitions should be sequences of positive regulations. To inculcate positive duties and to strengthen the moral sense are the objective points to be kept in view in the framing and enforcing of rules.\n\nII. GENERAL REGULATIONS.\u2014The following regulations have been drawn up in accordance with the foregoing principles, and, though few and brief, they will be found sufficiently comprehensive to cover nearly all the ground. They are in use in every school in which true education is being carried on, and they can be enforced with very little difficulty.\n\n1. Regularity.\u2014Teachers and Pupils must be Regular in their Attendance. Each teacher and each pupil must be present every day and every half day during the term, unless prevented by sickness or some equally weighty and unavoidable cause of absence.\n\n2. Promptitude.\u2014Teachers and Pupils must be Prompt in the Discharge of every Duty. Regularity and promptitude are the pillars of good school discipline.\n\n3. Decorum.\u2014Teachers and Pupils must observe strict Decorum. Decorum means proper conduct, good manners, and becoming behaviour. It means to do the proper thing at the right time, and in the right way.\n\n4. Quiet.\u2014Teachers and Pupils must study to be Quiet. In every working school there will be the hum of business, but teachers and pupils study to avoid unnecessary noise, and to produce a pleasant stillness. While the boisterous school is both unpleasant and injurious, the death-like stillness of inactivity is equally to be avoided.\n\n5. Communication.\u2014All Communications during School Hours must be made through the Teacher. The observance of this rule\nprevents a large proportion of the disorder often noticed in schools. Pupils must not communicate by talking, by writing, or by voluntary signs.\n\n6. Morality.\u2014Teachers and Pupils must sustain good Moral Characters. School government should be positive. It is not enough that pupils avoid all immorality. The positive virtues must be developed into habits. Truthfulness, honesty, benevolence, and fidelity must be systematically cultivated.\n\nIII. SPECIAL REGULATIONS.\u2014The above general regulations are exhaustive. Very few cases will arise that do not legitimately fall under these rules. But the peculiar circumstances, the special application, the necessary details, and the proper enforcement of general regulations may on occasion require special regulations.\n\nThe general regulations should be adopted at the close of the first day; special regulations should be adopted from time to time as they become necessary.\n\n1. Special Regulations are intended to Specify and Enforce General Regulations.\u2014The pupils should have their attention called to the fact that these are not new rules, but simple sequences or corollaries, of the general regulations, intended to explain them.\n\n2. Special Regulations should only be adopted when Necessary.\u2014Care must be taken to avoid the accumulation of school regulations. They should be few and brief; and should not be adopted till the necessity for having them is evident to the school.\n\nIV. ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS.\u2014The teacher should never lose sight of the fact that his authority is paramount in the school-room; nor should he allow this fact to be ignored by others, whether pupils or outsiders. But it will greatly aid him in carrying on the discipline of the school, if he will call the pupils into consultation in the framing and adoption of the regulations necessary for their government. They will much more readily, cheerfully, and intelligently obey laws that have to some extent been made by themselves than rules that have the appearance of being arbitrarily imposed upon them by the teacher. Besides\nwhich, the habit of making, obeying, and sustaining their own laws will do much to prepare them for the realities of life, and to fit them for discharging the duties of intelligent, self-governing, law-abiding citizens.\n\n1. Presentation.\u2014The Teacher Proposes and Explains the Regulations. These must of course be in harmony with the School Law of the province, and must be suited to the requirements of the school. The teacher prepares the regulations beforehand, proposes and explains them to the pupils, and thus leads them to adopt such rules as his experience proves to be necessary and useful.\n\n2. Adoption.\u2014The Teacher and Pupils Adopt the Regulations. Having explained the regulations to the pupils, the teacher joins in their adoption. By thus acting with them he shows that rules are for his guidance as well as for the government of the children. He thus raises them in their own esteem and imposes on them the very strongest obligation to obedience, because they cannot but feel that the regulations are self-imposed rules of conduct, not arbitrary laws imposed without their consent.\n\n3. Pledge.\u2014The Teachers and Pupils Pledge themselves to Help each other in Obeying and Sustaining the Regulations. Such a pledge is eminently proper, and is a powerful means of promoting good conduct; it stimulates the pupils' efforts to do right until they become fixed habits. It would be an idle ceremony to adopt regulations, unless a mutual pledge be taken to abide by them and to carry them into effect.\n\n4. Approval.\u2014The School Board Approves the Regulations. It will be judicious in all cases to submit the regulations for the approval of the Board of Trustees. It will show them that the teacher and pupils are determined to start right, and it may stimulate and strengthen the board in the desire to supply the necessary equipment for the school. Their approval will, in any case, strengthen the hands of the teacher, and place him in a secure position of vantage, when any case of discipline arises requiring the attention and interference of the trustees.\n\n5. Enforcement.\u2014The Teacher Enforces the Regulations. The fitness of this arrangement is apparent to every pupil. The teacher is the natural head of the school, to whom they look for instruction,\nfor advice, and for the maintenance of law and order. The pupils have pledged themselves to abide by the regulations, and to assist the teacher in enforcing them. How he may best do so will be pointed out in the next chapter.\n\n6. Method of Adopting.\u2014This may vary according to the number of the pupils, their ages, and other considerations. In general, the teacher may call the school to order at the close of the first day, or on any more suitable occasion if such should present itself, and the regulations should then be proposed, discussed, and adopted in accordance with the general system of school tactics.\n\nSome such plan as the following will generally be found speedy and effective; it is not intended for universal imitation, but will help to indicate the course to be pursued:\n\nThe attention of the school is called to the necessity for some regulations. As the state must have laws, so the school must have regulations.\n\nTeacher.\u2014How many think that the teacher and pupils should be prompt?\n\nPupils all raise their hands.\n\nTeacher.\u2014How many are in favour of making promptitude one of our regulations?\n\nPupils all raise their hands.\n\nTeacher.\u2014All that will join with me in a pledge to make an earnest effort to be prompt while connected with the school, please rise.\n\nPupils all rise.\n\nIn a few minutes, at the close of the first day, the six regulations may be unanimously adopted. In rare cases a pupil may refuse to rise. After dismissing the school, talk the matter over with him, and secure his pledge. As new pupils enter, they may be pledged privately or before the school.\n\nTeachers-in-training in the Model and Normal Schools will receive special instruction from the Principal as to the best method of proposing and adopting general and special regulations.\nTopical Review.\u2014School Regulations.\n\nExtremes and mean.\n\n1.

Enforcement.\u2014The teacher enforces the regulations.\n6. Method of adopting.\u2014Will be illustrated in the Model and Normal Schools.\nCHAPTER III.\n\nENFORCEMENT OF SCHOOL REGULATIONS.\n\nThe Adoption of General Regulations in accordance with some such intelligent plan as that suggested in the preceding chapter will greatly help the teacher in carrying them into effectual operation; but he will be sadly in error if he supposes that adoption is the only thing necessary for enforcement. It is, indeed, highly probable that the pupils, elated by the thought that their teacher has considered them so far worthy of confidence as to consult them in the preparation of the regulations, will make strenuous efforts at first to conform to the rules in whose fairness they have acquiesced, and that their conduct will, therefore, be as nearly perfect for a brief period as could possibly be expected from children of their age. But the experienced teacher will not dare to hope that such perfection of discipline will last; he knows that the young citizens of his commonwealth are intensely human, prone to yield to the impulse of the moment, and almost as liable to violate regulations as are their elders: and, consequently, he will adopt every means within his power to strengthen their good impulses, and to help them in their efforts to cheerfully observe the rules.\n\n\"How Shall I Enforce the Regulations?\" is one of the most important questions that can be asked by the inexperienced teacher, and it is one of the most difficult to answer. The regulations are based on sound principles; but great wisdom is needed in the application and adaptation of the principles. Each teacher must take into consideration all the conditions of his school and of the community, and then do the best he can under all the circumstances. He must remember, however, that it is his bounden duty to enforce the regulations; the more tact he can employ in doing so the better it will be for himself, his pupils, and the whole community.\n\nPrinciple of Duty.\u2014Pupils should be trained to feel that they have special duties to themselves, their fellow-pupils, their\nparents, and their teacher, and that these duties, as well as their higher duty to their Creator, place them under an obligation to redeem the pledge they have given to obey and to help each other to obey the general regulations adopted by the school.\n\nI. REGULARITY.\u2014Irregularity, in rural sections especially, is a serious evil, and no effort should be spared to reduce it to a minimum. It is very frequently the fault of the parents, who are only too ready to keep the children at home for trifling causes; but it is also too commonly the result of indifference on the part of the children themselves; and occasionally, we fear, it is due to the negligence of the teacher. It is a good thing to find out first of all what is the cause of the evil, and then apply the appropriate remedy.\n\n1. Intensely Interest the Pupils.\u2014Make the school as attractive in every respect as you can possibly make it. Prepare each lesson so thoroughly that you will be able to teach it in such a way as to interest every pupil, and make them feel that your lessons proceed in such a well-graded plan that they cannot stay away for even one day without losing something specially interesting and important. Impress your pupils with the truth that success in school depends on regularity, and that in the outer world no amount of cleverness will make an irregular person successful or respected. If you thoroughly interest the children and make them anxious to get to school they will generally manage to be regular.\n\n2. Interest the Parents.\u2014Show how it is that an irregular pupil falls behind his classes and becomes discouraged. The intelligent parent will not willingly detain a child from a single recitation. Point out to them that the occasioned absence of other children causes inconvenience and loss to theirs; and get them thus to see that in detaining their own children at home they are not only injuring them but also violating their duty to their neighbors. Teachers must do much missionary work of this kind.\n\n3. Urge Regularity as a Duty.\u2014The pupil should make the most of himself. He should so act as not to injure himself or others. Irregularity injures the pupil and also the school. Moreover it disappoints the hopes of the parents, and is a serious annoyance and inconvenience to the teacher.\n4. Inflict necessary Punishments.\u2014To say the least, irregularity is a misfortune, for which the pupil must suffer the consequences. If the habit becomes chronic, it may work a forfeiture of seat, of position in class, or even of position in school, as events decide. The School Law provides that habitual irregularity is a sufficient cause for the suspension of a pupil; it may become the painful duty of the teacher to carry the law into effect, as a punishment to the offender and a warning to those who may have been influenced by his bad example.\n\nII. PROMPTITUDE.\u2014Schools wisely vie with each other in the effort to secure the utmost promptitude. To enforce promptitude\u2014\n\n1. Let the Teacher be Prompt.\u2014The teacher should be at the school-room at least a quarter of an hour before the time of opening. The teacher's example greatly influences the pupils.\n\n2. Train to the Habit of Promptitude.\u2014A determined teacher will soon revolutionize an entire school and the community. Promptitude is easy when it grows into a habit.\n\n3 Impress the Importance of Promptitude.\u2014Point out the advantages of promptitude and the evils of tardiness. Show the effects of tardiness by examples. Tardy pupils will often miss the first part of a recitation, which usually consists of a review of the previous day's work, and will thus lose their best opportunity of fixing the subject in the memory. Their standing in class is thus materially lowered, and their progress seriously hindered.\n\n4. Arrange for Exceptional Cases.\u2014Promptitude must be secured at any cost; but simple justice requires provision for exceptional cases. Pupils peculiarly situated should not be considered tardy up to a fixed time. It would be obviously unjust to punish such pupils, provided that they reach school as early as the circumstances of their cases will permit; nor would public sentiment sustain the teacher in exacting attendance from them at as early an hour as the other pupils are expected to be present.\n\n5. Exercise Discretion.\u2014In the enforcement of this regulation the teacher should exercise a wise discretion, and adapt the treatment to the community. What will suit one school admirably will not be possible in another; even in the same school what will be easy at one season may be utterly impossible at another.\n6. Inflict appropriate Punishments.\u2014The tardy list works well in some schools. As the tardy pupils enter, they write on the board or slate their names and the number of minutes they are tardy. At recess, when the others pass out, these take the tardy seat. If the explanation shows that the tardiness was unavoidable, the pupil is excused, otherwise he remains seated for about twice the length of time lost. As a general rule, detention is a punishment that should be inflicted as rarely as possible; but if promptitude can be secured in this way only, the teacher must not shrink from adopting it.\n\nIII. DECORUM.\u2014This should characterize every voluntary act. Positions, movements, dress, manners, and conduct, in school and out, are some of the points to be considered.\n\n1. The Teacher should be a Model.\u2014Pupils tend to become like the teacher; hence good manners is an essential qualification of the teacher. An uncouth, ill-mannered, slovenly teacher should never be permitted to disgrace the school room; nor should an overly fastidious, mincing, drawling dandy ever enter the teaching profession,\u2014a calling that more than any other demands the constant exercise of shrewd, sound, practical common sense.\n\n2. Decorum is one of the Conditions of Success.\u2014The well-behaved are everywhere preferred to the ill-behaved. \"He is a gentleman,\" is the best of all passports. When pupils are made to realize that the teacher is a lady, it is not difficult to persuade them to try to be decorous.\n\n3. Teach Decorum Systematically.\u2014A short, practical lesson occasionally will prove of great value. The subject will thus be kept before the teacher and the pupils. These lessons should be full of interest and point; they should aim directly at the correction of such breaches of decorum as seem to call for urgent interference; and they must be given with such delicate tact as to correct the evil without lowering the self-respect of the offenders, or unduly weakening their confidence in the infallibility of their parents. It requires skilful handling, for example, to teach a class that spitting on the floor is a most offensive mark of ill-breeding and vulgarity. Poor children! they have perhaps been accustomed all their lives to see the filthy habit practised by most of those to whose example they would naturally look for their guidance.\n4. Teach Decorum Incidentally.\u2014Children must have concrete cases. As these occur, briefly call attention to them, and commend the decorous.\n\n5. Train to Habits of Decorum.\u2014Precept is good; example is better; training is best. Training converts precepts and examples into habits. Manage to make the pupils act decorously until decorum becomes a habit. Train them to conduct themselves properly everywhere and at all times. The earnest and continuous effort to become decorous will soon grow into a life habit.\n\n6. Right Punishments may be Used.\u2014Some pupils cannot be reached in any other way. Whatever will work in the pupil an appreciation of good manners and proper conduct is legitimate. Violation of the laws of good manners is generally the result of ignorance, and merely to indicate the error will in most cases be sufficient to effect a speedy reformation; but wherever a pupil persists in his offenses against decorum, the teacher should not hesitate to inflict such punishment as may be necessary to bring the offender to a speedy compliance with the regulation.\n\nIV. QUIET.\u2014Pupils and teacher here pledge themselves to study to be quiet; that is, to avoid making unnecessary noise; and it is essential to the comfort and progress of the school that this regulation should be strictly enforced. It is important to bear in mind that the quietness of a well-governed school is a very different thing from the stillness that used to be regarded as the great desideratum in the schools of the olden time, and that is still occasionally exacted by some teachers from whom better things might reasonably be expected. A room full of children so still that \"one might hear a pin drop\" speaks volumes for the crushing power of control that can produce such a phenomenon, but it says very little for the intelligence of the teacher who supposes that absolute silence is synonymous with perfect discipline in the school-room. The school-room is a workshop, and the industry of a busy, earnest community of students can no more be carried on without noise than could the operations of a first-class factory. Do not make the mistake of asking or expecting your pupils to sit still; they cannot be active without noise; but such noise is not disorder; it is only unnecessary noise that causes confusion, and this is what your regulation is intended to repress.\n1. Be Quiet Yourself.\u2014A fussy, noisy, boisterous teacher demoralizes the school, and produces the kind of noise that it is his duty to prevent. Talk earnestly, but in a low, quiet, concentrated tone; move quietly, and avoid all clapping, pounding, and stamping. Energy and vigor can and should be manifested in better ways.\n\n2. Secure Quiet from Principle rather than from Fear.\u2014This must be a cardinal principle in the enforcement of all school regulations; but it is specially important in securing quietness, for the quiet that results from fear is much more likely to be the stillness of inactivity than the orderly quietness of work. The pupil should be trained to feel that he has no right to disturb others, that his duty to his fellow-pupils and the teacher imperatively demands from him an earnest effort to be quiet.\n\n3. Boisterousness in the School-room must Never be Permitted.\u2014During intermission, if the pupils are confined to the house owing to inclement weather, talking and laughing are proper and should be encouraged; but all romping, scuffling, and boisterousness must be tabooed. The school-room must be held sacred to the genius of quietness and order.\n\n4. Train Pupils to do Everything Quietly.\u2014If a pupil does anything noisily, cause him to repeat the act quietly. Soon your pupils will become toned down, and will acquire the habit of speaking and moving quietly. Do not allow them to acquire the cat-like tread of the panther; let them learn to move with the quiet grace of well-bred gentlemen and ladies rather than with the treacherous noiselessness of the burglar and the thief.\n\n5. Use necessary Punishments.\u2014Some vicious and careless pupils can not otherwise be cured of noisy habits. If quietness can not be secured in any other way, you must resort to punishment; but in this and all other things do not try coercion till every other expedient has been tried and proved ineffectual. Let punishment be your last resort.\n\nV. COMMUNICATION.\u2014Necessity has forced all good schools to insist on this regulation being carried out to the very letter. Though exceedingly difficult, it can and must be rigidly enforced. Order cannot otherwise be maintained, and without order there can be no sound education. Even for his own sake\u2014\nfor sake of present peace, and with a view to further advancement in the profession\u2014the teacher should not cease his efforts till he has established non-communication as one of the characteristic virtues of his school. Nothing more clearly proves the teacher to be a good disciplinarian than the successful enforcement of the regulation against communication by voice, by writing, or by sign; and very few things contribute more to the comfort, the prosperity, the morality of the school.\n\n1. Appeal to Principle.\u2014It is not difficult to get the pupils to admit the injurious effects of communication, and to acknowledge that it is their duty to make an earnest, continuous effort to avoid it. It is no less the duty of the teacher to adopt wise means of arousing and directing the conscience of his pupils, and to strengthen and encourage them to comply with this and other regulations, because conscience tells them it is right.\n\n2. Never Grant Permission to Speak.\u2014Say to pupils firmly, \"No.\" Necessary communications can be made through the teacher, or at times set apart for that purpose, and must not be tolerated, much less encouraged, in any other way than that provided by the regulation.\n\n3. Anticipate and Prevent.\u2014By word, or sign, or look, you may prevent the offense; and prevention is infinitely better than correction. Herein lies one of the secrets of the success of the best school managers.\n\n4. Throw Around Pupils the most Favourable Influences.\u2014It is wise to remove the weak from temptation. Place them with the strong and brave. In chronic cases, the pupil may for a time be seated apart from the other pupils.\n\n5. Train your Pupils to the Habit of Non-Communication.\u2014This has been done in thousands of schools, and what others have done you may do. When the act has grown into a habit, very little of your time will be required for preserving order.\n\n6. Cultivate a Determined Purpose.\u2014\"You must not communicate\" should be felt in every nerve and fibre of the school. No quarter must be shown to whispering. Where there is a will, there is a way. Nature never allows the violation of any of her laws without imposing the legitimate penalty; here also the teacher\nmust imitate nature, he must be persistent and must convince the pupils of his resolute determination to enforce the school law of non-communication.\n\n7. Inflict appropriate Punishments.\u2014The habit must be broken up. When other means fail, effective punishment must be used. It is impossible to indicate what the punishment should be. In each case the teacher must do whatever promises the best results. General or private reproof, or changing seats, will usually prove effective.\n\nVI. MORALITY.\u2014Moral culture is by far the most important party of an education; the development of a virtuous character should be the aim of every teacher. Morality is a positive virtue, based upon the intuition, \"I ought,\" and not a mere compliance with a series of prohibitions, \"You must not.\" No system of instruction can succeed in which sound moral principles are not systematically inculcated; nor is the teacher fairly discharging the duties of his office, if he fails, by precept or example, to place before his pupils a high standard of morality, and to encourage them to reach it. It should not be more difficult to produce good character than good scholarship; systematic and persistent effort on the part of the family, the school, and the community will as certainly produce the one as the other.\n\n1. Teach Morality by the Influence of your own Example.\u2014It is impossible to over-estimate the influence for good of the truly worthy teacher. His pupils unconsciously imitate his example, and their characters are steadily moulded into conformity with his. All his impulses must be pure and elevating; his morality must be positive; his conduct must show that he loves the truth and hates iniquity, not in compliance with mere expediency but in obedience to the command of conscience.\n\n2. Teach Morality Systematically.\u2014Regular lessons will do great good, if the teacher has the gift of making them very interesting and practical. It is not advisable that the teacher should usurp the functions of the regularly ordained ministers of religion; he will, in fact, be compelled to use some caution lest his familiar talks on morals should change into laboured sermons on dogma.\n3. Teach Morality Incidentally.\u2014This can be done in connection with Reading lessons, cases of discipline, or when incidents occur involving morality. If timely and persistent, this method will accomplish far more than lectures or set lessons. Morality, like science, can be taught best by concrete examples. Children are repelled by vague abstractions and moral sermons; but the watchful teacher will find many excellent opportunities of instilling sound moral principles from the ordinary lessons and occurrences of the school.\n\n4. Work in the Pupil a Love of the Right and a Hatred of the Wrong.\u2014In reading or telling anecdotes, avoid the details of crime, but show the nobleness of right-doing and the meanness of wrong-doing; show the tendencies and the outcome of the two courses of conduct. This field is unlimited, and full of inspiration.\n\n5. Attack one Vice at a Time.\u2014The skilful general manages to conquer the enemy in detail. So must vices be conquered. Take profanity, then untruthfulness, then dishonesty, etc., and mass all your forces on each in turn. When the first is conquered, attack the second. This is the only successful plan for a campaign against vice, either for the individual, the school, or the community. This does not imply that you are to treat other vices as of little or no consequence. On the contrary, you must resolutely set your face against wrong-doing in all its forms; but a steady, systematic massing of your forces against a particular vice will render your pupils especially watchful, and will more rapidly develop their power to avoid it.\n\n6. Train the Pupil to the Habit of Right-doing.\u2014No amount of moral teaching will answer. Doing good is the only way to become good. Precept lets the pupil hear what is right, example lets him see what is right, training makes him practise what is right. It is as easy to cultivate the practice of good as of evil, if not easier,\u2014as easy, for instance, to train pupils to speak well of their absent fellow-pupils as to slander and malign them,\u2014easier to induce them to help than to hinder each other in advancing. Children have an instinctive love of what is just, generous, and chivalrous; and it is not a difficult task to train this instinct into a habit of doing right from right motives.\n7. Administer Punishments in Love.\u2014See that the wrong-doer suffers the natural consequences of his acts. Kindly but firmly manage to make the pupils get right and keep right. See that the punishment works in the pupil a hatred of the wrong and a love of the right. Ponder before you act. Injudicious punishment is criminal. It breaks down manhood, and is a prolific source of human woe. The objects of punishment are to reform the offender and to prevent others from committing a like offense. Not only the offender but every other pupil in the school, as well, should feel that the teacher is actuated by a strong sense of duty when he inflicts punishment for any cause; that he abstains from it as long as he can possibly do so, consistently with the faithful discharge of his duty to the school, as well as to the individual offender; and that he sorrowfully resorts to it as a last resource in the hope of preventing the formation and spread of evil habits.\n\nAppeal to Conscience as the great motive power in inducing obedience to all regulations.\n\nConscience is a rational emotion; it impels us to do what we believe to be right. Conscience is a feeling of satisfaction in view of right-doing, or a feeling of remorse in view of wrong-doing. \"An approving conscience is the smile of God; remorse, His frown.\" Veneration, honour to parents, truthfulness, honesty, courage, fidelity, virtue, benevolence self-control\u2014everything that elevates and ennobles\u2014must be cultivated from the standpoint of conscience. This becomes, as it ought, the master impulse of the soul. Appetite, passion, selfishness, weakness, yield to the mandates of conscience. An intelligent, conscientious man is the noblest work of God\u2014\n\n\"His mind clear as the mountain air,\nHis heart pure as the driven snow.\"\n\nTo produce such men is the grand end of education. The paramount work of every teacher is the culture of conscience; and this is involved in all that is taught and all that is done in the school-room.\nTopical Review.\u2014Enforcement of School Regulations.\n\nAdoption aids Enforcement.\n\n1.

Here we use it in the sense of punishment in its relations to a life of duty, and, indeed, it was in this sense it was used in the systemless system of the old regime; but the old regime recognized no other instrument of government than punishment\u2014no other instrument of punishment than the rod. With impartial blindness it tried to whip learning into the stupid, manners into the clownish, and morals into the vicious. It never seemed to contemplate the possibility of the pupil's being trained to govern himself, nor of his acting rightly from principle rather than from fear; hence punishment and government were used as synonymous terms. Happily, the educational theories and practices of the world have changed. Punishment\u2014the intentional infliction of suffering upon offenders\u2014is no longer regarded as the chief, much less the only means of school government. Instead of the fear of punishment, the sense of duty has been substituted as the great motive power, and the best teachers expend their most earnest energies in training the children to do right because it is right. If all pupils could be trained to this without calling in the aid of punishment, no right-minded man or woman would ever resort to it\u2014there would be no occasion for its use. But the desire to do right is not implanted with equal ease in the breast of every child, occasionally it requires something more than precept and example to quicken conscience, and herein lies the legitimate function of punishment. Suffering, mental or physical, wisely inflicted, educates conscience. As soon as conscience asserts its supremacy, the discipline of punishment becomes unnecessary, duties are performed from right motives, and the constant performance of duty soon grows into the habit of doing right.\n\n[108]\nThe Problem of School Punishment.\u2014To continue the discipline of suffering, after it has fulfilled its true mission of arousing conscience, would be senseless and inhuman; hence it is a matter of the utmost importance to consider what punishment to inflict at school, as well as when and how to inflict it. No subject connected with school management is more delicate than this, none requires more judgment, discretion, or wisdom. There can be no better test of the general fitness and capacity of a teacher than is furnished by the amount and kind of punishment he finds it necessary to inflict in order to conduct his school efficiently. In applying such a test, the general character and conduct of the community should, of course, be taken into account; but, as a general rule, the best teachers are those who punish the least, and the wisest, those who make the best choice, when punishment must be inflicted.\n\nThe following are some of the more important principles to be considered in connection with the problem of punishment in school:\n\nI. Reformatory.\u2014Punishment should be Reformatory, never Vindictive.\u2014All punishments should tend directly to benefit the punished, and indirectly to benefit the community. The State deals with adults, and hence, in the State, punishment is retributive and not necessarily corrective. The school deals with children; hence school punishments should be corrective rather than retributive. The good of the punished should be the paramount consideration. Vindictive punishment is worthy of the arch-fiend only; it should never be inflicted, either in school or State. It has taken the educational world a long time to discover that reformation and not retribution is the true object of punishment; no doubt the State will in process of time come to see that possibly it may be wiser as well as more humane to attempt the reformation of criminals rather than merely to exact retribution from them. Men, criminals and others, are but children of a larger growth.\n\nII. Self-Control.\u2014Punishment should foster Self-control and Self-respect. Self-government alone is worthy of man. Punishments should tend to foster self-control by working in the offender a firm resolve to forsake the wrong and do the right. Punishments that crush manhood are fiendish.\n\nIII. A Natural Consequence.\u2014The Punishment should be a Natural Consequence of the Offense. This is a fundamental principle\nof the Divine government, and the more closely human governments conform to it, the better. Such punishments, seemingly retributive, are in fact corrective. The relation of the punishment to the offense should be profoundly studied before it is administered.\n\nIV. Mild.\u2014Punishments should be Mild, but Certain. Undue severity creates sympathy for the offender and weakens the moral influence of the teacher. All semblance of cruelty should be avoided, whatever savors of ill-temper or brutality, whatever tends to the injury of the body, mind, or sensibilities of the child, is to be unsparingly condemned. Mild but certain punishments are most effective. Not the amount of pain inflicted, but the effect produced on the character of the child is the important consideration. Spasmodic discipline produces the most injurious effects on child-nature. If he is punished to-day for an offense of which no notice was taken yesterday, he cannot fail to conclude that the punishment does not so much depend on the offense as on the capricious temper of the teacher, and he is thus easily tempted, on the next opportunity, to repeat the offense and take the chances. Justice is the strongest principle in the childish mind, and his sense of justice is outraged by either cruelty or uncertainty in the exercise of discipline.\n\nV. Deliberate.\u2014The Infliction of Punishment should be Deliberate and Infrequent. Not in anger nor in haste should the child be caused to suffer. If possible, both teacher and pupil should have time for reflection. By faithful teaching and wise management, offenses should be prevented and punishment averted. The almost continual and violent punishments inflicted by some teachers and parents are a crying evil.\n\nVI. Loving Heart.\u2014Punishment should be Inflicted in Love. It grieves the teacher to inflict the punishment; he suffers that he may benefit the child. The child realizes that his teacher suffers for him and with him; and the knowledge that the teacher's sympathy is with him even in the act of punishing will do more to open the childish heart and quicken the childish conscience than all the pain that could be inflicted in years of tyranny by a cold, unsympathising martinet.\n\nVII. Educational.\u2014Punishment should be made an Educational Means, and as such it should be essentially Corrective. It seeks always\nto bring the youth to a sense of his wrong-doing, and to produce a positive alteration in his behaviour. It has for its aim his improvement. Every punishment must be looked upon as a means to an end. The pupil should always be conscious that it is painful to the teacher to punish him. Nothing can be more effectual as a means of cure for wrong-doing than for the wrong-doer to perceive in the manner, the tone of voice, and the words, that he who punishes also suffers in order that the wrong-doer may be cured of his fault. \"The principle of vicarious suffering lies at the root of all spiritual healing.\"\n\nBesides aiming at the reformation of the offender, punishment aims at the prevention of offenses. It is deterrent as well as reformatory, and for this reason it must occasionally be administered before the school, as an example and a warning. The teacher's duty is to educate the entire school, and though punishment should in general be inflicted in private, yet should he not hesitate to sink his consideration for the feelings of the individual in his desire to benefit the school, when the circumstances warrant the belief that the public punishment of an offender will have an educational value sufficient to justify the deviation from the general rule. In such cases, the teacher will be careful to guard against even the appearance of vindictiveness, cruelty, or excess.\n\nBENTHAM'S PRINCIPLES.\u2014The following are selected from Bentham's principles pertaining to punishment:\n\n1. The punishment following an offense should exceed the apparent advantage derived from its being committed.\n\n2. The greater the offense, the greater should be the pains taken to secure its punishment.\n\n3. Punishment should never be greater than is needed to prevent a repetition of the offense.\n\n4. Regard should be paid to the sensibility of the offender, as dependent on age, sex, position, health.\n\n5. Punishments should be increased in magnitude as the detection of the offense is uncertain or remote.\n\n6. When the offense is not an isolated act, but an act indicating the existence of a habit, the punishment should outweigh the apparent advantages, not merely of the act, but of the habit.\nGOVERNING FORCES.\u2014Whatever moves to right-doing, and develops the power of self-government, is a governing force in the educational sense. A brief outline of the governing forces is here submitted. They are five in number, viz., intellectual, moral, social, will, and physical forces.\n\n1. Intellectual Forces govern by system through motives.\n\n(a) System.\u2014Intellect matures plans and perfects system; it subjects impulse to reason, and governs by establishing the reign of law.\n\n(b) Motives.\u2014Intellect leads the governed to act from high and ennobling motives. Wise management leads the pupils to choose order.\n\n2. Moral Forces may be sub-divided into conscience and the affections. Man is a moral being, endowed with powers to enable him to appreciate and enjoy the right; his moral qualities fit him to be an inhabitant in a world of duty.\n\n(a) Conscience impels to the Right.\u2014The imperative I ought is a universal intuition. This is the central idea in all government. Without it government, except by physical force, would be impossible. The teacher, by educating conscience, renders the pupil an upright, self-governing being.\n\n(b) Affections.\u2014Rising above all the other faculties are enthroned the affections. Craving objects beyond self, they draw man into communion with his Maker and his kind. Happy the child impelled by love, and trained to do right because it is right!\n\n3. Social Forces.\u2014Man is a social as well as a moral being. Social influences act and re-act. Society is to a great extent regulated by the two great social forces, companionship and public opinion.\n\n(a) Companionship.\u2014Many aphorisms indicate the wide-spread conviction of the great influence, for good or evil, of companionship. Good companionship is a potent educational force, and one of the most powerful of the governing forces. The wise teacher will seek its influence for himself, and cultivate the desire for it in his pupils.\n\n(b) Public Opinion.\u2014It is impossible to estimate the overwhelming force of that subtle, impalpable, irresistible influence known as Public Opinion. By it the masters of assemblies rule. The teacher\nshould be careful, in his little world, to create and guide public opinion aright, and to avail himself of its aid in governing his school.\n\n4. Will Forces.\u2014Man is free and responsible. Will is the self-determining power of the soul.\n\n(a) Self-Control.\u2014We never break the child's will. We cherish free choice from right motives. We develop the power of self-government.\n\n(b) Firmness.\u2014The teacher is firm because he is right. Kindly but firmly he guides. The child is developed into a self-determining and self-acting man. Right motives lead to right determinations and right actions.\n\n5. Physical Forces.\u2014In school, as in society, the use of physical force as a punishment sometimes becomes necessary; but, in the ratio that the higher forces control, it becomes unnecessary to use physical force.\n\n(a) Restraints.\u2014This is probably the most effective way in which physical force can be used in school. By restraints even wild beasts are tamed.\n\n(b) Pain.\u2014Some pupils can scarcely be influenced except through the body. In extreme cases, until higher motives can be brought to bear, it may be necessary to utilize this force.\n\n(c) Comfort.\u2014Favorable physical conditions do vastly more than rules to secure good government.\n\n(d) Recreation.\u2014This is a mighty governing force. If teachers and parents would profoundly and practically study the philosophy of recreation, they would find comparatively little need for punishment.\n\nThe great Public Schools of the old country are, to a large extent, governed and controlled by the esprit de corps formed and fostered in the play-ground, the gymnastum, and the cricket ground. In our own country, too, much more attention is now being paid to the physical culture of the rising generation than was the case in former years; and we may reasonably look for correspondingly better results to the health and discipline of our pupils.\nTopical Review.\u2014Principles Pertaining to School Punishment.\n\nDiscipline defined.\n1.

Such punishments will be found to accord with the principles laid down in the foregoing chapter. They will tend to make the offender strong to do the right and to resist the wrong; and they will diminish the aggregate number of offenses in the school, not by the establishment of a reign of terror, but by the introduction of a healthy moral tone among the pupils. Judicious punishment not only reforms the individual and trains him to right habits, it also enlists the sympathy of his fellow pupils in behalf of the teacher who has effected such a change, makes them wish to help in the work of reformation, and tends gradually to establish duty as a cardinal principle of the community.\n\nBentham gives the following as the characteristics of judicious punishments:\n\n1. **Variability**\u2014They should admit of degrees.\n2. **Equability**\u2014They should admit of equal application under all circumstances.\n3. **Adequacy**\u2014To the offense committed.\n4. **Special Suitability**\u2014To the nature of the offense.\n5. **Exemplariness**\u2014They should be impressive.\n6. **Subserviency**\u2014To reformation.\n7. **Public Popularity**\u2014They should not excite public sympathy in favour of the offender.\n8. **Remissibility**\u2014In case of repentance or of miscarriage of justice.\n\nAs the best of all punishments, we begin with\u2014\n\nI. **Reproof**.\u2014This is an efficient corrective of most faults. Let teachers and parents learn rightly to administer reproof, and they will find the child-heart responding as does the rose-bud to the summer sun.\n1. General Reproof is the mildest and most effective of all school punishments. It alone will suffice to correct a majority of offenses. Some pupil has done wrong. At the proper time, in a low, earnest tone, the teacher speaks of the offense and the offender. No name is mentioned, but the sincere hope is expressed that the offense will not be repeated. Thus kindly and considerately dealt with, the pupil resolves to reform. Other pupils are strengthened by such reproof. The spirit of the school impels to the right.\n\n2. Private Reproof, administered in the right spirit, is wonderfully effective, and works marvellous results. General reproof having failed to induce the pupil to reform, the teacher has a private interview with him. He does not announce his intention to the school by publicly ordering the offender to remain after the closing hour, but finds or makes an opportunity for a strictly private meeting. Kindly and gently he shows the tendencies of such conduct, and asks if he will not at least try to do better for the future. He wishes to help the boy to become a man. Will he help himself? Nay more, will he not help the teacher to set a good example to the rest of the school? He can do it if he will, and the teacher will thoroughly trust him, and help him to overcome the temptations that he himself had found so hard to resist when he was a boy. Such an interview has been the turning point in the formation of the character of thousands. The pupil feels that he and his teacher are standing heart to heart; for the first time, perhaps, he fully realizes that the teacher is also his sincere friend, tenderly anxious for his welfare, and deeply sympathising with him in all his trials and temptations. His heart is touched, and his better nature is aroused, for the time at all events, to an intense desire and resolve to do the right, and thus prove himself worthy of the confidence and esteem of his teacher.\n\n3. Public Reproof is a powerful but dangerous punishment. It should be used sparingly and with great discretion; with some pupils it should never be employed, except for some unusually serious misconduct. It is a fearful thing to break down a pupil's self-respect, and to blunt his regard for public opinion.\n\nBut public opinion has its place. If the pupil cannot be moved by either general or private reproof, the teacher, at some favourable moment, presents the matter to the school, mentions the name of\nthe offender, not to wound his feelings but to arouse him and to give all the pupils an opportunity to aid him in the correction of his faults. If the public opinion of the school is healthy, the offender cannot but feel ashamed of his conduct; and if his shame leads him to resolve on reformation, he will find ready helpers among his companions, who will themselves be greatly benefited in turn by their efforts in his behalf.\n\nII. PRIVATION.\u2014Next to reproof, privation is the best of school punishments. While seemingly retributive, it is essentially corrective. In school government, restraint is as necessary as love, though happily it need not be so frequently employed. The wayward must be disciplined into respect for authority, and made to feel the consequences of misconduct until reformation is effected. Privations are the natural punishments for abused privileges. When reformation has been effected the forfeited privilege should be restored.\n\nThe following are some of the ways in which this punishment may be used to advantage, and slight as these privations may appear, they work marvellous results, silently, slowly, but surely training the pupil to govern himself, and laying the foundation for a noble manhood:\n\n1. Deprive of Seat.\u2014A pupil who is very irregular, or who habitually communicates, or creates disturbance, forfeits his seat. Other offenses may be corrected by the same punishment.\n\n2. Deprive of Recess.\u2014Recess should be enjoyed by all the pupils; but one who during recess mistreats others, uses improper language, or is guilty of bad conduct, should be detained. He may pass out alone after the usual recess. Tardiness, also, may be punished in this way.\n\n3. Deprive of Recitation.\u2014The recitation should be esteemed a privilege. The teacher may excuse a pupil from class for repeated neglect in preparing lessons, for communication, for copying from others, for improper conduct, or for rude answers. To be thus excused is keenly felt by most pupils. This punishment should not be inflicted for trivial cause.\n\n4. Deprive of Class Position.\u2014The standing of the pupil depends on faithful and successful work. The negligent will\nnaturally fall into lower and still lower classes. The time may come when such pupils may even forfeit their positions in school. These backward movements should be prevented if possible. Rarely do they result in good to the pupils or to the school.\n\n5. Deprive of Certain Privileges.\u2014Privation of a privilege should follow its abuse. The pupil will recognize the justice of the punishment. If inflicted in kindness and sorrow, this punishment is powerful to effect reformation.\n\n6. Keeping after School.\u2014Except as a penalty for offenses committed while returning from school, this punishment is seldom justifiable. A boy mistreats younger pupils, or is quarrelsome, or uses bad language; as a natural consequence, he is deprived of the privilege of returning home with the other scholars. This method of punishment might be resorted to occasionally with good effect for the correction of other faults than those just mentioned, if teachers would only act with discrimination in inflicting it, keeping in view Bentham's 4th Principle, as enunciated in our last chapter. But, unfortunately, many teachers have not acted judiciously in this respect,\u2014the punishment has been imposed on children to whom the regular hours are too long, and for offenses for whose correction it is eminently unsuited; consequently a most admirable means of discipline has become decidedly unpopular, and the practice has steadily fallen into disuse.\n\n7. Deprive of Favour.\u2014If a proper bond of good feeling exists between the teacher and the pupils, there can scarcely be a more effective means of punishing a disorderly child than the temporary withdrawal of the teacher's favour. The pupil is insolent, insubordinate, or idle, and as a natural consequence the teacher refuses to continue on the same terms of cordial friendship with the offender as before. It is precisely what would happen between friends in real life; business relations continue; ordinary duties are discharged; common civilities are exchanged; but so long as any cause of offense remains without atonement, no cordial feeling exists, no smile of approval is bestowed. The estrangement is keenly felt, and it seldom takes long to evoke from the child manifest signs of repentance and of desire for amendment and reconciliation. These signs the teacher should be quick to notice and to encourage, that despair of regaining the old footing may not drive him to worse courses.\nthe unhappy delinquent still further from the path of duty. The approval of the wise and faithful teacher is a wonderful incentive to good conduct, his disapproval is always a severe punishment; neither should ever be lightly bestowed.\n\nIII. DEPORTMENT MARKS.\u2014The pupil begins with a standing of 100 in deportment; only improper conduct can lower his standing. The daily conduct of the pupil makes its own record on the mind of the wide-awake teacher. At the close of the month or quarter the deportment is recorded in the register, and a report is sent to the parent.\n\n1. Grades and Reports.\u2014From 100 to 90, excellent; from 90 to 80, good; from 80 to 70, passable; from 70 to 60, poor. The words, never the figures, should be reported or published. Some schools use cards of four colours to represent the four words, and report the class standing on these cards.\n\n2. Correct Marking.\u2014Great care and strict impartiality are necessary. The marking must be on general conduct, and not on specific violations of the regulations; these have been dealt with already, immediately after the occurrence, and it would hardly be fair to punish the pupil twice for the same offense\u2014once by the special discipline suited to the transgression, and again by lowering the deportment record intended as an index of general behaviour. What record has the pupil really made? If you hesitate, always give the pupil the benefit of the doubt. Exert yourself to the utmost to prevent any pupil from falling below 70 in deportment.\n\n3. Injudicious Marking has brought all marking into disrepute. Some teachers carry it to the extreme, and the conduct of their pupils has reference to the marking rather than to the right. Others continually mark for specific offenses, and thus make themselves recording machines. Then, the marking is often glaringly unjust. Some incorporate self-reporting, with all its evils, with deportment marking.\n\n4. No Marking is considered better than injudicious marking. Hence some educators oppose all marking for deportment. They tell us that, in the hands of the average teacher, this punishment proves a serious injury.\n5. Doubtful Punishment.\u2014Marking deportment is considered by some educators as a doubtful, if not an injudicious punishment, to be ranked among the mere outward restraints employed in the discipline of the past. But, *general* good conduct is undoubtedly entitled to the approval of the conscientious teacher, and this is, partially at least, if not adequately, expressed by high deportment marks; *habitually* bad conduct unquestionably deserves his disapproval, and this it receives in a low deportment record. No sensible teacher will expect or trust that marking, however well and wisely done, is going to cure all the ills of the school-room. Department records have, however, proved a valuable auxiliary in the hands of many able teachers; and the system is at least worthy of a trial.\n\n6. Marking is a Silent Force.\u2014As such it should be permitted to exercise its influence for good. Seldom should the teacher refer to it, and never should he urge this as an incentive to good conduct. The punishment follows, as in nature and society, as a result of improper courses of conduct.\n\nIV. EXTRAORDINARY PUNISHMENTS.\u2014Suspension, Expulsion, and Corporal Punishment, when judiciously administered, must be regarded as coming fairly in the catalogue of Judicious Punishments; but on account of the serious nature of the discipline involved in the first and second, and because of the divided opinions that still exist concerning the third of these, we think it better to discuss them separately, under the head of Special Punishments, in the next chapter.\n\nINJUDICIOUS SCHOOL PUNISHMENTS.\u2014Under this head are to be classed all punishments that fail to excite a desire to do right because it is right. If mere compliance with a rule were the end and aim of punishment, then many of those which we shall have to class as injudicious would be entitled to take a much higher rank, and might fairly claim to be considered eminently successful. But *obedience from a right motive*, and not compliance merely, is the immediate object sought by discipline, and all punishments that fail to effect this must be ranked as injudicious. Punishments which violate principles must be avoided; that which is not established on a correct basis cannot be beneficial in its tendency. The mode of infliction, also, must be carefully consid-\nored, for many punishments, otherwise judicious and in strict accordance with principle, may become useless and ineffectual, even mischievous, if injudiciously administered. All punishments injurious in their tendencies are injudicious and should be tabooed. Their name is legion; only some of the more common are here classed.\n\n1. Unusual Punishments commonly prove to be Injudicious.\u2014Punishments approved by public sentiment will generally be found safest and best. Teachers who rack their brains to invent new tortures render themselves unpopular, and hence less successful. The preceding punishments are abundantly sufficient.\n\n2. Cowardly Punishments are always Injudicious.\u2014Children not less than adults despise a mean, cowardly person, who wantonly punishes the helpless.\n\nScolding, censure accompanied by threats, is one of this class of punishments. The wise teacher or parent tries to be sweet-tempered also; such a one never scolds, never threatens, never irritates. The sour, whining, threatening dyspeptic keeps the school continually irritated by the everlasting rasping of his scolding tongue. The wretchedness caused by this cowardly punishment is beyond computation; the unhappy child has not even the poor privilege of talking back; he must simply sit there and silently endure whatever the venomous coward may choose to utter of censure and abuse. Persons to whom the habit of scolding has become chronic should be excluded from the school-room.\n\n3. Threats are Injudicious and Unworthy of the Teacher.\u2014Nature makes no threats; but a mild, certain punishment follows violated law. The teacher cannot follow a better model; he should never threaten, never intimidate. Foreshadowing consequences must not be confounded with threatening. It is highly proper and right that the pupil should be forewarned of the inevitable consequence of misconduct; but this is a very different thing from the punishment in question\u2014warning is not threatening.\n\n4. Nagging is an Injudicious, Contemptible Punishment.\u2014It means constant, vexatious, irritating talk and action. Foolish and short-sighted teachers are sometimes guilty of nagging. They do not scold, nor reprove, nor punish outright; better if they\ndid. The victim perhaps reports in this way: \"The teacher is always picking at me.\" It is quite possible that the teacher has no such intention, and for that reason we do not here apply any stronger terms than \"foolish and short-sighted\" to those guilty of the practice; if done with malice prepense it is quite as cowardly and despicable as scolding or threats. Those addicted to the habit are sometimes utterly unconscious of the fact; they may even think it kind to refrain from downright reproof, and to substitute perpetual admonition for it. But it is a most mistaken policy. The average child is susceptible, and responds promptly to generosity, confidence, and obvious good will. When the child-heart feels that the teacher wishes, respects, and enjoys goodness in the pupil, it has the strongest motive to be good. But let the dark suspicion, whether well-founded or not, once get into the mind, \"My teacher wishes me to fail and trip so that he can be down upon me,\" and the influence of the teacher for good is gone; the child-heart is so embittered as to bring forth only evil instead of good, and the great end of education is defeated.\n\n5. Cruel Punishments are Injudicious and Inhuman.\u2014Such brutalities as placing pepper on the tongue, putting split sticks on the ears, compelling pupils to stand long on one foot, or to hold weights at arm's length, etc., are of this class. All tortures, all harsh and cruel punishments of this kind are injudicious. Moreover, they are fortunately illegal, so that any teacher guilty of such atrocities would very probably soon find himself where he would be lucky if the tables were not completely turned upon himself.\n\nBut bodily torture is not the only direction in which cruelty can find vent. Mental torture is a much more cruel punishment; it is infinitely harder to bear, and it too often leaves dark bruises and ugly scars upon the soul, that time is powerless to efface. Some teachers will not hesitate to indulge in the keenest sarcasm at the expense of an offending pupil, especially if he be an old offender; nay, they will pride themselves on their skill in making such a \"hard case\" wince. The teacher may have forgiven the culprit once before and let him go scot free. If so he will now fling his former leniency in the poor wretch's face and taunt him with his want of gratitude, his weakness in doing right. Perhaps the edifying scene will end by his forgiving the poor badgered victim once\nmore, and letting him go unpunished this time also just to see whether that will have any effect on his callous nature and induce him to do better for the future. Alas! for the chances of moral growth, in an atmosphere in which an unhappy child would gladly welcome the severest flogging rather than forgiveness! Truly some teachers do not know what punishment is, much less what is its aim and purpose.\n\n6. Head Punishments are Improper.\u2014The head, the immediate organism through which the soul acts, is a sacred thing. Slapping, boxing, pulling the nose, ears, or hair, are indignities to which no child should be subjected. If you must use corporal punishment, under any circumstances spare the head.\n\n7. Degrading Punishments are Educational Mistakes.\u2014No means should be spared to have the child think well of himself. Punishments having an opposite tendency are monstrous, and teachers who take a fiendish pleasure in degrading and demeaning their pupils are human monsters.\n\n8. Vindictive Punishments Injure both Parties.\u2014Any punishment administered in anger is more or less vindictive. That a parent or teacher should punish a child simply to gratify spleen, and without reference to the good of the child, is hard to conceive. That such punishment is common, is a humiliating fact.\n\n9. Keeping in, except for the causes mentioned in this chapter (under the heading \"Privations,\" sub-section 6, p. 118), will generally prove to be an injudicious punishment. It has fallen so much into disrepute and disuse that it might almost be classed among the \"Unusual Punishments.\" On the whole, it is perhaps best to let it remain there; better risk the loss of a sound means of discipline than run the risk of adopting what in your hands may prove to be an injudicious one.\n\nIt is a fearful thing to punish improperly. Erring man should ponder long before punishing a little immortal,\n\n\"Over whom the angels watch.\"\n\nInjudicious punishments tend to crush out the noblest traits of child-nature\u2014tend to foster all hateful passions.\nTopical Review\u2014Judicious and Injudicious Punishments.\n\nJudicious Punishments.\n\n1.

They include Suspension, Expulsion, and Corporal Punishment. In works on School Management, it is not uncommon to class these punishments, or some of them, among the common means to be adopted for the government of the school; and we have so far conformed to the general practice in this respect as to name them with other judicious punishments in the preceding chapter. Again, corporal punishment is frequently put before suspension in theory, as it generally has been in practice, as involving less serious consequences to the pupil\u2014as being in fact a milder form of discipline. We, however, prefer to group all three together for treatment in a separate chapter, because we wish to emphasize our opinion and desire that teachers should regard any one of these means of discipline as a very special, uncommon, extraordinary exercise of the power and authority with which he is invested; and, for the relative positions assigned to them, we place suspension before corporal punishment, because the latter, being essentially a degradation, barely escapes being ranked with the injudicious punishments; while expulsion, not being reformatory, is not in the proper sense of the term a school punishment at all, but rather a precaution against the contaminating influence of an incorrigible offender. It is arranged next to suspension merely because they both involve the enforced absence of the culprit from school, and so far resemble each other.\n\nReproof and privations are the only punishments ordinarily needed in school or family. The management should be so systematic and vigorous as to render severer punishments unnecessary. Still, in rare cases, the teacher may be compelled to resort to suspension, expulsion, or corporal punishment.\n\nI. SUSPENSION.\u2014This punishment combines the characteristics of the disciplines of reproof and of privation. It means the temporary banishment of the pupil from the school and grounds,\ndepriving him of all the rights, privileges, and advantages enjoyed by his fellows; and the sentence of suspension, publicly pronounced, as it generally is, constitutes the keenest reproof that can be uttered within the bounds of right feeling and good taste. It is, therefore, a punishment of extreme severity, which the teacher should avoid as long as the good of the pupils and the school can be promoted without it. When demanded, he should have the courage and judgment to carry it out effectively. Weak teachers continually resort to suspension; strong teachers rarely use this punishment. But suspension is the best of the severer punishments. Rightly managed, it results in the good of the suspended as well as the good of the school. Who should suspend? When? How? How long? How may the suspended be restored? Teachers must be prepared to act the answers to these questions. Success or failure may depend upon the course pursued.\n\n1. The Teacher Suspends.\u2014Charged with the government of the school, familiar with all the conditions, and seeking only the good of all concerned, the teacher unquestionably should exercise the right of suspension. This right should be vested in him by law or by contract. It is so in Ontario. Even in the absence of any express statute, the teacher's position gives him the right to suspend a refractory pupil, pending the decision and action of the authorities. It is founded upon necessity. Order must be maintained; and if it cannot be maintained by other means, the teacher has no choice but to suspend.\n\n2. Causes for Suspension.\u2014This punishment should be used with great discretion. The age and general character of the pupil, the necessity, and the probable effects must be duly considered. The School Law of Ontario provides for the suspension of offenders for any of the following reasons:\n\n(a.) \"Truancy persisted in.\" If the pupil sets so little value on the right of attending school as to persist in absenting himself without permission and without cause, suspension may induce him to estimate his privileges more correctly. The deprivation of a right has a wonderful effect in increasing one's desire to possess it.\n\n(b.) \"Violent opposition to authority.\" Insubordination has always been held a sufficient cause for suspension. A pupil who refuses to comply with the requirements of the teacher should be\nsuspended, if he cannot otherwise be led to submit. The teacher's authority must be maintained at any lawful cost.\n\n(c.) \"Repetition of any offense after notice.\" The repetition of an offense betrays either the existence of a bad habit, or of excessive thoughtlessness; but the repetition after express notice shows a determination to disobey, and merits a sentence of suspension. Such offenders are frequently cured effectually by a short period of enforced absence from school, and pupils likely to follow their bad example are generally willing to accept the timely warning.\n\n(d.) \"Habitual and determined neglect of duty.\" Habitual neglect of duty implies determination to neglect it, and such general worthlessness necessitates suspension. The school is a workshop. Earnest effort is the condition on which its privileges may be enjoyed. The pupil is determined to neglect his duty, notwithstanding all the efforts of the teacher to arouse him to a proper sense of it; nothing therefore remains but to try suspension, and this sometimes works a radical change.\n\n(e.) \"The use of profane, or other improper language.\" It is absolutely necessary that the pupils should be kept as free as possible from contamination; and if the ordinary punishments of the school are not sufficient to break up the vile habit of using profane language, the teacher has no other course left than to suspend the offender. It may quicken his dormant conscience and lead to permanent reformation; it will, at all events, free the school for a time, at least, from the influence of a bad example, and will mark the teacher's emphatic condemnation of the vice. In dealing with this evil, the humane teacher will remember that too many of the pupils attending our schools are daily subjected to the debasing influence of incessant profanity and other improper language at home; and he will consequently exhaust his ingenuity in devising expedients for putting such pupils constantly on their guard against the use of such language, before he resorts to the extreme measure of suspending the offender, and thus depriving him of the only chance he can have of coming under better influences than those surrounding him at home.\n\n(f.) \"General bad conduct, and bad example, to the injury of the school.\" This regulation seems at first sight to have only the good of the school in view, and not the reformation of the culprit.\nBut the very fact that his general conduct and example are considered injurious to the school, and that nothing short of his suspension will suffice for its protection, has often a most salutary effect in arousing a scapegrace to a sense of the seriousness of his misconduct, and to a strong desire for amendment and restoration.\n\n(g.) \"Cutting, marring, destroying, defacing or injuring any of the public school property, such as buildings, furniture, seats, fences, trees, shrubbery, &c., or writing any obscene or improper words on the fences, walls, privies, or any part of the premises.\"\n\nIf a pupil is so malicious as to wantonly injure or destroy the property of the school, he has no right to complain of being deprived of the privilege of attending it; and the privation seems the most likely means of impressing him with a sense of the value of that which he has injured, and thus of inspiring him with a feeling of shame and regret for his act of vandalism. If the injury consists in the writing of obscene words, no one will say that the punishment is too severe. It is not severe enough. A boy who could be guilty of such a piece of blackguardism should be first soundly flogged before the whole school, and then suspended indefinitely. The school-room is not the place for miscreants; we need houses of correction for them. The school and the community should be relieved from their contaminating influence.\n\n3. Appeal to the Board of Trustees.\u2014Under the School Law it is also provided that \"Any master suspending a pupil for any of the causes above named, shall, immediately after such suspension, give notice thereof, in writing, to the parent or guardian of such pupil, and to the trustees, in which notice shall be stated the reason for such suspension.\" The object of this precaution is to give the parent or guardian the right of appeal, in order to have the case fully investigated, and so to prevent the perpetration of injustice. Except in cases of gross injustice, the school board should, and generally does, sustain the teacher. In fact, it is but seldom that the board is called upon to interfere officially in such matters. The teacher is the best judge of the necessity for the infliction of such a punishment; no teacher, who understands how to govern his school, would think of resorting to it till he had convinced himself that other means of discipline would be without effect. He adopts it only when all other means have failed.\n4. How to Suspend.\u2014The management has been such that the pupils feel that the offender should be suspended. The teacher has used all possible effort to save the pupil, and failed. Suspension has become a necessity. The school must be freed from demoralizing influences, and the pupil must be placed in a position favourable to reflection and reformation. The manner of pronouncing the sentence of suspension would, of course, depend to some extent on the nature of the offense that has directly led to the suspension. Some such course as the following will generally answer the purpose of directing the public opinion of the school, and rendering the punishment impressive and effective. At the close of school, when the second step of the tactics for dismissing has been reached, the teacher calls the offender by name and orders him to stand up. He then, in a low, earnest tone, announces to the school that to his great regret he has been forced to decide on trying the effects of a temporary suspension, seeing that all his own efforts and those of the school in general have failed to induce the offender to do right. It is a very painful duty to be obliged to punish a pupil at all, and nothing but a strong conviction that his duty to the remaining pupils compels him to adopt this course would induce him to cut any pupil off from enjoying the privileges of the school and playgrounds. He wishes he could even now think of any milder way of getting the boy to act as others were trying to act; but he is sorry to have to say that all his expedients are exhausted. He is determined to have order at any cost, and as the boy is not willing to adhere to reasonable rules, it is better that they should separate. He hopes, however, and so do the boy's fellow-pupils, that the separation will not be long\u2014it depends on the boy himself\u2014as soon after the time named as he feels that he can do right for the future, he may return, and he will be gladly welcomed by them all.\n\n5. Length of Suspension.\u2014The time may be definite or indefinite. Short periods are usually best, but the time must not be so short as to bring the punishment into contempt. Indefinite suspension fixes no limit.\n\n6. Restoration.\u2014The restoration of a suspended pupil is a delicate duty, requiring judgment and skill. The pupil should realize that the past is buried, and that he is permitted to begin anew. Attention is called to the following points;\n(1) Restore a pupil whenever he gives satisfactory evidence of a determination to do right.\n\n(2) So manage that the conduct of the restored pupil shall be especially exemplary. He will be closely observed.\n\n(3) In no case should the school-board restore a pupil without the approval of the teacher.\n\nII. EXPULSION.\u2014Suspension temporarily deprives the pupil of the privileges of the school; expulsion severs his connection with the school. Suspension looks to the good of the pupil as well as to the good of the school; expulsion looks alone to the good of the school.\n\n1. Not a School Punishment.\u2014Expulsion is not designed as a school punishment. It is not reformatory, does not aim at the correction of a fault with a view to the ultimate restoration of the offender. Its sole object is to protect the school from the evil example of a pupil whose conduct seemingly proves him to be utterly worthless and depraved.\n\n2. Causes for Expulsion.\u2014\u201cWhen the example of any pupil is very hurtful to the school, and in all cases where reformation appears hopeless\u201d the offender may be publicly expelled, \u201cand, where practicable, removed to an Industrial School.\u201d This is the law in Ontario, and a similar law prevails in most countries. It is sanctioned by the courts, and by public opinion; and though it seems harsh to cut off any offender from the most likely means of reformation, yet the higher duty of shielding the well-behaved from corrupting influences must override all minor considerations.\n\n3. Who Expel?\u2014\u201cIt shall be the duty of the master, with the approbation of the trustees, to expel, etc.,\u201d is the provision of the Ontario law. It is the act of the school-board, never of the master alone.\n\n4. Precaution.\u2014Rare, indeed, are the cases that justify this terrible punishment. Ponder long before cutting off opportunity and hope even from the most unworthy. Act as if the unfortunate one were your own child. When you consider it imperative to inflict the penalty, think whether you cannot sufficiently discharge your duty to the other pupils by inducing the parent or guardian of the offender to remove him privately from the school. You might,\nin that case, explain to the school that you had suggested the withdrawal of the pupil in order to avoid inflicting on him the stigma of expulsion.\n\n5. Restoration.\u2014In most cases the act of expulsion puts an end forever to the school career of the offender; for the etiquette of the profession is that a pupil expelled from one school will be refused admittance into other schools. But in Ontario it is provided that \"any pupil under public censure, who shall express to the master his regret for such a course of conduct, as openly and explicitly as the case may require, shall, with the approbation of the trustees and master be admitted to the school.\"\n\nIII. CORPORAL PUNISHMENT is the intentional infliction of physical suffering as a reformatory means. There is a marked difference between the views now current on this subject and those that prevailed in the past. In former times the rod was regarded as the great panacea for all the ills of the school; now corporal punishment is very properly regarded almost as the last resource of the teacher. There is a growing feeling among teachers that it is degrading alike to the pupil who suffers it and to the teacher who is obliged to inflict it; and consequently the practice is steadily failing into disuse, though the theory of its value as a mode of discipline still remains almost as strong as ever. \"Grant the right, but avoid the use,\" is the modern doctrine, approved, with singular unanimity, by the world's educators. The fact that the teacher may and will resort to corporal punishment, if it becomes necessary, exerts a salutary influence.\n\nIn the ideal school, taught by the ideal teacher, this punishment is not necessary. In the average school, taught by the average teacher, it may be necessary. In all schools those teachers who seldom or never resort to corporal punishment should be held in the highest esteem. They have learned the art of governing through nobler motives.\n\nGround of Opposition.\u2014The arguments against corporal punishment are, for the most part, founded upon its abuse; but the widest experience as well as the soundest philosophy requires its retention as a school punishment. The highly skilful may never need to use this punishment; good teachers will use it sparingly\nand wisely; only bunglers will resort to it as a common punishment. In another generation, flogging in the school will be regarded as capital punishment is now regarded in the state.\n\nGeneral Conclusion.\u2014The utmost discretion and tact is needed to determine when it is advisable to employ corporal punishment in support of government; we would counsel extreme moderation in the use of it, but we are far from taking the high ground of denying the teacher's right and duty to have recourse to it. The true aim of all school discipline should be to stimulate such action in life as proceeds from the correct idea of duty. Such motives should be presented as will lead the child to obey rightful authority because he is under the highest moral obligations to do so. If love of doing right in the abstract, or the better-understood feeling of a child, love for his parents or his teacher, do not influence him to obedience, then we say that it may be the duty, as it is obviously the right, of the teacher judiciously to inflict corporal punishment.\n\n1. The Infliction Should be Private.\u2014The sacred principle that one child must not be corrected in the presence of another has a double significance here. Only in cases demanding publicity should the infliction take place in the presence of the school. Are there such cases?\n\n2. The Punishment Should be Moderate.\u2014It is the moral power of the teacher, and not the severe pain, that proves effective. This punishment simply enables the teacher to reach the nobler nature of the child. In many cases a single stroke is sufficient. Severity and cruelty are universally condemned. It is safest to err on the side of mercy.\n\n3. The Instrument Should be the Rod.\u2014The time-honoured birch is the fittest instrument. The ferule, the strap, the cat-of-nine-tails, are instruments of torture, to be shunned by the teacher. Employ no instrument that is not sanctioned by custom or regulation.\n\n4. The Back and Shoulders are the Fittest Portions of the Body to Inflict.\u2014Avoid all slapping, pulling ears or hair, shaking, or thumping. Hold the head sacred. Never break down the self-respect of the child, nor run the risk of injuring him for life, if not of killing him outright, by striking him on the head.\n5. Punish in Love.\u2014You are the pupil's friend, and seek his good. You grieve to be compelled to punish him thus. You suffer most. The rod alone is powerless for good. The magic power of love does the work. The pain is soon forgotten, but the heartfelt sympathy of the teacher is like seed planted in the pupil's soul, destined to develop into a noble life.\n\n6. The Punishment Should be Deliberate.\u2014Prepare the pupil by leading him to realize its necessity. Calmly strike a single stinging blow. Talk earnestly for a minute or two, then give another blow, a little more severe. Thus administered, not many blows (seldom more than three or four) will be needed. Whenever the determination has taken possession of the pupil to forsake the wrong and to do the right, the punishment should cease.\n\n7. Treatment after Punishment.\u2014This should be tender and considerate. Reformation is a growth. The pupil must be won back to right feelings and right conduct. Let every look and word and act show him how much you are his friend. Encourage him, stimulate him, guide him.\n\nThus administered and thus followed, corporal punishment becomes a great moral power. But may not the teacher who can thus administer this punishment succeed even better without it?\n\nGeneral Remarks.\u2014After laying down these somewhat elaborate principles, we feel very strongly inclined to say to teachers, in the words of Bentham:\u2014\"And thus having shown you when to punish and how to punish, let me advise you to have as little to do with punishment as you can help.\" See if you can not, by moral suasion, by precaution, by improved methods of organization and instruction, and by the bonds of affection established between you and your pupils, prevent offenses, and thereby avoid the necessity for punishment. If you must punish, try the effects of light punishments, such as reproof and restraints, before having recourse to severer punishments. You will be a good teacher in proportion to your ability to dispense with these. Few things have more hindered the art of education than the abuse of punishment.\nEXTRAORDINARY PUNISHMENTS.\n\nTopical Review\u2014Special, or Extraordinary, Punishments.\n\nSpecial Punishments.\n\n1.

DETAILED REPORTS DEMANDED.\u2014The medical profession holds in high esteem the numerous volumes giving the detailed practice of able physicians. Not less valuable to the professional teacher would be volumes containing the specific management of skilful educators, giving in detail the treatment of special schools, special difficulties, and special pupils. A score of such books by masters of the art of school management, like Arnold of Rugby and President Nott of Union College, would be esteemed above all price.\n\nII. THE INEXPERIENCED TEACHER NEEDS CONCRETE CASES.\u2014The training school, the Teachers' Institute, the educational journal, and individual observation furnish these to a large extent; but the cases need to be more numerous, and should take a wider range. A knowledge of modes of management of the wisest teachers is needed. This important subject has been too much overlooked by our educational journals; if they would give us more concrete illustrations and fewer theories, it would be better for both readers and writers.\n\nIII. SUCH REPORTS ARE HIGHLY SUGGESTIVE TO TEACHERS.\u2014No wise teacher will be a mere imitator. History never repeats itself. No two cases are ever exactly alike; but cases may be similar, and a report of one may suggest the proper treatment of another. The sensible teacher will adapt the treatment to the school and to the individual pupils. He will never copy, nor ever become a mere imitator.\n\nIV. DISORDERLY SCHOOLS, PUPILS, AND PARENTS NEED SPECIAL TREATMENT.\u2014Like the skilful physician, the able teacher seeks to discover the cause of the disorder, and he then devotes all his efforts to remove the cause and effect a cure. We have space merely for a few illustrative examples,\nV. MANAGEMENT OF DISORDERLY SCHOOLS.\u2014Treat each case on its merits. Do not suppose that any general system of treatment will suffice to eradicate all the specific disorders to be encountered in teaching. What has answered well at one time may utterly fail at another. Patience, perseverance, and above all, tact, will be required to enable you to apply general principles, rules, and regulations in such a way as to meet the special difficulty you may have to encounter. Make a careful diagnosis of the disorder, and when you have discovered the specific cause, seek carefully for the specific treatment necessary to effect a cure. As a rule, disorderly schools follow the lead of a very few ringleaders; and if you can get at these effectually, and reform them, the rest of the school will fall quietly into line. Make a special study of the ring-leaders, become interested in them, make them interested in you, employ them to help you in the management of the school and playground, and you will soon find the disorder on the wane.\n\n1. Disorder from Physical Discomfort.\u2014Remove the causes. Render the seats more comfortable; improve the heating and ventilation; secure abundant exercise; create an atmosphere of cheerfulness and content. Do not forget to secure the help of the ringleaders in whatever way you can employ them. The sensation of working for the good of the community will raise their moral tone and give you better material to work on in the future.\n\n2. Disorder from Coughing.\u2014Nothing is much more contagious than coughing, except, perhaps, laughing. It is a disorder that requires prompt treatment. Send home two or three of the worst cases, who really cannot control the cough, and then require the rest to stop. Most of them will try to do so immediately; but should any pupil continue coughing, in the hope of being sent home for the day, call him up\u2014divert his attention by some sudden change in his work, or in any other way\u2014and when you find that his cough has ceased, send him to his seat with an admonitory request not to begin it again. A few pointed remarks to the school will then be enough in most cases to hold the evil in check.\n\n3. Disorder from a Rough, Turbulent Class of Pupils.\u2014Boys, who have never had any good example before them, cannot be expected to be orderly at the outset. They will fight, and lie, and talk during school hours, and very possibly steal into the\nbargain. Get at the ringleaders; join in their games, and let them see that you can heartily appreciate vigour and energy when exhibited at the right time. This will do something to arouse their interest; keep on and interest them still more, till you get them ready to help you. Don't preach at them; but bend all your energies to the task of enlisting them to help you to carry out the system of the school. The worst men can be made into soldiers, and they will fight well because there is a system in the army. Speak little. Practise a class in coming and going, until it moves right, if it takes you all day. This is the secret of the discipline of all large schools. Do not worry; be cheerful. Get up an interest in the lessons. Somehow, get them to studying, by smiles, by praise, etc. Pick out the leaders, the troublesome ones, and take them singly, and try your influence on them; get them to help you, to be your assistants. Call on the parents and talk with them; make them glad you have called. Don't complain of John or Henry; tell them, however, you want them to improve, and what they should do. Get up some exercises to call their parents in\u2014some dialogues, etc.; it gives an interest to the school-room. Examine your own manner carefully; see whether you scold, or fret, or lose your balance or dignity. Improve your manner day by day. One half of the fault is there. Resolve to be master, not physically, but mentally, morally, by the force of your will. Study to be a power in your school-room.\n\n4. Disorder caused by Whispering.\u2014Many teachers ask, \"How can I stop whispering?\" I answer\u2014by stopping it.\n\nThe Story of Joseph.\u2014My first teacher permitted us to study \"out loud.\" My next teachers prohibited loud studying, but placed no restrictions on whispering. After that we had a strict teacher, who prohibited all whispering. I could not start to school until the corn was gathered, but I heard of the new rule. The morning I entered, the teacher met me kindly, gave me a seat, and arranged my lessons. Very quietly he said: \"Joseph, we do not have any whispering.\"\n\nAfter about half an hour I forgot this fact, and asked my seat-mate something about recess. The teacher, in passing me, said, in a low, earnest tone, \"Joseph, you must not whisper,\" and went right on with his work. I did not whisper for an hour, when I again thoughtlessly asked my seat-mate for his knife. Again, and still more earnestly, the injunction came, \"Joseph, you must not whisper.\"\nI did not whisper again till afternoon, when I was so unfortunate as to ask about the Spelling lesson. The teacher came to me, and said: \"Joseph, you may take your books and come with me. You may occupy this front seat by yourself. When you feel that you can get along without whispering, I will let you return to your seat.\"\n\nFor about a week I kept that lonely seat, and thought. I then told the teacher that I could now get along without whispering. \"Very well, you may take your former seat.\" I gave the teacher no further trouble. My recollection is that there was no whispering in the school.\n\nThe story of Joseph is instructive. The teacher had system, and was wide awake and firm. His management was vigorous and effective. By training, he converted precept and example into habit. Pupils who had always whispered were trained to the habit of non-communication. \"Where there's a will there's a way.\"\n\n5. Disorder because of Contagious Laughter.\u2014\"Our high school included sixteen laughter-loving girls, who spent the recesses in telling each other the most amusing secrets, and who often interrupted the school by bursts of uncontrollable laughter. The usual remedies utterly failed, but the following expedient proved completely successful: I changed the programme so as to have a laughing exercise at the time when the girls were generally the worst. When the time came I sent these girls to the board, one by one. The school saw the reason and began to laugh. I explained that I had set apart ten minutes for a laughing exercise; that whatever they did, I intended they should do in a systematic manner; and closed by calling on the most mischievous one to begin the recitation. I had so completely surprised the school as to produce the greatest sobriety, and the young ladies looked so ridiculous, that, at the close, the stillness was broken by one continuous and prolonged uproar of laughter. Some of the young ladies laughed, others wept. I never called the class again, nor was I ever afterward troubled by laughing from those girls.\"\n\nThis is a good illustration of the truth embodied in the aphorism, *similia similibus curantur*, which may occasionally be employed in discipline with as much success as in medicine.\n\n6. Disorder occasioned by a Disorderly Teacher.\u2014\"To correct such disorder, be orderly yourself; this is the prime requisite. Any other means to secure order is unsatisfactory and unphilosophical. The teacher teaches more by example in all the details of school work than by virtue of authority. In every school the large majority of the pupils will soon imitate the teacher in his\ntone, language, and daily walk in the school-room. If the teacher is noisy in his manner, he will have noisy pupils, and as a result, a noisy school. If he walks heavily, he must expect his pupils to do the same, for like begets like. If he whistles in the school-room, he must expect his pupils to do likewise; and he should not be surprised if his pupils try to outdo him in this particular, for it is but natural for them to attempt to excel. On the other hand, if the teacher's manner and walk in the school-room are quiet and self-possessed, and his voice at a medium pitch, soon the conduct of the pupils will be similar. The teacher's manner of doing everything will be truthfully copied by the band of pupils, who instinctively follow him from day to day.\n\n\"Teachers, are any of you dissatisfied with your order? If so, I advise you to examine yourselves, find your defects, and set about a reformation, radical and thorough.\"\n\nVI. GOVERN INDIVIDUALS THROUGH THE CLASS.\u2014Instead of giving your attention to individual pupils and single misdeeds, trying to correct each in detail, endeavour to deal with faults in such a manner as to exert an influence upon the entire class, which will lead to right thoughts and better actions. Aim thus to develop the public opinion of your class in favour of the right, so that you may govern individual pupils through the influence of your class.\n\nSuppose you have a class of young pupils, among whom are many careless or restless children, and you notice that they make a great deal of noise in taking slates from the desks, or in placing slates on the desks. Telling them to make less noise, or reminding John, Charles, and William that they are too noisy, or taking their slates away from them, will not secure habits of handling slates quietly. But if you tell the class that some of the boys are always quiet in handling their slates, and that it would be so pleasant if all the boys would try to be quiet, and then ask how many would like to try to put down and take up their slates quietly, the unanimous response would commit the class in favour of less noise.\n\nDo not attempt to govern your class by naming individual pupils and charging them with faults; such a course, if often pursued, seldom secures the desired end. Instead of directly telling pupils of their faults and bad conduct, lead them to see their own misdeeds\nin their true light through the public opinion of the class. The following incident will illustrate this point:\n\nDisrespect Reproved and Corrected.\u2014One day a boy gave the teacher of his school an insolent reply. All who heard it were greatly astonished, but the teacher did not exhibit anger by scolding or threatening the boy with punishment. He quickly determined to improve that opportunity by teaching a valuable lesson to the entire school. The very calmness of his manner made a deep impression on the school, and while the pupils wondered how the disrespectful boy would be punished, they felt certain that such conduct would not be allowed to pass unnoticed. The hour for closing came, and school was dismissed without any allusion to the conduct of the boy. After the customary opening exercises on the morning of the next day, the teacher addressed the school substantially as follows:\n\n\"Boys, if, while you were at play in the street before school opened, a gentleman who was passing the school had inquired the direction to the railroad station, would you have told him the way in a respectful manner?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" was the unanimous response.\n\n\"Suppose a common labourer, whose occupation soiled his garments, had come along and asked the way to a certain street, would you have told him as well as you could, or would you have treated him rudely, telling him to go about his business?\"\n\n\"We would tell him the way,\" said the boys.\n\n\"Very good,\" said the teacher. \"Now, suppose a man, very poorly clad, who was seeking work that he might earn a little food for his wife and children, or even one who was compelled to beg his daily food, should ask you a civil question, how would you treat him? Would you give him a civil answer?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" responded the school.\n\n\"That is right, boys.\"\n\nThus the teacher prepared the school for the lesson he had planned to give. After a pause, looking carefully over the school, until all eyes were fixed upon him, even those of the boy who gave him a disrespectful answer the day before, he said, with a kind but sad tone of voice:\n\n\"Yesterday afternoon I asked a question of one of the boys of this school. It was a proper question for me to ask a pupil; it was a question which was justly entitled to a respectful reply. And yet, I am very sorry to know that even one boy in this school so far forgot that respect which is due to his parents, to his teacher, and to his school-mates as to give his teacher a less civil reply than should have been given to a beggar in the street. I hope no boy in this school will ever again forget to be respectful.\"\u2014Calkins.\nVII. MANAGEMENT OF DULL PUPILS.\u2014Mrs. Dumont was the ideal of a teacher, because she succeeded in forming character. She gave her pupils unstinted praise, not hypocritically, but because she lovingly saw the best in every one. We worked in the sunshine. A dull but industrious pupil was praised for diligence; a bright pupil, for ability; a good one, for general excellence. The dullards got more than their share, for, knowing how easily such a one is disheartened, Mrs. Dumont went out of her way to praise the first show of success in a slow scholar. She treated no two alike. She was full of all sorts of knack and tact, a person of infinite resource for calling out the human spirit.\n\nVIII. MANAGEMENT OF HARD CASES.\u2014The wise teacher so manages as not to have hard cases in his school. The materials of which such are made up are transformed into good pupils. But, in all schools, cases frequently occur that try the teacher to the utmost. For their management no specific has been or ever will be discovered. Each case must be dealt with on its merits. Yet, certainly, the management of similar cases by wise teachers must prove highly suggestive.\n\n1. Charlie.\u2014\u201cCharlie was an inveterate joker. His quaint answers and questions produced no little merriment at my expense. I reproved him privately and publicly without effect. I resolved to turn the joke. \u2018Charlie, you may take off your coat. Hang it on the chair. Take this rod. Now, whip the coat,\u2019 Charlie was much surprised, and went to work with a right good will. I did not restrain the mirthfulness of the school. Soon Charlie broke down and burst into tears. He felt that he was beaten at his own game. After that he gave me very little trouble.\u201d\n\n2. Brice.\u2014\u201cI was fairly puzzled. I had tried moral suasion, I had tried punishment, but the boy seemed incorrigible. He had been taken from a lawless private school and sent to me. His last teacher had expressed himself as glad to be rid of him, and he had evidently entered my school with the determination of having \u2018a good time,\u2019 which meant, in his opinion, getting many boys into mischief, and annoying me as much as possible. The boy was gentlemanly-looking, bright, and apt; but \u2018obedience\u2019 and \u2018order\u2019 seemed to be terms which he habitually and systematically set at defiance. The weak teacher\u2019s refuge, suspension, was possible; but the remembrance of former victories, and the heartfelt desire to train this smart boy into a good and useful man, made me shrink more than usually from such an alternative. I walked away from...\nthe school in some perturbation. What course had I best pursue? The happy thought struck me, 'Place confidence in him, put him to work for others; perhaps he will endeavour to deserve this trust.' I caught at the idea, and that afternoon, having called my fourth grade to the blackboard, I said, 'Brice, I have been some time trying to teach this grade how to do Long Division. Sometimes children catch such things quicker from an older child than from a teacher. You are quite apt at Arithmetic; will you come up here and try what you can do for them?' The boy's face flushed, but he came up with alacrity, and I never saw more patient, thorough work done than he went through for the next half-hour. I had no more trouble with Brice that afternoon, nor have I had a great deal since. As soon as I see him becoming restless, I call on him to help me with some of the lower grades, after which he will always return to his own task with renewed diligence. This method, doubtless, is old to many of you; but by some it may have been untried, and to such I submit it, hoping that they may meet with like success.\"\n\n3. \"Alfred and Lena have arrived at that age at which youthful love begins to develop. They begin to think very much of each other. They begin to sit and stare into the distant future, and study the probabilities of the coming life. Fancy builds air-castles. They are continually smiling at each other. They sit together at rests, promenade together at noon, assist each other in the difficult problems; notes pass between them; he waits for her at the gate; they go from and come to school together; they are so engrossed in each other that they begin to fail in their classes. However beautiful this boy and girl love, it is a serious evil in school life, and must be cured. I felt that something must be done. After much reflection I pursued the following course:\n\n\"I spoke to the school about a pair of baby lovers. I described their conduct in a ridiculous light. Without mentioning the names, pupils knew to whom I referred. The cure was only partial. I kept them in at rest, and told them I wanted them to look at each other. I kept them after school, and told them I wanted them to walk home together. A few days' treatment, with the laughter of the school, effected a cure.\"\u2014THOMAS.\n\nIX. SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT SHOULD BE REPORTED.\u2014Now that teaching and school management are recognized as arts, and the best talent is flowing into our noble profession, the demand for details of practice is imperative. Works now published, giving the practice of Pestalozzi, of Froebel, etc., however valuable, are too meager to meet the wants of teachers. Another decade ought greatly to enrich this department of our professional literature, and give us many volumes filled with the details of skilful and successful school management.\nTOPICAL REVIEW.\u2014SPECIFIC MANAGEMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF INDIVIDUAL PUPILS.\n\nDetailed Reports Demanded.\n\nValue to the teaching profession.\n\nThe inexperienced Teacher needs concrete cases.\n\nThe educational journals should report such cases.\n\nSuggestiveness of such reports.\n\n1.

When they are wise in the daily management of their children's time, with a view to school duties and relations;\n3. When they are properly affected toward the school, and thereby sustain its management.\n\nIII. FOR THE CHILDREN.\u2014The children are in order\u2014\n\n1. When they are happy;\n2. When they respect the teacher and his office;\n3. When they feel interested in the school, and have pride in its success.\n\nIV. FOR THE TEACHER.\u2014The teacher is in order\u2014\n\n1. When he is thoroughly master of himself;\n2. When he possesses the clearest mastery of the subjects he is presumed to teach;\n3. When he comprehends correctly the relations surrounding and centering in him.\n\n[144]\nSchool Duties.\n\nI. DUTIES OF TEACHERS TO THEMSELVES.*\n1.

Noisily using pencils upon slates and desks;\n   (4.) Noisily handling paper and turning leaves;\n   (5.) Moving the feet upon the floor;\n   (6.) Striking the desk-frames with the feet when changing position;\n   (7.) Attempting to sharpen pencils on desks;\n   (8.) Using the lips while studying;\n   (9.)

The habit of not understanding a question without repetition;\n   (17.) Answering questions before being called upon to do so.\n\nVI. DUTIES OF PUPILS OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL-HOUSE.\n\n1. To go to and from school in such a manner as not to disturb any one;\n2. To go directly home at the close of school.\n3. To come to school at the proper hour, and not earlier.\n4.

To give no encouragement to factious complaints.\n\nSchool Rights.\n\nI. RIGHTS OF TEACHERS.\u2014Teachers have rights; to insist on these is noble. A truckling, cowardly sycophant is not fit to be a teacher.\n\n1. The teacher has the absolute control of the internal workings of the school. He is responsible for results, and hence must be left untrammeled to reach results in his own way.\n\n2. The teacher has the absolute right to classify, teach, and govern the school. Parents and school-boards may suggest and advise, but not dictate. The competent teacher knows best; the incompetent teacher should be speedily removed.\n\n3. The teacher has a right to the respect and confidence of the parents, pupils, school-board, and community.\n4. The teacher has a right to a joint control with parents of pupils while going to and from school; also, to punish for conduct out of school which tends to injure the school and subvert the authority of the teacher.\n\nII. RIGHTS OF PUPILS.\n\n1. To the treatment due to rational beings.\n2. To sympathy and encouragement.\n3. To thorough and appropriate instruction.\n4. But, towering above all the specific rights of childhood, and embracing them all in its wide significance, is the grand right to maturity\u2014the right to the complete unfolding of its powers\u2014the right to attain its end; the right to be a man; the right to read the Creative Mind spread abroad upon His works; the right to the infinite pleasures that wait upon mature susceptibilities; the right to scatter happiness here; the right to retire in peace from a well-employed mortality!\n\nIII. RIGHTS OF PARENTS.\n\n1. To thoroughly qualified teachers\u2014those who know methods as well as subjects, mind as well as matter.\n2. To faithful and devoted teachers. Parents intrust the teacher with their most precious treasures. The teacher owes it to parents to do as well for the children as if they were his own.\n3. To kind and loving teachers. Loving parents claim the right to commit their precious darlings to sympathetic teachers; teachers from whose hearts issue treasures of love and encouragement; teachers who will take the place of the parents.\n\nIV. RIGHTS OF SCHOOL-BOARDS.\n\n1. To manage the finances.\n2. To employ and dismiss teachers.\n3. To approve the general regulations.\n4. To expel disorderly pupils.\n5. To sustain worthy teachers.\n\nSuggestions.\u2014The youthful teacher will read this chapter many times. The pupils can be quietly taught their duties by giving one or two items at a time. School duties and rights furnish valuable topics for essays and lessons in training schools and Teachers' Institutes.\nTOPICAL REVIEW\u2014CONDITIONS OF ORDER\u2014SCHOOL DUTIES AND RIGHTS.\n\nOrder.\n1.

How may the teacher secure study? How may the largest results be obtained from the efforts put forth? How may such a desire for knowledge be created as will make of the pupil a lifelong student? In this and the following chapters the attempt is made to answer these questions. Certainly no part of the art of school management is of greater importance.\n\nImportance of the Subject.\u2014We have already said that one of the most imperative duties of the teacher in the intellectual development of his pupils is to instruct them in the art of acquiring information from books. It is not at all an uncommon thing to find, even in the ranks of the teaching profession, men and women who have not yet fully mastered this art themselves. As long as the question before them is simply how to acquire additional information on any subject with which they are already tolerably familiar, they do not find much difficulty in extracting the desired knowledge from the volumes in the reference library; but when the necessity arises to diverge into some hitherto unknown region of learning they find it extremely difficult to follow the plainest directions of the guide-book. Such teachers frequently exhibit a most lively and laudable anxiety to remove from the paths of their\npupils the stumbling-blocks that have proved so troublesome in their own experience; but they find it, of course, an almost impossible task to teach others what they have never learned themselves.\n\nTHE RULES FOR STUDY, being first thoroughly mastered by the teacher, should be taught systematically to the pupils. They have proved of great value to many hundreds, and the teacher can hardly benefit his pupils more than by teaching and illustrating one of them each week, and training the learners to apply them. Better study conditions, better learning. Whatever tends to secure effective study tends to elevate the student and the race.\n\nI. Take a Deep Interest in what you Study.\u2014Cold iron can not be welded. The indifferent student fails to weld the new and the old knowledge. Heat the iron and a few strokes do the work. Interest is mental heat; learning and memory are in proportion to the interest. A cold, slow, repulsive teacher is a dead failure. He who can not create and sustain a deep interest can not teach. The student who does not take an interest in his work does not learn.\n\nII. Give your Entire Attention to the Subject.\u2014Attention is the condition of knowledge. But for the accumulated power of attention, learning and progress would be impossible. Close and continuous attention enables the pupil to master difficulties and retain results. As the rays of the sun, when concentrated by the burning glass, produce combustion, so, when the energies of the soul are directed to a single point, the mind burns its way through all difficulties. Newton said: \"The difference between myself and others is, chiefly, that I have acquired the power to concentrate my attention more completely, and to hold it longer on a subject, than most men.\" Herein lies the secret of success. A giddy, inattentive pupil accomplishes little. A teacher may do much but if he can not secure and hold the attention of his pupils he can not teach.\n\nIII. Study Systematically both as to Time and Method.\u2014A programme sufficiently elastic to meet the various circumstances is needed. A well-arranged programme enables the student to accomplish double as much as he ordinarily will do without one. \"In education,\" said Everett, \"method is everything.\" The pupil who knows how to study, and wisely uses his time, can\nprepare his lesson better and in much less time than one who does not know how to study, or who lacks system. A teacher who is not systematic, or who can not train his pupils to system, has no business in the school-room.\n\nIV. Master Each Step as you go.\u2014The child asks, \"What is it?\" the boy or girl, \"How is it?\" the youth, \"Why is it?\" the man, \"Whence is it?\" The child masters the objective phase of the subject; the boy, the analytic; the youth, the scientific; and the man, the philosophic phase. While in hand, is the time to master the lesson. To go through a book once should in most cases be sufficient. Let each lesson be a review of previous lessons. \"Leave nothing unconquered behind.\" Teachers who hurry their pupils through the book, who crowd them through many and long lessons, do much to injure them. Study few subjects. Short lessons and long study will produce strong men and thorough scholars.\n\nThe teacher must guard against the error of supposing that mastery of the subject means the thorough comprehension of it in all its manifold relations. To acquire such a mastery as this of even the simplest subject of study would demand the highest powers of the human intellect; but it is possible for each pupil, if judiciously guided in his mode of study, to acquire by once going through the text-book, such a mastery of the subject as is within the reach of his intellectual development. The child is not expected to master the analytic, the scientific, or the philosophic phase of any subject.\n\nV. Think Vigorously, Clearly, and Independently.\u2014\"Thinking makes the great man.\" The ninny dreams, leaving others to solve the problems and think out the lessons. In most classes may be found those putty-faced, soft-brained, indolent creatures, who do their best to prove Darwinism. Ability to think rapidly and effectively is the objective point in intellectual culture. The honest, independent, and able thinker is the grandest man that walks this earth.\n\nVI. Study to Know, not to Recite.\u2014Studying to recite is one of the greatest evils connected with school life. In many schools the pupils who study to know are the exceptions. The lesson is recited glibly to-day, but forgotten to-morrow. Good marks are secured, but the child is not educated. Right methods\nof teaching render such reciting impossible. The true teacher inspires the pupil with a love for knowledge. The subject is studied, and the book is used as an instrument. Instead of merely reciting the facts, theories, etc., given in a book, the pupil tells what he thinks about what the book says. The teacher and the pupils together work out wider, deeper, more accurate views of the subject than can be obtained from the text-books. Pupils thus taught never finish their education; it begins in the cradle, nor ceases at the grave.\n\nVII. Use what you Learn.\u2014Knowledge increases mental power. It is valuable for its own sake. Use keeps knowledge fresh. Think, write, talk. Connect books and nature. Connect past and present acquisitions. In whatever you engage, command and use your entire resources. The true teacher trains his pupils to use what they learn, by leading them to tell what they know.\n\nVIII. Duly Mix Study, Recreation, and Rest.\u2014Recreation and rest are essential to physical vigour, and hence to effective study. Winship practised gymnastics and lifting for an hour or two a day, until the weak boy became the strongest man in the world. Daniel Webster would concentrate his mighty powers for a time, then take recreation, and he became the intellectual giant of the age in which he lived. \"Work while you work; play while you play.\" Hard study hurts no one. The greatest thinkers are usually healthy. Man was made to think.\n\nGOOD CONDITIONS OF STUDY are essential to the proper carrying out of any rules or system, and to the full realization of the hopes of teacher and pupils. Cheerful, earnest, well-directed study is the key to scholarship and success; it cannot be secured except under favourable conditions.\n\nI. Physical Conditions.\u2014The body is the organism through which the mind works, and hence must be kept healthy and vigorous. Pure air, suitable exercise, proper diet, cheerfulness, and abundant sleep are the physical conditions of hard study. The stomach should be neither empty nor loaded; the system should be neither excited nor relaxed; the position should be neither uncomfortable nor sleep-inviting. Under such conditions, pupils will have clear heads and the power of physical and mental achievement and endurance.\nII. Surroundings.\u2014The disciplined mind may work on through turmoil, but even philosophers seek solitude and stillness. Much more does the inexperienced pupil require the most favourable surroundings. The wise teacher manages to have a quiet school, to have communications made only through the teacher, to avoid all distractions; he so arranges everything as to foster study. Parents should see that certain hours are made equally favourable for home reading and study. The pupil will soon learn to place himself under the most favourable conditions, and\n\n\"In solitude to muse, to think, to conquer.\"\n\nIII. Struggle or Perish Alone.\u2014Each soul is an individual personality. Self-study and self-help develop individuality and power. Each pupil is trained to do his own work. He learns that \"Heaven helps students who help themselves.\" During recitation and social intercourse, he gains what he can from others. During study, he suffers no one to hinder or assist. The habit of independent study grows into the habit of independent thinking and acting.\n\nIV. Programme for Study.\u2014Comparatively short periods of study, with ever-increasing intensity, are best. I have found forty minutes the best average time for advanced students, both for study and recitation. Intense study during periods of forty minutes, followed by a few minutes of real recreation, enables the student to accomplish twice as much during a year as he can by drudging on through many weary hours. Lively recitations of forty minutes each, followed by short recesses, are also by far the most favourable for advancement. The younger the pupils, and the more intense the work, the shorter must be the periods of study and the longer the intervals of rest. The plan now adopted in many schools, of having a recess of ten minutes at the close of each hour, is based on a profound knowledge of child-nature. Effort must stop short of exhaustion. After rest, the mind readily grapples with the work of the hour. With renewed vigor and power, after each period of recreation, the pupil takes up again the problem. He works systematically, doing specific work at specific times.\n\nThe youth who vigorously follows these directions will steadily increase in physical and mental power.\nTopical Review.\u2014Rules and Conditions for Study.\n\nQuestions relating to the art of study.\n1.

Programmes for study should be carefully planned,\nCHAPTER II.\n\nHow to Study.\n\nHow to Study is the most important lesson that can be taught by the teacher to the pupil, for the development more particularly of his intellectual powers. Any one can study, but he is a philosopher who knows what to study, and when to study, and how to study.\n\nThe farmer, the mechanic, the artist, the scientist, and the teacher are entitled to start with the accumulated experience and achievements of the race. Thus only is progress possible. Surely the child is entitled to no less. To leave the young to grope their way is to rob them of their best years. Wise parents guide the efforts of their little ones. Experienced and wise teachers should direct the activities of learners.\n\nThe chief office of the teacher is to train pupils to right habits of study. He who knows how to study and has the will to study scarcely needs a teacher. He has learned how to search for truth and how to master subjects. He has gradually become self-helpful and independent of the teacher. He falls in love with knowledge, and esteems truth more than millions of gold. The pupil thus trained will be an earnest student through life. How may we educate our pupils to study? How may we make them independent of ourselves.\n\nAttention to the following considerations relating to the order, aids, and benefits of study will assist the teacher in his efforts to find satisfactory answers to these questions.\n\nI. PROGRESSIVE STEPS IN STUDY.\n\n1. Get Clear Ideas of the Lesson.\u2014Experience and previous lessons furnish the basis. What is the general subject? What are the relations of the lesson to previous lessons? Whatever the lesson, the learner asks himself these questions. With the subject clearly before his mind, he goes to work.\n2. Read the Lesson Carefully.\u2014This is done in order to get before the mind its general scope. The student reads the lesson slowly. Each word not understood is examined; and, if compound, analyzed. After thus reading the lesson, the student is prepared for its systematic study.\n\n3. Master the Leading Features of the Lesson.\u2014Now begins hard study. Definitions, principles, divisions, and leading facts or statements are made a part of the pupil's self. He will not rest until he can correctly present and clearly illustrate the principal points. Committing and reciting definitions, principles, or statements, that convey no meaning to him, are monstrous errors. Only principles, definitions, and facts, thoroughly understood, should be treasured in memory.\n\n4. Study Details and Illustrations.\u2014From particulars to generals, then from generals to particulars, is the true method of study. The student begins with the concrete and works up to definitions, principles, and classification; reversing the process, he reduces generals to particulars, thus verifying his conclusions. He synthesizes and analyzes; he induces, deduces, and reduces. He begins with intuitive knowledge, works up to generalization, and finally reduces all generalizations back to intuitive knowledge. At every step he has recourse to illustrations. Illustration is the great lever in study and teaching. To illustrate means to illuminate, to make clear. Illustrations remove mountains of darkness and difficulty. The unknown is expressed in terms of the known. New and abstract truths are reduced, by concretion and comparison, to the range of experience. The child and the philosopher pursue substantially the same course.\n\nToo much detail, and too many illustrations should be carefully avoided; they weary the pupil and tend to obscure the principles rather than to illustrate them. Enough should be given to ensure a mastery of principles and their ready applications, and here the details should cease. Some pupils will require more than others; even experienced teachers will need to be on the alert, and guard against extremes on either side.\n\nII. HELPS IN STUDY.\u2014If the mechanic needs tools, how much more does the student need books? Books are guides as well\nas implements. To learn what books to use and how to use them to the best advantage is one of the most important parts of an education.\n\n1. The Dictionary Stands First.\u2014As soon as the pupil begins the Third Reader, a small dictionary should be placed in his hands, and he should be trained to use it properly. The advanced student, at any sacrifice, must have for constant use an unabridged dictionary. Without a dictionary, no lesson can be properly prepared. Whenever there is a doubt about the meaning, pronunciation, or spelling of a word, the appeal is made to the dictionary. It should be the constant companion of teacher and pupil, as it is of the scholar.\n\n2. Other Text-Books for Reference are needed.\u2014Other authors may often open up new fields of thought, or present the topic from different standpoints. The student with two or three text-books to consult on the same subject has decided advantages.\n\n3. Reference Books.\u2014A good encyclopedia is invaluable. It enables the student to gain wider and deeper knowledge. He finds where information may be had, and learns how to gain it. The more of the works of great thinkers the student has at command, the better. These he consults as he does the dictionary, or as he asks the views of his companions. He learns to commune with the masters, and thus discovers the sources of information, and acquires the power of vigorous thought.\n\n4. Objective Helps.\u2014Agassiz would leave his pupils for days to gain what they could from objects. Afterward he would give instruction based on the student's own observations. Great teachers seem to have uniformly pursued a somewhat similar course. This method is divine. A pupil studies geology from the book; when he comes to the rocks he has to begin again. Does his knowledge help or hinder? The better plan is to begin with nature. Let the pupil make crude collections for geology, zoology, and botany; he finds in these the keys to unlock the books. In geography, physics, and chemistry, let him construct, if necessary, simple apparatus to illustrate the principles. In this way he forces the secrets from nature and from the books. One experiment made by the pupil himself is worth hundreds witnessed.\n5. Outlines of the Subject.\u2014After the subject has been carefully studied, the student prepares an outline, showing the relations of the subdivisions, and also the relations which the subject discussed bears to other subjects. Outlines, properly used, are valuable for these reasons:\n\n(a.) The Outline gives Comprehensiveness.\u2014Having mastered the parts, the student now examines the subject as a whole. What are its latitude and longitude? What are its boundaries? What are the logical relations of the subdivisions? The answers are embodied in the outline.\n\n(b.) The Outline aids Memory.\u2014Ideas are associated in their logical relation. Any link in the outline suggests all the other parts. Students who lack system will be found deficient in memory. Teachers who leave subjects scattered in fragments need not expect their pupils to retain permanently the things taught.\n\nCaution.\u2014Do not make a hobby of diagrams. Though of great value when properly used, outlines may become an incubus. Details precede summaries. The outline is used for review. The teacher who begins with the diagram shows that he has failed to grasp a fundamental principle in teaching; he begins at the top to build the tower.\n\nIII. BENEFITS OF HARD STUDY.\u2014School-books have been so simplified and diluted, teaching has been so largely degraded to the trade of feeding children with spoons, parents have become so fearful that hard study will ruin the health of their fragile darlings, that there doubtless is danger that hard study may become a lost art. Let every educator and every parent ponder the following facts:\n\n1. Hard Study is Healthy.\u2014Man was made to study. Great students have usually been long-lived and healthy. Proper food, plenty of sleep and exercise, and right habits will insure to the hard student vigorous health. Abominable diet, late hours, excessive novel-reading, dissipation, and lack of abundant open-air exercise\u2014not hard study\u2014are the causes of bad health among students. No student who obeys hygienic laws will ever be injured by hard study.\n\n\"Many, far too many, of our school girls and boys are ill-fed or over-fed, and their stomachs, rather than their brains, are over-\nworked. Many, far too many, of our girls, in school and out, are dressed in ways that invite sickness and disease, and their bodies suffer far more than their brains; but jaded stomachs, congested livers, and obstructed circulations make heavy, neuralgic heads, and study becomes a process attended with weariness and discomfort.\"\n\n2. Hard Study Develops Manhood.\u2014Nothing else can take its place. Hard study is the royal road to manhood, as well as to geometry. The student must grapple with the problems and solve them for himself. This gives pluck and tenacity. It develops the feeling of mastery and independence.\n\n3. The End of Study is Culture and Manhood.\u2014Books, teachers and schools are means. Good teachers and good books stimulate and direct effort, but do not relieve the pupil from effort. All our improved educational instrumentalities and methods simply increase the facilities for working out our own educational salvation. \"Thinking makes the great man.\" Hard study is the royal road to manhood and success.\n\n4. Hard Study versus Amusement.\u2014\"A life spent in practical education is the best means of exploding the foolish theories which make the staple of many treatises that assume to tell the teachers how to teach. The teacher's work is so practical that, when he does it best, he can hardly himself tell how he does it. I once thought I could make learning so entertaining that pupils could be educated as an amusement. In this view I was fortified by Rousseau, Locke, and Pestalozzi. I have since learned that such an education, if it were possible, would be a miserable preparation for the stern realities of life. While the teacher should win the attention and sustain the interest, he should keep in mind that amusement in education holds about the same ratio to toil that a lady's jewelry does to her substantial dress.\"\u2014(Prof. F. T. Kemper.)\n\n5. Hard Study must be Encouraged.\u2014Oral teaching must be made to stimulate and direct effort, not displace it. Transparent and well-arranged books must be made to aid in the acquisition of real knowledge. Time must not be wasted in solving puzzles and answering conundrums. Parents and teachers must encourage hard study. Only thus can we educate a race of brave, strong, independent men and women.\nTopical Review\u2014How to Study.\n\nThe Art of Study.\n\n1.

It is the concentration of the mental energies upon one thing at a time. The art of teaching is based on the art of securing and holding the attention of the learner, and thus developing the habit of attention.\n\nI. EDUCATIONAL IMPORTANCE OF ATTENTION.\n\n1. Attention is the Condition of Knowledge.\u2014Without some degree of attention, nothing can be learned. The accumulated power of attention renders acquisition possible.\n\n2. Mental Growth Depends upon Attention.\u2014Mental power increases in proportion as the pupil acquires the power of exact, rapid, penetrating, and prolonged attention. Imbeciles lack this power.\n\n3. Perception and Memory Depend upon Attention.\u2014Where there is no attention, we are unconscious of mental action, and hence recollection is impossible. The closer the attention, the clearer are our perceptions and the more tenacious our memories. Indistinct perception and poor memory are largely the results of the habit of inattention.\n\n4. Teaching Power is Determined by the Power to Secure and Hold the Attention.\u2014Without this power, neither ability nor scholarship can avail. It is clear that the art of securing attention is a fundamental qualification of the teacher. Education is a failure unless it develops in the pupil the power of penetrating and prolonged attention.\n\nII. UNFAVOURABLE CONDITIONS.\u2014As far as possible, whatever distracts attention should be avoided. The disciplined mind may work amid confusion, but children need every favouring influence in their weak efforts to give attention.\n1. Boisterous Teaching Distracts the Attention of those Studying.\u2014Teachers and pupils should speak in low or medium tones. We want energy, but not noise. Study to be quiet as well as earnest.\n\n2. Punishing Pupils during School Hours Seriously Interferes with Attention.\u2014Only the most unskilful teachers distract the attention of the school by reproof or scolding or other punishments. \"A time for everything.\"\n\n3. Speaking to the Teacher Diverts Attention.\u2014\"May I speak?\" \"May I get a drink?\" \"May I leave my seat?\" No such questions should be permitted. All necessary communications should be made by silent signals. The first question must never be asked. For the second question, the hand is raised with the first finger extended; for the third, with the first and second fingers extended, etc. The teacher responds by an appropriate movement of the head. Better see that all such things are attended to during the recess, and thus avoid these interruptions.\n\n4. Watching Disorderly Pupils is most Damaging.\u2014The entire attention of the teacher is due to the class reciting. Only thus can he hold the attention of the pupils. Here is a serious difficulty. There is no remedy but in training the pupils to the habit of self-government. Place the disorderly where they will not need watching. Let your eyes and ears always be wide open, so as to take in the whole school. Watching the bad pupils will become unnecessary.\n\nIII. HOW NOT TO SECURE ATTENTION.\u2014Attention is not secured by claiming it; not by entreating it; not by urging its importance; not by threats; not by promises; not by bribes. All such efforts are the subterfuges of the weak and the unskilful; but they fail to long hold attention, and utterly fail to develop a habit of attention. The art of securing attention is positive, not negative.\n\nIV. RULES FOR SECURING AND CULTIVATING ATTENTION.\n\nRule 1. Command Attention by Interesting the Pupils.\u2014This is the fundamental means of securing, as well as of cultivating, the power of attention. The teacher must have some.\nthing good to present, and must present it in a suitable manner. Study the secret springs of interest. Keep curiosity and the thirst for knowledge always active.\n\n(1.) Novel Objects.\u2014The child is all attention to novel objects. As primary teaching is necessarily objective, means of interesting pupils are readily commanded. Infinitely silly must be the teacher who does not use objects as the means of securing and cultivating the attention of children. In nearly all school work objects may be used to increase the interest.\n\n(2.) Stories.\u2014Children are wonderfully attentive to stories, anecdotes, incidents, and lively descriptions. Each recitation may be made more attractive and more valuable by incidents, anecdotes, or something else in this line. Be brief, and make everything illustrate the lesson.\n\n(3.) Adaptation.\u2014All knowledge, if timely, and adapted to the capacity of pupils, may be made as interesting as objects and stories. Your language, your manner, your illustrations, and your methods must be suited to the advancement of your pupils. The knowledge must be yours, and must be fresh.\n\n(4.) Mistakes.\u2014Tasks, repulsive lessons, and forced work are educational mistakes. They repel and repress rather than develop the power of attention. It is glad activity that gives culture. When study is made more interesting than play, pupils, unasked, give the utmost attention. By interest and management, not by force, the soul is reached, and glad effort secured.\n\n\"Command the attention of young pupils by an animated manner, and by addressing curiosity and expectation; of older pupils, by brevity and clearness of language, and by logical connection of matter.\"\n\nRule 2. Win Attention by Endless Variety.\u2014Avoid all routine, all monotony, all prosy explanations. Make everything real. Flash upon the class your information and your explanations. Win attention by presenting new and fresh knowledge. Prepare for each lesson. Create activity and win attention by constant surprises. Thus, while educating others, you will yourself grow strong and vigorous.\nRule 3. Attract Attention by a Good Elocution.\u2014Don't talk much; don't talk loud; never scold; and seldom repeat. Talk to the point, be in earnest, and keep in mind that \"words fitly spoken are like apples of gold in pictures of silver.\" As the magnet attracts the needle, so does good elocution attract attention. Where the elocution is good, it is seldom necessary to ask attention. It is hard for any one to give attention to droning, inarticulate, monotonous, lifeless utterances. \"'Tis modulation charms the ear\" and rivets the attention.\n\n\"That I may attract attention, I must have attractive power that will draw the pupil toward me. I must have magnetism that will hold the pupil fast to me. I must have enthusiasm that will fire my pupil with zeal for work. I must be able to sink myself from sight; to transfer attention from myself to my subject. If I have these four personal elements in my teaching, I shall get attention and hold it. If I have not, I must cultivate them.\"\n\nRule 4. Compel Attention by Right Class Management.\u2014Each member of the class is held responsible for the entire lesson. Each one may be called on at any moment. Inattention is considered a serious disgrace. Questions are asked but once. Topic and question methods, individual and concert answers, written and oral work, are duly intermingled. The pupils are learning, not merely reciting. Most minds are somewhat sluggish, and work well only under pressure. The skilful teacher incites without exciting; presses without coercing; instructs without repressing self-helpfulness; inspires without confusing; compels without forcing.\n\nRule 5. Favour Attention by Frequent Change of Position.\u2014If kept long in one position, pupils will become restless and inattentive. Now let them stand, now sit; now make them work on the board, now explain; now let them answer individually, now in concert; now give a moment's exercise, or vary the position in some way, and thus make attention possible and pleasant. \"Give attention a chance.\"\n\nRule 6. Promote Attention by Vigilance.\u2014Use your eyes and ears. The entire class and the entire school must be seen and heard. All symptoms of inattention must be noted at once and\nthe remedies applied. Stupid teachers, who see but a part of the class or school, promote inattention. Sensible teachers will not continue the lesson for a moment without attention. The alert teacher promotes attention by always being wide awake.\n\nRule 7. Cultivate Attention by Frequency of Repetition.\u2014During each recitation the leading features of previous lessons are required. Because they are required to use their knowledge continually, pupils learn to give close attention. Studying merely to recite is a fatal error. The lesson of today is forgotten tomorrow. Now, nothing can be said to be well learned until it has been often before the mind. Then, children delight to do that which they can do well. Cultivate attention by making each lesson a review of all previous lessons.\n\nRule 8. Stimulate Attention by Rewarding it.\u2014Always have something interesting and valuable to present. The teacher supplements both the book and child-experience. He is a great student. He constantly interrogates nature. His knowledge is always fresh and sparkling; it is at once wider and more specific than that derived from text-books. He opens up to child-mind new beauties and new wonders. Curiosity is kept active. Every energy is aroused. The pupil grows strong as well as wise, and the power of ready and penetrating attention becomes a life habit.\n\nRule 9. Encourage Attention by Showing that it is the Key to Success.\u2014Your own observation will furnish many examples. Each successful life is an example. Each pupil's experience will illustrate the rule.\n\n(1.) Newton.\u2014\"The difference between myself and other men consists chiefly in the habit I have acquired of more completely concentrating my attention, and holding it longer upon a subject, than most men. Because I have acquired the power of intense and prolonged attention, I am able to accomplish what others fail to do.\"\n\n(2.) Dickens.\u2014\"The only serviceable, safe, certain, remunerative, attainable quality in every study is the power of attention. Whatever I have tried to do in life, I have tried with all my heart to do well. Whatever I have devoted myself to, I have devoted myself to completely. This I now find to have been my golden rule.\"\n\n(3.) Napoleon.\u2014\"The mind is like a chest with many drawers:\nwhen one is opened, all the rest should be closed. I am able to despatch a marvellous amount of work, because, with all the powers of my mind, I attend to one thing at a time. When I have finished the work in one drawer, I close it and open another. When I have finished and closed all, I can rest; I can sleep at once, even on the battle-field.\"\n\nV. UNWISE INCENTIVES TO STUDY.\u2014As a rule, prizes, individual emulation, rewards, punishments, and all such incentives, are unwise and generally injurious. The true teacher will very seldom need to resort to such expedients. The incentives embodied in the above rules will be found all-sufficient.\n\n\"If prizes are ever offered, it should only be in cases where the pupil can not be reached by worthier motives, and as an expedient to lift him to a higher plane.\n\n\"I have known a few cases in which rewards, and even punishments, were productive of good results; but such instances are exceptional. The rule is, that the fruitage of such motives is bad. Inflating the minds of children with ambitious prospects of becoming some 'great one' is baneful and pernicious. Such incentives turn the youth from the shops and farms and overcrowd the professions\u2014results inimical to the stability and prosperity of the state.\n\n\"The love of knowledge, the development of a true manhood, preparation for the highest usefulness, qualification for the greatest happiness, approval of the Creator\u2014these are better, safer, nobler motives.\"\u2014Prof. William Irrelan.\n\nThe Question of Rewards and Punishments is one that still admits of discussion; and we do not intend our statements in the text to imply that all rewards and all punishments are to be discarded, even as means for the attainment of the mental development of the pupils. The true objective point in education is the development and culture of the mind, and the communication of knowledge by the teacher, directly and indirectly, is and always will be the chief means of securing this end. He is the best teacher who can attain this object with the least help from rewards and punishments; but we do not expect that even the best teacher will be able to dispense entirely with these doubtful incentives until the educational millennium has arrived, and that, we fear, is not so very close at hand as some of us would fondly hope.\nTopical Review.\u2014Art of Securing Attention and Study.\n\nImportance of securing attention.\n1.

Every successful primary teacher makes the same discovery. As a result, many of our primary schools are becoming models of interest and adaptation; means and methods are adapted to child-nature. As flowers unfold amid sunshine, so children develop under genial influences.\n\nI. SCHOOL WORK SHOULD GIVE PLEASURE.\u2014As motion is in the line of the least resistance, so education is in the line of the greatest pleasure. Not painful, but pleasurable, are the processes of development. The application of this pervading principle is working an educational revolution such as the world has never before known.\n\nThe old education was painful and repulsive. Studies were considered beneficial in proportion as they were distasteful. The new education inspires voluntary and glad effort. Adaptation and interest are cardinal. The old education consisted largely of unmeaning task-work, which tended to discourage and repress. The new education leads the pupil to discover and apply, and inspires boundless enthusiasm.\n\nII. PLAY IS AN EDUCATIONAL PROCESS.\u2014It is the natural vent of the child's activity. Properly directed, the child plays up to work. To thus direct play is the mission of the Kindergarten. This can be done largely in every family and in every primary school. The play songs cultivate a love of music. The construction blocks lay a foundation for inventive drawing. The exercise plays develop strength and grace. The mother and the teacher who understand childhood will need few hints. There is a limitless field from which to choose.\n\nIII. HAND AND EYE CULTURE.\u2014The child is incapable of abstract study. He deals with the concrete. Ideas are developed through action. Results are worked out.\n1. Reading.\u2014The object is examined. The name is spoken and placed on the board. The pupils find the word on the cards, print it on the board, write it on their slates. Words are combined and read. Lessons are written or printed on board and slates. Words are spelled and sentences written. Pictures are drawn. Objects are collected and brought to class. Constant activity and endless change characterize preparation and recitation. Hand work leads up to mind work. The pupils read well because they understand what they read.\n\n2. Drawing and Penmanship.\u2014The fact that every child loves to make pictures, indicates a great educational law. Drawing educates the hand, develops taste, aids in the acquisition of knowledge, and is of great practical value. It keeps pupils interested and busy.\n\n3. Arithmetic.\u2014With small sticks, the numeral frame, weights, measures, etc., each pupil performs the operations. The board and slate are used without limit. The children are delighted because they can do, as well as understand, the work.\n\n4. Geography.\u2014With a board and some clay and sand, the continents, the divisions of land and water, etc., are constructed. Maps are drawn on slates and board. The globe and outline maps are made to do good service. The divisions of land and water are all made on the playground. A solid foundation is laid in actual experience.\n\n5. Other branches equally engage the hand and eye. Indeed, hand exercise is the secret of success in primary-school work. The little ones are over-flowing with activity. Let this activity be so directed as to keep them interested and busy. At the same time let it be so directed as to lead to knowledge and culture.\n\nIV. VOICE CULTURE.\u2014Speech and song are divine. All children delight in vocal effort. The teacher so manages as to make the vocal exercises educational. The child becomes an excellent reader, a charming conversationalist, a sweet singer. The teacher takes lessons from the children while at play, and trains them to be equally natural and eloquent in the school-room. Every lesson is full of meaning and full of action. The Kindergarten has taught us invaluable lessons, true to nature.\nV. BODY CULTURE.\u2014Play\u2014spontaneous activity\u2014prepares for work\u2014determined activity. Play is the best exercise for children, yet calisthenics are indispensable, for these reasons:\n\n(1.) These exercises educate the body\u2014give the children better command of the body.\n\n(2.) They are hygienic. By fostering a good circulation of the blood, they make the brain a better instrument for mental effort.\n\n(3.) They promote order by working off the restless activity of childhood.\n\n(4.) They tend to fit for citizenship. Pupils learn to act in concert, and thus prepare for the rhythm of society. They learn exact and prompt obedience to rightful authority, and are thus prepared for citizenship.\n\nThese exercises need to be frequent and varied, calling into activity every muscle. They must be adapted to the strength of the pupils, and must be so managed as to delight the children. \"Physical Culture,\" by E. B. Houghton, will give the inexperienced teacher a full series of suitable exercises for pupils of all grades.\n\nVI. ACTION AND CULTURE.\u2014The following great educational principles pervade all primary work:\n\n1. All true education is self-education.\n2. Personal and persistent effort is the condition of growth.\n3. Child-culture consists largely of well-directed physical activities.\n4. The chief office of the teacher is to stimulate and direct child-effort.\n5. Child-growth is simply the gradual, continuous, all-sided development of the original powers and tendencies of child-nature.\n\nThe day for parrot-work, for cramming, for mere book-teaching, for stultifying and dwarfing, for lifeless, repulsive schools, is for ever past. Now our little ones begin their education with glad activity. They see, and hear, and taste, and handle. They feel, and choose, and do. They begin with nature and oral teaching, and from ideas are lead to words, from words to definitions, from nature to books. They tread surely, because every step rests on the rock of personal experience. They move on cheerily, because each lesson opens up new beauties. They grow strong, because each step is a victory.\n\n\"Good schools are the natural results of good teaching. They never come of good school-discourses, or good courses of study, or good superintendence, or good discourses on the philosophy of education, taken alone. All these external means may be useful and necessary as conditions; but good teachers, guided by a true method, constitute the efficient cause of all good schools.\"\nTopical Review\u2014Work for the Little Ones.\n\nSchool work should give pleasure.\n1.

The body and the mind are inter-dependent.\n2. Education is a growth.\n3. The mind in all its faculties is self-acting.\n4. By systematic and well-directed effort each power of the soul is educated.\n5. The teacher stimulates and directs effort, but all education is self-education.\n6. The teacher, to take a single intelligent step, must understand the plan of child-mind and the plan of the subject taught.\n7. In teaching, the matter and the method must be adapted to the capacity of the learner.\n8. At every stage, contact with the entire circle of science is necessary to complete and harmonious development.\n9. Educational effort should be in the line of least resistance\u2014i.e., of greatest pleasure.\n10. At every step in education, moral, intellectual, and physical development should receive due attention.\n\nII. General Principles of Education.\u2014(Brooks.)\n\n1. The primary object of education is the perfection of the individual.\n2. The perfection of the individual is attained by the harmonious and full development of all his powers.\n\n*These principles are merely stated here; in the \"Science of Human Culture\" and \"The Art of Teaching\" they are derived, examined, and applied.\n\n[180]\n3. The intellectual powers develop naturally in a certain order, which order should be followed in education: perception, memory, imagination, conception, judgment, reason.\n\n4. The basis of this development is the self-activity of the child.\n\n5. This self-activity has two distinct phases: from without inward\u2014receptive and acquisitive; and from within outward\u2014productive and expressive.\n\n6. These two phases, the receptive and productive, should go hand in hand in the work of education.\n\n7. There must be objective realities to supply the condition for the self-activity of the mind.\n\n8. Education is not creative; it simply develops existing realities and possibilities.\n\n9. Education should be so modified and adapted as to develop the different tastes and talents of the pupils.\n\n10. A scheme of education should aim to attain the triumphant result\u2014development, learning, and efficiency.\n\nIII. Psychological Principles relating to Teaching.*\n\n1. In education, culture is worth more than knowledge.\n\n2. Exercise is the great law of culture.\n\n3. The teacher should aim to give careful culture to the perceptive powers of the child.\n\n4. The teacher should aim to furnish the memory of the child with facts and words.\n\n5. The memory should be trained to operate by the laws of association and suggestion.\n\n6. The power of forming ideal creations should be carefully cultivated.\n\n7. The mind should gradually be led from concrete to abstract ideas.\n\n8. A child should be gradually led from particular ideas to general ideas.\n\n* \"Normal Method of Teaching,\" by Edward Brooks, is a valuable work, in which these principles are elaborated and applied.\n9. A youth should be taught to reason first inductively and then deductively.\n\n10. A learner should be gradually led to attain clear conceptions of intuitive ideas and truths.\n\nIV. Principles pertaining to the Order of presenting Truth. (Brooks.)\n\n1. The second object of teaching is to impart knowledge.\n\n2. Things should be taught before words.\n\n3. Ideas should be taught before truths.\n\n4. Particular ideas should be taught before general ideas.\n\n5. Facts, or particular truths, should be taught before principles, or general truths.\n\n6. In the physical sciences, causes should be taught before laws.\n\n7. In the physical sciences, causes and laws should be taught before the scientific classification.\n\n8. The elements of the inductive sciences should precede the deductive sciences.\n\n9. The formal study of the deductive sciences should precede that of the inductive sciences.\n\n10. The metaphysical sciences should be the last in a course of instruction.\n\nV. Principles pertaining to the Processes in Harmonious Teaching.*\n\n1. Primary instruction should proceed from the known to the unknown.\n\n2. Advanced instruction may sometimes proceed from the unknown to the known.\n\n3. Primary instruction should be given in the concrete.\n\n4. Advanced instruction should be more abstract.\n\n5. Primary instruction should be synthetic and analytic.\n\n6. Advanced instruction should be both analytic and synthetic.\n\n* James Johonnot, in \"Principles and Practice of Teaching.\" Some of the principles are slightly modified.\n7. Primary instruction should be inductive.\n8. Advanced instruction should be inductive and deductive.\n9. Primary instruction should proceed from the practical to the theoretical.\n10. Advanced instruction should proceed from the theoretical to the practical.\n\nVI. Principles pertaining to Courses of Study and Methods of Teaching. (Johonnot.)\n\n1. All primary ideas of the material world must come through the senses.\n2. The senses should be trained and made acute by systematic object-teaching.\n3. Attention is best secured by proper and related object lessons.\n4. Perceptive knowledge should be made the basis of primary instruction.\n5. Memory is best cultivated by forcible, repeated, and related perceptions and ideas.\n6. Subjects appealing mainly to the reason and judgment belong to the advanced course of instruction.\n7. Ideas should precede words.\n8. Instruction should proceed from the known to the unknown.\n9. Exercise should be left to the pupil.\n10. Each process of instruction should include full perception, distinct understanding, clear expression, and, where possible, the passing of thought into action.\n\nTopical Review.\u2014Principles of Education and Teaching.\n\n1.

For their solution the centuries have done much. Much may be learned of the masters, from Socrates down. But, with all the lights of the past, and all the helps of the present, each one, from necessity, must work out these problems for himself. The teacher is an artist, not an artisan. In what follows, the effort is to develop principles rather than rules, and to create better ideals rather than to teach specific methods. The teacher should be the master of methods, not the slave. His mind should mingle with that of the pupil, and he should breathe a new life into the soul of the learner. Do you think such a teacher will ever be found standing before his class, book in hand, trying to teach verbal definitions, and listening to verbatim recitations?\n\nI. The Interested Attention of all must be Secured.\u2014The interested attention of each pupil during the entire recitation is the first condition of success in teaching. You may be able to solve the hardest problems and write the ablest books, but if you have not the power to secure and hold the attention of your pupils, you can not teach.\n\n[187]\nII. Each Pupil must be held Responsible for Each Answer.\u2014Each question or topic should be discussed silently by each member of the class. Any one who fails to object to an erroneous answer is held as agreeing with it. This principle individualizes the pupils, compels attention, fosters independent thought, and secures accuracy. It utterly discards all mere routine methods, so productive of inattention, listlessness, parrot answers, and dulness.\n\nIII. The Pupil must Answer in his Own Language.\u2014Rarely should the pupil be permitted to answer in the language of the book or of the teacher. From the earliest stages, the pupil must be trained to translate everything into his own language. Only thus can we be certain that the subject is understood. This principle will lead to true language culture and thorough scholarship. This, of course, does not apply to the committing to memory of select passages of verse and prose,\u2014an exercise that should hold a very important place in the teaching of the young.\n\nIV. The Teacher must never do for the Pupil what he can Manage to make him Do for Himself.\u2014Education results from self-exertion. Culture comes from well-directed personal effort. The best teacher helps his pupils the least, but manages to have them help themselves the most.\n\nV. All Assistance should be given During Recitation.\u2014The entire time of the teacher is needed to conduct the recitations and manage the school; therefore it is better for the pupil to prepare the lesson unaided. In class, the necessary assistance can be given to twenty as well as to one. All needed instruction can be given during the recitation, leaving the teacher free during rests and before and after school to look after the higher interests of the pupils. Few will question either the soundness or the importance of this principle. Only novices work the problems for their pupils.\n\nVI. Train the Pupil to be Honest, Independent, and Thorough.\u2014All pretense should be discouraged. The pupil should be stimulated to independent effort, both in preparing and reciting, and should be encouraged to refuse assistance when at all able to achieve the victory for himself. This principle can hardly be made too emphatic.\nVII. The Pupil, not the Teacher, should do the Work.\u2014The violation of this principle is a common but pernicious error of the profession. Leading questions, such as involve the answer, or hint words, finishing the answer when the pupil hesitates, repeating the answer after the pupil, solving all the difficulties as soon as they present themselves, are a few of the ways in which too many teachers defraud their pupils. The pupils, and not the teacher, should do the reciting.\n\nVIII. Manage to reach the Pupils Individually during each Recitation.\u2014The certainty of being called upon is a most effectual stimulus to preparation. Whenever a class becomes so large that this principle cannot be observed, it should be divided. The skilful, energetic teacher, in most subjects, can manage admirably a class not exceeding thirty, and will reach each one repeatedly during each recitation.\n\nIX. Oral and Written Exercises should occupy about Equal Time.\u2014With young pupils, the oral must predominate. With all the advanced grades, much written work is needed. The ability to give concise, clear, correct, and well-written answers is a desideratum. The wise teacher uses the blackboard almost constantly. Much written work may be brought to the recitation, on slates or paper. Country schools too often neglect the written work; hence the common inability to write a creditable letter or business paper.\n\nX. System, Vigour, and Vivacity must characterize Class Management.\u2014Only systematic effort produces desirable results. The utter want of system will account for the shamefully low products of so many schools. Then, vigour and life are necessary in order to maintain an unflagging interest and elicit the best efforts of the pupils.\n\nXI. The Hearts of both Teacher and Pupil must be in the Work.\u2014The disregard of this principle is painfully prevalent. Failure is almost certain when either the teacher or the pupil has no heart for the work. Love of the work is a primary condition of success.\nTopical Review.\u2014Principles Relating to Class Management.\n\nClass Defined.\n1. Advantages of division into classes.\n2. Teachers study principles, and devise methods.\n\nI. The interest of the pupils must be secured.\n   Scholarship fails unless supported by power to arouse attention.\n\nII. Each pupil responsible for each answer.\n   1. Each pupil considers the question on his own account.\n   2. Rotation questioning\u2014\"Next! Next!\"\u2014generally useless.\n\nIII. Answers must be in the pupil's own words.\n   1. This ensures thorough understanding of the topic.\n   2. It cultivates the pupil's powers of expression and composition.\n   3. Committing to memory must not be overlooked.\n\nIV. The pupil must do what he can for himself.\n   Self-exertion results in education, strength, and culture.\n\nV. Recitation hour is the time for explanation.\n   1. Explanations to individual pupils waste time.\n   2. Disorderly habits result from disorderly instruction.\n\nVI. Pupils should be honest, independent, thorough.\n   1. Neither pupil nor teacher should be guilty of pretense.\n   2. Pupils should refuse unnecessary assistance.\n   3. Thoroughness commands success.\n\nVII. Pupils, not teachers, should do the work.\n   1. Modes of violating this principle are numerous.\n   2. The violation is a fraud on the pupil and the community.\n\nVIII. Each pupil recites at every lesson of his class.\n   1. The certainty of being called on ensures preparation.\n   2. No class should be too large for individual recitation.\n\nIX. Oral and written work equally important.\n   1. Young children require most oral work.\n   2. Written exercises develop the powers of more advanced pupils.\n\nX. System, vigour, and vivacity essential to success.\n   These are useful with individuals, essential with classes.\n\nXI. The heart must be in the work.\n   If the pupil's heart is not in the work, get it there.\nCHAPTER II.\n\nLessons and Class Work.\n\nEducational results worked out by the thought and experience of educators are made to tell in the class. Guided by great principles, with well-defined objects in view, the teacher awakens thought, directs effort, concentrates mental activity, and trains the pupil to achieve results.\n\nI. OBJECTS OF CLASS WORK.\u2014The immediate contact of the minds of teacher and pupil, stimulating and training to systematic and persistent effort, the correction of faults, and the building up of right habits, are the general objects of class work. The following are some of the special objects:\n\n1. To train the pupil in the Art of Study.\u2014How to study is an art to be learned. That mother who said to the teacher, \"Train my boy to prepare the lessons, and I will hear him recite them,\" displayed great wisdom. But she evidently did not know that a properly conducted recitation is the best means of training the pupil how to study, and also of stimulating him to prepare for the recitation.\n\n2. Examination of Written Work prepared by Pupils.\u2014With young pupils this should never be neglected. Good work should be commended.\n\n3. To test the Extent of the Pupil's Preparation.\u2014There can be no excuse for poor lessons. Thorough preparation must be secured at all hazards. The certainty that the preparation will be thoroughly tested is a powerful incentive to study. The pupil's knowledge of the subject may be tested by topics, by questions, or by requiring a written outline.\n\n4. To train to the Habit of Clear, Concise, and Connected Expression.\u2014Pupils should recite by topics as well as discuss the lesson. Merely answering questions is not enough. Written answers and composition are admirable means of cultivating accurate and ready expression.\n5. To arouse Interest, cultivate a Love of Study, and train to Investigate.\u2014This is vastly more important than the knowledge communicated or acquired.\n\n6. To impart Information.\u2014The teacher supplements the text-book, and literally feeds the hungry minds of his pupils.\n\n7. To direct the Work of the Pupils.\u2014When under intelligent direction the pupil accomplishes many times as much as when left to grope his way.\n\n8. To lead the Pupil to apply the Things Learned.\u2014Mere isolated facts are almost worthless, yet much of the current teaching gives the pupil little more. The living teacher and class work are needed to lead the pupil to realise that all the sciences are one hierarchy, and to train him to classify and use the knowledge acquired.\n\nII. LENGTH OF RECITATIONS.\u2014The length of the recitation must depend on the character of the school and the age and advancement of the pupils. Short, lively recitations are better than long, dull ones. The attention can be secured and the interest maintained only for a limited time. To continue the recitation longer will prove an injury.\n\nThe Limits.\u2014The widest experience in all countries has satisfied educators that the best results are secured within the following limits: (1.) Primary school, from 10 to 20 minutes; (2.) 3rd and 4th classes, from 20 to 30 minutes; (3.) Advance classes, from 30 to 40 minutes; (4.) College, from 40 to 60 minutes. In country schools no recitation should be less than ten nor more than thirty minutes. No effort should be spared to secure sufficient time to make each recitation effective.\n\nIII. ASSIGNING LESSONS.\u2014Teachers often greatly err in the assignment of lessons. Age, capacity, and opportunity are alike ignored. Regardless of the difficulties, so many pages are assigned. Figures cannot express the evils resulting from this stupid practice. \"Show me the lessons assigned, and I will tell you the merits of the teacher.\" To assign lessons judiciously requires unlimited care, sound judgment, and accurate knowledge. General directions may be given, but the art can only be acquired by experience.\n1. The Lesson must be Adapted to the Class.\u2014Not to the two or three bright pupils, or the two or three dull ones, but to the body of the class. Additional work, such as reports, may be given to the bright pupils, and only the minimum amount of work required of the dull ones. This elasticity enables the teacher to do the best for each pupil, even in large classes.\n\n2. Assign Pages as well as Subjects.\u2014The old schoolmaster assigned pages, some modern teachers assign subjects; but the practical teacher will assign definite lessons in the text-books in connection with the subjects. The mere theorist would have you assign subjects only; but the practical worker steadily assigns specific book work as well as subjects.\n\n3. Assign Short Lessons.\u2014You can then count on thorough preparation. Besides, the pupil will have time for work outside of the book, and in class you will have time for instruction, drill, and review.\n\nThe young physician gives strong medicines in large doses, but the old physician gives mild medicines in small doses. So it is with teachers. The inexperienced teacher will take a class through the Third Reader in a single quarter, while our best schools take two years for the same work. The object is not to rush \"through the book,\" but to develop all the powers of the soul. The acquisition of valuable knowledge is both a means and a result.\n\n4. In Assigning the Lesson, Teach the Pupils How to Prepare it.\u2014With young pupils this is peculiarly important. While the work must be directed by the teacher, his great duty is to initiate the pupils into the ways of doing it for themselves. A little time spent in giving the necessary instruction will create interest, incite to cheerful study, and secure successful preparation.\n\nIV. TREATMENT OF THE UNPREPARED.\n\n1. Encourage Always.\u2014Heartily approve good work, and show the failing ones that they too may succeed. Nothing should be done to discourage the pupil. He can and will try.\n\n2. Ascertain the Cause of Failure.\u2014You can then judiciously seek a remedy. In school management we have no specifics. Each case needs special treatment, and all general directions are merely suggestive.\n3. Let Pupils Understand that you expect Good Lessons.\u2014This is a powerful motive to most pupils. They grieve to see your look of disappointment when they fail, but they are made happy by your approving smile when they succeed.\n\n4. Impress the Importance of Diligent Study.\u2014Each one works for himself, not for his parent or his teacher. Good lessons are the beginning of success in life. Failure is a serious matter to the pupil, the parent, the school, and the world.\n\n5. In Chronic Cases of Failure, the Pupil must be Made to Feel the Loss.\u2014This can be done in various ways:\n\n(1.) By commending diligent pupils. The shortcomings of the negligent are thus placed in sharp contrast.\n\n(2.) By excusing from class. The recitation is the privilege of the diligent, and the unprepared forfeit this privilege.\n\n(3.) By reducing to a lower class. Such pupils must not be permitted to become an incubus to their fellows.\n\n(4.) By excusing from school. After every possible expedient has failed, it is better to let the pupil rest a term or two.\n\n6. Never Force Pupils to Study.\u2014Detaining or whipping pupils to make them study is a relic of ancient barbarism. Generally the teacher rather than the pupil deserves the punishment. Do you adapt the matter and the method to the capacity of the pupil? Do you infuse life and energy into everything? Do you manage to let each pupil feel the pleasure of achievement? Do you make study more interesting than play? If you do not, can you afford to punish pupils for not studying? All the powers of the soul develop when study is a real joy. Glad activity is the great secret in education.\n\n7. Use Force to Overcome Bad Habits.\u2014The idle, the negligent, the careless, the stupid, and the wayward must be reached. Punishment in some form is a necessity; only let it be made plain that the pupil is punished for idleness and disobedience. I have no sympathy with wishy-washy management. Some things must be done. The pupil must study. Force must be used if necessary to overcome bad habits. Secure earnest study by wise management.\nTopical Review\u2014Lessons and Class Work.\n\nObjects of Class Work.\n\n1. To train the pupils in the art of study.\n2. Examination of written exercises.\n3. Testing the pupil's preparation.\n4. To cultivate the practice of correct composition.\n5. To stimulate interest, love of study and investigation.\n6. To supplement the knowledge gained from the text-book.\n7. Intelligent direction of the pupils in their work.\n8. To lead the pupils to apply their learning.\n\nLength of Recitations.\n\n1. Must not exceed the powers of the pupils.\n2. Limits according to class and age.\n   (a.) Junior pupils in primary schools\u201410 to 20 minutes.\n   (b.) Third and junior fourth classes\u201420 to 30 minutes.\n   (c.) Advanced classes\u201430 to 40 minutes.\n   (d.) Adult classes in college, &c.\u201440 to 60 minutes.\n\nAssigning Lessons.\n\n1. The lesson is for the average of the class.\n2. Pages as well as subjects should be specified.\n3. Short lessons secure the most thorough preparation.\n4. Teach the pupils how to prepare the lesson.\n\nTreatment of the Unprepared.\n\n1. Approve good work, and encourage every honest effort.\n2. Ascertain causes and apply remedies for failure.\n3. Show that you expect careful preparation.\n4. Impress the importance of diligent study.\n5. In chronic cases:\n   (a.) Contrast failure with successful cases.\n   (b.) Deprive of the privilege of recitation.\n   (c.) Remove to a lower class.\n   (d.) Suspend in extreme cases only.\n6. Do not try to win a love of study by force.\n   Employ force to punish idleness and disobedience.\nCHAPTER III.\n\nGENERAL CLASS METHODS.\n\nClass Work stimulates and directs Effort.\u2014The fruitful mind of the teacher broods over the struggling mind of the pupil\u2014arousing, guiding, instructing. The learner is trained to wrest the secrets from nature and books. Mental power is developed and right habits are formed. This is teaching.\n\nClass Methods vary as Subjects and Teachers vary.\u2014The method is determined by the subject, the class, and the teacher. The end to be reached is culture by means of mastering subjects. The safe rule is to employ such methods as will best enable you to effect the desired results.\n\nGeneral Class Methods are used in all subjects, and are common to all good teaching. Founded in educational principles, they are essentials in the art of teaching. Such are the Socratic, the Topic and Question, the Discussion, and the Conversation methods. The Lecture method has, perhaps, some claims to recognition under this head.\n\nI. THE SOCRATIC METHOD.\n\n1. Definition.\u2014By skilful questioning the pupil is led to discover truth for himself. Subjects are examined from the standpoint of the learner. The teacher stimulates and directs, but never crams. Pupils are encouraged to present their own thoughts. If correct, the teacher deepens and widens these views by suggestive illustrations; if incorrect, the absurdity is shown by leading the pupils to discover the legitimate consequences. Thus the burden of observation and research is thrown upon the learner, who, at every step, feels the joy of discovery and the conscious pleasure of assisting the teacher. Such teaching results in development, growth, education.\n\n2. Illustrations. The following free translation of a conversation between Socrates and one of his pupils is a good example of the Socratic method:\n\n[196]\nMeno. \"Socrates, we come to you feeling strong and wise; we leave you feeling helpless and ignorant. Why is this?\"\n\nSocrates. \"I will show you.\" Calling a young Greek, and making a line in the sand, \"Boy, how long is this line?\"\n\nBoy. \"It is a foot long, sir.\"\n\nSocrates. \"How long is this line?\"\n\nBoy. \"It is two feet long, sir.\"\n\nSocrates. \"How much larger would be the square constructed on the second line than on the first line?\"\n\nBoy. \"It would be twice as large, sir.\"\n\nUnder the direction of the boy, Socrates constructs the two squares.\n\nSocrates. \"How much larger than the first did you say the second square would be?\"\n\nBoy. \"I said it would be twice as large.\"\n\nSocrates. \"But how much larger is it?\"\n\nBoy. \"It is four times as large.\"\n\nSocrates. \"Thank you, my boy; you may go.\u2014Meno, that boy came to me full of confidence, thinking himself wise. I told him nothing. By a few simple questions I led him to see his error and discover the truth. Though really wiser, he goes away feeling humbled.\"\n\nThe above is an object lesson. To illustrate the Socratic method of teaching abstract truths, another example is given:\n\nA Model Lesson.\u2014\"Socrates would convince Alcibiades, in opposition to materialistic views, that the mind is the man. He abstains from laying this down as a proposition to be proved, and offers no connected argument. He begins by asking whether he who uses a thing and the thing used are not altogether different; and then, Alcibiades being reluctant to answer positively, he asks again more specifically:\n\n\"Socrates. A currier, does he not use a cutting-knife? is he not different from the instrument he uses?\n\n\"Alcibiades. Most certainly.\n\n\"S. In like manner the lyrist, is he not different from the instrument he plays on?\n\n\"A. Undoubtedly.\n\n\"S. This, then, was what I asked you just now. Does not he who uses a thing seem to you always different from the thing used?\n\n\"A. Very different.\n\n\"S. But the currier, does he cut with the instrument alone, or also with his hands?\n\n\"A. Also with his hands.\n\n\"S. He, then, uses his hands?\n\n\"A. Yes.\n\n\"S. We are agreed, then, that he that uses a thing and the thing used are different?\n\n\"A. We are.\"\n\"S. And in this work he uses also his eyes?\n\"A. Yes.\n\"S. The currier and the lyrist are, therefore, different from the hands and eyes with which they work?\n\"A. So it seems.\n\"S. Now, then, does not a man use his whole body?\n\"A. Unquestionably.\n\"S. But we are agreed that he that uses and that which is used are different?\n\"A. Yes.\n\"S. A man is, therefore, different from his body?\n\"A. So I think.\n\"S. What then is the man?\n\"A. I can not say.\n\"S. You can say at least that the man is that which uses the body?\n\"A. True.\n\"S. Now, then, does anything use the body but the mind?\n\"A. Nothing.\n\"S. The mind is therefore the man?\u2014A. The mind alone.\"\n\n3. Use of the Socratic Method.\u2014Though older than Socrates, this method is modern; it is, in a high sense, the method of Pestalozzi and the new education. Its special use is in giving original instruction. In primary work the Socratic is the dominant method. In all grades of school work it holds a prominent place. The teacher is an instructor, and teaching is presenting a subject or object of thought to the mind in such a manner as to lead it to think, to reason, or to gain knowledge.\n\n4. Advantages.\u2014Pupils discover truth for themselves, solve their own problems, master their own difficulties, and become courageous and strong. Impressions made are lasting; the knowledge thus acquired can be used. Mere school-keepers, rote-teachers, quacks, shams, and fossils will never adopt this plan of teaching; but, as teachers become familiar with the science of education, and skilled in the art of teaching, they will necessarily use the Socratic method in giving original instruction. Questioning is better than telling.\n\nII. THE TOPIC AND QUESTION METHOD.\n\n1. Definition.\u2014The subject is examined by topics, and acquisition tested by questions. Pupils are trained to tell connectedly their own thoughts in their own language. Pointed questions are interjected at every step to hold the attention of the class, to direct effort, and to test thoroughness.\n2. Use.\u2014This method is made the basis in class-work. Other methods supplement this. The teacher, whenever necessary, asks sharp questions. Each member of the class is held responsible for all the work. Thus the close attention of each one is secured, and shallowness and pretense are exposed.\n\n3. Danger.\u2014Class work may degenerate into mere reciting, and teaching may be excluded. Exclusive topic work is fatal to vigour and thoroughness. The topic method needs to be used sparingly in primary teaching. Lazy teachers find the topic method an admirable means of shirking work. They hear the recitations.\n\n4. Advantages.\u2014Subjects are examined systematically, and pupils learn the art of consecutive discourse. When judiciously used and constantly supplemented by other methods, the topic method may rightly be made the basis of class work.\n\nIII. THE DISCUSSION METHOD.\n\n1. Definition.\u2014In short and pointed speeches the pupils define and maintain their positions. Objections are urged and answered. Pupils learn to yield gracefully when convinced. The teacher directs the discussion, and closes it at the right moment.\n\n2. Use.\u2014Discussion elicits intense interest, calls forth the best efforts of pupils, and leads to accuracy and clearness. In some form, and to some extent, this method may be used in all schools.\n\n3. Dangers.\u2014Time may be squandered in desultory talk; the disposition to dispute rather than investigate may be fostered; and feelings may be wounded by sharp retorts and personal allusions. The wise teacher will guard against these evils, and will use the discussion method sparingly and wisely.\n\n4. Advantages.\u2014The discussion method tends to develop vigorous thought and independent expression. As iron sharpens iron, so discussion sharpens mind. Educationally, the discussion method stands very high. In these mental conflicts the utmost power of the pupil is put forth. He acquires cogency of thought and vigour of expression. He learns to respect the positions of others, and at the same time manfully to maintain his own. There is no better way to cultivate independence, self-assertion, liberality, and the habit of treating an opponent courteously and fairly. The discussion method supplements the Socratic and the topic methods.\nIt tends to break up monotony, to dissipate insipidness and stupidity, and to bring into contempt all sophistry and shallow pretense.\n\nFrom the primary school to the university, this method may be used with incalculable advantage. Let the discussion method predominate in our schools and colleges, and teachers will cease to be called narrow, bigoted, tyrannical. Wide culture and a clear head will be found necessary in order to decide points, direct discussions, give information, and sustain the interest. Mere school-keepers do not dare to permit discussions; many a college professor would lose his position within a month. But competent educators who use this method will grow with the work, and, like their pupils, become courteous ladies and gentlemen, as well as independent and powerful thinkers. Give us less cramming, less artificial training, and more rugged development. The great want of our schools is growth. The world needs oaks, not willows. The discussion method is preeminently the method to make men.\n\nIV. THE CONVERSATION METHOD.\n\n1. Definition.\u2014The teacher presents his views, and leads the members of the class to do the same. The style is conversational. Each one is free to ask and answer questions. The teacher should be well prepared, and should work for results. This was the method of the Great Teacher. The perfect model lessons may be studied as reported by Matthew and Luke.\n\n2. Use.\u2014This method supplements the Socratic in giving original instruction, and is especially suited for the oral work in all schools. Professional instruction, for the most part, is given by this method in training schools and Teachers' Institutes. Many instructors in theological, medical, law, and technical schools use it to great advantage.\n\n3. Dangers.\u2014Teachers may become loquacious; pupils may ask silly questions; or side issues may absorb the time. The teacher needs to be full of the theme, and his few remarks should be full of information and pith. The pupils need to be so impressed that no one will dare to trifle.\n\n4. Advantages.\u2014The teacher seems to merely lead in the investigation, and his remarks seem to be spontaneous. The pupils feel that they are doing the work, and each one realizes the pleasure of original discovery. This is true teaching, and the result is real education.\n5. Illustration.\u2014The following conversation between an institute instructor and the teacher-pupils admirably serves our purpose:\n\nQuestion. Why should we teach?\nAnswer. That others may gain knowledge.\nQ. Why should others gain knowledge?\nA. That they may have a wider means of enjoyment and usefulness.\nQ. In order to enjoy their knowledge, what must children do with it?\nA. They must use it.\nQ. In order to use their knowledge, what must they do?\nA. They must think.\nQ. Why have the children as well as the teacher to think?\nA. In order that their knowledge may do them greater good.\nQ. Why not let the teacher do all the thinking?\nA. It would not improve the children.\nQ. What must be used in thinking?\nA. The mind.\nQ. What does every child's mind possess?\nA. Certain faculties.\nQ. What are faculties of the mind?\nA. Powers which the mind possesses to do certain things.\nQ. In order that children may use these faculties\u2014may think\u2014what must be done with the faculties?\nA. They must be cultivated. The children must be led to use them.\n\nQ. How may this be done?\nA. By teaching object lessons; thus taking the children to Nature\u2014the source of knowledge\u2014and allowing them to compare, reason, and generalize for themselves. Then let them express in their language the results of their investigations, being careful to have their expressions accurate. This kind of work makes the children independent.\n\nV. THE LECTURE METHOD.\n\n1. Definition.\u2014The teacher clearly, tersely, and systematically presents the subject; the learner listens intently, firmly fixes in his memory the leading points, and at his leisure ponders and digests the lecture.\n\nThe lecture method is utterly out of place in elementary schools. Wherever tried, it proves an ignominious failure, a sure training process for inattention, listlessness, and mischief. We would advise Public School Teachers to eschew it; or, if they will use it, let it be only in the most advanced classes, and there, sparingly.\nTOPICAL REVIEW.\u2014GENERAL CLASS METHODS.\n\nIntroduction.\n\n1.

Besides these, the skilful teacher calls to his aid various expedients which we may call auxiliary methods. Of approved auxiliary methods, we call attention to the following:\n\nI. THE WRITING METHOD.\u2014Whatever plan may be pursued, much written work should be required. The board, the slate, and the paper are important educational aids, and should be fully utilised. The inspired and over-sensitive teacher, who shrinks from a little crayon dust and the life and hum of vigorous class work, should be speedily promoted. The class-room is no place for the nervous, the fussy, or the invalid. To awaken interest and direct the energies of youth, requires enthusiasm, power, energy, work.\n\nThe means for written work should always be at command. From the primary school to the college, much class work should be written work. The teacher who ignores the writing method needs to learn the ways of education more perfectly.\n\nII. THE OUTLINE METHOD.\u2014After a subject has been mastered in detail, it is reviewed in outline. The outline aids memory and enables the learner to grasp the subject as a whole. It leads to the mastery of essentials and the omission of burdensome details. President Brown asks and answers the vital question:\n\n\"Do we not Teach too Much? I do not mean that our courses of study are too extensive; but do we not teach too much of any one subject? We give the mass without the thought, the essence. We solve problem after problem, we commit definition after definition, we parse word after word, we translate sentence after sentence, and do not realize that there is any relation the one with the other. It seems to me, that if we would learn principles systematically rather than so much, we would have more knowledge at our command.\"\n\n[203]\nIf we could see the thought as developed in any subject, just as we should and must see the thought in reading\u2014and not only see the thought in one subject, but be able to follow it through every branch\u2014then our knowledge would be systematic.\"\n\nThe outline method, when wisely used, tends to secure the results referred to above.\n\nCaution.\u2014Avoid mere outline work. Your pupils will starve if fed on skeletons. To begin with diagrams, to teach from diagrams, and to depend upon diagrams, are fundamental educational errors.\n\nThe Place of Outlines.\u2014Subjects are first presented synthetically, then analytically. We begin with the concrete and work up to classes, definitions, rules, principles. We begin with particulars and work up to diagrams. Modern text-books rightly place the outline at the close of the subject.\n\nIII. THE REPORTING METHOD.\u2014One or two members of the class are appointed to report on specific topics connected with the lesson, or previous lessons. The teacher will see that these reports are brief, well prepared, and well presented. The reports occupy a small part of the recitation. They should neither be too long nor too frequent, nor must they supplant the regular work. They furnish extra work for bright pupils, and tend to relieve inequalities in classification. These reports serve well for review, but the chief advantage is in training pupils to work up subjects and present the results of research.\n\nIV. THE RECIPROCAL METHOD.\u2014The class is divided into groups of two or more each, and these in turn act as pupil and teacher. For large classes, this is a valuable artifice, as it greatly multiplies individual work. In normal work it is found to be admirable for practice teaching. The wide awake teacher may use the reciprocal method sparingly, but must never rely upon it. Nothing can take the place of individual teaching.\n\nV. THE CONCERT METHOD.\u2014The members of a section or of the entire class answer together. To overcome timidity, to quicken the interest, or to fix a fact, this method may be used sparingly. With young pupils, about one fourth of the recitation may be conducted in this way. But, as the pupils advance, it will be used less and less. In some subjects concert work affords a\nvaluable drill. It may be advantageously used to a limited extent in all classes, but especially in oral work.\n\nDanger.\u2014The exclusive concert method is a sure cure for study. Concert teaching is showy but shallow, and is favored by \"fuss and feather\" teachers. The honest teacher will use the concert method sparingly in imparting instruction, never in ascertaining the pupils' knowledge of the subject.\n\nOther approved class methods are omitted, as there is danger of perplexing the young teacher. The orator, while speaking, never thinks of the principles of elocution, or the intonation of his voice. The artist seems inspired, but hard work is the source of the inspiration. While teaching, the educational artist seldom thinks of principles or methods. Having mastered both, he intuitively pursues the method best suited to his purpose at the time. He is the master of all methods, but the slave of none.\n\nTopical Review.\u2014Auxiliary Class Methods.\n\nAuxiliary methods.\n\nEmployed occasionally to supplement general methods.\n\nThe writing method.\n\n1.

Of no use in examination of pupils.\nCHAPTER V.\n\nQUESTIONABLE, ERRONEOUS, AND ANTIQUATED CLASS METHODS.\n\nI. QUESTIONABLE CLASS METHODS.\u2014Some methods not wholly bad are modestly classed as questionable. We strongly advise against such methods. Use only sound methods.\n\n1. Turning down is wrong in principle and unsatisfactory in practice. This method lingers in remote districts, but is rarely used in good schools; in fact, it deserves to be classed with antiquated methods. True emulation must be secured by other and better means.\n\n2. Daily Marking is a relic of the old education, and is an incubus and a mistake. Unphilosophical, it tends to mislead teacher and pupil. It wastes precious time and gives no equivalent. As a rule, pupils should not be marked oftener than once in two weeks. To this rule there are exceptions. No marking is the other extreme.\n\n3. The Exclusive Question and Answer Method is more than questionable; it is pernicious. The teacher ceases to be an instructor, and becomes a mere interrogation point. The children are kept in leading-strings and literally starved. Text-books constructed on this method should be consigned to the moles and bats. Any teacher suspected of this method should be court-martialed, and, if found guilty, should be at once dismissed from the service. In a past age school-keepers were permitted to ask questions from the book, and pupils were required to answer in the language of the book. The modern teacher closes the book and constructs his own questions, instructing as well as questioning. In the modern school, the learner studies the subject and constructs his own answers.\n\n4. Any Exclusive Method is Bad.\u2014A violin with a single string, a piano with but one key, and a teacher with but one method, are an unmusical trio. Like the musician, the teacher should\ncommand the entire key-board of his art. The slave of a method should be emancipated before he is permitted to enter the school-room.\n\nII. ERRONEOUS CLASS METHODS.\u2014Their name is legion. To this category belong all methods that violate well-established educational principles.\n\n1. The Parrot Method.\u2014The pupil commits the lesson, and recites it verbatim. Pursuing this method, the Chinese have made no progress in twenty centuries. This, the worst of all methods, is a favourite with mere school-keepers.\n\n2. The Cramming Method.\u2014Thorough digestion is as essential to mental as to physical growth. Cramming is fatal to digestion. Child-mind assimilates knowledge slowly. Mental food requires to be adapted to the capacity of the learner, both as to quantity and quality. Perfect digestion promotes growth, and gives us strong men and women; cramming produces mental dyspepsia, and gives us learned weaklings.\n\n3. The Drifting Method.\u2014System conditions efficiency. The teacher who meets his class without a plan must fail. Well may men and angels weep to see the vast herds of drifting teachers. Without chart or compass, they are blown hither and thither by every breeze of fancy or wind of caprice. Unfortunate pupils! The true teacher matures well his plans, and works to them.\n\nIII. ANTIQUATED CLASS METHODS.\u2014Pod augers, wooden mould-board ploughs, old washing machines, and antiquated class methods will doubtless receive due attention in the \"curiosity shop\" of the coming Dickens. We can only give samples.\n\n1. The One-at-a-Time Method.\u2014The old schoolmaster tried to hear his pupils one at a time, thus squandering nine-tenths of his time. Classification has increased the teacher's power twenty fold.\n\n2. The Consecutive Method.\u2014The old schoolmaster, at a later period, called on his pupils in regular order. He was sometimes called \"Old Next,\" because, when a word was misspelled, or a question missed, he would shout, \"Next! next! next!\" This method was found to be a sure cure for attention.\n3. The Machine Method.\u2014The old schoolmaster asked the questions in the book, and assigned the next lesson. Sometimes he made the class take the lesson over. A machine that could ask questions would serve about the same purpose.\n\n4. The Ciphering Method.\u2014The pupils \"ciphered,\" and the old schoolmaster worked the \"sums\" for them. The big boys would cipher all day, and would take the hard \"sums\" to the master, who would often work hours on a single \"sum.\"\n\nCONDITIONS OF PROGRESS.\u2014Most of the erroneous and antiquated methods referred to in this chapter were in common use within the memory of persons still living. Their disappearance and the substitution of better methods are striking evidences of educational progress. That we may continue to make steady and rapid progress, we must act in accordance with well-defined principles.\n\n1. The Achievements of one Educator or one People must be made common property.\n\n2. Bad Methods, like Poisons, should be Labeled.\u2014Teacher-life is short and child-life is precious. Unnecessary experimenting is criminal. When theory and experience determine a method to be bad, let it be laid aside forever. Methods approved by the thought and experience of the race are safe.\n\n3. The Teacher must keep himself en Rapport with the Educators and Educational Movements of the World.\u2014Educational associations, Teachers' Institutes, school visitation, educational journals, and educational books furnish ample means. The art of teaching is based on the science of education. In view of the infinite interests involved, how profoundly we ought to study the immortal being committed to our guidance! We ought to master the laws of human development, and become familiar with the means of human culture. We should make our own the achievements of the educational world. Then will we be able with certainty to apply educational means to educational ends, in accordance with educational principles. Then will our methods be necessarily good, because founded in law. Then will we be able to produce results of which the mass of our teachers, even now, scarcely dream.\nTOPICAL REVIEW.\u2014QUESTIONABLE, ERRONEOUS, AND ANTIQUATED CLASS METHODS.\n\nQuestionable class methods; should be avoided.\n\n1. Turning down creates confusion, and is wrong in principle.\n2. Daily marking wastes time, and misleads both teacher and pupils.\n3. The exclusive question and answer method is pernicious.\n   (a.) It makes the teacher an interrogation point.\n   (b.) Book questions and book answers dwarf the intellect.\n   (c.) The questions should be framed by the teacher; the answers, by the pupils.\n4. All exclusive methods are bad.\n\nErroneous class methods violate principles.\n\n1. The parrot method is the worst of all.\n2. The cramming method destroys mental digestion; and removes the appetite for intellectual food.\n3. The drifting method blows teacher and pupils about aimlessly.\n\nAntiquated class methods.\n\n1. The one-at-a-time method ignored classification.\n2. The consecutive \"Next! next!\" method killed attention.\n3. The machine method merely questioned and assigned work.\n4. The ciphering method made a calculating machine of the master.\n\nConditions of progress.\n\n1. Educational principles must supplant machine teaching.\n2. Individual achievements must become common property.\n3. Bad methods, like poisons, should be labeled.\n4. The teacher must be abreast of the educational movements of the time.\n5. He must profit by educational societies, journals, institutes, and other means of improvement.\n6. He must study the laws of human development and culture.\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nART OF QUESTIONING.*\n\nI. PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE ART OF QUESTIONING.\n\n1. Questions must be adapted to the Capacity of the Pupil.\n   (1.) What is it?\u2014For children.\n   (2.) How is it?\u2014For boys and girls.\n   (3.) Why is it?\u2014For youth.\n   (4.) Whence is it?\u2014For manhood.\n\nThe matter, manner, and form of questioning should be adapted to the age and development of the learner, and to the nature of the subject. Three stages of development should be recognized: early childhood, youth, and beginning maturity. Teaching questions, especially, should conform to the obvious laws of mental suggestion and association.\n\n2. Questioning is Better than Telling.\n   (1.) The learner is led to discover for himself.\n   (2.) The learner is trained to do independent work.\n   (3.) The learner is incited to greater mental activity.\n\n3. Questioning is a great Mental Force.\n   (1.) It directs effort.\n   (2.) It awakens thought and stimulates activity.\n   (3.) It leads to close observation.\n   (4.) It trains the pupil to analyze and synthetize.\n\n4. Questions should Follow each other in a Logical Order.\n   (1.) The questioner must have a well-defined object in view.\n   (2.) The question must logically lead to its evolution.\n\n*This subject belongs properly to the \"Art of Teaching.\" The outline is given here to show the bearing of the art of questioning on school management. The productions of several authors have been freely used in this outline, but chiefly those of James H. Hoose.\n5. Questioning carried too far is Injurious.\n   (1.) It confuses and bewilders.\n   (2.) It fosters a dependence on the questions.\n\nII. GENERAL STATEMENTS PERTAINING TO THE ART OF QUESTIONING.\n\n1. Questioning implies two Parties:\n   (1.) The teacher, who understands, and is prepared to assist the learner;\n   (2.) The learner, who does not understand, and who needs assistance.\n\n2. The Efficient Instructor is Master of the Art of Questioning.\n   (1.) He constructs his own questions.\n   (2.) He adapts his questions to the learner and to the subject.\n\n3. As to Subject Matter the Question is:\n   (1.) What is this or that? or,\n   (2.) How is this or that? or,\n   (3.) Why is this or that thus or so? or,\n   (4.) Whence is this or that?\n\n4. The Teacher must Remember that the Pupil gains Knowledge\u2014\n   (1.) Of the objective world by sense perception;\n   (2.) Of the subjective world by conscious perception;\n   (3.) Of the relation world by thought and imagination;\n   (4.) And that all knowledge is reproduced by a well-trained memory.\n\n5. When the Learner is unable to Advance he may with Propriety ask for Aid.\n\nThe prerequisites on the part of the teacher for profitable questioning are a thorough knowledge of a subject and its relations; a clear conception of the important points of a subject, and of its difficulties; some knowledge of the general laws of mental action, and of the special laws of suggestion and association; and a knowledge of the condition and peculiarities of the learners.\nIII. OBJECTS OF QUESTIONING.\n\n1. To properly direct the efforts of the learner.\n2. To incite the pupil to think for himself.\n3. To lead the pupil to discover truth for himself.\n4. To arouse the dull and startle the inattentive.\n5. To bring out the important details of the subject.\n6. To test correctness and to correct errors.\n\nIV. QUESTIONING IN CLASS MANAGEMENT.\n\n1. In general the question should be propounded to the entire class.\n2. Give a moment for each one to think and raise hand.\n3. Call on any one in the class for a part or all of the answer.\n4. Each member of the class must be held responsible for each answer.\n5. The instructor should listen attentively and patiently to each answer.\n\nV. QUESTIONS FOR WRITTEN EXAMINATIONS.\n\n1. Give questions involving principles and the application of principles.\n2. Give questions requiring definite answers.\n3. Give questions involving the pupil's general knowledge of the subject.\n4. Avoid technical questions and puzzles.\n5. Be liberal and just in marking the answers.\n\nVI. OBJECTIONABLE QUESTIONS.\n\n1. Leading questions. \"The world is round, is it not?\"\n2. Questions that indicate the answer. \"Did Columbus discover America?\"\n3. Questions of the alternate form. \"Is the world round or square?\"\n4. Questions that quote part of the answer. \"Arithmetic is the science of what?\"\n5. Questions that suggest the answer: (1.) By language; (2.) By emphasis; (3.) By inflection; or (4.) By the expression.\nVII. QUESTIONS TO BE AVOIDED.\n\n1. Avoid questions that include too much.\n2. Avoid pointless or silly questions.\n3. Avoid \"kill-time\" questions.\n4. Avoid pert questions, designed to display your sharpness.\n5. Avoid pedantic questions, designed to display your learning.\n6. Avoid all haphazard questions.\n\nAll questions should be clear and definite, both in thought and language. Teaching questions may be suggestive; testing questions should neither involve nor suggest the answer. Teaching questions should be put slowly; examination questions may, on many subjects, be put rapidly. Teaching questions may, in many cases, be answered by a class collectively; testing questions should usually be answered by individuals.\n\nVIII. ANSWERS.\u2014The answer should be\u2014(1.) To the point; (2.) Clear; (3.) Direct; (4.) Concise; (5.) Definite; (6.) Complete; and (7.) Original.\n\nTopical Review.\u2014Art of Questioning.\n\nPrinciples underlying the art of questioning.\n\n1. Questions must suit the capacity of pupils.\n2. Questioning is better than telling.\n3. Questioning is a great moral force.\n4. Questions should follow each other in logical order.\n5. Questioning should not be carried too far.\n\nGeneral statements relating to questioning.\n\n1. It implies two parties.\n2. The teacher should be master of the art.\n3. Questions as to subject-matter.\n4. Teachers should know how pupils gain knowledge.\n5. The pupil may ask for aid when unable to advance alone.\n\nObjects and kinds of questions.\n\n1. Questions in class management.\n2. For written examinations.\n3. Objectionable questions.\n4. Questions to be avoided.\n5. How questions should be answered.\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nGolden Hints to Teachers.\n\nI. THE SEVEN LAWS OF TEACHING. (President Gregory.)\n\n1. Know thoroughly and familiarly whatever you would teach.\n\n2. Gain and keep the attention of your pupils, and excite their interest in the subject.\n\n3. Use language which your pupils fully understand, and clearly explain every new word required.\n\n4. Begin with what is already known, and proceed to the unknown by easy and natural steps.\n\n5. Excite the self-activity of the pupils, and lead them to discover the truth for themselves.\n\n6. Require pupils to restate, fully and correctly, in their own language, and with their own proofs and illustrations, the truth taught them.\n\n7. Review, review, review, carefully, thoroughly, repeatedly, with fresh consideration and thought.\n\nThese laws underlie and control all successful teaching. Nothing need be added to them; nothing can be safely taken away. No one who will thoroughly master and use them need fail as a teacher, provided he will also maintain the good order which is required to give free and undisturbed action to these laws.\n\nII. PREPARATION OF LESSONS. (President Gregory.)\n\n1. Prepare each lesson by fresh study. Last year's knowledge has necessarily faded somewhat. Only fresh conceptions warm and inspire us.\n\n2. Find in the lesson its analogies and likenesses. In these lie the illustrations by which it can be made to reveal itself to others.\n\n3. Find the natural order and connection of the different facts and truths of the lesson. A jumbled mass of materials does not make a building, nor does a jumble of disjointed facts make up a science.\n4. Seek for the relations of the lesson to other lessons already learned, and to the life and duty of the learners. The vital force of truth lies in its relations. It is the passage of the electric fire along the distant connected wires which makes the telegraphic apparatus important.\n\n5. Use freely all aids to gain the truth, but never pause till the truth gained has been thoroughly digested in your own mind, and its full meaning and importance have arisen upon you as a vision seen by your own eyes.\n\n6. Study the lesson till its truths and facts take shape in easy and familiar language. The final proof and product of clear thought is clear speech.\n\nIII. PRACTICAL RULES TO BE TAUGHT TO PUPILS.\n\n1. Stand or sit erect. Stand while reciting.\n2. At signals, move promptly, quickly, and quietly.\n3. Give your entire attention during the whole recitation.\n4. Be courteous to your teacher and fellow pupils.\n5. Answer in your own words.\n6. Answer in complete sentences.\n7. Raise your hand when you (a) can answer the question; (b) disagree with an answer; (c) wish to criticise; (d) wish to ask a question.\n8. Never speak without permission.\n9. Speak in a medium tone. Speak distinctly and energetically.\n10. Never prompt. Be honest and independent.\n\nIV. CONDITIONS OF SUCCESS. (Prof. B. S. Potter.)\n\n1. Earnestness from a deep interest in the work.\n2. Knowledge from actual experience.\n3. Aptitude to teach, enforced by a mastery of the art of teaching.\n4. System both in teaching and managing.\n5. Ability to detect and correct one's own failures.\n6. Hard work from a thirst for knowledge and a love of teaching.\n\nV. SECRETS OF SUCCESS.\u2014(Prof. W. P. Nason.)\n\n1. The teacher must be able to seize and impress the principal points in the lesson.\n2. The teacher must hold the interested attention of the class till all have mastered the point under consideration.\n\n3. Difficult and important points must be frequently reviewed.\n\n4. Each member of the class must be kept interested and busy.\n\n5. General class drill should constitute a part of the recitation.\n\n6. Work, and manage to make your pupils work, with enthusiasm and energy.\n\n7. Talk to the point, talk well, but avoid too much talking.\n\nVI. A MODEL SCHOOL. (\"Visitor.\")\n\n1. Principles.\u2014(1.) Each study was divided into subjects in their natural order; each subject into its logical division; each division into the steps of its development; each step into lesson-steps; each lesson-step into lessons, each containing but one new idea, and so simple that the teacher could give all the necessary illustrations and instruction.\n\n(2.) In the primary and intermediate classes no facts or principles were given to commit to memory as a task; memory simply recorded the use, in a variety of exercises which directly or indirectly referred to the senses.\n\n(3.) Every lesson was thoroughly understood and applied before the next was presented to the attention.\n\n(4.) No time was wasted in trying to illustrate or explain what the pupils, on account of age or lack of experience, were unable to understand.\n\n(5.) In advanced classes the principles of generalization were deduced from primary and intermediate practice.\n\n2. Practice.\u2014(1.) Close classification, in which pupils of the same degree of advancement only were placed in the same class.\n\n(2.) The lessons were given in a brief, pointed, and methodical manner, with no extra words to obscure the sense. In every case, when possible, the pupils repeated the illustration of the teacher with the objects in their own hands.\n\n(3.) The text-book was used, in class to furnish exercises for a review rather than as a manual of instruction.\n\n(4.) No lesson was recited that the preparation did not in some way exercise the judgment in discriminating and comparing, cultivate neatness and taste in penmanship, and correctness of orthography or\npunctuation, or require skill in the logical order of arrangement on the slate or blackboard.\n\n(5.) In recitation the teacher had nothing to say by way of assistance. Pupils were required to ask questions as often as to answer them.\n\n(6.) Short and prompt recitations, the time being from ten to thirty minutes.\n\n(7.) Nearly double the usual time was given to the primary and intermediate grades; consequently not so much time was required in the advanced grades to make the same progress.\n\n3. Results.\u2014As a result of the above system, habits of personal industry in the school-room were secured in a remarkable degree. No special system of discipline was required; the pupils apparently had no time for mischief. Every recitation was an eminent success or a positive failure; no blundering, no helping, no make-believe. Self-confidence was based upon actual ability and not upon self-concession.\n\nVII. Effects of Method. (J. W. Richardson.)\n\nThere is a prevailing opinion existing in the minds of a certain class of educators, that methods are of little importance. Many go further than this, and believe that to make our acts conform to a method is to give them a mechanical character, which deprives them of all appearance of being the products either of genius or of a free intelligence.\n\nSuch opinions are especially mischievous in our educational affairs, as they encourage educators to think little of the philosophy of education, or of those general principles on which alone can be founded either a true science or art of teaching. Every intelligent act implies a knowledge of its beginning. All ends produced by human agency are produced by the use of some means. Success in attaining ends depends on two things\u2014on the use of the right means, and on using them in the right way. The way of using means, or of performing our acts, is called method.\n\nThose who have no definite methods to use have no definite ends to obtain. But all teaching worthy of the name has its known ends to accomplish.\n\nTeaching occasions knowledge, development, and method. Whenever the mind exerts its power in a right manner upon appropriate\nobjects of thought, it becomes conscious of two results. One result is the possession of new knowledge; the other is an increased facility in the exercise of the powers by whose activity knowledge is acquired. The facility is mental training. The faculties are trained by their right use in doing what they would acquire the power of doing. . . . . . The third result produced by a method of teaching is found in the method of thinking or study it communicates. Not much knowledge or mental discipline can be obtained by the longest courses of study now taught in our schools; but a good method of teaching will always present a good plan of study, and occasion that discipline of mind which will enable it to use the plan in the further pursuit of knowledge after the pupil has left his school.\n\n\"Teachers have their individuality, which shows itself in greater or less degrees in their school-room practice, while applying philosophical methods of teaching. This individuality is exhibited in the way that one teacher illustrates a point differently from another; in the way he speaks; in the way he looks; in the way he thinks, it may be; in the way in which his questions are conceived; in the impromptu expedients which he devises; in what in general is called 'his way of doing things.' This individuality of the teacher is known as manner. Misapprehension of the true province of scientific methods of teaching has led many to apply the term to any peculiar experiment or expedient which may be selected, which things are, in fact, but examples of manner.\"\u2014James H. Hoose, \"Methods of Teaching.\"\n\nTopical Review.\u2014Golden Hints to Teachers.\n\n1. The Seven Laws of Teaching.\u2014Gregory.\n2. Preparation of Lessons.\u2014Gregory.\n3.

Effects of Method.\u2014Richardson.\nPART VI.\n\nEXAMINATIONS AND RECORDS.\n\nCHAPTER I.\u2014School Examinations.\n\nII.\u2014Marking Grades.\n\nIII.\u2014School Records and Reports.\nPART VI.\n\nEXAMINATIONS AND RECORDS.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nSCHOOL EXAMINATIONS.\n\nExaminations, records, promotions, reports, and graduation are important factors in school management. Enthusiasts chafe, and visionaries theorize, but the philosophic educator finds these expedients as valuable as they are necessary. Machinery implies friction, and without machinery achievement is impossible. The time has come, however, for a calm and critical re-examination of the entire subject. Many abuses and some hideous practices must be corrected; the drudgery must be reduced to the minimum; teachers must be trained to subordinate machinery to culture; but all attempts of well-meaning sentimentals to pooh-pooh necessary agencies out of school work will prove harmless.\n\nA school examination is a good servant, but a bad master. When rightly managed, good results are obtained; when unwisely managed, it becomes a cruel instrument of torture. Unwise management, abuses, and extremes have created prejudice and opposition. When the abuses have been corrected, the objections will disappear, and examinations will be welcomed by both pupils and teachers.\n\nI. OBJECTS OF EXAMINATION.\u2014Why do we examine? Simply to supplement good teaching. Some special objects deserve mention.\n1. To Stimulate Pupils to Master Subjects.\u2014Smatterers dread examinations, but thorough scholars welcome them. When the subject is once mastered, the pupil is always prepared for examination. The certainty that the work will be examined, and examined thoroughly, is a powerful but legitimate stimulus to effort.\n\n2. To Incite Pupils to keep Knowledge Ready for Use.\u2014Examinations test mental power and the mastery of principles. Pupils are stimulated to frequently review subjects; thus their knowledge is deepened and widened.\n\n3. To Secure Valuable Data for Promotions, Records, and Reports.\u2014To base the pupil's standing wholly on examinations is a great educational blunder, but to disregard examinations is a greater one.\n\nEducation should be a training to promote insight, power of thought, and facility in acquiring knowledge. Perception, not memory, should be cultivated; and as the student can advance only by his own endeavours, he should be led through such a course of labour and original thought that he may come out an independent thinker, as well as a thorough scholar, in such branches of education as he has inclination for. To obtain such a training, examinations should be means, not ends.\n\nII. WHAT SHOULD THE EXAMINATION BE?\u2014Not killing to both body and mind; not an instrument of torture; not a grinding slavery to teachers and pupils; not a stimulus to cramming; not a discouragement to study.\n\n1. As to Matter.\u2014The examination should be confined to what the pupil ought to know, or ought to be able to do. No puzzles, nor questions designed to exhibit the examiner's knowledge, are admissible.\n\n2. As to Method.\u2014The examination should be a test of the ability and acquirements of the pupil, not of his power to memorize. Does the pupil really understand the subject? Has he the ability to express well what he knows? With the view of ascertaining these facts, the examination should be conducted.\n\n3. As to Questions and Topics.\u2014The examination must be made searching and thorough. The questions should be pointed\nand clear, requiring brief and definite answers. Principles, plain problems involving principles, essential definitions, leading features, and work to be done are the points to be pressed.\n\nCaution.\u2014Avoid unimportant details, dates, and technicalities; avoid puzzles, catches, and everything ambiguous. Let every question be clear, concise, and to the point. Avoid all questions that merely test verbal memory, or show the smartness of the examiner.\n\n4. As to Preparation.\u2014Examination should be so arranged as to foster genuine study and discourage all cramming. Pupils soon learn that nothing counts in real examinations but a thorough understanding of the subject, and that special cramming for examination will always manifest itself to their injury. No lesson should be studied or recited with reference to examination. Pupils should become so absorbed in their work that when examinations do come, each is delighted to tell what he knows.\n\nMistakes.\u2014All cramming and hurried preparations for examinations are ulcers indicating disease; the teaching is wrong; the examination is wrong; the system is wrong. The reconstruction of such schools must be radical and complete. Instead of educating, they stuff; instead of developing, they dwarf.\n\nIII. WHEN SHALL WE EXAMINE?\u2014Not at stated times, or so frequently as to oppress pupils and teachers. Whenever the teacher is satisfied that it will do good, he should examine the class. Pupils properly taught are always prepared, and hence need not know when an examination will occur. Regular examinations at the close of the month or quarter would be better abandoned; the evil more than counterbalances the good. At some time, during each period of from four to six weeks, each class should be carefully examined. As no time is fixed, there is no hasty preparation or feverish anticipation. Too frequent examinations burden the teacher and disturb the regular order of work.\n\nAdvanced Classes may be Examined at Stated Periods. The necessity for facing an anticipated ordeal is an excellent preparation for the actual business of life; pupils trained to meet such tests without flinching will not be disheartened in after years by nervous dread of failure under the pressure of an appearance in public.\nIV. ORAL AND WRITTEN.\u2014How shall we examine? Shall we make it oral or written? I answer, let the oral and written be combined. In good teaching, each lesson is a review and an examination. Oral and written work occupy about equal time. An examination differs from a recitation in omitting instruction, and simply testing the pupil. With large classes, the written work is the principal test; but, with ordinary classes, the oral, equally with the written examination, is used. This combination is better every way; it relieves the tension, and affords each pupil a guarantee of fairness. The difficulty of supplementing written examinations by oral is confessedly very great. In many of our examinations it would be impossible to adopt the oral method without manifest injustice. It would seem, in fact, that in all general competitive examinations, the written method is the best, if not the only, means of securing the application of a uniform test; and unless such examinations are uniform, they are worse than useless.\n\nV. LENGTH OF EXAMINATIONS.\u2014Written examinations should be brief. Five questions may be made as good a test as fifty. Lengthy examinations wear out the pupils, and grading the papers wears out the teachers. The effort is necessarily severe, and the time should be correspondingly short. The average length of examination may well be reduced one-half, and this will remove a leading objection to examinations.\n\nVI. EXAMINATIONS FOR PROMOTION AND GRADUATION.\u2014The examinations should undoubtedly constitute one of the conditions of promotion or graduation. Is it the most prominent condition? I think not. The recitation standing of the pupil is the estimate of all his class work during the month or term. Let this be multiplied by four, the average of his examination grades added, and the sum divided by five. The result is his class-standing, and can hardly be otherwise than a fair estimate of the pupil's standing; but, in case of doubt, let the pupil be further tested in a private oral examination. Such a course is so eminently reasonable and just as to disarm all opposition. The deliberately formed opinion of the teacher as to the pupils' fitness for promotion should unquestionably have great weight in determining the classification of the school.\nTopical Review.\u2014School Examinations.\n\nExaminations must remain as means of Education.\n\n1. The subject demands to be reconsidered.\n2. Abuses prove nothing against wise use.\n3. Examination, a good servant but a bad master.\n\nObjects of examination\u2014generally, to supplement good teaching.\n\n1. To stimulate pupils to master subjects.\n2. To incite pupils to keep knowledge ready for use.\n3. To secure data for promotions, records, and reports.\n4. Examination encourages thoroughness in special subjects.\n\nWhat should examinations be? What should they not be?\n\n1. Should be confined to what the pupils ought to know\u2014not to contain conundrums nor examiners' display questions.\n2. Should test ability and acquirements, not mere memory.\n3. Should be clear and searching, involving principles and their applications.\n4. Should encourage genuine study, and render cramming as unsuccessful as it is hurtful.\n5. Stuffing is not feeding; cramming is not educating.\n\nFrequency of examinations.\n\n1. Should not be held at stated periods.\n2. Should not be held oftener than once in four weeks.\n3. Advanced pupils are disciplined to self-reliance by stated examinations.\n\nOral and Written examinations.\n\n1. Both methods should be employed where practicable.\n2. Oral tests correct errors of written ones with young pupils.\n3. Uniform oral tests cannot be employed in general competitive examinations.\n\nWritten examinations should be brief.\n\nSuch a severe strain should not be prolonged.\n\nExaminations for Promotion.\n\n1. Examination should be a test, but not the only one for promotion.\n2. The teacher's observation and record must have full weight.\nCHAPTER II.\n\nMARKING GRADES.\n\nSimplicity should characterize school mechanism. The teacher and the pupils must be left untrammelled. Spontaneous and glad effort is the law of growth. In so far as mechanism enhances spontaneity, it is desirable; whenever it fetters, or cramps, or represses, it should be modified or thrown aside.\n\nMarking is considered a mechanical necessity in every well-ordered school, and, when judiciously used, is a wise educational expedient. At longer or shorter intervals nearly all successful teachers, in some way, mark the achievements of their pupils.\n\nI. OBJECTS OF MARKING.\u2014Every act of the teacher should have a well-defined object. The objects of marking are:\n\n1. To Stimulate Effort. The true teacher is delighted with success and grieved by failure. By words, and looks, and marks he expresses his pleasure or pain. The aim of the pupil in studying should be to know, yet the recorded approval of the teacher is a strong incentive to effort.\n\n2. To Indicate the Achievements of the Pupils. The teacher will thus be enabled to do the best for his pupils. It is not wise to trust to memory always. Even the orator finds notes helpful. To the teacher they are indispensable.\n\n3. To Enable the Teacher to Make Reliable Records and Reports. Teachers are changed, pupils are promoted, and courses of study are completed. Parents and school officers justly expect trustworthy records and reports. Careful marking furnishes necessary data.\n\nII. CRITERIA FOR MARKING.\u2014Marking is a difficult art. Effort, attainments, and growth are to be estimated, and the comparative results are to be expressed in figures. At best, the percentages are but approximate judgments.\n1. Effort deserves the Fullest Recognition. Let each step which the pupil masters by earnest effort be noted, that he may realize his progress. Many a hard-working pupil becomes discouraged and loses heart because he cannot perceive that he improves. As soon as he becomes conscious that he has accomplished a little, he will redouble his efforts to accomplish more. Determined effort deserves all possible encouragement, because it points to boundless possibilities. Well-directed and persistent effort ultimately wins.\n\n2. Originality and Independence deserve Special Recognition. The pupil is encouraged to work his problems in his own way, to present his thoughts in his own language, and to form and express his own views upon every subject. All glib parrot reciting must be discouraged.\n\n3. Real Attainments must receive Due Credit. Success is tangible. The pupil masters principles and readily applies them. He steadily grows stronger as well as wiser. Marks should as nearly as possible show his achievements and his relative strength.\n\nHow to Mark.\u2014\n(1.) Duly weigh effort, originality, and attainments; mark in view of all.\n(2.) Study your pupils; if you err, let it be in the pupil's favour.\n(3.) Be not an unfeeling marking-machine; your mission is to encourage and help.\n(4.) Be impartial; mark favourites below, rather than above, and unfortunates above your estimate, rather than below. Your feelings may bias your judgment; you need to make due allowance for unconscious aberrations.\n\nIII. FREQUENCY OF MARKING.\u2014Once a week does well. For most classes, once in two weeks is sufficient. Many teachers find once a month satisfactory and altogether sufficient. Pupils never know when they will be marked. If the mark is low, the teacher redoubles his efforts; the pupil is encouraged, and tested again and again; if finally merited, a higher mark is inserted in place of the low mark.\n\nTeaching versus Marking.\u2014\n(1.) Marking-machines belong to a past age. Few schools can now bear the incubus of daily marking in all the subjects.\n(2.) Daily marking of minute details exerts a baleful influence. Pupils are stimulated to study to recite, rather than to know.\n\n(3.) The business of the teacher is teaching, not marking. Daily marking wastes much of his energy. No marking is better than daily marking.\n\n(4.) Marking must never interfere with teaching, but must be done at such moments as the teacher is free.\n\nIV. THE SCALE OF MARKING.\u2014By common consent, from 1 to 100 has been adopted as the best scale.\n\n1. 90 to 100 denote excellent.\u2014These grades should be given only in cases of decided merit. Unmeaning and careless marking does great injury. Flattery is sin.\n\n2. 80 to 90 denote good.\u2014These grades indicate decided satisfaction on the part of the teacher.\n\n3. 60 to 80 indicate passable.\u2014No effort should be spared to bring each pupil up to this standard.\n\n4. Below 60 means unsatisfactory.\u2014Poor marks should rarely be permanently recorded. Use your utmost resources to secure interest and work. Test the pupil again and again. Wait days and even weeks before finally recording a grade below 60.\n\nRemarks.\u2014\n(1.) Pupils may or may not be permitted to see the register. Usually it will be found better not to allow the pupils to see it.\n\n(2.) In all reports to parents, the words excellent, good, passable, or unsatisfactory are given, and not the figures. The same course is pursued whenever pupils are informed of their grades.\n\n(3.) The exact figures are for the teacher and his successors.\n\n(4.) Written and oral work are marked on the same basis.\n\n(5.) No marking and daily marking are extremes to be avoided. The thoughtful teacher will not mark his pupils, as a rule, more frequently than once a week, nor less frequently than once each month.\n\n(6.) The pupil is not marked on a single answer or a single recitation, but upon a series of answers and a succession of recitations.\n\n(7.) A clear head and an honest heart are essential to successful marking.\n\n(8.) Honest work must be secured at any cost.\nTopical Review\u2014Marking Grades.\n\nMarking is a mechanical necessity in every school.\n\n1. Simplicity should characterize all school mechanism.\n2. Achievements of pupils must be recorded.\n\nI. Objects of Marking.\n1. To stimulate effort by recording the teacher's approval.\n2. To aid the teacher in the preparation of records and reports.\n\nII. Criteria for Marking,\u2014must be carefully weighed.\n1. Effort deserves the fullest recognition.\n2. Originality and independence merit special recognition.\n3. Real attainments must receive due credit.\n4. How to mark:\u2014\n   (1.) With reference to effort, originality, and attainments.\n   (2.) Study your pupils; let errors be in their favour.\n   (3.) Let your marking give encouragement and help.\n   (4.) Be impartial; allow for possible errors of feeling.\n\nIII. Frequency of Marking.\n1. Once a week. 2. Not on fixed days.\n3. Teaching versus marking:\u2014\n   (1.) Marking machines belong to the dead past.\n   (2.) Daily marking induces study from wrong motives.\n   (3.) Daily marking wastes time and energy.\n   (4.) Marking must not be done in teaching hours.\n\nIV. The Scale of Marking,\u2014from 1 to 100.\n1. 90 to 100 denotes excellent. 2. 80 to 90 denotes good.\n3. 60 to 80 indicates passable. 4. Below 60 means unsatisfactory.\n\nV. General Remarks on Marking.\n1. Pupils are not allowed to examine the register.\n2. The words, and not the figures, are used in reports.\n3. The figures guide the teacher and his successors.\n4. Written and oral work are marked on the same basis.\n5. Avoid the extremes of daily marking and no marking.\n6. Marking is based on a series of recitations.\n7. Correct marking requires a clear head and a clean heart.\n8. Honest work must be secured at any cost.\nCHAPTER III.\n\nSchool Records and Reports.\n\nI. FORM.\u2014For ungraded schools the records and reports must be in the simplest possible form, involving little labour and less skill. Most school registers now published are so well arranged that no teacher need fail to keep a correct record. The blanks usually furnished for reports explain themselves, so that mistakes in filling out are inexcusable.\n\nTeachers in training in the County Model Schools will receive special instruction as to the manner in which the registers, and other books prescribed in the School Law and Regulations of Ontario, should be kept. It would be a needless extravagance of space to insert here specimens of the various entries to be made in these books; a brief examination of their form, and of the entries in them belonging to the Model School, will be sufficient to guide each teacher as to the proper manner in which to keep his own.\n\nII. VALUE.\u2014Records and reports, properly kept, aid in many ways.\n\n1. They help the Teacher.\u2014Since conditions and results must be recorded and reported, the teacher is stimulated to do his best. Slipshod work is discouraged. Moreover, the teacher having the records before him is better prepared to do his pupils justice; and, because of the permanency of the record, he is far less likely to do injustice to any pupil.\n\nCare must be taken, however, not to allow the register to become an unhealthy stimulus either to teacher or pupil. There is probably less risk of the teacher doing injustice to a pupil by too low a record than of his doing him more than justice by erring too constantly on the side of mercy. Justice, tempered with mercy, should be the guiding principle in every entry in the register.\n\n2. Records are a Great Aid to the New Teacher.\u2014Barbarians make no records. Schools without records are in a barbarous condition, as the new teacher has nothing to guide him.\nWell-kept records enable the new teacher to begin where his predecessor left off. It is, in fact, utterly impossible for any teacher properly to classify a new school unless the various registers have been faithfully and regularly kept.\n\n3. Records Aid School Officers.\u2014County Inspectors and school-boards may readily determine the condition of a school, and take intelligent action with reference to it, if the records are complete and reliable. Without such records, official action is likely to be blind action.\n\n4. They Elevate the Teacher in his Profession.\u2014The registers are the business books of the teacher; and Inspectors and others cannot but be impressed by the manner in which the entries are recorded. Teachers should remember that teaching is a business as well as a profession, and their duty to themselves demands that they leave nothing undone to further their interests by honourable means.\n\nIII. THE SCHOOL REGISTERS.\u2014For ungraded schools, registers may be arranged for the following purposes:\n\n1. Enrolment.\u2014The names and ages of pupils, the times of entrance, and parents\u2019 names are carefully recorded each term. In case of withdrawal or removal, the time and its cause should be noted opposite the name of the pupil.\n\n2. Attendance.\u2014The roll may be arranged alphabetically, and the teacher may call the names. This is the approved plan in small schools. In large schools numbers may be assigned to pupils, each calling his own number; or, the division leaders may name absentees. The latter method has decided advantages. The teacher calls a division; the pupils belonging to this division rise, and the leader reports the absentees. The other divisions, in like manner, are called in turn. The teacher marks each absentee on the roll. In this way, the roll of any school may be called in less than one minute. In all cases, absentees alone are marked; no mark means present. The attendance roll is called at the close of each half-day session. (See also page 69.)\n\n3. Tardy Roll.\u2014This roll may be called at the beginning of each half-day session. The \u2014 mark means tardy; when explained satisfactory, the \u2014 is changed to +, but the record is permanent. (See also page 100.)\n4. Class Rolls.\u2014These rolls show the recitation and examination grades and the class-standing of the members of each class. The average of the class grades in the branch, multiplied by four and added to the average written-examination grades, and the sum divided by five, will give the class-standing for the month, term, or year.\n\n5. Reports.\u2014All reports should be recorded in the register. The register should always contain blanks for this purpose.\n\n6. Programme.\u2014The programme should also be recorded in the register, which should contain blanks for this purpose. The register should be preserved with as much care as the ledger of the merchant. The new teacher will find recorded in it the real condition of the school, and the data he needs in organizing.\n\nIV. TEACHERS' REPORTS.\u2014These should be such as impose the minimum of extra labour. Faithful teachers of ungraded schools are always overworked.\n\n1. Monthly Report Cards to Parents.\u2014No grades are placed on these\u2014simply the words, excellent, good, passable, poor. A foot-note explains that \"excellent\" means from 90 to 100; \"good,\" from 80 to 90; \"passable,\" from 60 to 80; \"poor,\" below 60. These reports will include deportment as well as scholarship. Times absent and times tardy should also be reported. In no case should these reports be made oftener than once a month.\n\n2. Quarterly Reports to School-Boards.\u2014In these reports are given the total enrollment, the average attendance, the average class-standing of each pupil, and such other items as the blanks call for. To require these reports monthly is a useless imposition upon teachers. The law should be so changed as to require only quarterly reports to school-boards, but monthly reports to Inspectors.\n\n3. Reports to County Inspectors.\u2014A full report, containing items mentioned in the report to the School Board, and such other items as may be required in the blank furnished, should be made at the close of each month to the County Inspector. In addition to the regular reports, special reports may be required at any time. Some Inspectors now wisely require monthly reports from teachers, and thus keep themselves fully informed at all times as to the\ncondition of the schools under their charge. Efficient county supervision is thus secured; and, though it is by no means absolutely necessary, nor is it required by law, to furnish such monthly reports, yet there can be no question that such reports, judiciously and systematically furnished, would do much to secure greater efficiency in the schools and a closer approach to uniformity in the grading and classification of the schools.\n\n4. Enforcement.\u2014Statements that the reports required by the School Law and Regulations have been made should condition the payment of salaries. When reports are required at the close of a quarter, the salary for the last month should be withheld until the reports are made.\n\nV. REPORT OF COUNTY INSPECTORS.\u2014This should be made annually to the Hon. the Minister of Education, and quarterly to the County Council. It should be printed in pamphlet form. This report may embrace:\n\n1. The Names of Teachers.\u2014Address, salaries and grade may be given; also the number of times that each one has attended the Teachers' Institute in his own county.\n\n2. Catalogue of Pupils.\u2014This should contain the names of all pupils enrolled during the year; the division to which the pupil belongs will be indicated after the name. One page may be devoted to each school.\n\n3. Names of Graduates.\u2014Pupils completing the elementary course of study should be published as elementary-school graduates.\n\nOur school system is so arranged as to utilize as far as possible all the machinery of education; and, as the High School follows the Public School in natural order, it seems, for the present at least, better to encourage as many of our Public School pupils as can do so to continue their studies to the end of the regular High School course. The time has not yet arrived for a purely technical \"graduation\" in connection with our Public Schools; but credit should be given in the report, whenever any candidate has left the school either by entrance into a High School or by the completion of the full course prescribed in the programme of studies for Public Schools.\n\n4. Financial Statement.\u2014The report should exhibit all moneys received and paid out for school purposes by each school.\n5. Miscellaneous.\u2014This report should give the course of study and such general information as will tend to advance the educational interests of the country.\n\n6. Cost and Value.\u2014Printing is cheap; the cost of printing such a report would be insignificant, and its value would be great. It would establish a school system for the county. Each pupil would know his place in the line of advancement. All the teachers of the county would learn to work to a plan. As much interest would be taken in graduation from the district school as is now taken in graduation from higher institutions. The whole people would be interested.\n\nMany of our County Inspectors' Reports are models of their kind,\u2014suggestive, able, and comprehensive. It will be a great economy of time, money, and talent when the circulation of such reports becomes general. A collection of the reports of County Inspectors should contain sufficient information about every school and every teacher in the province to enable vacancies to be filled at once by those best fitted for them by nature and education.\n\n[Concluding Remarks.\u2014The foregoing pages contain all that appear to the Editor of this special Canadian edition to be essential for the successful management of an average Canadian school, whether graded or ungraded. He is not, indeed, at all sure that he has not placed before the teachers in training rather more than is absolutely necessary; but if so, the Model School masters will guide them to make a judicious selection.]\nTOPICAL REVIEW\u2014School Records and Reports.\n\nI.

[48 V., c. 49, s. 158.]\n\n158. Every teacher shall be entitled to be paid at the rate mentioned in his agreement with the trustees, even after the expiration of the period of his agreement, until the trustees pay him the whole of his salary as teacher of the school, according to their engagement with him, provided always that an action must be commenced within three months after such salary is due and payable by the trustees. [48 V. c. 49, s. 159.]\nCertificates.\n\n159. Every certificate to teach a Public School shall be ranked as of the first, second, or third class, and shall be issued under the regulations of the Education Department, only to such persons as (a) furnish satisfactory proof of good moral character; (b) and, if males, are at least eighteen years of age, or if females, seventeen years of age, (c) and are natural born or naturalized subjects of Her Majesty, and (d) pass the examinations prescribed by the Education Department.

Every certificate issued under this Act shall entitle the holder thereof to teach a public school in any municipality in the Province, but only those of the first and second class shall be valid during good behaviour. [48 V. c. 49, s. 161.]\n\nThe same,\n\n161. First and second class certificates of qualification shall be granted to teachers by the Minister of Education on the report of the Central Committee of Examiners, and third class certificates shall be granted by the County Board of Examiners according to the regulations of the Department. [48 V. c. 49, s. 162.]\n\nThird class district certificates.\n\n162.

As pupils learn to read principally by imitation, the teacher's voice should direct in the matter of accent, inflection, emphasis and pronunciation. Pupils in every class should be required regularly to commit to memory selected passages in prose and verse, to give the meaning of what they read, and to make, from time to time, a summary of the reading lessons, in their own language.\n\n(b) Geography.\u2014The School House and its surroundings, with which the pupils are familiar, should be taken as the first subjects of lessons to give correct ideas of boundary and direction. Map drawing should be practised from the beginning. Definitions in Physical Geography should be fully illustrated in all cases by blackboard drawings or otherwise. The teacher should teach this subject in the first and second classes by means of familiar talks about the natural phenomena of different countries, the peculiarities of different races, the birds and animals of different zones, etc.\n\n(c) Grammar and Composition.\u2014Grammar should be taught at first mainly as the basis of composition. The essential parts of the simple sentence; the functions and definitions of the parts of speech, and the rules for inflection, should be arrived at by induction; sentence building, and the correction of common mistakes in English. Every school exercise, whether oral or written, should be made an exercise in Composition. The teacher should use especial care in requiring good English from his pupils in all their answers in class or in conversation.\n(d) History.\u2014The principal events in Canadian history, with their bearing upon the progress of Canada, should be discussed. Care should be taken to explain thoroughly our Municipal and Federal forms of Government, and the principal events of English history, without unnecessary details or unimportant dates. A comprehension of leading facts and general principles is more valuable than the most accurate knowledge of details, if unaccompanied by ability to distinguish what is important from what is not. Throughout the course the teacher should bear in mind the interesting and valuable lessons that may be deduced from the lives of the men and women who have played a prominent part in history.\n\n(e) Arithmetic.\u2014Systematic training in mental Arithmetic should prevail in all the classes. Accuracy and expertness in performing elementary operations are of the first importance. Problems based on the elementary rules should be given from the commencement. Great stress should be laid on the solution of questions by the Analytic Method.\n\n(f) Writing.\u2014Neat and legible writing, and the proper formation of the small and capital letters should be aimed at.\n\n(g) Drawing.\u2014The drawing exercises in Parts I. and II. of the First Reader, or the Kindergarten Drawing course, should be used for the First Class. In the junior Second Class the pupils should be encouraged to expand these exercises into original designs. In the other classes the authorized Drawing Course should be followed.\n\n(3) Fourth Form.\n\n(a) Reading.\u2014A general knowledge of the elements of vocal expression, with special reference to emphasis, inflection, and pause. The reading, with proper expression, of any selection in the Reader authorized for Fourth Book classes. The pupil should be taught to read intelligently, as well as intelligibly.\n\n(b) Literature.\u2014The pupil should be taught to give for words or phrases, meanings which may be substituted therefor, with-\nout impairing the sense of the passage; to illustrate and show\nthe appropriateness of important words or phrases; to dis-\ntinguish between synonyms in common use; to paraphrase\ndifficult passages so as to show the meaning clearly; to show\nthe connection of the thoughts in any selected passage; to\nexplain allusions; to write explanatory or descriptive notes on\nproper or other names; to show that he has studied the lessons\nthoughtfully, by being able to give an intelligent opinion on\nany subject treated of therein that comes within the range of\nhis experience or comprehension; and especially to show that\nhe has entered into the spirit of the passage, by being able to\nread it with proper expression. He should be required to\nmemorize passages of special beauty from the selections pre-\nscribed, and to reproduce in his own words, the substance of\nany of these selections, or of any part thereof. He should also\nobtain some knowledge of the authors from whose works these\nselections have been made.\n\n(c) Orthography and Ortho\u00ebpy.\u2014The pronunciation, the syl-\nlabication, and the spelling from dictation, of words in common\nuse. The correction of words improperly spelt or pronounced.\nThe distinction between words in common use in regard to\nspelling, pronunciation, and meaning.\n\n(d) Writing.\u2014Besides writing the regular copy-book exer-\ncises, the pupil should be taught simple business forms, letter\nwriting and how to keep simple accounts.\n\n(e) Geography.\u2014The form and the motions of the earth. The\nchief definitions as contained in the authorized text-book:\ndivisions of the land and the water; circles on the globe; politi-\ncal divisions; natural phenomena. Maps of America, Europe,\nAsia and Africa. Maps of Canada and Ontario, including the\nrailway systems. The products and the commercial relations\nof Canada.\n\n(f) Grammar.\u2014The sentence; its different forms. Words;\ntheir chief classes and inflections. Different grammatical values\nof the same word. The meanings of the chief grammatical\nterms. The grammatical values of phrases and of clauses. The nature of the clauses in easy compound and complex sentences. The government, the agreement, and the arrangement of words. The correction, with reasons therefor, of wrong forms of words and of false syntax. The parsing of easy sentences. The analysis of simple sentences.\n\n(g) Composition.\u2014The nature and the construction of different kinds of sentences. The combination of separate statements into sentences. The nature and the construction of paragraphs. The combination of separate statements into paragraphs. Variety of expression, with the following classes of exercises:\u2014Changing the voice of the verb; expanding a word or a phrase into a clause; contracting a clause into a word or a phrase; changing from direct into indirect narration, or the converse; transposition; changing the form of a sentence; expansion of given heads or hints into a composition; the contraction of passages; paraphrasing prose. The elements of punctuation. Short narratives or descriptions. Familiar letters.\n\n(h) History.\u2014Outlines of English history; the outlines of Canadian history generally, with particular attention to the events subsequent to 1841. The municipal institutions of Ontario, and the Federal form of the Dominion government.\n\n(4) PROGRAMME FOR FIFTH FORM\u2014PUBLIC SCHOOLS.\n\nThe programme for the Fifth Form embraces the following subjects:\u2014Reading and Orthoepy, Orthography, English Grammar, Composition and Prose Literature, Poetical Literature, History and Geography, Arithmetic and Mensuration, Algebra, a Commercial Course, Drawing, Physics, Botany, Music, Drill and Calisthenics. The course of study and the text-book used under each head shall be the same as that prescribed for the First Form in High Schools. Trustees are recommended not to open a Fifth Form in the Public School in any city, town, or incorporated village, where a High School is situated.\nGENERAL DIRECTIONS\u2014FORMS I.-V.\n\n(a) Agriculture.\u2014The authorized text-book on this subject should be introduced into every rural school. Special attention should be given to such points as, how plants grow and what they feed upon, how farms are beautified and cultivated, the value of shade trees, what trees to plant and when to plant them, the relation of agriculture to other pursuits, the effect of climate on the habits of a people. Poetical selections on rural subjects, talks on natural history, should form part of the instruction of every Friday afternoon.\n\n(b) Temperance and Hygiene.\u2014These subjects should at first be taught in the form of familiar lectures. The nature and effects of alcohol upon the system and the importance of temperance and a strict observance of the laws of health, as set forth in the authorized text-book, should form part of the regular instruction of the school from the Second Form upwards, and should be taught, either by the use of textbooks, or otherwise, as thoroughly as any other subject on the programme.\n\n(c) Drill and Calisthenics.\u2014The different extension movements prescribed in the authorized text-book on the subject should be frequently practised, not only during recess but during school hours. Accuracy and promptness should characterize every movement. In addition, the boys should be formed into companies and taught the usual squad and company drill, and the girls should be exercised in calisthenics.\n\n(d) Music.\u2014As in the authorized text-book. In forms I. and II., pupils should be practised in rote-singing, obtaining in the last part of the course the elements of musical notation. In the other forms they should be practised in song-singing, sacred and secular, continuing also the course in musical notation.\n\n(e) Moral and Religious Instruction.\u2014No course of moral instruction is prescribed. The teacher is expected, however, by his personal example as well as by the exercise of his authority\nand by instruction, to imbue every pupil with respect for those moral obligations which underlie a well formed character. Respect for those in authority and for the aged; courtesy, true manliness, reverence, truthfulness, honesty, etc., can best be inculcated as the occasion arises for referring to them. The religious exercises of the school should be conducted without haste and with the utmost reverence and decorum.\n\n(f) Reviews and Recitations.\u2014Every Friday forenoon should be devoted to a review of the week's work, and the afternoon to exercises tending to relieve the usual routine of the school-room, while promoting the mental and moral culture of the pupils. The teacher should encourage the pupils to prepare dialogues, readings, recitations and songs for the Friday afternoon school-sessions. He should also choose some topic for a familiar lecture, or read some literary selection, making such comments as are likely to promote a love of reading, and quicken the interest of the scholars in the work of the school. The girls should receive suitable instructions in plain sewing.\n\nDuties of Pupils.\n\n7. The following are the duties of pupils in Public Schools:\n\n(1) Every pupil whose name is entered on the register of a Public School shall attend punctually and regularly every day in the school term in which his name is so entered; he shall be neat and cleanly in his person and habits, and diligent, truthful, honest, kind, courteous, respectful, and obedient, and shall conform to all the rules of the school.\n\n(2) Any pupil not present at the time prescribed for opening the school may be required to furnish forthwith a written excuse from his parent or guardian, or be denied admittance to the school for the day or half-day, at the discretion of the Principal.\n\n(3) Any pupil absenting himself from school, except on account of sickness, shall forfeit his standing in his class, or shall be liable to such other punishment as the teacher may lawfully inflict.\n(4) No pupil shall be allowed to leave school before the hour appointed for closing, except in case of sickness, or on the request, either oral or written, of the parent or guardian.\n\n(5) Any pupil, once admitted to school and duly registered, shall attend at the commencement of each term and continue in attendance regularly until its close, or until he is withdrawn by notice to the teacher to that effect; and any pupil violating this rule shall not be entitled to continue in such school, or be admitted to any other, until such violation is certified by the parent or guardian to have been unavoidable.\n\n(6) Any pupil guilty of any of the following offences, viz.:\u2014 (a) persistent truancy; (b) violent opposition to authority; (c) the repetition of any offence after being warned; (d) habitual and wilful neglect of duty; (e) the use of profane or improper language; (f) cutting, marring, destroying or defacing any part of the school property; (g) writing any obscene words on the fences, water-closets, or any part of the school premises; (h) general bad conduct, injurious to the moral tone of the school, may be suspended by the teacher for one month, or until such suspension is removed by assurance of better conduct, or by order of the Trustees.\n\n(7) Whenever a teacher suspends a pupil for any of the causes herein named, he shall at once notify the parents or guardians, and the Trustees stating the reasons for such suspension.\n\n(8) The parent or guardian of any pupil suspended may appeal to the Trustees against the action of the teacher, and the decision of the Trustees, or of a majority of them, shall be final.\n\n(9) Any pupil who shall be adjudged so refractory by the Trustees or by a majority of them, and by the teacher, that his presence in the school is injurious to the other pupils, may be expelled, and no such pupil shall be readmitted to any school without the written consent of the Public School Inspector.\n(10) Pupils in cities, towns and villages shall attend such school or department as may be designated by the Trustees, and no transfer from one school or department to another shall be allowed without the consent of the Trustees and the Inspector.\n\n(11) No pupil who is affected with or exposed to any contagious disease, shall be permitted to attend school until he produces the certificate of a medical man that there are no sanitary objections to his re-admission.\n\n(12) Any pupil absenting himself from an examination, or from any portion thereof, without permission of the teacher, shall not be admitted to any public school, except by authority of the Inspector, in writing; and the names of all such pupils shall be immediately reported by the teacher to their parents and the Trustees.\n\n(13) Pupils shall be responsible to the teacher for their conduct on the school premises, or in going to or returning from school, except when accompanied by their parents or guardians, or by some person appointed by them, or on their behalf.\n\n(14) No pupil shall be allowed to remain in school unless he is furnished with the books and other requisites to be used by him in school, but it shall be lawful for the Trustees to supply him with such books and other requisites.\n\n(15) No pupil shall have the right to attend school unless, and until, he has paid all the fees imposed by the Trustees for the current month or quarter, as the case may be, and for such books, stationery and other supplies as are authorized under the Public Schools Act.\n\n(16) Any school property or furniture injured or destroyed by a pupil, shall be made good forthwith by the parent or guardian, under penalty of the suspension of the delinquent.\n\n(17) Every pupil entitled thereto shall, on application, when he leaves or removes from a school, receive a certificate of good conduct and standing.\nSCHOOL HOURS.\n\n8. The school hours shall be from nine o'clock in the forenoon till four o'clock in the afternoon, but the trustees by resolution may, for the purpose of affording facilities for religious instructions or for other suitable purposes, prescribe a shorter period. In Kindergarten Schools, the hours of study should not exceed three hours per day.\n\n9. There shall be a recess of not less than ten minutes each forenoon and afternoon, and at least one hour shall be allowed for recreation during the middle of the school day.\n\nDuties of Teachers.\n\n10. In every Public School in which more teachers than one are employed the head teacher shall be called the Principal and the other teachers Assistants.\n\n11. The Principal shall prescribe (with the concurrence of the Trustees) the duties of the Assistants, and shall be responsible for the organization and discipline of the whole school.\n\n12. It shall be the duty of every teacher in a Public School\u2014\n\n(1) To see that the school-house is ready for the reception of pupils at least fifteen minutes before the time prescribed for opening the school in the morning, and five minutes before the time for opening in the afternoon.\n\n(2) To classify his pupils strictly according to the programme of studies prescribed by the Education Department, and to make no departure from such classification without the consent of the Trustees and the Inspector.\n\n(3) To prepare a time-table to be posted in some conspicuous part of the room for the guidance of himself and his pupils.\n(4) To prevent the use by the pupils of unauthorized textbooks.\n\n(5) To make at the end of each school term or at such other time as may be approved by the Inspector, and subject to revision by him, such promotions from one class to another as he may deem expedient.\n\n(6) To practise such discipline in his school as would be exercised by a kind, firm, and judicious parent; to reprove his pupils with tenderness and becoming deliberation, and to aim at governing them through their affections and reason rather than by force; to encourage his pupils to cultivate kindly feelings towards one another, respect for one another's rights, politeness in and out of school, habits of honesty and truthfulness, and obedience to all persons in authority over them; and to discountenance quarrelling, cruelty to animals, and the use of profane and improper language.\n\n(7) To give strict attention to the proper ventilation and cleanliness of the school-house; to make and enforce such rules as will ensure the keeping of the school grounds and outbuildings in a neat and cleanly condition.\n\n(8) To see that the school grounds, sheds, and water-closets are kept in proper order; that no damage is done to the furniture, fences, outbuildings, or other school property; to give notice in writing to the trustees of any necessary repairs or supplies.\n\n(9) To employ (unless otherwise provided for), at such compensation as may be fixed by the Trustees, a suitable person to make fires, sweep the rooms, dust the walls, seats, desks, and other furniture; but no assistant teacher or pupil shall be required to perform such duty unless regularly employed for that purpose as herein provided.\n\n(10) To make up all returns to the Inspector or the Education Department, as far as the information required can be supplied from the school register, and to furnish such other\ninformation affecting the interests of his school as may from time to time be required by the Department or the Inspector.\n\n(11) To attend regularly the Teachers' Institutes held in his county, and to contribute from his experience and observation to their general usefulness.\n\n(12) To give immediate notice to the Trustees and Inspector of his absence from school through illness or other unavoidable cause. [See also Revised Statutes, section 153, (1887)].\n\nCollections\u2014Presents\u2014Lost Time.\n\n13. In no school shall collections be taken up or subscriptions received from the pupils, nor shall any bills or other advertisements be distributed by the teacher for any purpose whatever without the consent of the Trustees.\n\n14. Except when severing his connection with the school, no teacher shall receive any presents from the pupils, nor shall he give any medal or prize to any pupil without the consent of the Trustees.\n\n15. No teacher shall make up lost time by teaching on a holiday or during vacations, and any attendance during such time shall be disallowed by the Inspector.\n\nInspectors.\n\nQualifications.\n\n16. Any person holding (1) either a first-class Provincial certificate, grade A, or a degree in arts from the University of Toronto with first-class honours in one or more of the recognized departments of examination in said University, or an equivalent standing in any other University of Ontario, (2) and furnishing evidence of having taught successfully for five years (of which at least three years must have been spent in a Public School) shall be eligible to be appointed a Public School Inspector.\nCounty Inspector's Duties.\n\n17. It shall be the duty of every County Inspector\u2014\n\n(1) To spend at least half a day each term in each school.\u2014Where a school has several departments, the Inspector should devote half a day to each department. When, however, from the character of the work done, an Inspector thinks it would be in the interest of the school to extend his visit over the whole day, he should do so. The half day limit is the average time required for each visit.\n\n(2) To satisfy himself as to the progress made by the pupils from time to time. This cannot be done without many memoranda of the standing of each class. It will therefore be necessary for the Inspector to make copious notes in regard to each recitation, showing the condition of each class and the proficiency attained in the several subjects of the curriculum. This part of the work should be thorough and searching; and the conclusions arrived at should be based on the Inspector's own observation.\n\n(3) To examine into the methods of instruction pursued by the teacher. To do this the Inspector should require the teacher of the school to teach several lessons in his presence. In this way the teacher's methods can be observed and hints given for improvement should he evince any faults of method or of manner. Great attention should be paid to methods: the proper and logical presentation of a subject is so important that success is impossible without it.\n\n(4) To teach a few model lessons himself. The proper method of teaching subjects that are found to be neglected or badly taught by the teacher should be exemplified by the Inspector. Here all the qualities which go to form the model teacher should be exercised. His methods of questioning and of receiving answers, of rousing the enthusiasm of the class, of securing attention, of reaching by apt illustration the judgment of the pupils, are all eagerly watched by the teacher and should serve both as a model and as a stimulus to him in the future.\n(5) To ascertain the nature of the discipline exercised by the teacher. This no doubt will appear from the attention and diligence of the pupils, without special enquiry. The manner of the teacher will very soon indicate the nature of the discipline. It would be well, nevertheless, to ascertain whether corporal punishment is frequently resorted to, and if not, what are the punishments (if any) usually inflicted.\n\n(6) To examine the registers, maps, seats, and all the internal and external equipments of the school-house. He should see (a) that the register is properly and neatly kept, and ascertain whether or not entries are made therein daily; (b) that the maps are suitable and well preserved; (c) that blackboards are in proper repair, and that crayons and brushes are fully supplied; (d) that the furniture is generally adequate; that proper attention is paid to the heating (e) and ventilation of the rooms; (f) that the fences and out-houses are in proper repair; (g) that the school library is suitably cared for.\n\n(7) To report to Trustees in regard to such matters as require their attention. This duty the Inspector should never neglect. The Trustees of a school expect to be informed and directed as to many matters coming under the cognizance of the Inspector, who is, in a certain sense, their officer, and is appointed for the very purpose of aiding them in the discharge of their duties. His report, therefore, on the school should be full. Every necessary change coming within the scope of the duties of the Trustees should be mentioned in detail, and in no case should the school grant be withheld, until they have had an opportunity of removing any defect to which their attention has been called.\n\n(8) To give such advice to teachers as may be deemed necessary. This part of the Inspector's duty should be performed with tact and delicacy, and perfect frankness. Whatever defects in the teacher's manner, or in his discipline of the pupils, or methods of instruction are discovered during the inspection of the school, should be plainly pointed out. Whenever the Inspector has reason to believe that there is any defect in the organization of the school, or in its classification,\nor in attention on the part of the pupils, it should be referred to, and the proper remedy suggested. This, of course, should be done privately\u2014not in the presence of the pupils.\n\n(9) To see that no unauthorized text-books are used in the school. No text-books should be placed in the hands of the pupils, except those authorized for their use. Under the disguise of recommending certain works for \"home study,\" many unauthorized text-books are introduced into the school. This should be prevented by the Inspector in the exercise of his authority as an officer of the Education Department.\n\n(10) To withhold the school grant in certain cases. Before the school grant is withheld: (1) An opportunity should be afforded the Trustees to remedy the wrong complained of. (2) A full statement of the case should be sent to the Department, and the consent of the Minister of Education obtained. As the grant can be withheld for any violation of the School Act or Departmental Regulations, the power thus conferred should be exercised judiciously, and only when other remedies fail.\n\n(11) To divide the school grants. Care should be taken to see that the semi-annual returns of the Trustees are properly added up, and if any doubt exists as to their accuracy they should be compared with the school register. When the division of the grant is made, as required by law, it will be sufficient for the Inspector to send a statement to the Township Treasurer of the amount due each school section, and at the same time to notify the Secretary-Treasurer of each Board of Trustees of the amount due its section. The Board of Trustees can then give an order either to the teacher or to some other person to whom it desires to have the money paid, and on this order the Township Treasurer is authorized to pay the money.\n\n(12) To decide complaints made within twenty days in regard to the election of Trustees and other matters. In discharging this duty the Inspector should remember that he is exercising judicial functions and should accordingly proceed with due deliberation. He has a right to withhold his decision until such evidence is produced as he may deem necessary in regard to the question at issue.\n(13) To grant, on examination, temporary certificates. These certificates should only be granted (1) when petitioned for by a Board of Trustees, and only for the school over which such Board has jurisdiction; and (2) until the date of the next ensuing Departmental Examination; and (3) when it appears that a teacher holding a regular certificate is not available. The consent of the Minister is also necessary in every case.\n\n(14) To suspend a teacher's certificate. This should be done only when he is fully satisfied that the teacher is incompetent or immoral, or has wilfully violated the school law or the regulations of the Education Department. In the final investigation by which such suspension is to be confirmed or set aside, the fullest opportunity should be afforded the teacher to vindicate himself. Judicial fairness should in this instance also characterize the conduct of the Inspector.\n\n(15) To visit the County Model School at least twice in each term. It is very desirable that the Inspector should be present at the opening of the Model School and assist the Principal in its organization. He should also visit the school at least once during the term, and by his presence and counsel encourage the teachers in training in the pursuit of their studies. For such two visits he should be paid by the County Council at the same rate as he is paid for Public School work.\n\nCITY INSPECTORS.\n\n18. The Inspector of every city or town shall, as far as circumstances admit, be governed by the regulations respecting County Inspectors, and shall, in addition thereto, perform such other duties as may be imposed upon him by the Board of Trustees.\n\nPOWERS OF INSPECTOR.\n\n19. The Inspector, while officially visiting a school, has supreme authority in the school, and has the right to direct teachers and pupils in regard to any or all of the exercises of\nthe school-room. He may either examine the classes himself or direct the teacher to do so. He is at liberty to give such advice to pupils or to the teacher as he may deem necessary. All his counsels, however, should be given in a spirit of kindness, and his authority should be exercised, not with a view to over-awe or intimidate, but to reform abuses, correct mistakes, and inspire confidence and respect. He should be courteous and considerate and when reproof is necessary it should be tempered with gentleness and sympathy.\n\nCOUNTY MODEL SCHOOLS.\n\nGENERAL CONDITIONS.\n\n63. The County Board of Examiners for each county or group of counties shall set apart at least one Public School as a Model School for the professional training of Third Class Teachers, subject to the approval of the Education Department.\n\n64. In order to entitle a Public School to be ranked and used for Model School purposes, the following conditions must be complied with:\n\n(1) The Principal shall hold a First Class Departmental Certificate and have at least three years' experience as a Public School teacher.\n\n(2) There shall not be fewer than three assistants holding at least Second Class Provincial Certificates.\n\n(3) The equipment of the school shall be at least equal to that required by the regulations for the fourth form of a Public School.\n\n(4) A room for Model School purposes, in addition to the accommodation required for the Public School shall be pro-\nvided either in the same building or elsewhere equally convenient.\n\n(5) The Principal shall be relieved of all Public School duties during the Model School term, and the assistant provided for this purpose, shall, under the direction of the Principal, take charge of Public School work only.\n\n65. The Principal shall report to the Chairman of the Board of Examiners, at the close of the session, the status of each teacher in training, as shown by the daily register.\n\n66. The teachers in training shall attend regularly and punctually during the whole Model School term, and shall be subject to the discipline of the Principal, with an appeal, in case of dispute, to the Chairman of the County Board of Examiners.\n\n67. The teachers in training shall be subjected to an examination in Practical Teaching at the close of the session, and also to a written examination on papers prepared by the Central Committee, the results of which, on the percentage fixed by the County Board of Examiners, shall determine their final standing.\n\n68. In any county where there are two or more Model Schools the County Board shall distribute the students equally among the different schools, and in cases where there may be a deficiency of room in any Model School, the County Board may give the preference of admission to such as have obtained the highest number of marks at the non-professional examination.\n\n69. Boards of Trustees may impose a fee of not more than five dollars on each teacher in training, and in addition thereto the County Board of Examiners may impose a fee on each teacher in training not exceeding two dollars per student as an examination fee in lieu of the amount chargeable against the county for conducting the professional examination.\n70. There shall be one session of thirteen weeks in each Model School during the year, beginning on the second Tuesday in September.\n\n71. Each Model School shall be visited at least once during the session by the Departmental Inspector, and twice by the County Inspector in whose district such Model School is situated.\n\nCourse of Study.\n\n72.

In Music and Drill and Calisthenics the Board shall accept the results of an examination held by the Principal or conduct a special examination as it may deem expedient. The Board shall have power to reject any candidate who may show himself deficient in scholarship.\n\nTEACHERS' INSTITUTES.\n\n75. In each county or inspectorial division, a Teachers' Institute shall be formed, the object of which shall be to read papers and discuss matters having a practical bearing on the daily work of the schoolroom.\n\n76. The officers of the Institute shall be a president, vice-president, and secretary-treasurer. There shall also be a management committee of five. The officers of the Institute and the management committee shall be elected annually.\n\n77. There shall be at least one meeting of the Institute each year, extending over two or more days, to be called the annual meeting, for the election of officers and the discussion of such matters as may be submitted by the management committee.\n\n78.

A copy of the programme should be sent to every teacher in the county or inspectorial division, at least one month before the time of the meeting. All questions and discussions foreign to the teachers' work shall be avoided.\n\n80. A portion of the afternoon of the second day at every annual meeting should be set apart for discussing such matters as affect the relations between the teacher and the Trustees, of which special notice should be given by the Secretary to every Board of Trustees in the county or inspectorial division. The actual travelling expenses of one representative from each Board of Trustees shall be allowed by the Board for attendance in all such cases.\n\n81.

It shall be the duty of every Public School teacher to attend continuously all the meetings of the Institute held in his county or inspectorial division, provided the time so spent shall not exceed two school days in each half year, and in the event of his inability to attend, to report to his Inspector, giving reasons for his absence.\n\n83. It shall be the duty of the Inspector to furnish the secretary of the Institute with a list of the teachers in his county or inspectorial division. From this list the roll shall be called at the opening of each session. He shall also report to the Department on the form prescribed.\nNORMAL SCHOOLS.\n\n84. There shall be two sessions of the Provincial Normal Schools in each year:\u2014The first, opening on the third Tuesday in January, and closing on the third Friday in June; the second, opening on the third Tuesday in August, and closing not later than the twenty-second of December.\n\n85. The hours of daily work shall be from 9 a.m. to 12, and from 1.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. The daily sessions shall be opened and closed as prescribed in the Regulations for Public Schools.\n\n86. The students shall lodge and board at such houses only as are approved by the Principal; and shall not be out of their boarding-house after 10 p.m. Ladies and gentlemen shall not board at the same house. Communication of every kind between the sexes is strictly prohibited, except in the school-room by permission of the Principal or one of the Masters.\n\n87. The Principal shall be responsible for the discipline and organization of the Normal School students; he shall prescribe the duties of the Masters, subject to the approval of the Minister of Education; he shall cause such examinations to be held from time to time as may be deemed necessary, and keep a record of the same; he shall give such directions to the officers of the Normal School as will secure the efficiency of the service.\n\n88. The Masters shall be responsible to the Principal for the discipline, and general progress of their classes; they shall report monthly to the Principal the standing of each student in the subjects of their departments, and, daily, the absence of any student from their classes.\n\n89. Every student shall attend regularly and punctually all the classes during the term; he shall conduct himself with\nbecoming courtesy towards his teachers and fellow-students; he shall make reparation for all damage caused by him to furniture or other property belonging to the school; he shall submit to such discipline as may be required by the Principal or Masters of the Normal School, and shall conduct such classes in the Model School, and teach such subjects as may be directed under the supervision of the teachers of the Normal and Model Schools.\n\n90. The course of study and training in the Normal Schools shall be as follows:\u2014(a) History of Education; Science of Education; School Organization and Management; the study of the best methods of teaching each subject on the programme of studies for Public Schools; (b) Practice in Managing Classes and in Teaching in the Model School; (c) Instruction in Hygiene, Agriculture, Reading, Writing, Drawing, Music, Drill and Calisthenics; (d) Lectures in such subjects as may be prescribed by the Minister of Education.\n\n91. At the close of each term an examination shall be conducted by the central committee, in the History of Education, the Science of Education, School Organization, and Methods of Teaching. An examination in Hygiene, Agriculture, Reading, Writing, Drawing, Music, Drill and Calisthenics shall, unless otherwise ordered, be conducted by the Principal. There shall be no written examination in the subjects on which lectures are delivered simply, but any student reported as inattentive and negligent shall forfeit any honours he may be entitled to in other subjects.\n\n92. The final examination shall be adjudged according to the following schedule of marks:\u2014History of Education, 75; Science of Education, 125; School Organization and Management, 125; Methods in English Mathematics and Natural Science, 400; Practical Teaching in the Model School, 250 (on report of Principal and Masters); Practical Teaching in Model School, 250 (on report of central committee): Hygiene, Agriculture, Reading, Writing, Music, Drill and Calisthenics, 50 each. At the final examination in Practical Teaching, each\ncandidate shall teach at least two lessons, the subject of which shall have been selected by the examiner, sufficient time being allowed the candidate for preparation.\n\n93. A minimum of 50 per cent. of the marks obtainable for practical teaching, of $3\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent. of the marks obtainable in each of the other subjects, and 50 per cent. of the aggregate marks shall be required to entitle the student to a certificate. Any candidate who obtains 50 per cent. in each subject and 75 per cent. of the aggregate shall be entitled to a certificate with honors.\n\nMODEL SCHOOL.\n\n94. The Masters of the Model School, shall act under the direction of the Principal of the Normal School, and shall be responsible to him for the order, discipline and progress of the pupils attending the Model School.\n\n95. The terms of the Model Schools shall correspond to those in High Schools, and, except to fill up vacancies, pupils shall be admitted only at the beginning of a term.\n\n96. The Regulations respecting pupils in Public and High Schools shall apply to the pupils of the Model School, subject to such variations as may be approved by the Minister of Education on the report of the Principal.\n\nRELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION.\n\n200. Every Public and High School shall be opened with the Lord's Prayer, and closed with the reading of the Scriptures and the Lord's Prayer, or the prayer sanctioned by the Department of Education.\n\n201. The Scriptures shall be read daily and systematically without comment or explanation, and the portions used may be\ntaken from the book of selections adopted by the Department for that purpose, or from the Bible, as the Trustees, by resolution, may direct.\n\n202. Trustees may also order the Bible or the authorized Scripture Selections to be read daily by both pupils and teachers at the opening and closing of the school, and the Ten Commandments to be repeated at least once a week.\n\n203. No pupil shall be required to take part in any religious exercises objected to by his parents or guardians, and in order to the observance of this regulation, the teacher, before commencing a religious exercise, is to allow a short interval to elapse, during which the children of Roman Catholics, and of others who have signified their objection, may retire.\n\n204. If, in virtue of the right to be absent from the religious exercises, any pupil does not enter the school-room till fifteen minutes after the proper time for opening the school in the forenoon, such absence shall not be treated as an offence against the rules of the school.\n\n205. When a teacher claims to have conscientious scruples in regard to opening or closing the school as herein prescribed, he shall notify the Trustees to that effect in writing, and it shall be the duty of the Trustees to make such provision in the premises as they may deem expedient.\n\n206. The clergy of any denomination, or their authorized representatives, shall have the right to give religious instruction to the pupils of their own church, in each school-house, at least once a week, after the hour of closing the school in the afternoon; and if the clergy of more than one denomination apply to give religious instruction in the same school-house, the School Board or Trustees shall decide on what day of the week the school-house shall be at the disposal of the clergymen of\neach denomination, at the time above stated. But it shall be lawful for the School Board or Trustees and clergymen of any denomination to agree upon any hour of the day at which a clergyman, or his authorized representative, may give religious instruction to the pupils of his own church, provided it be not during the regular hours of the school.\n\nSuperannuated Teachers' Fund.\n\n229. In order to be entitled to any portion of the Legislative Appropriation for Superannuated Teachers every teacher of a High, Public or Separate School, and every Inspector, must have contributed $4 annually to the Superannuation Fund during the whole time of his professional service.\n\n230. Arrears, if any, from 1854 inclusive, (if the applicant was then teaching,) shall be charged at the rate of $5 per annum, and must be paid before the applicant ceases teaching. All arrears must be paid before 1st July, 1886.\n\n231. In the case of Inspectors, or Local Superintendents, who are now Inspectors, services as an Inspector shall be considered equivalent to services as a teacher.\n\n232. In the case of teachers or Inspectors under sixty years of age, proof of disability must be furnished annually to the Department. The retiring allowance shall be withdrawn whenever the disability ceases, and the recipient shall annually present himself to the Inspector, in order that he may report thereon to the Minister.\n\n233. Teachers or Inspectors, sixty years of age, are entitled to Superannuation, without proof of disability, provided the regulations aforementioned regarding payment and arrears are complied with. In all cases evidence of good moral character is required.\nText Books.\n\n234. No book shall be authorized as a text-book in any Public School until the copyright thereof has been vested in the Education Department.\n\n235. Every text-book for Public or High Schools printed and published in Canada, shall be subject, at any stage of its manufacture, to the inspection and approval of the Department in regard to printing, binding, and paper; in case of using any book not published in Canada the English edition shall be preferred to any other.\n\n236. A sample copy of every edition of every authorized book shall be deposited in the Education Department by the publisher, and no edition of any book shall be considered as approved without a certificate from the Minister of Education approving thereof.\n\n237. Every authorized book shall bear the imprint of the publisher, and shall show upon the cover or title page the authorized retail price, and no part of the book shall be used for advertising purposes, without the written consent of the Department.\n\n238. The Education Department may require the publisher of any text-book to make such alterations from time to time as may be deemed expedient; but no alterations in contents, typography, binding, paper, or any other material respects, shall, in any case, be made without the approval of the Education Department.\n\n239. Every publisher of an authorized text-book shall, before placing any edition of such authorized book upon the market, execute such agreements and give such security for the due fulfilment of these regulations as may be required by the Education Department.\n240. All authorized text-books may be published by any firm of publishers in Ontario on the payment to the original publishers of such sum or sums of money as may be agreed upon by arbitrators to be appointed for that purpose by the publishers concerned and the Minister of Education respectively.\n\n241. The Minister of Education may, at his discretion, after making full enquiry into the cost of manufacture, reduce the retail price of any authorized text-book; he may also remove such book from the list of authorized text-books, if the publishers fail to comply with the regulations of the Education Department, or if it be considered to be in the public interest so to do.\n\n242. In case the Education Department shall at any time recommend any books as aids to the teacher, for private reference or study, it is to be distinctly understood that such books are not to be used as text-books by the pupils, and any teacher who permits such books, or any other books not authorized as text-books for the public schools, to be used as such, shall be liable to such penalties as are imposed by the School Act.\n\nCARE OF SCHOOL PROPERTY.\n\n248. Trustees should appoint one of their own number or some responsible person to look after petty repairs, such as fixing fences, outhouses, walks, windows, seats, blackboards, and stoves.\n\n249. No public school house or school plot (unless otherwise provided for in the deed), or any building, furniture, or other thing pertaining thereto, shall be used or occupied for any other than Public School purposes, without the express permission of the Trustees acting as a corporation.\n\n250. Provision should be made by every school corporation for scrubbing and sweeping the school house regularly, for\nwhitewashing walls and ceilings at least annually during the summer holidays, and for making fires one hour before the time for opening school, from the first of November until the first of April in each year.\n\n**ARBOR DAY.**\n\n251. The first Friday in May should be set apart by the Trustees of every rural school and incorporated village for the purpose of planting shade trees, making flower beds and otherwise improving and beautifying the school grounds.\n\n**FIRE DRILL.**\n\n252. In every school house consisting of more than one story the pupils should be regularly trained in the fire drill, in order to prevent accidents from the alarm of fire.\nAPPENDIX II.\n\nCOUNTY MODEL SCHOOLS.\n\nPROFESSIONAL WORK, SYLLABUS OF LECTURES, &c.\n\nHINTS ON MANAGEMENT.\n\nFirst Section of Term.\u2014Two Weeks.\n\nI. Opening of School.\u2014In opening the Model School the Principal should explain to the teachers the organization and classification of the Public School with which it is connected; the necessity of observing carefully the methods of teaching practised by himself and assistants; the points on which they are marked in the Training Register; the importance of careful preparation for each day's work; the necessity of regularity and punctuality, with such other hints in regard to their deportment towards each other, towards the teachers on the staff, and the pupils with whom they come in contact, as may be considered requisite.\n\nII. Teaching by Principal.\u2014For the first two weeks of the session the Principal should teach, in the separate room provided for this purpose, those subjects which he intends the student-teachers subsequently to begin with. This is preferable to an introductory course of lectures. In teaching a class as above, the Principal should first lay clearly before the students the plan of the lesson, and illustrate this plan by his method of teaching. He should also require them to take notes of his methods, and in the \"criticism\" hour these notes\nwill furnish a basis for many practical hints. In this way, (say) ten lectures, combined with illustrative teaching, may be given on the best method of teaching reading, arithmetic, spelling, and geography to a primary class. During this time the student-teachers should not be required to visit the different departments of the Public School for observation, as no person can observe intelligently, or with profit, until he has first some idea of the object to be attained by the teacher.\n\nIII. Teaching by Students.\u2014The student-teachers having observed and taken notes of the Principal's methods of teaching, are now prepared for actual teaching, as well as for more extended observation elsewhere. It will be well, therefore, during the second two or three weeks of the session to employ them in teaching a class as above, in the separate room used for the purpose, the subjects previously taught in their presence by the Principal.\n\nIV. Observation.\u2014The Principal should next prepare the student-teachers for taking observations in the different rooms set apart for training purposes. They should have learned at least by this time that no lesson can be well taught unless both the matter of the lesson and the method of presenting it to a class have been carefully considered.\n\nThe assistant teacher's should explain, in the presence of the student-teachers, the purpose and plan of the lesson to be taught, before they begin to teach. Attention should also be called to points in the progress of the lesson, and the work should be summarized at the close. The student-teachers should not be mere visitors in a room, but should observe methods of teaching and discipline. They must therefore be taught to observe intelligently.\n\nThe following hints on \"observation\" are suggested:\n\n1. Matter.\n\n(1) Whether suitable to the class; proper amount for one lesson; whether exercising observation, conception, reason or all of these.\n(2) Lesson\u2014whether bearing on one point; into what heads divided.\n\n(3) Whether in a lesson involving a moral lesson, the proper applications are made.\n\n2. Method.\n\n(1) Whether the purpose of a lesson was properly outlined at the beginning.\n\n(2) Whether the connection between the lesson and previous work was shown when possible.\n\n(3) Whether the error of telling too much was guarded against.\n\n(4) Whether good illustrations were used, specimens distributed, and diagrams drawn.\n\n(5) Whether appropriate and definite questions were given.\n\n(6) Whether the blackboard was used, and new terms written upon it.\n\n(7) Whether errors in answering were thoroughly corrected, and special attention given to pupils who were backward.\n\n(8) Whether pupils were allowed sufficient time to think.\n\n(9) Whether the attention of all the class was secured, or of only a few forward pupils.\n\n(10) Whether the lesson was properly summarized.\n\n3. The Class.\n\n(1) Whether respectful, attentive, interested, and, if so, how secured.\n\n(2) Whether pupils seemed weary, if so, why?\n\n(3) Whether likely to carry away the lesson as a whole.\nEach student should be required to enter his daily observations upon a sheet similar in form to that given below:\n\nName of assistant teacher........................\n\nDate...........................................\n\nSubject of lesson..................................\n\nNotes by student-teacher as follows:\u2014\n\n........................................................\n\n........................................................\n\n........................................................\n\n........................................................\n\nSignature of Student.\n\nThese \"observations\" should be submitted to the Principal for consideration during the \"criticism hour,\" who will find ample material in the notes made, and in the discussion of the more theoretical part of the course, such as \"management, discipline, organization,\" etc., to occupy all the time at his disposal.\n\nSecond Section of Term\u2014Three Weeks.\n\nObservation and Class Teaching.\u2014During this section of the term, one-half of each day should be spent by the students in the Model School room:\n\n1. In observing class teaching by the Principal.\n\n2. In class teaching before the Principal and their fellow-students.\n\n3. In criticisms. During the \"criticism hour\" the students should be required individually to read their notes with reasons, and all should be encouraged to express their opinions freely; the Principal directing the discussion and closing the criticisms.\nDuring the second half of the day the students should be engaged in observing teaching in the different rooms and taking notes. In order to secure uniformity and definiteness, the following form is recommended:\n\nReport of lesson on...........................................\n\nTaught by......................................................\n\nThe faults most worthy of notice were:\u2014\n\n1. Your position................................................\n\n2. The plan of lesson..........................................\n\n3. Your management..........................................\n\n4. Your language was.........................................\n\nfor instance.....................................................\n\n5. In energy you................................................\n\n6. Your mode of questioning was............................\n\nfor instance.....................................................\n\nBesides the above, other matters worthy of criticism should be reported.\n\nDate........... Assistant Teacher......................\n\nThe assistant teacher should make entries on the form during the progress of the lesson, and at the close hand it to the student-teacher, who should hold himself ready to be criticised on the points noted, by the Principal, whenever necessary. The marks assigned by the assistant teacher for the lesson should be given immediately after the lesson is concluded, and may be communicated to the student-teacher, at the option of the Principal. All lessons should be assigned to the student-teachers by the Principal, on consultation with the assistants in whose rooms the lessons are to be taught, and a record kept of each lesson in the Training Register, so as fairly to afford equal practice in every subject in the Public School curriculum.\nTHIRD SECTION OF TERM\u2014SEVEN WEEKS.\n\n1. Teaching by Students in the Divisions.\u2014The student-teacher having already seen the Principal teach a number of subjects; having taught the subjects himself under the direction and criticism of the Principal; having observed how classes are taught by the assistant teachers; and having some idea of the \"matter\" and \"method\" of a lesson, should now be able to take charge of a class in the subjects already illustrated. As preliminary to this step, the lesson to be taught should be assigned the previous day, and thoroughly prepared, the assistant teacher, with whose class the student is entrusted, should leave him as much as possible to his own resources, and should take notes for subsequent entry in the Training Register. Assistant teachers should not be reticent in reporting criticism, particularly if the work has been badly done. The criticism should be thorough, definite, just and kind.\n\n2. Number of Lessons to be taught by Students.\u2014It is desirable that not less than thirty lessons shall be taught by each student. By the course suggested, at least seven weeks will be available for teaching in the different divisions. Taking twenty students as the average number in a Model School, and allowing one half-hour lesson per day to each student, we have ten hours per day for teaching by the student. Taking four divisions as the number used for Model School purposes, with a senior and junior section in each division, we have eight classes for ten hours of teaching, or an average of one hour and a quarter for each class during each day for seven weeks. When the number of students exceeds twenty, more than four divisions should be used if possible. The students should be properly distributed among the different rooms, and while one teaches, the others will observe and take notes. Lessons by students should not immediately follow each other. It is also strongly recommended that the students assigned to a division should remain a week in one room. By this means the corrections made by the assistant teachers will be more effective, the students and the pupils will become better acquainted, there\nwill be less change, and consequently the regular work of the division will be less disturbed.\n\nFourth Section of Term\u2014One Week.\n\nReview and Examination.\u2014Students should not be required to do any school work during this week, but should be allowed to review the work of the term.\n\nSyllabus of Lectures.\n\nOpening Lecture by the Public School Inspector.\n\nIt is very desirable that the Inspector should be present at the opening of the Model School and address the students. In his address the following should be considered:\n\n(1) The importance of the teacher's work in the school room and in the school section.\n\n(2) His opportunities for doing good.\n\n(3) The need of giving proper attention to his health.\n\n(4) The need of availing himself of every means whereby he may rise in his profession.\n\n(5) Proper attention to the instructions given by the Principal of the Model School and by the assistants.\n\n(6) Careful attention to teaching witnessed by students.\n\n(7) Proper deportment during the session.\n\n(8) Preparation of lessons assigned.\n\n(9) Necessity for continuing his professional reading.\n\n(10) Reward of the faithful teacher.\nLECTURE I.\n\nCharacteristics of a Good Teacher.\n\n1. Mental Characteristics.\u20141. Professional spirit.\u20142. Sympathy.\u20143. Tact.\u20144. Earnestness.\u20145. Energy (not demonstrative).\u20146. Enthusiasm.\u20147. Hopefulness.\u20148. Patience.\u20149. Watchfulness.\u201410. Definiteness.\u201411. Thoroughness.\n\n2. Characteristics of Manner.\u20141. Quietness.\u20142. Cheerfulness.\u20143. Calmness.\u20144. Self-possession.\u20145. Uniformity of temper.\u20146. Politeness.\u20147. Kindness.\n\n3. Habits.\u20141. Speaking in a low tone.\u20142. Orderliness.\u20143. Punctuality.\u20144. Cleanliness.\u20145. Neatness.\n\nLECTURE II.\n\nPrimary Reading.\n\nI. There are two steps in learning to read well:\u2014\n\n(a) Word recognition.\n\n(b) Expressive reading.\n\nII. Methods of teaching reading.\u20141. Expressive reading can only be taught to junior pupils by giving them good examples for imitation. It should be taught to senior pupils by giving them proper rules for pausing, emphasis, inflection, etc.\n\n2. Word recognition may be taught by either of the following methods:\u2014\n\n(a) The alphabetic, or naming method.\n\n(b) The word, or \"Look and Say\" method.\n\n(c) The phonetic method.\n\n(d) The phonic method.\n3. The alphabetic method has been generally discarded, because in most cases the names of the letters in a word are in no sense suggestive of the sound of the word itself. The only plea urged for its use is that it teaches spelling, by compelling pupils to spell words before naming them. It does this only to a limited extent, and in direct opposition to the recognized rule that spelling should be taught by reading, instead of trying to teach reading by spelling.\n\n4. The phonetic method requires a new alphabet with a letter to represent each sound in the language, and is therefore impracticable with our present alphabet.\n\n5. The word, or \"look and say\" method gives the name of the whole word to the pupils. The objections to its use are:\n\n(a) It depends too much on the memory.\n(b) It does not make the pupils do independent work soon enough.\n(c) The pupils can make very little, if any, use of knowledge already gained in acquiring more.\n(d) It makes the pupil a receptive rather than a constructive agent.\n(e) It does not compel such scrutinizing inspection of words as to lead to correct spelling.\n\n6. If the English alphabet had but one sound for each letter and only one letter to represent each sound, the phonic method alone would be the best plan for teaching children to recognize new words. It gives the pupil the sound of the letters and trains him, first, to combine these sounds to form words; and secondly, to recognize new words by sounding the letters which form them.\n\n7. To avoid the mental confusion of children, teachers should use a perfectly self-consistent alphabet, with only one sound for each letter, during the first five or six weeks of a child's experience in learning to read. By using the short sounds only of the vowels a very large number of words may be formed.\n8. The Phonic, combined with the word method, will be found to lead to the best results in teaching word-recognition.\n\nIII. General Suggestions.\u20141. Use slates and the blackboard in teaching reading from the beginning.\n\n2. Let the pupils write script from the first.\n\n3. Teach the sounds of letters only as they are used. It is a great mistake to teach the alphabet as a whole, either by names or sounds, before putting these to a practical use.\n\n4. Pupils should not be allowed to try to read a sentence until they know all the words it contains.\n\n5. Simultaneous reading should only be allowed when the pupils are imitating the teacher, or when they are reciting something that has been committed to memory.\n\n6. Bright pupils are certain to engross most of the teacher's attention so long as they are in class. Dull pupils should get most teaching. In order to secure this result, when the new work of a lesson has been taught, give review test words or sentences, and let those who read them first go to their seats and work there.\n\n7. Backward pupils rely on those more advanced to lead them, and it is of the utmost importance that they should be compelled to make independent effort. It is therefore very much better to let the pupils whisper the new words or sentences to the teacher after he has written them on the black-board.\n\n8. Pupils should be required to do a great deal of word-building. The following are illustrations of an infinite variety of problems which may be assigned to them:\n\n(a) When they know the sounds of at, in, ing, on, etc., let them make as many new words as possible by prefixing letters to them.\n\n(b) Give them two consonants, one for the beginning and the other for the end of a series of words, and let them form words by writing vowels between them.\n(c) Give a single consonant, and let the pupils form as many words as they can, beginning or ending with it, and containing the number of letters fixed by the teacher.\n\n(d) Write a certain number of letters on the black-board and let the pupils form as many words as possible by using only these letters.\n\n(e) If the word method be used, it is a good plan to set the pupils to count at their seats how often certain words occur on a certain number of pages.\n\n9. Lessons in reading to primary classes should be brief and lively. Two fifteen minute lessons are much better than one lasting half an hour.\n\n10. Vary the method of conducting the lessons as much as possible.\n\n11. In order to correct or prevent the habit of sounding \"a\" and \"the\" separate from the words following them, let the pupils first use them in speaking of some object held by the teacher. He holds up a book, for instance, and the pupils say correctly and naturally \"a book,\" or \"the book.\" They will do so without fail. Then these words should be written on the black-board, and repeated by the class, the teacher pointing alternately to the object and to the written words. It is also a good plan to join such words, as well as adjuncts, by bracketing them when they are written on the black-board.\n\nLecture III.\n\nLanguage Lessons.\n\nThis subject should form a part of the every-day work in the school-room. It should precede the study of grammar. Correct forms of speech must be placed before the pupils. Induce pupils to speak freely. Talk with them rather than to them.\nOrder of teaching.\u20141. Place some familiar object, as a chair, before the class.\n\n2. Ask pupils to name the object, and tell its use.\n\n3. To name its parts.\n\n4. To describe the different parts, or tell something about them.\n\n5. To tell the use of the different parts, etc.\n\nHints.\u20141. Require answers in the form of a sentence.\n\n2. Do not criticize answers.\n\n3. Give correct form, write it on the board, and require class to repeat several times.\n\n4. If pupils cannot form correct sentences, aid them by suitable questions.\n\n5. Endeavour to form correct ideas in the pupils' minds, and then require these ideas to be properly expressed.\n\n6. Take subjects with which the pupils are familiar.\n\n7. In receiving oral answers distinct articulation and correct pronunciation should be required.\n\n8. Answers should frequently be written on the slate.\n\n9. In written answers proper attention should be given to capitals, periods and interrogation marks.\n\nSubjects for lessons.\u2014The different objects in the school-room. Colour, form, size, weight, etc. Animals, plants and minerals.\n\nSpecimens or pictures should always be placed before the class.\nLECTURE IV.\n\nComposition.\n\nPrimary objects.\u20141. Correct and free use of language.\n2. Correction of common errors of speech.\n3. To increase the pupils' knowledge and use of words.\n4. Variety of expression.\n5. Cultivation of observation, perception, memory, and imagination.\n\nCautions.\u20141. Ideas must precede words.\n2. Objects and subjects must be furnished to evoke the various powers of the mind, and the pupil must be taught how to accumulate, arrange, and express his ideas connected with them, and finally how to criticize the whole.\n3. First exercises must be very simple and constantly repeated.\n4. They must be carefully graded.\n5. Errors must be corrected, but not criticized at first.\n6. Do not expect too much.\n\nThe following outline of lessons is suggested:\n\nFirst Class.\u20141. Elementary language lessons in this class will serve as preparatory work for the teaching of oral and written compositions.\n2. Correction of colloquial errors.\n\nSecond Class.\u20141. Systematic drill in the correction of colloquial errors; no reasons should be given.\n2. Oral and written descriptions of actions and of objects.\n3. Recital of the story in the reading lesson by paragraphs, and as a whole.\n\n4. Letter-writing of the simplest kind, giving special attention to form of opening and closing.\n\nThird Class.\u20141. Correction of colloquial errors continued.\n\n2. Continual training in polite, courteous forms of speech.\n\n3. Elliptical exercises to teach the correct use of saw, seen, did, done, went, gone, etc.\n\n4. Oral and written reproduction of short stories, and subject of reading lessons.\n\n5. Letter-writing.\n\n6. Simple business forms, accounts, and receipts, separate and combined, order for goods, order for money, promissory note, negotiable and non-negotiable.\n\nFourth Class.\u20141. Elliptical exercises to teach the correct use of such words as may, can, shall, will, would, should, lie, lay, laid, rise, raise, come, came, sit, sat, set, etc.\n\n2. Oral and written reproductions of stories and lessons on animals and plants.\n\n3. Transposition of stanzas of poetry in prose.\n\n4. Biographical and historical sketches, oral and in writing.\n\n5. Letter-writing.\n\n6. Business forms, notes payable on demand, at bank, joint, and several, with and without interest, drafts payable at sight, at time after sight, at time after date, etc.\n\nFifth Class.\u20141. Changing passages from the direct to the indirect order, and from the grammatical to the rhetorical order, and vice versa. (See Morrison, pp. 75 to 87.)\n\n2. Elliptical exercises, Morrison, pp. 88\u201391.\n3. Analytic and synthetic exercises in narrative composition. Morrison, pp. 111-127.\n\n4. Abstracts of reading lessons.\n\n5. Paraphrasing.\n\n6. Business correspondence.\n\n---\n\nLECTURE V.\n\nGrammar.\n\n1. Develop a sentence on black-board.\n\n2. Develop the idea of subject and predicate.\n\n3. Teach the use of words and of phrases in the sentence.\n\n4. Group words and phrases around subject and predicate. (Slate exercise.)\n\n5. Classification of words according to use in sentence.\n\n6. Names of these classes, i.e., of the parts of speech.\n\n7. Definitions of ditto.\n\n8. Sub-divisions and inflections of do. in the same order:\u2014example, use, comparison with others, classification, name, definition, or rule.\n\nNo analysis of a sentence should be attempted until the teacher is certain the pupils understand the meaning of the sentence as a whole, and of all the words and phrases. The analysis of complex sentences should be developed from simple sentences, and pupils should be required to change a complete sentence into a simple sentence and vice versa. Great care should be taken to guard against merely mechanical analysis.\nLECTURE VI.\n\nSpelling.\n\nI. How Spelling is Learned.\u20141. Pupils learn to spell through the eye.\n\n2. Correct spelling depends upon seeing with precision.\n\n3. Spelling is learned through reading.\n\n4. The ear may aid in spelling words spelled phonetically, but the eye alone is the best means of learning to spell. (Deaf mutes spell accurately.)\n\nII. How Spelling is Taught.\u20141. As correct spelling depends on accurate seeing, the great aim of the teacher should be to train the pupils to look definitely at all parts of the words.\n\n2. Young pupils should copy largely from primers and from the black-board.\n\n3. Transcription is the best means for committing a spelling lesson to memory, as it compels the most careful and scrutinizing examination of the words.\n\n4. Pupils should never see words incorrectly spelled.\n\nIII. Testing Spelling Classes.\u20141. There are two methods, oral and written. (Although spelling has to be learned through the eye, a knowledge of spelling may be shown orally.)\n\n2. As spelling has to be used practically by writing words, it is undoubtedly best to test spelling classes by making them write the lessons assigned.\n\n3. Writing a word impresses its form much more than spelling it orally.\n\nIV. Examining Spelling Lessons.\u20141. In review lessons and in small classes the teachers should correct the lessons.\n2. Pupils may exchange slates, and mark the words wrongly spelled, the teacher spelling the words slowly.\n\n3. Pupils may retain their own slates, and the teacher may call on different pupils to spell the words orally. Those who agree with the spelling given must indicate this by raising their hands before the teacher decides as to its correctness.\n\n4. Slates may be exchanged and the corrections made as in No. 3.\n\n5. While the teacher writes the correct spelling on the black-board, each pupil may correct his own work, and slates or books will then be exchanged for revision only.\n\nNote.\u2014In all cases when slates are exchanged the pupil owning the slate should have the right to appeal against the marking done by his neighbour.\n\nV. Correcting Errors.\u20141. Each pupil should write the words he misses five times to impress their correct forms on his memory.\n\n2. It is better that he should write these words once a day for five days than five times on the same day.\n\n3. He should keep a list of his errors at the end of his dictation book, and copy it occasionally.\n\n4. From these lists the teacher should prepare review lessons.\n\nVI. General Suggestions.\u20141. The teacher should articulate clearly and pronounce correctly when giving words for spelling.\n\n2. Only one trial should be allowed in oral spelling.\n\n3. In oral spelling, the divisions into syllables should be marked by a slight pause.\n\n4. Spelling should be taught to a considerable extent by means of composition, in order to give pupils practice in spelling their own vocabularies.\nLECTURE VII.\n\nElementary Arithmetic.\n\nPRELIMINARY REMARKS.\n\n1. Arithmetic is taught for the sake of its (a) value in discipline, (b) value as knowledge, i.e., its utility in the affairs of life.\n\n2. To secure these values as thoroughly as possible, all arithmetical study is to be a training in thinking; all merely mechanical work is to be banished. There must indeed be mechanical drill, but this must be founded on intuitions (from material objects).\n\n3. For this training in thinking, systematic training in Mental Arithmetic, from first to last, is absolutely indispensable; and, therefore, so far as Arithmetic is concerned, the principal task of the teacher in the Public School is to practise the children in Mental Arithmetic.\n\n4. At each and every stage Mental Arithmetic must precede, and lead up to Written Arithmetic.\n\n5. In every stage abstract and applied calculations are to go together; e.g., when a pupil has learned (say) through intuition the combinations of five, he is to be practised in \"practical problems,\" involving familiar things of life.\n\n6. In mental work, rapidity, correct language, and logical order of thought and statement must be constantly aimed at.\n\n7. In Mental Arithmetic it is desirable that the teacher should follow the sequence of some book. Otherwise the \"course\" is likely to be without logical method; desultory problems are of but little use in mental training. At the outset children need no book; when they have advanced to division, and its applications (\"analysis\"), they may prepare assigned lessons in some text-book. But a book supplies only type-questions; many similar questions should be framed by teacher and pupils.\n\n8. In Mental Arithmetic there should be frequent written examinations, as well as oral.\nA.\u2014First Stage\n\n1. The numbers 1 to 10, inclusive, taught intuitively by Number-Pictures and by counting\u2014these \"pictures\" being presented through (a) dots or points on black-board, slate, etc., (b) arrangement of balls of abacus, (c) arrangement of cubes, etc., used as counters. Picture-Numbers are to be used because the intuition of a number of objects in a group is comparatively easy if there is a symmetrical arrangement, e.g., the conception of five is easier from this arrangement * * * than from this * * * * *\n\n2. On the principal which underlies the law of repetition, it will in general be well to make more than one presentation of a Number-Picture, e.g., of five: \u2014* *, * *, * *, * *, * *.\n\n3. Practice is to be had in all the combinations of the several numbers (see table below); and every number is to be mastered before the next number is taken up. This means (a) the addition of pairs of numbers, by Number-Pictures in various ways (see above), and by \"practical problems,\" (b) subtraction or the resolution of numbers into pairs by similar means, (c) the multiplication and division (exact) of pairs, as e.g., three times two are six; the twos in six are three.\n\nNote.\u2014(a) May be left till the combinations of 20 are learned. Practise in counting backward and forward.\n\n4. Practise in the corresponding written exercises as soon as the children have mastered the mental processes.\n\nNote.\u2014The above points are to be kept in view in teaching every number and its combinations and partitions till ten has been well mastered.\n\nB.\u2014Second Stage.\n\nThe numbers 11 to 20 inclusive, to be taught intuitively, all the steps given in the first stage being followed. This includes especially\u2014\n\n(1) Practice in the addition of two numbers whose sum is not greater than twenty; see table given below. Practical problems as before.\n(2) Subtraction. Practical problems.\n\n(3) The multiplication and division of numbers within the above-named limits. This practice means\u2014\n\n(a) The multiplication table of numbers from 1 to 20; this supposes (as before) much \"drill,\" but drill grounded on intuitions.\n\n(b) Division of the products obtained in (a) by an abstract divisor; (b) division in the sense of distribution, the converse of the operation in (a); in (a) the factors are given and the product is to be found; in (b) the product is given and the factors are to be found. It cannot be too often repeated that these processes are to be rendered visible\u2014there must be intuitions through number-pictures.\n\n(c) Measurement of the products of the multiplication table, i.e., division in the sense of being contained in; e.g., 2 is contained in 4, 6, 8, etc.\n\n(4) Practice in the corresponding written exercises as soon as the children have mastered the processes mentally.\n\nThe following table, which exhibits all combinations of numbers from 1 to 20, shows substantially the work to be done in these two stages, and is fundamentally the basis of all combinations.\n\n**Table of Combinations of Numbers from 1 to 20.**\n\n|   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|\n| 1 | 1+1 | 2+1 | 3+1 | 4+1 | 5+1 | 6+1 | 7+1 | 8+1 | 9+1 |\n|   | 1+2 | 2+2 | 3+2 | 4+2 | 5+2 | 6+2 | 7+2 | 8+2 |\n| 11 | 1+3 | 2+3 | 3+3 | 4+3 | 5+3 | 6+3 | 7+3 |\n|   | 1+4 | 2+4 | 3+4 | 4+4 | 5+4 | 6+4 |\n| 10+1 | 1+5 | 2+5 | 3+5 | 4+5 | 5+5 |\n|   | 1+6 | 2+6 | 3+6 | 4+6 |\n| 9+2 | 1+7 | 2+7 | 3+7 |\n| 8+3 | 1+8 | 2+8 |\n| 7+4 | 1+9 |\n| 6+5 | 2+9 |\n| 5+6 | 3+9 |\n| 4+7 | 4+9 |\n| 3+8 | 5+9 |\n| 2+9 | 6+9 |\n| 1+10 | 7+9 |\n| 2+10 | 8+9 |\n| 3+10 | 9+9 |\n| 4+10 | 10+9 |\n| 5+10 | 10+10 |\n1. The upper part of the table gives the combinations of the numbers to ten inclusive; the lower part, the combinations of the numbers from 11 to 20 inclusive. The ways of forming are:\u20144 and 1, 3 and 2, 2 and 3, 1 and 4. In all there are 100 combinations, and no more.\n\n2. Each of these combinations is to be visibly represented by NUMBER-PICTURES, as suggested in (A, 1). Each picture will be formed from the immediately preceding one by the addition of a single point, and will be made up of elements previously mastered, e.g.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\n1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n* & * & * & *\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n3. As already suggested, slightly different pictures of the same number will be given, e.g.:\u2014for 3, \\[*\\ *\\ *\\]; for 4, \\[*\\ *\\ *\\ *\\]; for 5, \\[*\\ *\\ *\\ *\\ *\\]; etc. From 5 \\[*\\ *\\ *\\], we get 6\u2014\\[*\\ *\\ *\\]; from 6 we get 7\u2014\\[*\\ *\\ *\\ *\\]; etc.\n\n4. (a) This table includes the usual forms:\u20141 plus 2, 3, 4, etc.; 2 plus 1, 2, 3, etc.; 3 plus 1, 2, 3, etc.\n\n(b) It is applicable to the higher combinations of numbers, e.g., take those of 5; 4+1 leads to 14+1, 24+1, etc.; 2+3 leads to 2+13, 2+23, 2+33, etc.\n\nNote.\u2014Call attention to the fact that thirteen is three-teen, i.e., 3 and ten; fourteen, 4 and ten, etc.\n\nC.\u2014Third Stage.\n\n1. The genesis of numbers from 1 to 100, inclusive\u2014the method of intuitions being followed as in the preceding stages.\n\n2. Make the pupil familiar with combinations of tens as units; e.g., as in the combinations of five, 4 tens+1 ten; this by visible and tangible objects. Call attention to the fact that thirty is 3 tens; forty is four-ty, i.e., 4 tens, etc.\n\n3. Teach the intermediate numbers, e.g., 21=2 tens+1; 22=2 tens+2, etc.; 31=3 tens+1, 32=3 tens+2. Give\npractice in counting backwards and forwards. Give notation and numeration to 100, inclusive.\n\n4. Give practice in the addition of a number of one digit to one of two digits; the higher number to be exhibited as so many tens and units. Form series of numbers, e.g., give two or three terms, and have the children continue the series, as 12, 14, 16, etc.; 9, 12, 15, etc.; 21, 25, 29, etc.\n\n5. Practice in the subtraction of a number of one digit from one of two digits. As in the preceding exercises, intuition is necessary, especially in such cases as 43\u20147, 62\u20149, etc.\n\n6. Practise the multiplication table till the pupils have obtained a ready knowledge of it, but, in every instance, give by intuition a clear insight into the meaning of each combination; e.g., the meaning of 4 times 7 is 28, must be made perfectly clear by means of the \"ball-frame,\" etc. But this clear insight being had, drill till the children can give the combinations with scarcely an effort of thought.\n\nIn written work the order should be (a) multiplication by a number of one digit; (b) do. by 10; (c) do. by a multiple of 10; (d) do. by a number formed of units and tens.\n\n7. Give practice in the division of the products of the multiplication table (as in Stage B, 1 b), (a), by an abstract divisor, i.e., division in the sense of distribution; and (b), measurements of the products, i.e., division in the sense of being contained in. In written work the order will be (a), division by a number of one digit; (b), by 10; (c), by a multiple of 10; (d), by a number consisting of tens and units.\n\n8. The children are now prepared to deal formally with (a), the factors of a number; (b), the factors common to two or more numbers; (c), the G. C. F., of do.; and (a) with the multiples of a number; (b), a multiple of two or more numbers, and (c), the L. C. M. of two or more numbers.\n\nThe course of work above exhibited shows, in the main, the whole course of instruction in elementary arithmetic, and constitutes the basis of all subsequent work. Unless, therefore, the work outlined has been thoroughly mastered, subsequent progress will be uncertain and unsatisfactory.\nD.\u2014Fourth Stage.\n\nThis stage is mainly a continuation of the preceding stages, which cover the ground of the first seven sections of Mental Arithmetic, Pt. I. Details, therefore, are not necessary. A few hints may be noted.\n\n1. Children must understand the value of numbers before they use them. This is the fundamental principle in the preceding stages, in which intuition has the first place. In Stage D, when intuition is no longer expedient, the numbers should be clearly analyzed into hundreds, tens, units, etc.\n\n2. In written work with larger numbers\u2014i.e., numbers too large for mental operations, note the following points:\n\n(a) Avoid working with very large numbers. Don't waste nervous force in drudgery. Long mechanical operations, especially of multiplication with large factors, have little practical value. Who needs to multiply millions by millions, or even hundreds of thousands? Instead of questions involving hosts of figures, give many questions of moderate length and aim at accuracy and rapidity.\n\n(b) To prevent mere mechanical drudgery, and to awaken the interest which grows out of intelligence, every process must be thoroughly explained.\n\n(c) As already implied, in mental work insist on good language and logical and concise order of statement; in written work aim at neatness, accuracy, rapidity.\n\n(d) Some of the tables of weights, measures and money will of course be mastered, and use made of them in \"Practical Problems.\"\n\nE.\u2014Fifth Stage.\u2014Fractional Arithmetic.\n\nI. Vulgar; II. Decimal.\n\nNote.\u2014Vulgar fractions form a principal subject in Mental Arithmetic. Both from common experience and from operations in the preceding stages, the children have become familiar with some of the ideas and nomenclature of Fractional Arithmetic. The formal and systematic instruction is now to begin. Give the notation as soon as the conceptions are clearly gained.\n1. Begin with the now familiar idea of the division of a number into equal parts, the underlying principal in all teaching of fractions. Show, e.g., that to divide 6 by 3 is to obtain one of the three equal parts that compose 6. Show that \"to take one-third of 6\" is the same as \"to divide 6 by three;\" there is a change of name, but no change of idea or of operation. Give practice in finding $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{3}$, $\\frac{1}{4}$, $\\frac{1}{5}$, etc., of a number.\n\n2. Lead to the facts that a number has two halves, three thirds, four fourths, etc.\n\n3. The children have already learned that twice one unit of any kind, is two units of the same kind; three times one unit of any kind is three units of the same kind, etc. They are, therefore, now prepared to find $\\frac{2}{3}$, $\\frac{3}{4}$, $\\frac{4}{5}$, etc., of a number; e.g., they find one-third of 6 to be 2, and therefore two-thirds of 6 to be 4.\n\n4. Lead to the fact that thus to take (e.g.) $\\frac{3}{4}$ of a number is the same as to take one-quarter of three times the number, i.e., to divide 3 times the number by 4. Lead to the facts that 3 lbs. divided by four is 12 ounces, etc.\n\n5. Show that $\\frac{1}{2}$ of a number = $\\frac{1}{4}$ of it = $\\frac{1}{8}$ of it; that $\\frac{1}{3}$ of a number = $\\frac{1}{9}$ of it, etc.; and that $\\frac{1}{4}$ of a number = $\\frac{1}{16}$ of it, etc.\n\n6. Now proceed to show that not only a number but also a single thing may be divided into equal parts. Base the instruction on intuitions, by a divided line, rectangle, or other concrete object. Apply the ideas developed in 2, 3, 4, 5, above.\n\n7. Show (a) how to change whole numbers into the form of a fraction; (b) how inexact division gives rise to a mixed number; and (c) conversely how a mixed number may be changed into an indicated division, i.e., an \"improper fraction.\"\n\n8. Use ideas of 5, above, to show how to change fractions with different denominators into fractions having a \"common denominator.\"\n9. Addition and subtraction.\n\n10. Multiplication and division.\n\nFor methods and type-questions, see chapter on fractions in Mental Arithmetic.\n\nII.\u2014Decimal Fractions.\n\nThe teaching in Decimal Fractions follows the order observed in vulgar fractions, so that every \"rule\" in decimals finds its explanation and demonstration in the corresponding rule in vulgar fractions. Guard against the rule-of-thumb work; explain every process.\n\nNote.\u2014While special stress has been laid on the necessity of beginning with intuitions for the acquisition and development of the first conceptions in the several stages, it is very desirable that the pupils should pass as soon as possible to the abstract and the general.\n\nF.\u2014Sixth Stage.\n\nApplication of the foregoing to analysis and to \"Commercial Arithmetic.\"\n\nThe unitary method, which has been followed in the simple analysis of the previous stages, is to be followed here. It is to be applied to\n\n1. Solution of \"Rule of Three,\" problems.\n2. \"Simple Interest.\"\n3. \"Profit and Loss in all its \"cases.\"\n4. Other percentage problems.\n5. Proportional parts and Partnership.\n6. Averages.\n7. General analysis.\n\nFor methods and type-questions under these heads see Mental Arithmetic Part II., and last chapter of Part I.\n\nNote.\u2014In this stage the fundamental principles of ratio and proportion, with applications, may be given.\nLECTURE VIII.\n\nGeography.\n\nPART I.\n\nI. Introductory lessons on place, to explain.\u20141. Use of, on, around, above, below, beneath, under, etc.\n\n2. Use of terms right, left, middle, centre, corner, etc.\n\n3. Necessity for a standard of distance using:\n   (a) Measurements in the school-room, inch, foot, yard.\n   (b) Representations on a scale of the top of the desk or table with the places of a few objects marked.\n\nThese lessons will prepare pupils for use of maps.\n\nII. Lessons on animals and plants.\u20141. That live on land, in water, fly through the air.\n\n2. That live in hot parts of the earth, in cold parts, in forests, in deserts, in plains, on mountains.\n\nIII. Stories and reading lessons about people who live in other countries.\u20141. What kind of homes; what they wear, what they eat, what they do, etc.\n\nIV.\u2014General knowledge to be gained from observation.\u20141. Of land and water, and uses of each.\n\n2. Of air\u2014all around.\n\n3. Of sun, moon and stars, light and heat.\n\n4. Of division of time\u2014hour, day, week, night, etc.\n\n5. Of the seasons\u2014spring, summer, etc.\n\n6. Of the terms circle, diameter, circumference, sphere, hemisphere (to be learned from drawing and form lessons).\n\nPART II.\n\nI. Lead pupils by suitable illustrations to a conception of the earth.\u2014Great ball, moving in the air, around the sun, lighted by the sun, surface of land and water, shape, flat appearance, size, motions and results, axis, poles, equator,\nII. By means of maps and blackboard drawings teach natural features of the earth's surface.\u20141. Begin with most striking.\n\n2. Observe, describe, name:\n   (a) Forms of land\u2014coast or shore, continent, island, etc.\n   (b) Forms of water\u2014ocean, sea, gulf, etc.\n\nIII. General topography of earth's surface, with special reference to continents and oceans.\u2014Their positions, relative sizes, boundaries, etc.; using map of the world.\n\nPART III.\n\nI. Principal land and water forms and political divisions of a single continent\u2014\n\n1. Blackboard chiefly to be used, maps for reference.\n2. Pupils reproduce on slates or blackboard.\n3. Pupils draw on slates from maps placed before them.\n4. New names to be written upon the board and copied by pupils.\n\nPART IV.\n\nI. Physical features.\u2014(a) Water-basins, general shape, outlet, etc.\n   (b) Mountains or ridges which bound them.\n\n1. Climate of different parts, and how affected.\n2. Character of different animals, including man, as affected by climate.\n3. Different plants as affected by climate.\n4. Minerals, where found and why.\n5. Occupations of the people in different parts, and why.\n6. Exports and imports.\n7. Language, religion and form of government.\n8. Manufacturing and commercial centres.\n\nThe political divisions may next be taken up. Other continents in the same way.\nLECTURE IX.\n\nObject Lessons.\n\nI. Aims.\u20142. The primary aim is to develop all the child's faculties by employing them properly in gaining knowledge. The ability to acquire knowledge is better than the possession of knowledge.\n\nThe secondary aims are:\u2014\n\n(a) To correct, extend and apply the child's vocabulary.\n\n(b) To give the child additional knowledge.\n\nNote.\u2014Knowledge must not be given to children ready-made. One of the most common blunders is to regard object lessons as mere information lessons. Knowledge should be communicated incidentally in object teaching.\n\nII. Method of Teaching Object Lessons.\u20141. It is absolutely essential that every pupil shall investigate independently.\n\n2. Every pupil should have a specimen, if possible.\n\n3. As soon as possible (say in the Senior First Book classes), each pupil should write down the results of his investigations.\n\n4. The teacher should guide the class in making their investigations, by asking such questions as:\u2014\n\n(a) What can you learn by looking at this object? by feeling it? by smelling it? etc., etc., thus giving a training in the intelligent use of the means of acquiring knowledge, or:\u2014\n\n(b) By writing a scheme on the blackboard, such as:\u2014\n\nExamine your object and tell me its form, size, colour, weight, etc., etc. This gives a training in the systematic classification of knowledge.\n\nWith complex objects, leaves, etc., attention should be directed to one part at a time.\n\n5. In lessons on form, direction, etc., the pupils should draw the forms and lines. Making a perpendicular line once will impress its character on the mind of the pupils more definitely than ten repetitions of a definition.\n\n6. Drawing should be very largely used by the pupils in\ndescribing the parts of objects in Natural History and Botany. To draw a thing the child must examine it with scrutinizing care.\n\n7. It is a great mistake to think that showing an object to a class and giving some interesting facts relating to its origin, manufacture, etc., is teaching an \"object lesson.\" General information lessons are good, but they are no more like genuine object lessons than reading lessons are.\n\n8. Insist on full statements from the pupils in answering. It is more important in object lessons than in any other subject.\n\n9. Advancement should be made very slowly in an object lesson. Investigations with a view to discovery must be made slowly even by experienced adults. Accuracy and not speed should be the aim.\n\n10. While the great aim of object teaching undoubtedly is to strengthen the observant faculties, the faculties that use knowledge should be developed as well as those that gain knowledge. Comparison, judgment, memory, language, and the power to make a practical application of knowledge should be developed gradually from the first lesson.\n\n11. Many teachers err by trying to lead their pupils to discover things outside their stage of mental development.\n\n12. When any quality, or form, or power has been discovered by the pupils as belonging to the object under examination, let the range of its application be extended at once, by calling on the class for the names of other things possessing the same quality, form, power, etc.\n\n13. It is necessary to distinguish very clearly between object teaching and object illustration. In object teaching, the object itself is studied; in object illustration, the object represents something else. An apple may be used to illustrate the meaning of a fraction, and then it is merely representative of a unit or its parts. As the subject of an object lesson, the apple is studied as to its form, parts, construction, etc.; where the seeds are situated, how they are protected, why they are so protected, etc., etc.\n\nNote.\u2014True object teaching should not be confined to \"object lessons.\"\n14. It is an excellent practice to assign an object for home study occasionally. The results of the children's investigations should of course be reported on paper.\n\n15. One of the simplest methods for inducing young children to study nature in her processes as well as her results, is to place peas or other seeds in a glass containing water, so that the students may watch the stages of growth.\n\nLECTURE X.\n\nHistory.\n\nI.\u2014Aims in Teaching History.\u20141. To show the nature and value of historical knowledge.\n\n2. To guide pupils in finding its treasures.\n\nII. Method of Teaching History.\u20141. Topical better than chronological.\n\n2. Classify events in connection with the great departments of national life instead of associating them merely with the reigns of monarchs.\n\n3. Topics: Dr. Arnold suggests, \"race, language, institutions, and religion.\" The history of most countries may be subdivided into (a) wars, civil and foreign; (b) the constitution; (c) the church; (d) progress of the people, commercially, socially, educationally; (e) literature; (f) notable people.\n\nIII. Plan of Teaching History.\u20141. In one lesson give a general sketch of the whole history to be taught, and divide it into its great development periods, fixing the date of the commencement of each period.\n\n2. Teach the history of each period, beginning with the first.\n\n3. Teach independently the events connected with each topic.\n\n4. Sketch the history connected with each topic successively through all the periods, after having taught each period independently.\n5. Show the advantages of this plan (a) in giving connected ideas regarding the progress made in each department of national life, (b) in facilitating the remembrance of historical facts in their relation to their effects; and (c) in affording natural and incidental reviews of the history already taught.\n\nIV. Training Pupils to Study History.\u20141. This is the most important of the teacher\u2019s duties in dealing with this subject. History should be learned chiefly after school life has ended.\n\n2. Assigning lessons wisely is the means for training to study.\n\n3. Do not assign answers (notes) to be committed to memory.\n\n4. Assign questions, and let pupils prepare answers by reading their histories.\n\n5. All questions should not relate merely to isolated facts or dates.\n\n6. They should compel a comparison of facts and exercise the pupils\u2019 judgment.\n\n7. A good outline or plan of the lesson is better than questions for advanced classes.\n\nV. General Suggestions.\u20141. Chronology is not history.\n\n2. Epoch men and women should receive a large share of attention.\n\n3. Striking scenes and great events should be vividly pictured to awaken interest.\n\n4. Pupils should write historical abstracts and biographical sketches for compositions.\n\nLECTURE XI.\n\nWriting.\n\nThe following method is recommended:\u2014\n\nI. Illustrate on the blackboard\u2014\n\n(a) The formation of the elements or formative lines entering into any letter, and the mode of combining these lines either angularly or by shorter turns.\n(b) The slant of the main and the connecting lines.\n(c) The relative width of each letter and of its parts.\n(d) The relative height of the different letters, viz.:\u2014body, stem and loop letters.\n\nII. Make a well-formed letter upon the blackboard as a type or model, and then make a number of imperfectly formed ones, intended to illustrate anticipated faults. Ask pupils to point out faults as to shape of elements; junction of parts; width between parts or between letters; relative height or length of parts. Ask pupils to suggest the mode of correction; pupils failing, teacher should give the necessary aid and show them how to avoid similar errors.\n\nIII. Teach pupils how to combine (a) several letters of the same kind; (b) several letters of different kinds; lead pupils to observe the horizontal space occupied by each letter when thus combined. Impress the subject of letter-spacing upon the mind by a lively concert drill, several pupils writing on blackboard while others are writing on slates or on paper.\n\nIV. Let each letter be introduced by a criticism of the faults seen in letters occurring in the lesson, made then and there, either by teacher or by a few pupils.\n\nV. The order in which the small letters should be taught is somewhat as follows:\u2014\n\n(a) i, u, v, n, m, w, x.\n(b) o, e, c, s, r.\n(c) a, d, g, q, t, p.\n(d) b, l, h, k, f, j, y, z.\n\nVI. Pay due attention to position of body, pen and paper while writing, and let each copy or writing lesson be supplemented with suitable exercises on practice-paper to secure freedom of execution.\nMusic.\n\nFollow the course indicated in the Public School Reader.\n\nTeach the students as a class of children, supposing them to know nothing of the subject.\n\nSpend four to six lessons on the work suggested on pages V. and VI., before taking up \"Singing at Sight.\"\n\nContinue weekly practice of breathing exercises throughout the term.\n\nDo not try to teach the students all the songs and exercises. Select a few in each key, then proceed to the next, so that a general idea of all the work in the First Reader may be obtained in the necessarily limited time.\n\nIn nearly all classes of adults beginning the study of vocal music some will be found who have defective voices, or very little sense of pitch. In these cases the teacher should encourage the student to not only enter heartily into the work but make an effort by special practice to overcome the difficulty.\n\nDuring the first part of the term it will be advisable to occasionally give short lessons, in the presence of the students, to classes of children from the Model School. This is desirable for the purpose of demonstrating the practicability of the system, and to show how interesting the study of music may be made to children.\n\nTwo months should be sufficient to go over the work contained in the First Reader.\n\nThe remainder of the session should be devoted to practice lessons by the student, criticism on such lessons, and a short review.\n\nDrill and Calisthenics.\n\nI. Benefits.\u20141. To the health.\n2. To the figure.\n3. Improved carriage.\n4. Aid in discipline.\nII. Rules for Teaching.\u20141. Apply the same principles as in teaching any other subject.\n\n2. Objective illustration is better than the most accurate verbal explanations.\n\n3. Repeating the words of a drill book to a class is not better teaching than repeating the words of a grammar would be.\n\n4. Study the words carefully to learn precisely what the movements are, but teach chiefly by action and not by words.\n\n5. When you have done one step of a motion or exercise before the pupils, question them closely about what you have done, before they attempt to imitate you.\n\n6. Do or describe only one step in a motion or exercise at a time, and do not pass on until that step has been performed correctly.\n\n7. It is of paramount importance that errors should be carefully corrected; absolute accuracy at the beginning will save much trouble afterwards.\n\n8. Errors may best be corrected by doing the motion in both the right and the wrong way, and asking the pupils to describe the difference between them.\n\n9. Be prompt, decided and energetic in conducting drill and calisthenic exercises.\n\n10. Speak in a loud tone, but not in a high key, in giving commands.\n\n11. It is of great importance to be accurate and uniform in giving the words of command.\n\nAll light calisthenic exercises should be done in time with singing.\n\nDRAWING.\n\nI. Kind.\u2014Industrial.\n\nII. Advantages.\u20141. Cultivation of the taste.\n\n2. Training of the hand.\n3. Training of the mental powers, observation, comparison, etc.\n\n4. Practical utility in every walk of life.\n\nIII. How to begin to teach drawing.\u20141. Begin with the principles of symmetry, and teach them objectively.\n\n2. This may be done analytically or synthetically; analytically by showing a small piece of oilcloth or carpet, and allowing the pupils to find the parts that correspond in shape and colour; synthetically by making patterns with different kinds of leaves or other objects (four of each kind), and placing those of the same kind in opposite positions with the stems toward the centre. (These patterns may be made before a class by fastening the leaves, etc., to a piece of board with small tacks. It is best to place a small round object, a flower for instance, in the centre.) The great fundamental law of symmetry, or harmony of opposites, is thus learned very easily.\n\n3. Let pupils form patterns by laying leaves, small flowers, etc., etc., on their desks, and making the opposite parts with similar leaves, etc. (The roadside will supply plenty of material for this objective work.)\n\n4. Let them copy on their slates, with pencils, the simple patterns they make with objects.\n\n5. Show how they may fill a square with such symmetrical patterns.\n\n6. In drawing such patterns let junior pupils use for construction, or guide lines, small squares checkered over the large one in faint lines.\n\n7. Vary the position of the square (a) diameter upright; (b) diagonal upright; (c) two concentric squares one with diameter upright, the other with diagonal upright, etc., and let the pupils fill each time with symmetrical patterns.\n\n8. When sufficient time has been devoted to the square, show how to make other geometrical figures, and how to fill them with symmetrical patterns. Be sure to explain new geometrical figures, only when you need to use them.\n\nNote.\u2014This work should be done on slates, by pupils in First and Second Books, and beyond this the teacher should be guided by the books recommended by the Education Department.\nTHE ART OF QUESTIONING.\n\nI. According to the purpose for which they are used, questions are:\n   1. Tentative or preliminary.\n   2. Teaching or developing (Socratic).\n   3. Testing in (a) repeating, (b) recalling, (c) reviewing.\n\nII. According to the method of asking them, questions may be divided into:\n   1. Those requiring simultaneous answers.\n   2. Those requiring individual answers.\n   3. Elliptical; sentences with parts omitted, to be filled in by the pupils.\n   4. Suggestive; indicating the answer by form or inflection.\n   5. Alternative; answered by \"yes\" or \"no,\" \"old\" or \"young,\" \"large\" or \"small,\" etc.\n\n   NOTE.\u2014Classes 3, 4 and 5 should be used sparingly. Simultaneous answers may be used in repeating, or recalling, and then chiefly in connection with elliptical and alternative questions.\n\nIII. Rules for questioning:\u2014\n   1. Do not ask questions in rotation.\n   2. Do not name the pupil who is to answer a question until after it has been stated.\n   3. Do not indicate by pointing, looking, or in any other way, which pupil has to be called up to answer a question until after it has been stated.\n\n   In review or repetition questions, do not wait an instant for the answer.\n\n   When a question demands independent thought, wait a sufficient time after stating it, before naming a pupil to answer it, but pass rapidly to some one else if the first named cannot answer.\n6. Give easiest questions to backward and diffident pupils.\n7. Give most questions to backward and diffident pupils.\n8. Do not form the habit of repeating the answers given.\n9. Give a question promptly to an inattentive pupil.\n10. State every question to the whole class, and then call on one pupil to answer it.\n\nSchool Organization.\n\nThis subject includes the suitability and adaptability of everything which has to do with the school work.\n\nProper Organization\u2014includes:\n\n1. School-room and its appointments.\n2. Apparatus and books.\n3. Classification of pupils.\n4. Apportionment of time and subjects.\n5. Registration.\n\nSchool-Room.\n\n1. Should be substantial and commodious, properly heated and ventilated.\n2. Seats should not face windows.\n3. Should be kept clean and decorated.\n4. Should be furnished with hooks, maps, globes, blackboards, crayons, erasers, numerical frame, tablet lessons, weights and measures, thermometer, clock, etc.\n\nText-Books.\n\nPupils should be furnished with all necessary books, and teacher should have a full set of text books used in school.\nClassification\n\nIs the grouping of pupils for school work according to age, ability, and scholarship.\n\nThe following points must be considered:\n\n1. Uniformity.\u2014The several branches should be kept as nearly abreast as possible. Pupils should be so classified as to give the greater part of their time to subjects in which they are deficient.\n\n2. Adaptation.\u2014Every pupil should be placed in the class best suited to his ability and advancement.\n\n3. Age, Ability, and Scholarship.\u2014Other things being equal, older pupils should be classed higher than younger ones, and strong, bright pupils, higher than delicate, dull ones.\n\n4. Reading and Arithmetic.\u2014These subjects may be taken as a basis for classification. In ungraded schools the classification should be sufficiently flexible to provide for the circumstances of the school or pupil.\n\n5. Number of Classes.\u2014As few classes should be formed as is consistent with good grading. Numerous classes fritter away the time.\n\n6. Size of Classes.\u2014Medium sized classes are best. Very large classes prevent individual teaching. Small classes make it difficult to sustain interest among the pupils.\n\nTime Table.\n\nIt must be adapted to the school. It cannot be drafted till the school is classified.\n\nIt must provide:\u2014\n\n1. Specific employment for each pupil during the entire school day.\n\n2. Adequate time for each recitation.\n\n3. Proper rests and recess.\n\n4. Due attention to each pupil.\n5. Proper distribution of studies of the same kind.\n6. Alteration of study and recitation.\n\nRegisters.\n\nKinds\u2014Daily and Class. The use of each should be explained, and copies placed in the hands of the students.\n\nSchool Government.\n\nThis subject includes all the means employed to accomplish the best results with the least waste of time and labour.\n\nObjects to be secured.\n\nOrder, attention, diligence, prompt and cheerful obedience, a healthy tone and good habits among the pupils, the correction and prevention of misdemeanor.\n\nQualities necessary in the teacher.\n\nSystem, energy, vigilance, will-power, self-control, confidence, ability to punish judiciously, culture, heart-power, teaching power, managing power.\n\nThe following hints may be given:\n\n1. Have but few rules and abide by them.\n2. After giving an order wait to see it obeyed.\n3. Your language should not imply that your pupils desire to violate your orders.\n4. Commands should be given in a quiet, firm tone, without shouting or repetition.\n5. Seldom reprove.\n6. Keep your pupils employed.\n7. If necessary, explain the reason of your command.\n8. School government should be regular, natural, self-sustained, unobtrusive, kind and just.\nClass recitation.\n\n1. As to pupils. Proper mode of advancing to position; position itself; supply of materials\u2014books, slates, pencils, etc.; mode of holding books and slates; attention; dismissal from the school-room.\n\n2. As to teacher. Position of teacher, whether sitting or standing; manner during recitation; animation; attention; division of attention between class and pupils; economy of time; recitations should not encroach upon each other; should have some specific object; every error should be corrected; lessons should be made interesting; frequent reviews necessary; mode of assigning subsequent lesson.\n\nMotives to be placed before children.\n\nPerception of utility, emotion, love of approbation, duty of obedience to constituted authority. Rewards,\u2014as changing places, appointment to offices of trust, merit cards, certificates, prizes, etc. Punishments,\u2014as censure, demerit marks, corporal punishment, suspension, expulsion.\n\nOffences.\n\nGive hints on how to deal with the following:\u2014(1) want of punctuality; (2) irregularity; (3) truancy; (4) indifference to study; (5) neglect of home work; (6) quarrelling; (7) whispering; (8) copying; (9) tattling; (10) lying; (11) communicating with other pupils; (12) use of bad language.\n\nRules for the infliction of punishment.\n\n1. Punishment should be reformatory, not vindictive.\n2. Should not be administered in anger.\n3. Teacher should not manifest pleasure.\n4. Should be a natural consequence of the offence.\n5. Age and health of the offender must be considered.\n6. Should be deliberate and seldom inflicted.\n7. Should not excite public sympathy.\nSchool Law.\n\nGeneral Hints.\n\nForm of applying for a situation as teacher; agreement with trustees; must be signed by a majority; what constitutes its validity; its reservations; visiting days; holidays; absence on account of sickness; agreement how dissolved; resignation; suspension of certificate; salary how payable; school grants how paid; on what conditions can teachers claim pay for holidays.\n\nSchool Room Duties.\n\nMust be at school certain time before opening; opening religious exercises; who are exempted from attending, and on what conditions; authority of the teacher as a public officer; no person to interfere with him in the discharge of his duty; power to suspend pupils and for what offences; limitations of this power; expulsion, on what grounds legal; duty in regard to school property; out-premises, fences, well, and playgrounds; fires and sweeping; school reports; registers.\n\nDuties as to Pupils.\n\nInstruction according to programme; constant employment of his time; discipline, nature of; when too severe; kind of government desirable; merit cards; absence from school; presents; subscriptions; time table; quarterly examinations; visitors' book; visitors.\n\nDuties of Pupils.\n\nPunctuality; cleanliness and good conduct; leaving before closing; absence; excuses; absence from examination; going to and from school; supply of books; property injured; contagious diseases; effects of expulsion; certificate of good conduct.\nHygiene.\n\nIn Hygiene, the student will be examined on the \"Manual of Hygiene for Normal and Model Schools,\" authorized by the Education Department, omitting chapters I., VII., VIII., IX. and XVI.\n\nExamination Papers.\n\nThe examination papers will be based on the Syllabus of Lectures and the text-books recommended. In Music and Drill no papers will be issued by the Department. Marks may be awarded by the teachers in charge of these special subjects, and the Board of Examiners may require an additional examination in their own presence, if deemed expedient.\nAPPENDIX III.\n\nFORMS OF PRAYER.\n\n(Authorized under Regulation, 249.)\n\nOPENING.\n\nLet us Pray.\n\nOur Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name,\nThy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in Hea-\nven; give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our\ntrespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us; and\nlead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.
