We told him to do so as she was still and still is on the school list. He was to bring Victor in too.\n\nHe told him that they would be both X-rayed as soon as they would come, he hasn't brought them.\n\nThus our amazement of hearing about their admission in Cecilia Jeffray.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Margaret (Stella) Potawatikweh,\n121 Rat Portage Band.\n\nReceipt is hereby acknowledged of your\n129-3-10 (E.1) of the 4th instant regarding the\nadmittance of the above to the Cecilia Jeffrey\nIndian Residential School.\n\nWith reference to your last paragraph this girl\nwas admitted to the Kenora R.C.

When her condition\nimproved she should have been returned to the Kenora\nSchool.\n\nIn view of sub-section two of section ten\nof the Indian Act and the further fact that the girl\nhad never been discharged from the Kenora School, the\nprincipal of the Cecilia Jeffrey School should never\nhave accepted her.

The child is much younger than he should be for admission to a residential school.\n\nThis boy is an illegitimate child. The mother has married a man other than the boy's father. This man, her present husband, seems to have difficulty in living peaceably with the child. In fact the presence of the child threatens to break up what may otherwise prove to be a reasonably satisfactory home.\n\nBy admitting this child to this school we can give him a chance to exist without provoking strife, and we can assist his mother and step-father. That he was not receiving good care is evidenced by the fact that he was brought here from hospital, where he had been treated for severe frost-bites on both hands.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nKenora, January 21st, 1949\n\nRe: Application for Admission of:\n- Leslie Landamin, 98 Whitefish Bay\n- Edward Redsky, 245 Rat Portage Band\nTo Cecilia Jeffrey I.R.

He returned to this school on May 14th and asked my advice about the possibility of his returning to High School next year. We discussed the reasons for his having left school after only a few weeks of attendance last fall, and I learned that he had felt really handicapped when starting High School, for two reasons. Like many students of Indian Residential Schools his knowledge of English is not such as to be desired, and he felt handicapped when he began to work among English-speaking pupils. Then too he had had only half days in classroom while taking his Grade VIII, and did not feel that he had the thorough grounding in the work which the average day school student, attending classes all of each school day, had acquired.\n\nI suggested to him that he return to this school and study with our Grade VIII class, in order that he might be well prepared to return to High School here in the fall. This he has done. He is studying well, is really trying to improve his English, and in so many ways given real promise of proving a good student who will take full advantage of the opportunity to carry on at school.\n\nMay I ask that he be re-admitted to this school, in order that money grant may be paid for him during this period (commencing April 14th, 1949).\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nKenora, June 8th, 1949\n\nEducation Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nRe: Nobby Green, 61 Shunai Lake Band 39\n\nIn connection with the above noted who was formerly pupil No. 257 at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, we would now submit a copy of a letter received from Mr. T.O.

G.

School\n\nThe above noted pupil ran away from the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School on January 27th, 1951. His brother was in town at the time and had sent Guy back to the school by bus but he evidently returned to town in the same bus. From then up to the present no contact has been made with him nor has any of our Indian pupils or people seen the boy.\n\nExtensive search has been made both by the Principal, the writer, local police, R.C.M.P., Police and Ontario Provincial Police who had been given a description of the boy. The boy's father and brother also have tried to make contact by visiting different woods contractor's camps.\n\nA letter from the Principal, Mr. Ross has been received advising of the continued absence of this boy, and a copy of this letter is attached for your information.\n\nBoys and girls have left the school before and after a considerable lapse of time have been eventually found or have returned voluntarily and it is possible in this case that someone is sheltering him and is not coming through with information.\n\nWe shall continue our efforts to trace this boy. The wood camps are just about to break up within the next 10 days or so and it may be possible to make more thorough enquiries.\n\nNorman Paterson,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nMarch 7, 1951.\n\nMr. Norman Peterson,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nKemptville, Ontario.\n\nRe: Guy Ripley\n\nReference your 129/18-24.\n\nWe have your letter of the 3rd instant with reference to the above named boy.

She was in St. Mary's for a few days this term, but he told me that she was one of our pupils so I went over and got her.

This can be done by showing the names on the discharge section of Form I.A. 411. On receipt of this list, the Department will advise you whether the discharges are approved.\n\nThe Principal has claimed thirty days grant for pupils 0367, 0368, 401, 402, 403 and 404; while under column \"Date of Entrance to School\" he shows that these children entered after September 1, consequently we have reduced the amount of grant in each case accordingly.\n\nIt is noted that there are some pupils carried on the return who have been absent for as long as three years. Will you kindly advise the Principal to apply for the discharge of pupils who he feels will not return to school within the next year. Should any of the pupils return to school at a later date, he may apply for re-admissions which are usually granted.\nIn following the present practice of carrying children on the Return who are actually not at school and will probably be away for some time, the enrolment is shown as higher than it actually is.

Father Lacelle also forwarded a certificate of baptism indicating that she Rosaline was baptized on February 17, 1941. Yet in view of this information available in 1941 the application for admission of this child was completed and signed in 1949 requesting her admission to the Cecilia Jeffrey R.C. Indian Residential School. When this application was approved the girl was admitted to the school on September 25, 1949 and remained there until June 30, 1951. In September 1951 she was in the Kenora R.C. School and later in October she was returned to the Cecilia Jeffrey school.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would contact Father Lacelle and advise why this girl was placed in the Kenora R.C. School in September 1951 when her admission to the Cecilia Jeffrey school was approved. It is requested that obtain this information from Father Lacelle in writing and forward it to this office.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPhilip Morin,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nCOPY\n\nST.

As it was not necessary for the children to remain in the school until June 30 it was in the best interest to send them home earlier. However, the school is entitled to full per capita grant for the quarter for the children who remained in the school until June 20th.\n\nIn view of the above information the Principal should claim per capita grant of 91 days for all pupils for whom she had claimed 60 days.\n\nIt is noted that some of the children left the residence earlier than June 20, consequently the Principal should claim the number of days they were in residence from April 1 to the date they left the residence.\n\nPlease advise the Principal that she should rewrite this return and forward it to your office in the usual manner.\n\n[Signature]\nPhilip Sheilan\nSuperintendent of Education\nThe following boys successfully tried an examination supervised by Dr. Ferguson of Kenora, in St John Preliminary First Aid, in June this year:\n\nLeonard Churchill\nJoe-Victor Crowe\nPeter Shebageget\nLorna Martin\nFred Koyes\nWillie Redsky\nFrank Blackhawk\nAndrew Williams\nThomas Ross\n\nHarvey-Arthur Redsky\nPeter Handorga\nStanley Prince\nRonald Johnson\nKenneth Redsky\nAllan Redsky\nMaurice Shebageget\nLawrence Land\nEdward Redsky\n\nFive others dropped out before the test because:\nOne went to Sanatorium\nTwo couldn't qualify (needed more help than we could give)\nTwo were absent without leave, at end of course.\n\nThe following girls took an adapted course in Home Nursing from the Red Cross course, but no examiner was available to give the girls a test.

This pupil was also absent during the March Quarter.\n\nIn view of this information we have disallowed 91 days grant for this pupil. The Principal has claimed 47 days for pupil # 393 and in the Remarks Column the Principal has stated \"Max AWOL\". This pupil was in residence for 25 days during the March Quarter. The Principal has claimed 21 days for pupil # 399 and indicated in the Remarks Column \"Hospital Sioux Lookout April 23/52\". This pupil was in residence during the March Quarter 35 days.\n\nAs it is very indefinite whether these pupils were in residence during the June Quarter and if they were in the school it is necessary to indicate when they returned to residence and the date they left the residence if they left the residence for any particular reason during the quarter. As it is not possible to pay the per capita grant for these pupils without this information, and as we are anxious to avoid delaying the per capita grant payments for the school we are disallowing any grant for the three pupils.\nPlease obtain definite information regarding these three children and advise. If you and the Principal feel that the school is entitled to any grant for them for the June quarter, it will be in order to enter their names at the bottom of the School Quarter.

Normally the QI credited to her was intended for pupil number 067 who was in school every day. The sum of days in residence on page one does not include the extra QI and should therefore remain at 164.\n\nPupil number 093 Max Cobbinen for whom 47 days were claimed was in school April 2nd - 15th. On the 16th he was allowed to go with his parents for the weekend. He arrived back on May 6th and remained until the 16th. He was granted permission to go again with his parents only for the weekend. He was brought back on June 4th, but was away at the first closure on June 6th. He was brought back on June 13th and sent home with the other children, thus school was dismissed for the holidays on June 20th. The allowable number of days should be 49.\n\nPupil number 309 William Crowe for whom 74 days were allowed in the June quarter and 0 days in the March quarter. In the school preventative records I find that William Crowe returned from St. Anthony Hospital in Winnipeg on February 1st and remained until April 1st when he was sent as a patient to the hospital at Sioux Lookout. In the March Quarter 57 days he should have been allowed.

Indian Residential School.\n\nI believe that regardless of the past history of this case, that the present facts of the case should be the deciding factor; in that the father, mother and brothers and the grandfather are all willing to allow this girl to be sent to the R.C.

He was discharged from Brandon Sanatorium on August 30, and was sent on to us at C. J. School with a letter of introduction to Dr. Playfair. He has to report for photoperiodic pupils every week for ten days for at least another year, probably two years.\n\nFollowing our several conversations on him I think we concluded that considering all factors it would be best for Basil to continue on at C. J. and attend Kenora High school. Mrs. Richmond, principal of C. J., B., has arranged a time table for Basil and he is now attending classes there. Since school is already underway we thought it best to reduce delay to a minimum in settling his status.\n\nBasil was admitted to C. J. School in May 1948, but there remains the matter of his discharge which appears in our records as \"in care,\" unlikely to return to school\" (Admission - Discharge form attached to Quarterly Returns, March 31, 1952).\n\nHis discharge was approved under the date of April 27th, (file 461-10) as pupil number 265. Inasmuch as Kenora seems to be the only centre at which Basil can receive the medical attention which he requires, without entailing undue strain etc., due to weekly travel, and since school has already been in session for almost a fortnight, could you take whatever steps may be necessary to grant us authority to re-admit the child to Cecilia Jeffrey?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

As this pupil was not in residence during June the school is not entitled to grant for her for July and August. We are consequently disallowing sixty-two days grant claimed.\n\nThe Principal has claimed ninety days grant for pupil # 302 as this pupil was not in residence during June; the school is not entitled to grant for him for July and August. We are consequently disallowing the sixty-two days for the two months and are allowing twenty-eight days for September. It is noted that this pupil returned to school September 3rd.\n\nPlease be advised that we are allowing eighty-four days grant for pupil # 314, eighty-three days for pupil # 346, fifty-three days for pupil # 399 (you will recall that we disallowed the Per Capita Grant claimed for this boy on the June Return as the matter has been clarified we are allowing the disallowed grant), one hundred and fifteen days for pupil # 393 (grant was disallowed on the June Return).\nThe following children have been out of residence for a considerable time: 0289, 0293, 0303, 0305, 0307, 0310, 0322, 0331, 0346, 0349, 0350, 0352, 0359, 314, 32, 325, 326, 331, 336, 339, 340, 351, 352, 356, 357, 366, 370, 377, 379, 381, 385.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would review these cases with the Principal with a view to removing their names from future Returns if it is evident that these pupils will not be returning to school. When a decision is reached on any of these children, it would be appreciated if you would instruct the Principal to request their discharge from the school by listing them on Form I.A. 411. When this is done the Principal will be in a position to drop their names from future Returns.

Faith and apparently so is Rosaline consequently she shall attend an R.C. School.\n\nOttawa, November 21, 1953.\n\nRev. Rosaline John\n\nThis family is from the Kenora Agency in the Province of Ontario. The mother is dead. In September 1947, Joe John, Rosaline's grandfather, who had custody of the child at that time, signed an application for her admission to the Cecilia Jeffrey (Presbyterian) Indian Residential School, indicating on the application that the religious denomination was \"Indian belief\".\n\nIn view of this information, Rosaline's admission to the Cecilia Jeffrey School was approved and she was admitted as a grant-earning pupil on September 25, 1949.\n\nRosaline John has been at the Cecilia Jeffrey School continuously from September 25, 1949 to June 30, 1951. In September 1951, the father, Alex John when returning Rosaline to school from summer vacation assumed that she was attending the Kenora R.C. School as he placed her there. When it was established that she had previously attended the Cecilia Jeffrey School she was returned to that school in October 1951 and has remained there since.\n\nSince his wife's death the father, Alex John has remarried and requests the transfer of his daughter from the Cecilia Jeffrey (Presbyterian) Indian Residential School to the Kenora (Roman Catholic) Indian Residential School by statutory declaration reading as follows:\n\"I and my wife desire to have my child, Rosaline born February 15th, 1941 attend the Kenora R.C. Indian Residential School, in Kenora, Ontario, we are both of the Roman Catholic Faith and wish Rosaline to be trained in the same Faith.\"\n\nFather A. Lacelle, now Principal of the Kenora R.C. Indian Residential School, writes regarding the religious denomination of the mother and Rosaline:\n\n\"I recall attending Rosaline's mother on her death bed in 1941 and hearing her pleading with me that Rosaline be baptised and raised in her faith. She had entered the hospital a few days earlier with gallbladder trouble and had asked for baptism which she received on the 16th of February.\n\nAlex is now married to Mary Rose Seymour and is bound by the usual engagement for mixed marriages to have his children raised in the Catholic faith, which promises are signed by two witnesses on January 24th. This, of course, does not apply to Rosaline, but the mother's plea and the child's faith, and the instances of her grandfather Joe John to put her in the Catholic School would justify my letter as he is the guardian of the child.\"\n\nRosaline was baptised on February 19, 1941 according to the rites of the Roman Catholic Church. A copy of \"Certificate of baptism\" is attached.\n\nIt would be appreciated if a ruling were given on Alex John's request.\n\nDirector,\n\n[Signature]\n\nM.F./H.M.\nOttawa, December 19, 1952.\n\nMr. H. Paterson,\nBupt. Indian Agency,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nThe request for the transfer of Rosaline John from the Cecilia Jeffrey to the Kenora Indian Residential School has been received and carefully considered.

The Principal has neglected to indicate whether these children were ill in school, in hospital or at home and the respective dates of the absences. Please ask the Principal to provide you with this information and instruct him to indicate this type of information in the Remarks Column of future Quarterly Returns.\n\nThe Principal has claimed ninety-two days grant for pupil # 342 and has indicated in the Remarks Column \"visiting\". As it is not clear we have disallowed the Per Capita Grant claimed for this pupil. It will be necessary for you to advise us whether this boy was absent from residence and the period of absence. The Principal should claim retroactive grant for this boy on the March Quarterly Return and state the reasons and the dates. The same applies to pupil # 392.\nAs pupil #285 was in hospital for a period exceeding thirty days the school is entitled to eighty days grant rather than fifty-two as claimed.

For example, pupil # 285 was an ex-sam patient. For three and a half days during the quarter he was ill; feeling well enough to go to classes, and was in bed at the school. He was taken to St. Joseph's hospital for check-up and tests, and was in hospital for two days, after which he returned to Brandon Jan. Total days for illness are thus 5\u00bd days. In our Return, the terms \"Hospital\" or \"In Hospital,\" indicate that the pupil was admitted to St. Joseph's Hospital, Kenora, on Doctor's orders for the period indicated. The term \"Infirmary\" indicates that the child was confined to bed in the ward at the school. In our Return, the term \"Visiting\" means that the child is out of the classroom for the period stated, and that during that time he was with his parents, usually in the building. At a school such as this, occasions arise where parents who have come very long distances, and who may see their children only once during the school term, arrive near the end to see the children. In such cases we allow the child to \"Visit\" with the parents in the girls' or boys' playing-room, say, for the afternoon, while the pupils are here. On occasion the parent may be given permission to take the child to town for the afternoon, in which case the child is back in residence before suppertime that evening. In all cases, without exception, such \"Visits\" are made with their children are with permission of the Principal, and are allowed only under special circumstances where long distances and other factors are involved. We have been most scrupulous in reporting all cases of absenteeism without permission under the category \"A.W.O.L.\"\nConversely, and by inference, all other cases of absenteeism are with the full knowledge and permission of the principal.\n\nPupil # 307 was ill, in bed, in the dormitory, at the school; period of illness obviously one day, since the full quota of days in the classroom for any single pupil for the quarter was fifty-six, and none of which he spent fifty-five in the classroom. Pupil # 359 has a best known record, remarks self-explanatory; discharge applied for this quarter. Pupil # 377, the same as pupil # 307. Pupil # 346 was hospitalized two days, St. Joseph's, Kenora. Pupil # 346 was in hospital in June, 1952, did not return to school until after the New Year, 1953. Pupil # 346 was in school, fifty-six and one half days out of the quota of fifty-six. Pupil # 346 was allowed to visit with his parents during school hours on October 29th., the one half day they were in the area. This was with the knowledge and permission of the principal, and the child was not away from the premises. Pupil # 346 was absent without leave for twelve days during the quarter. He ran away. On another occasion he was allowed to visit with his parents in the children's playroom at the school, with permission of the principal, for one afternoon, during school hours. Pupil # 347 ran away one afternoon, was brought back to school the same evening. Pupil # 348 was ill in bed, in the ward, at the school for one and one half days during the quarter. Pupil # 349 was absent without leave for one day during the quarter after he returned to school at the end of the term. The same applies to Pupil # 352, and Pupil # 353, and to Pupil # 370. Pupil # 379 was hospitalized for tests and observation on December 3rd., (St. Joseph's, Kenora), and was sent to Brandon San on December 7th., 1952. Pupil # 395 was discharged as an incorrigible run-away, a nuisance, and a disturbing influence. Ref. Department File # 461-10 (EO) under date of January 15, 1953. Pupil # 396 was ill, in bed, at the school for one day during the quarter. Pupil # 397 was allowed to sight with his parents for one afternoon, during school hours, with the principal's permission. I believe I allowed the father to take the child to town that afternoon. The date was October 29th., Remarks re Pupil # 349 are self-explanatory. Pupil # 405 ran away and was absent without permission for five days during the quarter. Pupil # 406 was absent without permission for one and one half days, also pupil # 408. The latter was treated at St. Joseph's Hospital, Kenora, and at the school infirmary for eight days, for a skin disease. He was admitted to St. Joseph's on November 12th., and discharged on November 19th. Pupil # 411 had a type of jaundice, and was in bed in the ward, at the school, for nine days during the quarter. Pupil # 413 was absent without leave for seven days during the quarter, and spent seven and one half days in St. Joseph's Hospital, Kenora, where he underwent extensive tests and observation as a T.B. suspect. He was admitted to the hospital on November 12th., and discharged on November 19th. Pupil # 416 was\nvisiting with his parents, out of the classroom, but within the school and with permission of the principal for most of one day during the quarter. The date was October 23rd. He is a new pupil at the school, and this was his only opportunity to see his people during the quarter. Pupil #417 was ill in bed, in the dormitory, at the school, for one half day during the quarter. Pupil #418, the same as pupil #406 and #405, was run away all three together, and were returned after one and one half days. Pupil #420 was absent without permission for one day during the quarter. He was ill for eighteen days, twelve of which he spent in St. Joseph's Hospital, Kenora, and the remaining six days of which he spent in bed, in the ward, at the school. He was admitted to St. Joseph's on November 13th., and discharged on November 25th.\n\nPupil #0257 was ill, in bed, one half days, seven of which she spent in St. Joseph's Hospital, Kenora, the remainder in bed, in the ward, at the school. She was admitted to St. Joseph's on November 19th., and discharged on November 25th. Pupil #0259 was absent from the classroom for one half day during the quarter. She had been sick since October 17th. Pupil #0339 was ill at school, in the ward, October 6th., p.m., until October 17th. She was admitted to St. Joseph's Hospital, Kenora, for tests and observation of December 18th., and was discharged on December 19th. Pupil #0341 was ill at school four half days during the quarter - November 12, 14, 20, and 26. Pupil #0341 was ill for one half day during the quarter November 17th., inclusive. Pupil #0341 was ill at school, and was allowed on October 14, 15, 16. She was ill again, at school for one half day on October 20th., and again for one half day on November 8th. She was also ill for one half day on October 21st. She was in bed, in the ward, at the school, with infectious Hepatitis on November 17th., to dist. inclusive. This pupil was not hospitalized during the quarter. Pupil #0351 was ill at school, in the dormitory, on November 17th., inclusive. Pupil #0353 was ill for five days at school, in the ward, with Jaundice November 17th., to 21st., inclusive. Pupil #0354 and Pupil #0355 were each absent one half day, October 7th. They were allowed to spend this half day with their parents, out of the classroom, but within the confines of the school. Pupil #0356 was ill for one half day, in the dormitory, at the school, October 21st. Pupil #0360 was absent from the classroom with permission of the principal, to see her parents, on December 11th. She did not leave the school grounds. Pupil #0361 was allowed by the principal to leave the classroom for the afternoon of December 11th., to see her parents at the school, November 18th to 21st., inclusive, she was in bed, at school with Jaundice. Pupil #0365 missed one day of school, on October 20th. She was absent with permission of the principal, on October 21st., for one half of that day, but remained on the school property, and for the remaining half day she was permitted to go to town with her parents. Pupil #0366 was ill with Jaundice, in bed, in the ward, at the school, on December 1st., and 2nd., and for one half day on December 3rd. Pupil #0372 was ill from the afternoon on October 6th., until she returned to class on the morning of November 4th. She was sent to bed for rest on the afternoons of November 4th., and 5th. The child had Jaundice, but was not hospitalized. Pupil #0373 was hospitalized...\nat St. Joseph's on the afternoon of October 2nd., and was discharged on October 6th. She was in bed, in the ward, at the school until she returned to the classroom on the morning of November 4th. She rested on the afternoons of November 4th. and 5th., as did Pupil # 0372. Pupil 0374, the same as pupil # 416. Pupil # 0375 was another case of infectious hepatitis. She was sick from October 15th. to November 14th. She was in bed, in the ward, at the school, and was not hospitalized. She was out of the classroom all day on October 15th., and one half day on October 16th.\n\nShe was in the classroom all day on October 17th., and one half day on October 20th. She was in bed, in the ward, at the school, from October 21st. to November 11th. She was in the classroom on the afternoons of November 13th. and 14th. and rested in bed at the school on the afternoons of these three days. (Periodic sore eyes). Pupil # 0376, the same as pupil # 392, except that the girl was admitted to school a few days late as indicated.\n\nI trust that this letter provides the information desired by the Department, and that the requested grant will be allowed for the pupils in question. If a more exhaustive search of our records is essential, we shall try to find the time to make it. I would suggest, however, that the Department might find it feasible to issue some kind of detailed directive with official abbreviations for the convenience of principals who are attempting to supply accurate information in the blank spaces available on the Quarterly Return. The Department's illustrative data March 31st., 1953, is helpful, but complete standardization of terminology would seem to me to be the answer to many of the difficulties experienced by both the Department and principals reporting.\n\nOur copy of Dr. Phelan's letter to you, dated January 19th., 1953, leaves us in some doubt as to whether retroactive grant should be claimed only for pupils # 342 and # 392. Since the same apply, for example, to pupils # 416, 0353, 0354, 0360, and 0374? We have no indication either as to whether the grant for pupils # 346, 0361, 0365 and 0376 is in doubt for reasons similar to those given for pupils # 342 and 392. Since Form No. I.A.403 does not provide space on which to claim retroactive grant, we are claiming this form for the pupils specifically mentioned, that is pupils # 342 and 392, on an additional sheet of Form No. I.A.403. If grant has been withheld for any of the other pupils who may be in question, presumably the Department will allow this grant on the basis of information supplied in this letter.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nElton Andrews\n\n(Principal)\nMay 4, 1953\n\nMr. H.

After paying the March Quarterly Return you may advise the Principal that the school has been paid for all the grant claimed and that the Department will not owe any retroactive grant to the school for either the March or the December Quarterly Return.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would bring these facts to the Principal's attention.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMay 5, 1953.\n\nMr. W.

It seems evident from the changes made in our report in Ottawa in the remarks column under, for example pupils #0353 and 0360 &c., etc., that the Department considers a child to have been a day late if he was not in school on January 1st. The directive on Preparation of Quarterly Returns dated March 9, 1953 indicates that the dates of return of pupils are to be noted in the remarks column of Form 1.A.403. The original form submitted to your office indicated such dates, and have been revised with most of these dates changed. Assuming that the Department has in mind some definite date for the beginning of terms, it is understandable that we are in error regarding the number of days a pupil is to be considered late on returning to school. On the other hand, what I do not understand is how the actual date itself may be changed. For example, it is known to us at this school that pupil #31 returned to residence here on January 6th, 1953, and not on January 2nd., as the corrected form would indicate. In the re-written form herewith submitted, we have claimed this date of January 6th., and not attempt to indicate how many days the pupil is to be considered late. On the other hand, in the re-written form we have claimed 74 days for this pupil rather than 69 as in the original form submitted. We have followed this same procedure in all cases in the re-written form. I can assure you that there was no intention on our part of claiming more grant for any pupil than is allowable. The\nfundamental error seems to have been in assuming that pupils in residence up to Christmas are allowed their grant for the full holiday period as they are over the summer holidays if they are in residence during the quarter which ends June 30. The Quarterly Return, as corrected in Ottawa, would seem to indicate that holidays ended on December 31. The form as re-written claims grant on this basis.\n\nWe have included the claim for retroactive grant on a separate sheet as was done originally, and hope that this is as it should be.\n\nThe returned form as corrected states that pupil # 368 is overcharged 65 days. Please note that this pupil was not absent without leave from January 26 to the end of the quarter, but for one half day only on January 26th., as originally indicated. He was in the classroom for fifty-six and one half days during the quarter. We originally claimed for him 86 days in the \"Residence\" column, considering him four days late because he did not return to residence until January 9. The re-written form claims for him 81 days in residence.\n\nPupils # 303, 335, 407, 413, 420, and 0257 were in residence over the whole holiday period. Please note also that in the corrected form two days have been deducted from pupil # 392 reducing his total for the quarter from 90 to 88 days. This pupil was out of residence for the two days indicated as \"visiting\" but with his parents here and with the permission of the principal. The child was merely allowed to leave the classroom for a few hours to spend a little time with his folk when they visited here. This seems to me quite permissible. We report all cases of pupils out of residence without permission even for one half day under the category \"AWOL\".\n\nI wonder if it would not be possible for principals to be supplied with specific instructions at least once a year giving the number of days in the school year, the number of days in each quarter, the dates of beginning and ending of holiday periods, etc., so that these do not have to be deduced from vague sources? I trust that these forms as re-written will not be the cause of further inconvenience to you, and that they meet with requirements.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

Paterson,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nRenora, Ont.,\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 17th regarding the March Quarterly Return for the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School, we have carefully reviewed the return and are forwarding it to the Chief Treasury Officer to make full Per Capita Grant payment on the March Quarter.\n\nThere are a number of points which we would like the Principal to be aware of for his guidance in preparing future returns:\n\n(a) It is the Department's usual practice to pay Per Capita Grant for the day a child enters a residential school. If a child enters school on January 3rd, he is allowed for eighty-six days during that quarter, providing the pupil is in residence full time, following his Return. When a pupil returns on February 1st, the school would be entitled to fifty-nine days grant. It is noted that the Principal on completing the March Return did not follow this practice.\n\n(b) It is not necessary for the Principal to disallow grant for a pupil who was out of residence for one-half day. He may claim\ngrant for the full day. This is allowed due to the fact that the School Management is making provision for a pupil on the assumption that he will be in school for the full day.\n\n(c) When a pupil is in residence he is allowed to leave his classroom in the morning or afternoon or for a whole day to visit his parents who are visiting the school. Grant should be disallowed when pupils are away from residence for a whole day.\n\n(d) The Principal has requested that the Department advise all principals of the number of days in each quarter. We do not see any necessity for doing so as the number of days can be worked out simply by adding the number of days for the three months in the particular quarter.\n\nAttached I am forwarding you two copies of the latest regulations regarding completing the quarterly returns. I expect they will be of benefit both to yourself and the Principal of the Coe Hill Jeffrey Residential School. Two copies of this letter are being forwarded to you in order that you may send one to the Principal.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n### DISCHARGE OF PUPILS\n\n| No. | Name                  | Grade | Remarks Upon Discharge |\n|-----|-----------------------|-------|------------------------|\n| 345 | Peter Shebegeget     |       |                        |\n| 366 | Robert Prince        |       |                        |\n| 367 | Tom Ross             |       |                        |\n\n**Note:** One or more of these forms should be forwarded with each quarterly return and full particulars should be given regarding all pupils either admitted or discharged during the quarter.\n\n---\n\n**ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT Cecilia Jeffery Indian**\n\n**School During**\n\n**Names of Parents and Guardians on Record**\n\n**Quarter:** April - June\n\n**Quarter, 1952**\n\n---\n\n**Library and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada**\n\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nJuly 13, 1953.\n\nMr. M. Paterson,\nDept. Indian Agency,\nKenora, Ont.,\n\nWith reference to the June Quarterly Return for the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, the Department approves the discharge of pupils # 345 and 366.\n\nIt is noted that the Principal has requested the discharge of pupil # 367 from Ross from this school. It is further noted that this boy is only thirteen years of age and the Principal indicates that \"this boy is a habitual and incorrigible run away, given to thieving and generally exercising an undesirable influence over other children. My judgment is that this boy's discharge ought to be approved\".\n\nPlease advise whether this boy's discharge has been discussed with you by the Principal and whether you are agreeable that this boy should be discharged. If so, what arrangements are being made for his education elsewhere.\n\nIt is noted from the Quarterly Return that a large number of the pupils have been absent without leave for different periods. Please advise whether this matter has been discussed with the Principal and what action is being taken to avoid having the pupils leave the school from time to time without any authority.\nFor pupil # 0346 Barbara K. Akkeway, the Principal has claimed seventy-seven days grant; however, he has neglected to indicate the reason for claiming less than the prescribed number of days in the quarter and the period of absence from residence. Please advise the Principal that we are disallowing grant for this pupil as Treasury officials will not pay grant without the above-mentioned information. Please provide this office with this information and instruct the Principal to claim retrospective grant for this pupil on the September Quarterly Return indicating in the Remarks Column full particulars.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nKENORA, July 21st, 1953\n\nIndian Affairs Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nRe: File: 461-10(E6),\nLetter dated 13-7-53\n\nWith regard to the fourth paragraph of your letter above noted we wish to advise that this matter was discussed at length with Mr. H.G.

We have been attempting to clear the Quarterly Return of children who for one reason or another do not seem likely to return to school, or who have been out of school over extended periods of time, or who, as in the case of the child in question here, have sometimes appeared to us as cases where a school of this type is not very adequately equipped to handle. In doing this I have tried in each case to consider all the factors involved, and to strive at a wise decision always with the needs and best interests of the child in view. The decision which I had reached in the case of Tom Ross was not an easy one to make at the time, and has continued to do so ever since. I am glad to have this case re-opened for further consideration in the hope that some more effective methods of dealing with truant children may be brought into operation within the next year or so.\n\nWe at this school, by the very nature of our work, welcome the opportunity to work with problem children in order to do what we can to expand their horizons and to help to lead them into a better and fuller life. However, while it is obvious that we are primarily an educational rather than a reform institution and only a certain proportion of our energies can go into the tracking down of truant children without causing many others to suffer neglect.\n\nI have repeatedly stated my considered conviction that the problem of truancy in this area can be dealt with successfully in the long run through an impartial third party not directly connected either with the school or the Indian agency in the person of a full-time truant officer. In every single case of truancy\nSince our arrival at this school we as a staff have made every effort humanly possible to retrieve the child. Sometimes we are successful; sometimes we are not. I myself have spent as many as three consecutive days and nights with very little sleep in the bush and on the roads exhausting every possibility of retrieving children in the fear that some harm might come to them. We make it a policy never to give up the search until some definite indication is received that the child is safe or returned. The nature of the terrain in this area and the inadequacy of the resources, lack of specialized means of transportation and travel grants, and other factors make it impossible for school staffs and the Indian Superintendent, nevertheless, to combat this problem alone. There is no denying the fact that the problem of truancy in this area is a serious one though its effects are out of all proportion to its extent and frequency. A single truant child is capable of producing a situation in a school community which can operate for months and may be seriously disrupted for days on end.\n\nThe problem of truancy among Indian children needs thorough and sympathetic study as all of us know. It bears little resemblance to the sporadic kind of truancy which occurs among white children and involves difficulties which are not found in the latter. In only a comparatively small number of cases does truancy among Indian children seem to have causes which can be analysed and dealt with by ordinary methods. The causes which are cause enough to be the face that Indian children are aware of the times of year when parents are leaving for the rice fields, trap lines, hunting expeditions and so forth, and also when they move toward the town to buy and sell and so on. Children at these times become unsettled and may make determined and persistent efforts to catch up with parents before they get away. The fact that has to be reckoned with is that there are children who will run away from school even if the factors like cold water, ice, distance, lack of food and so on are no deterrent. There is also a factor of irrationality involved in this matter of truancy. There is no necessary connection between conditions at the school, for example, and the fact that a child runs away. It is usually fruitless to reason that the event has a cause in our sense of the term and that if the cause is removed the condition may be corrected. The whole problem of truancy in this area seems to me to be important enough to warrant some intensive research by a special commission set up for the purpose.\n\nI consider myself fortunate in having come to this work with some sociological and anthropological background, and I feel competent to say that, from our own cultural standpoint, the causes of truancy appear to be basically primitive in nature and need careful and scientific investigation from a broad anthropological basis. Notions which might be described as \"small or bad seasons,\" the bush, and so forth, have a bearing on this problem. Phases of the moon have something to do with it as well as crisp frosty weather. Childish reasons such as \"the boys were teasing us\" are quite adequate from the child's point of view to justify his starting out on a fifty to one hundred mile trek in sub-zero weather with no provision for food or shelter and, considering the\njourney, inadequately clothed.\n\nOf the specific negative factors contributing to this whole problem I think that the lack of well-equipped playgrounds and the shortage of playground space and facilities rank foremost. The fairly general disinterest shown as to the value to the Indian of education in the white man's sense, and the consequent inability of Indian schools to also be major positive factors. A look at the problem of playground space alone will serve to illustrate the point. There are at present two playgrounds, one for boys and one for girls, outside the small patch of playing ground four feet by four feet that is allowed per child. More important than this is the fact that, come weather or example, children from six to sixteen years of age are crowded into so small an area. Outside of the classroom there is no possibility of really separating the younger from the older children during any single hours of the day. Younger children are subjected to bullying, while the older children have always the little ones under their feet. Perhaps the most obvious complaint of Indian parents is that the older children are hard on the little ones. Certainly the common reaction given by children to running away from school is that some other child has hurt them.\n\nThis does not indicate that older Indian children are prone to beat up on the little ones, but precisely the opposite. It is true that Indians generally are uncommonly solicitous of children, and that the Indian child is commonly a pampered child in our own eyes. Nevertheless all of this reflects a situation which could be corrected at this school only by a radical expansion of staff facilities and eventually by doubling the number of supervising personnel, playgrounds and playgrounds. I believe that supervision here is inadequate as it could possibly be under the circumstances. The circumstances, however, tend to create a situation in which it is less to impossible for the supervisor to give individual attention to seventy-five children of varying ages and the attention he individually which is their right. This amounts to pre-adolescent children need the kind of care, play activity and human contact that they receive if they are to develop into the well-balanced personality for which the type of educational opportunities offered by a school of this type ought to prepare. As the situation is now, even if one of the best instructors is given the kind of attention she could demand which is due her, the other is necessarily relegated to the extent. It is not possible for a single supervisor who is working in the room and play ground at his disposal to adequately care for children in normal activity out of school hours when their ages range from six to sixteen. The problem of properly fenced grounds is also indicated, related to the problem of bullying. As the situation is at present any child who may wish to do so may merely lace into the bush at will, and it is fair manner to say from her to supervisors that a situation of continuous tension should have to exist over this matter.\n\nWhile I realize that there is much more to be said on this subject, and that the opinions stated were hardly asked for in your letter, but\nare to be regarded as my own, I think that this letter does\nindicate that this is a problem which we here do not take lightly,\nand points to a few things which may be of some value in future\nconsiderations of this problem as a whole. In the case of pupil\nTom Ross, I would like to reverse my own former decision and\nask that his application for acceptance be withdrawn, and at the\nsame time request that he return to school in September to con-\ntinue his education. I should like also to assure you that we for\nour part will not relax our efforts to do what we can toward the\nsolution of this whole problem.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n(Signed) J.

W. Byers Esq.,\nPrincipal Indian Residential School,\nKERRA, ONT.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have yours of the 18th in which you state that you wish to secure about twenty young Shorthorn females of milking strain. If you wish to secure heifers that have been bred I am afraid that you will have difficulty in picking up twenty such as you would like to take because they are exceedingly scarce. If, however, you could take younger heifers that have not been bred I think that the stock could be secured within a reasonable length of time, though it would take more or less searching to find the number you require. The Caledonia district is about as good a district as we have for this purpose, and if you are sending some person down after these cattle I should be glad to take my car and see that he has a chance to look over what there is for sale and help him in any way possible.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary.\nDear Sir,\n\nAttached is a letter from the Dominion Shorthorn Breeders' Association re cattle.\n\nI would like to receive authority to purchase 20 head. About six of these will have to be cows which will be milking when school opens as we have not sufficient to supply the pupils with milk.\n\nI would also like authority to purchase about 20 or 25 young pigs. They could be shipped in the same car.\n\nThere will also have to be a bull purchased. The one at the school lacks scrotal size. I would like an exceptionally good one as it pays to have the best in stock. This animal will necessarily have to be carefully selected.\n\nWaiting you in anticipation of your favorable reply to the above.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, June 6, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with enclosure, concerning live stock for the new Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. The Department is not satisfied that 50 head, in addition to the cows from the old school, are really required. Would it not be preferable to purchase 10 good sows, rather than 20 younger animals? Further, could not the cows be found in Manitoba, so that the freight costs would be less?\n\nDo you consider it advisable to supply the milch cows before the barn is erected, and do you also think that you should have young pigs before the school is in operation? Please give these suggestions your consideration, and, after consultation with Mr. Agent Edwards, you might place your request in his hands.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst.

These cattle will be out on pasture until fall.\n\nThere is another source of a possible purchasing point. Brandon Fair will be held July 1st to 6th, and there is always a good exhibit of live-stock.\n\nThe difference in rate between Brandon, Man., and Guelph, Ont., is around $40 a car-load. There is a special half rate on milkers from Guelph but this special rate applies on pedigreed cattle only from western points.\n\nSince commencing this letter Capt. Edwards has returned from his Treaty trip and I shall turn this letter over to him.\n\nI remain Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nCecilim Jeffrey Indian School,\nKenora, Ont., June 16th, 1929.\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe purchase of cattle file I29_5_14\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of 6th inst., I wish to state that I had already discussed this matter with Capt. Edwards and his views were the same as suggested in my letter. He was absent on Treaty when I wrote and will be another four or five days.\n\nI might say I have written different live-stock breeders' associations also the Agricultural College at Winnipeg and at Guelph, and the only encouraging letter I received was from Guelph. I am becoming alarmed at our situation here as with the opening of school in September we will be without milk.\n\nThe cows which Mr. Macdonald has are poor milkers. It takes the five of them milking at their best to give the present animal only a limited supply. Then there will be a period of almost three months where these cows will be dry. Further these cows are not likely to be bred owing to the fact that the bull died.\n\nMy idea was to have 12 good milkers coming in at different times so that a steady supply of milk could be maintained. I would also like to have an additional 12 head of young cattle coming on so that the herd may be kept up. I would like to raise our own beef and make our own butter. It is much cheaper to get into\nKenora, Ont.\nJune 19th/29.\n\nSir:\n\nThe principal of the new Cecelia Jeffrey school has handed me the enclosed letter for transmission to the department.\n\nThe cows at the old school have never been tested, are poor milkers and worth practically nothing; and I would certainly advise purchasing new stock. I agree with Mr. Byers that it would be advisable to buy in the East; the difference in freight on a carload being very small, we would be sure of good stock. He has gone to considerable trouble finding the best market.\n\nIn purchasing a carload as Mr. Byers wishes, there would be a considerable saving on freight, and the younger stock could be growing up into beef. No good cattle can be purchased locally, and a good bull should be also obtained.\n\nWe would be glad to receive instructions as soon as possible as it will take some time to get the cattle and the school will soon be opening.\n\nI would also like authority to purchase about 12 young pigs, weaners, for the school at a cost of about $5 or $6 each.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nP.S.\nMemorandum:\n\nThe Principal of the new Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School is urging the Department to make early arrangements for the livestock that is necessary. Mr. Byers is not only a practical man but he is a good stock man and he wants 10 milkers, 10 heifers, a bull and 12 young pigs. The 7 cows at the old school are not of much value as milkers and will likely have to be beefed.\n\nMr. Byers has been in correspondence with the Dominion Shorthorn Breeders Association, of Guelph, and is well informed concerning sources of supply. I wish to recommend that he be given authority to purchase the milk herd himself - the selection of animals to be made in the vicinity of Guelph. I estimate the cost at $1000. Only tuberculin tested animals will be considered. The young pigs can be purchased locally and will cost about $70.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSept. of Indian Education.\nJune 27, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Indian Agent Edwards has forwarded your letter of the 18th instant, regarding the purchase of cows for the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. I understand that the 7 animals at the school are pure milkers. The ones that are transferred to the new site will be tested and those that are not worth keeping for milking purposes should be disposed of. If you wish to sell these for the purpose of supplementing from school funds the animals allowed by the Department, you may do so.\n\nYou are authorized to complete arrangements with the Dominion Short Horn Breeders Association through their representative for 10 milkers, 10 heifers and one bull. No unnecessary expense should be incurred, as the Department does not consider it necessary to secure registered stock. The Department is placing this purchase in your hands, so that you will be entirely satisfied with the milk herd that is provided. Replacements in future will have to be made from the purebreds or other suitable animals, unless the animals have been purchased, you should forward properly certified accounts, in duplicate. You may also forward an account, in duplicate, in your own favour, for the freight costs.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Edwards is receiving authority to purchase 12 young pigs, at a cost of approximately $5 each. A copy of this letter is being forwarded to him for his information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nB. W.

I am enclosing, for your information and guidance, a copy of my letter of today's date to Mr. Byers. The Department is placing the purchase of the milk herd in his hands, for two reasons: you are busy with treaty payments at the present time, and, secondly, the school management will satisfy themselves concerning the animals purchased.\n\nYou will please arrange for the purchase of 12 young pigs, at an estimated cost of approximately $6 each.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nA.

You also mentioned in your letter that you did not consider it was necessary to buy registered stock. The Principal informed me he is away doing work in the East and will be back soon to purchase this stock. I asked what amount he considered he would have to pay for the animals and he said he expected they would cost $150 to $200 a head. This looks very expensive to me in view of the fact that it is not necessary to purchase registered stock. However, the authority to purchase was not directed to him, so I am not interfering, except that I pointed out to him no unnecessary expense has to be incurred as per your letter. This is for your information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\n[Stamp]\nOTTAWA, December 4, 1929.\n\nE. W.

Owing to the Police not having a large enough boat and owing to the Departmental officers being away, packed up for the Winter, I got in touch with Mr. Evans, Principal of the Cecelia Jeffrey School and borrowed the school boat for the use of the Police. The Sergeant took with him Constable Patterson of the Provincial Police, and a mechanic but their investigations did not lead to anything. In the afternoon of the 14th they were returning to Kenora when something went wrong with the clutch and they were unable to make the boat go. A wind sprung up and they were washed ashore on one of the islands. They had a canoe with them and were able to reach the camp, and returned to Kenora on the 15th and reported the matter to me. There had been a strong wind blowing on the night of the 14th and they did not know how badly the boat was damaged. I got in touch with the Lake of the Woods Milling Company and got them to send a steamboat and barge to bring in the launch. This was done with great difficulty as the boat had sunk and was badly damaged. The boat was taken to the Stone Boat Company in Kenora who built it, and on receipt of an estimate from them I will write you and get further instructions as to what should be done in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nKenora, Ont.\n\n10/11/29\n\nRe: Alleged Ring of Liquor to Indians at Whitefish Indian Reserve, Lake of the Woods, Ont., Indian Act.\n\nOn the behalf Capt. F. Edwards, Indian Agent at Kenora, Ont., informed me that he had received information to the effect that liquor was being run to the Indians at Whitefish Reserve and requested that the matter be investigated.\n\nOn my inquiries about Kenora I learned from the Provincial Police that there was a shortage of beer in the local store and that they had been watching the Brewery Door (not night) for the past two weeks in an effort to catch some trading.\n\nCapt. Patterson of the C.F.Police stated that he would help watch the channels going to Whitefish if a suitable boat could be had for the work, and that with such Department cooperation the chances of success would be doubled.\n\nI explained the situation to Capt. F. Edwards and told him that the Police boat was too small for the work at this season of the year. The Captain said that he would run us up in the Indian Department's boat but it had been taken out for the year. However, he said that he would arrange to get the Indian school boat for the trip if we could get a mechanic. This we did.\n\nOn the 12th Inst. I left in the Indian School Boat for Whitefish district with Capt. Patterson of the C.F.Police and R. Moore, Mechanic. We watched the channels going to Whitefish until the afternoon of the 14th Inst. without seeing any boats going to Whitefish with the exception of the Keewatin Lumber Co.'s Tug. There were several boats came up as far as Yellow Girl and nearby islands but none went towards Whitefish.\n\nOn the afternoon of the 14th Inst. when returning to Kenora and about eight miles out the clutch slipped and would not drive the boat, when it was tightened by the Mechanic it would stop the engine when it was put in gear. The Mechanic stated that nothing could be done as the Clutch was worn out.\n\nThere was a big sea running at the time so we got the Anchor out but owing to the shortness of the Anchor rope it was unable to hold the boat in the sea that was running with the result that we were blown ashore on the North shore of Quay Island the boat was damaged and filled with water.\n\nOn the following day we reached Kenora in another boat and I reported to Captain F. Edwards what happened. He requested me to go with the Tug and show the Captain where the boat was. I left with the Tug on the same day and had the boat at J.V. Stone's (Boat Company) dry dock at about 10 am on the 16th Inst.\n\nThe Indian agent,\n\n(A.D. Calvert)\n\nKenora, Ont.\n\nForwarded for your information,\n\nR.C. Pollock,\n\nC.S.

Stone Boat Manufacturing Company, who built the boat, and asked them to give me an estimate of repairs. They inform me that to repair the hull, put in new planking where necessary, replace part of deadwood, repair damaged wood work in interior, including glass in windows, new rudder, new propeller and shaft, $400. Necessary repairs and complete overhauling of engine $128. Painting boat, inside and out, $85.00.\n\nIn this connection I think a certain amount of repairs, particularly the overhauling of engine, etc., and possibly painting the boat should be paid by the school authorities. I presume the balance of the account should be paid for by us. I have not discussed this matter with Mr. Myers, the Principal, but shall be glad to receive instructions from you. I'll communicate the other day as to whether it would be advisable to sell the boat or not. In his writing, he stated they were very anxious to keep the boat and there is no question it would be useful to them in recruiting, visiting the Indians and in taking the children out on the Lake.\n\nI understand the church authorities intend opening the old school as a Summer resort for the Presbyterians of Winnipeg. They could only do this if the Principal would allow them the use of the boat occasionally and Mrs. McKerroll, present here at the opening of the School, asked me to do all possible to get the Department to keep the boat for the school.\n\nAwaiting your instructions,\n\n[Signature]\n\nNov. 29th, 1929\nOttawa, December 9th, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letters of the 15th and 25th ultimo, concerning the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School launch. The overhauling of the engine and the painting of the boat will be paid for by the school authorities. The Department will meet the other costs of repairing the boat, which you have estimated at $400.00. Please make the necessary arrangements and see that the launch is properly stored for the winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\nCecilia Jeffrey School,\nKenora, Ont.

He is a very reliable man and is used to stock.\n\nHe asks to have his expenses paid and $25.00. This is a very reasonable offer.\n\nI would like for the Dept. to advance me $300 to cover expenses such as Tixete, Breths, Meals etc.\n\nKindly instruct me as to what I shall do by way of paying for these. Do you suppose owners will sell on an order on the Dept. If it would be convenient I would appreciate a man to represent the Dept. to be with me when selecting.\n\nKindly send me full instructions as I purpose leaving soon.\n\nWishing you the compliments of the Season,\n\nI remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, December 30, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th instant, with reference to the purchase of a milk herd. You are authorized to proceed to Qualph for this purpose and to engage one man to look after the stock. This man's expenses will be paid and $50 for his services. Under separate cover, an accountable cheque for $1,500 is being directed to you. This cheque should be used only in connection with the milk herd, i.e., to pay your expenses, those of Mr. Brown, Mr. Brown's fees, freight and for the purpose of paying cash for any animals purchased. You can make better arrangements by purchasing on the cash basis. In other cases, of course, you should forward a properly certified account, in duplicate, in favour of those from whom the stock is purchased. The Department will then send official cheques direct to the vendors. It is understood that the Canadian Breeder's Association will assist you in making the selection, that you will purchase grade animals in the main and that no unnecessary expense will be incurred. It is considered that not more than 10 milkers, 10 heifers and one bull should be secured. If fewer animals will satisfy the needs of the school, the Department will be grateful if you will curtail the expenditure. I do not consider it necessary for a department representative to be with you when making the selection. The matter will be left in your hands.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

We need one to run a feed-grinder also a feed-cutter for a silo and for stumping and clearing the land and other farm work. Also there is no one in this district who makes a business of threshing and we have no way of threshing our grain. Our neighbor has a 23ft. Separator but he has no engine. He proposed that we supply an engine and he would supply the separator. This is a good proposition for us and we should have a tractor for several reasons.

This team was bought for the North Development Co., but they are laying off teams and are not taking them.\n\nMr. Bradshaw, the owner has offered to take the old team and a difference of $400. This is allowing us $150 for the old team which are really not saleable at all.\n\nThe above team would do credit to the school.\n\nI shall appreciate it very much if you will request the Dept. to authorize the purchase of the same.\n\nI remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nCecilia Jeffrey School,\nKenora, Ont.

The question of obtaining the old team of horses at the school for a young team appears more urgent. As Mr. Byers has had presented to him a very attractive proposition, the Department will authorize an expenditure of $400. Please instruct Mr. Byers that the new team should be examined by a veterinary, at school expense or at the expense of the vendor, before purchase is made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

In this connection I have to say that the terms of the agreement are satisfactory to this Department. It is expected that the Principal will carry out all instructions which he may receive from the officer of the Health of Animals Branch who makes the inspection from time to time.

It is noted that you have made an offer to Mr. W. E.

We are instructing him that you make the purchase of supplies of this nature and pay for same from per capita earnings or other receipts of the school. I shall be pleased if, when purchasing hay, you will give Mr. Ryan an opportunity to quote.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nE. W. Byers, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nCecilia Jeffrey Res. School,\nKenora, Ont.\nIt is not the financial value alone that I am considering, but the fact that this cow was a very outstanding animal. Hoping you will look into this matter and give it full consideration,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nThe Commissioner,\nDominion Livestock Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have just completed a test of our herd for T.B. The test being made by the Government Veterinary Surgeon from Dryden, Ontario. In regard to one cow Minnie's Queen -22653L- This cow was bought one year ago from D. Z. Gibson of Oakwood, Ontario being bought under test. None of the herd here showed a reaction with the exception of this one cow. She showed a reaction. This cow was our finest one in the herd and I was counting on her for a foundation cow. She was in splendid condition and a good feeder, and outside the test there were no indications whatever to lead one to suspect her. She was a very valuable animal with a good record behind her. I suggested to the Vet. that I remove her immediately from the premises and have her placed under quarantine in order that I might save the calf. He insisted that we destroy her and we had her killed. The Vet. was present when she was killed and he removed every gland and every organ and examined them very carefully and could not find any indication whatsoever of the disease being present. I consider the Vet. did what he considered was his duty, but I sincerely think that something else other than T.B. produced the reaction. I don't believe the animal had the disease, and the Butcher emphatically declares he could see nothing to indicate the least symptoms of the disease.\n\nWe have sustained a very severe loss in having to destroy this animal, and I feel that we should be recompensed from some source. It seems to me that it was a very drastic measure to destroy such a valuable cow upon the first test.\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed please find copy of a letter from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School to the Commissioner of the Dominion Livestock branch, for your information.\n\nThe Principal signed the forms to come under the Supervised herd agreement and we are of the opinion that he has no address, nor should the Department give him compensation, as it appears to us, he has enough animals at the School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\n\nMinister's Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\nTo Sam Omerholm,\nKenora,\nOntario.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| 1931 |         |        |\n\nMarch 5 To account rendered per Teachers attended. 1 35\n\nSchool Vote, Cecilia Jeffrey School\n\n20/4/31\n\nEXAMINED and\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nAgent.\nOffice of the [Redacted] Indian Agency,\n\n[Date]\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 5608, amounting to $2435 in favour of [Redacted], for Balance of Freight account on Machinery for the Cecilia Jeffrey School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental\n\n[Signature]\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edward\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1931 March | To account rendered per Vouchers attached.   | 400.00 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent\n\nForm 52\n**THE J.

All the new planking and woodwork that was put into this boat had to have at least 3 coats of paint in order to be brought up to the finish of the rest of the boat and on account of all these new pieces being put into the boat it was necessary to paint the whole launch inside and out. The work made necessary on the engine was due to the boat having been sunk. We had to install a new coil, put new parts in distributor and magneto as well as take the engine all apart and properly overhaul and clean it.\n\nTrusting that this is the information you require, we are\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe J.M. Stone Boat Mfg. Co., Ltd.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.M.D.\nCapt. Frank Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose herewith an account rendered by the Stone Boat Manufacturing Co., for repairs on boat.\nI am also enclosing a letter from this same firm stating that all work done on this boat was on account of its having been wrecked.\n\nWe have also had an additional expense of re-equipping the boat. We had a full outfit of dishes and cooking utensils including a stove, and all these were lost or destroyed. The pike pole was also lost and so was the anchor.\n\nThe boat was sent out in good condition having been overhauled a short time previous by Stone Co. We were also obliged to engage an engineer to give the engine an overhauling as we could not work the clutch which had been damaged and one of the Tappet rods was stripped. The engineer's time cost us over $50.\n\nThe total expense incurred should not be any charge against the school as we sent the boat out in good condition and it was not in as good a condition after the above work had been done on it.\n\nI shall appreciate it if you will explain this to the Department.\n\nI remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nHenura, Ontario,\nMarch 5th, 1931.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReference your letter 120-7-14 of December 8th, 1930 re part payment for overhauling and painting the Cecilia Jeffr. School Launch, which the Department stated they would pay $400.00 for. We inclose Voucher for the amount of $400.00, the account is for $500.00 leaving a balance of $100.00, which according to your letter should be paid by the School Authorities. We also inclose a letter from Lie. Principal and a letter from the Stone Boat Co., to the Principal.\n\nIt is quite possible that the Dinner, cooking utensils, and Stove were lost or spoiled by the water, but the R.C.M.P. Police inform us that the Anonor was brought in.\n\nIn our opinion the cluten must have been defective when the boat went out, and the cause of the damage was through the cluten going wrong. The Principal thinks we should pay the full $500.00 as the School did not use the boat again, the school should pay the difference in the bill, or if they do not feel they should pay for the upkeep of the boat, it could be disposed of, although very handy for the R.C.M.P. Police returning children to the Schools but not used very much by the School Authorities, but if the Principal wishes keep the boat, we do not think he should complain paying for the upkeep, although we admit on this occasion the boat was not being used on School purposes but Department Service and the R.C.M.P. Police and Provincial Police were with it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOttawa, March 13, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 106-17 of the 5th instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Ocelin Jeffrey Indian Residential School, together with a voucher covering the cost of repairs made to the school launch.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that, when our new appropriation is available, a cheque to the amount of $400, being the sum this Department agreed to provide, will be forwarded to the J.

His greatest objection is the fact that he did not think that he would not have the animal replaced by another by the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nMr. Beyers requested me to urge my influence with the Indian agent in a recommendation for the replacement of the above animal, and in the supply of satisfactory pump to be used in the disinfection of the premises immediately following the slaughter.

Watt Inspector\nHEALTH OF ANIMALS BRANCH\nDepartment of Agriculture\nOTTAWA, March 11, 1931\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to our telephone conversation of today I now beg to enclose a copy of Inspector Watt's report concerning the test of the herd at the Cecilia Jeffrey school at Kenora.\n\nI think it well to point out in this connection that Mr. Byers states in his letter to the Livestock Commissioner, a copy of which I understand is in your possession, that no lesions were found in the racing cow although Dr. Watt in his official report of the conduct of the test states definitely that lesions were found in the carcass.\n\nAwait additional reply.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nVeterinary Director General\n\nEnclosure.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note]\n129-3-14\nI also pointed out to Inspector Watt that in future when holding post mortem examinations it would be advisable to draw the owner's attention to the lesions whether he was interested or not, in fact to show them to anyone present, and that by so doing the Department would avoid criticism and annoyance.\n\nI left Kenora, Ontario, for Winnipeg at 6.40 A.M. on Wednesday, March 28th, arriving at Winnipeg at 6.15 A.M., and returned to my duties at this office.\n\nEnclosing this is the information you desire,\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(SD) J. B. STILL,\nChief Inspector for Manitoba.\nof Almora, he replied that he had not seen any lesions. Upon asking Inspector Watt why he did not show the lesions to Mr. Ayers, Inspector Watt informed me that he did not think Mr. Ayers was interested in the case but that Mr. Ayers asked him to show him the lesions he would have done so.\n\nI might also say that while questioning Mr. Ayers in connection with this case he more or less contradicted himself at times on the points above mentioned.\n\nWhile at the Cecilia Jeffrey School I also made inquiries in the presence of Dr. Ayers, Inspector Watt, and Captain McKeown, all three who were present or were working around the school while Inspector Watt was making the post mortem. A party known as George Brown, in the employ of the school, called the farmer, stated that he did not see any lesions and Inspector Watt did not show them to him. J. McGuire, who was also present, and who had driven Captain McKeown, Inspector Watt and myself to the school, informed me that he was present and had seen several post mortems held on handling cattle and that he was more or less interested in the case. On questioning Inspector Watt very closely and that Inspector Watt showed him the lesions. In fact he had mentioned to Inspector Watt before he had cut into one of the animals that it appeared to be abnormal. Mr. Cecil Fox, the party who butchered this animal, was not at the school at the time of my visit but was at the scene of business. Therefore, on my return from town of morning, in company with Captain McKeown and Inspector Watt, I interviewed him. He advised me that he had not seen the lesions but that this might be accounted for due to the fact that he was working on other parts of the carcass at the time. He, however, informed me that there was foreign body, being a piece of barbed wire about 12 or 18 inches in length, was present in the diaphragm and that there was an abnormal condition both in the diaphragm and near covering of the heart. The butcher, Mr. Fox, who has been in the butchering business for a number of years, also advised me that this cow was only between three and four months in calf.\n\nThe diseased portions were destroyed by fire. Mr. Ayers, the Principal, was fully instructed by Inspector Watt, according to Mr. Ayers' own statement, as to the cleansing and disinfection of the premises and disposal of the diseased portions, which has been done.\n\nBoth the Indian Agent, Captain Frank Edwards, and Mr. Ayers, the Principal, now appear to be satisfied that the reactor was slaughtered.\n\nI think the trouble in connection with this case was largely due to the fact that at the time this animal was found to be a reactor the Principal, Mr. Ayers, was more or less unused so he knew the difficulty in obtaining animals of this class and probably had Inspector Watt used a little more tact and diplomacy I do not think the controversy which has occurred would ever have come up.\nThe Veterinary Director General,\nDepartment of Agriculture,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of March 16th in which you asked me to proceed to Kenora and visit the Cecilia Jeffrey School for the purpose of ascertaining certain facts and reporting them to your office concerning the same, I have visited the school and examined over the premises by Inspector H. J. Watt. I might say that on Tuesday, March 16th, I left Winnipeg at 10 A.M., arriving at Kenora at 1:30 P.M., where I met Captain Frank Edwards, Indian Agent, and Inspector H. J. Watt, and accompanied them to the Cecilia Jeffrey School, located about three miles from the town of Kenora.\n\nOn arrival there I met Mr. H.W. Byers, the Principal, and visited his office and thoroughly discussed with him the question raised by you, in the presence of the Indian Agent, Captain Frank Edwards, and Inspector H. J. Watt.\n\nMr. Byers, in our presence, expressed himself as entirely satisfied with the work which had been carried out by Inspector Watt. He also stated that the cow which reacted, catalog No. K74585, was a valuable animal to him, and that the reaction was quite noticeable. He advised me that he had expressed a desire to Inspector Watt to retain this cow in isolation on the premises until such time as she had calved so that he could raise the calf. He also stated that Inspector Watt did not absolutely refuse to permit him to do this but advised him very strongly owing to the fact that this cow was only between three and four months in calf, to have her slaughtered pointing out to Mr. Byers the dangers to the balance of the herd in keeping a reactor on the premises even though she was kept in isolation and eventually Mr. Byers agreed to have the animal slaughtered.\n\nUpon slaughter Inspector Watt found lesions as outlined in his R. of A. form 70, which, he states very emphatically, were present. Mr. Byers informed me that he did not see these lesions nor had Inspector Watt shown him these lesions and that he had not asked Inspector Watt to show him these lesions. One of the reasons which accounted for him not seeing these lesions was due to the fact that he was engaged in other work attending to some other work while the post mortem was being carried out and probably was not taking the interest in it he might have. On asking him as to why he made the statement in his letter of February 26th to the Commissioner, Dominion Livestock Branch, Ottawa, that this animal, on slaughter, did not show any indication...\nMarch 30, 1931\n\nH.T.

Some of it is nine feet high with large cobs. You know from your experience in the East how important a corn crop is, and that it is necessary to put it in a silo to have much value, and as we are situated we cannot handle the crop as we have not an ensilage cutter.\n\nI thought it possible that my letter of Aug. 4th might not have come to your attention, as I feel assured that you would know how very necessary an ensilage cutter would be. We have the silo and feed is going to be scarce here this year, and also very high in price, that we wish to save everything possible and to use it in the most economical way.\n\nI realize that this is a difficult year for all concerned, but I do not see how we can get along without an ensilage cutter. It will mean the loss of several tons of fodder.\n\nI hope you will reconsider the above and that you will see your way to authorize the purchase of this. I might be able to purchase a second hand one at a reasonable price.\n\nI shall appreciate an immediate reply as the corn is ready for cutting, and I am afraid of frost.\n\nThanking you for your worthy consideration of the above favor,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKenora, Ont.\nAug. 20th, 1931\nOttawa, August 22, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Byers:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to the corn cutter required for filling the silo at the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School.\n\nOur funds this year are so limited that the Department cannot authorize the purchase of the machine which you request.

I desire to have my herd dealt\nwith under the Bang's disease policy of the Health of Animals Branch\nand do hereby agree:\n\n1. To employ at my own expense a veterinary practitioner to\ncollect blood from all of the cattle in my herd for a laboratory\ntest at intervals provided in the following sections of this\nagreement, and at any other time the Veterinary Director General\nmay consider necessary.\n\n2. That if the first test of my entire herd is negative I will\narrange to forward blood within a period of ninety days following\nfor another test, and if the herd is negative to this test I will\nforward blood a year from the date of the first test.\n\n3.(a) That I will forward blood from animals giving a questionable\nreaction at intervals of six weeks.\n\n(b) That if reactors are found at the first test or subsequent\ntests I will forward blood from all my non-reacting cattle at\nintervals of six weeks until the herd passes a negative test,\nor at any other period as required by the Veterinary Director\nGeneral. After a negative test is obtained I will forward\nblood at two successive intervals of three months each, then\nat an interval of six months, and, if negative, yearly thereafter.\n\n4. That if conditions make it necessary to establish a double\nunit herd (infected and non-infected) I will strictly isolate\nthe infected animals and remove all calves from the infected\nherd as soon as possible after birth to neutral quarters until\nthey have passed a negative test after ninety days.\n\n5. To arrange to have blood collected from cattle purchased for\naddition to my herd and forwarded for test to a laboratory approved\nby the Department of Agriculture, and not to bring them on to my\npremises until they pass the test. I further agree to keep them\nentirely apart from the cattle on my premises for one month, and\nthen forward blood for another official test. I will not add\nthem to my herd unless they pass this test.\nThe barns and outbuildings are in good repair.\n\nThe stock is as follows:\n\n- 4 Horses\n- 40 Cattle (22 cows & 18 young stock)\n- 55 Pigs (5 Sows and 50 Young)\n- 75 Sheep\n- 24 Chickens\n\nAt present, 15 cows are milking. The milking is done by machine and I was surprised to find at the night's milking that only about 50 lbs. of milk, or a little better than 3 lbs. per cow, was secured. I understand the morning supply is around 100 or 110 lbs.\n\nThe boys have nothing to do with this work, not even stripping the cows. The Principal said that the Department did not approve of this and he promised to see that the boys were given an opportunity to do some milking. I consider the purchase of the milking machines most absurd, especially when so much help is available.\n\nThe cattle, I fear, have Bangs Disease, and this is largely in the registered cattle. From information I would gather, there are 12 shorthorn cows and 7 aborted. Last year, about the same number were lost and in the previous year, there were four. I might say that I only saw 6 young calves from the total herd of 29. It may be that some were not in calf, thus the poor showing. The Principal stated that none of the cows are bred and that the bull is useless.\n\nI would recommend that this situation be discussed with the Health Branch of the Dominion Livestock Department and ask them to handle the situation under their plan for the control of infectious abortion. I understand this work will be done free of cost.\n\nAs noted, these cattle are giving little increase and the milk production is almost nil. The situation should receive immediate attention and I am at a loss to know why Mr. Byers did not place the matter before the Department.\nOttawa, November 31, 1936.\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Inspector Hamilton's report regarding his recent visit to the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nMr. Hamilton is of the opinion that the cattle have \"Bangs Disease\". He also states that the present herd is producing a very small quantity of milk.\n\nPlease let me know if the milk at present produced by the herd is sufficient to meet the demands of the school. Is this milk dangerous to the health of the pupils? The Department is rather surprised to receive this report on your herd as it was considered that you should have previously reported conditions to us.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. G. L.

Thirty head were tested; 14 Negative, 13 Positive and 3 questionable.\n\nAll of our pure breeds went down with the exception of 3.\n\nI would like to offer the following suggestion to your Department:\n\nIn view of the fact that B.I. Abortion is such a difficult disease to stamp out from a herd and also taking into consideration that other may develop the infection later, the further the most valuable part of our herd is involved, I would like to suggest that we ship the entire herd and dispose of them all, thus keep our supply of milk until school closes in July and not replace our herd until Sept. 1st. This would leave the premises free of stock for a period of over four months during which interval with a thorough disinfecting and the sunlight and fresh air, all infection should be well cleared up.\n\nAt least $1500 would be required to replace sufficient animals for our required milk supply which sum would have to be provided by the Dept. Any Proceeds from the disposal of the present herd would be required to pay for the milk supply during the four or five months.\n\nBeing as it is at the close of a severe winter during which feed was very scarce and also high in price the cattle are not in a salable condition and will not realise much.\n\nI consider it very unwise to retain any of the herd when once the infection has set in and a few months without stock would make it much more safe of any further infection.\n\nThe summer vacation being only a few months ahead will work in very well with the plan I have suggested.\n\nI shall await further instructions.\n\nI remain\n\nSir,\n\nE.W.

It is noted that, owing to the disease from which the cattle are suffering, it will be necessary to slaughter the whole herd.\n\nWith regard to replacing the cows at the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School, the Department has no intention of providing pedigreed stock. We are prepared, however, to allow a sum not exceeding $1,000 in the purchase of good grade cows that have been tested.

Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF INSPECTOR A.G. HAMILTON,\nOF THE CECILIA JEFFREY RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL,\nDATED NOVEMBER 1, 1927.\n\nThe cow barn has been whitewashed and cleaned but I found in them two head of cattle, a cow and heifer, which had been purchased to butcher. I objected to bringing in these cattle because this might lead to defeat the object of having a clean germ-free stable for some teatred cattle. I asked concerning the proposed herd and Mr. Byers stated he had partly arranged to get four Ayrshire heifers from a man near Teulon, Manitoba. The school needs milk cows not heifers and I would recommend that six or eight cows be purchased and these should be kept fresh or put to freshen. If we are planning to get milk for this winter we hardly see the use of buying cows before spring. If and when the cows are to be purchased, would it not be advisable to secure the services of a veterinary from the Health of Animals Branch here. I am informed they are willing to co-operate in any work of this nature. You will also point out that Mr. Byers has a good short horn bull which he purchased last spring at the Brandon Bull sale. I advised him at the time to wait for the result of the Bank's test in his herd; but he was determined to buy the bull, and did. I think it is a mistake to jump from one breed to another and we all must admit that the short horn cattle are hard to beat, for an all around general purpose breed. On the other hand, if he is only desirous of milk then either Holstein or Ayrshire should be selected.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, November 5, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of November 1 with reference to your recent inspection of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Principal is being written and instructed to arrange for proper supervision of the boys toilets in order that they may be kept as clean as required.\n\nRegarding the new cattle to be purchased, the Department approves of your suggestion that six or eight cows be secured at once. These should be just fresh or about to freshen. It is felt that if there is sufficient feed at the school it would be cheaper to purchase the cows now than to wait until next spring; besides funds are available at the present time. Good grade cows should be purchased.\n\nYou should inform the Principal that the Department does not approve the purchase of heifers.\n\nIt is hoped that you will be able to complete the purchase of the cows at an early date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nManitoba.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to my letter dated December 20th, No. 111-11A, re cattle for the Cecelia Jeffery School. I have tried my best to locate suitable Shorthorn cattle, but without success. I did locate four lovely Holstein cows all ready to freshen and in excellent condition\u2014none over 5 years of age. On December 29th I wrote Mr. Byers asking if he would be satisfied with this breed and if possible I would like him to see them. They were T.B. tested, also tested for Bann\u2019s disease and priced at \u00a385.00 each.\n\nI received no reply and on January 4th I wired him. On the 6th he replied that he had been ill and requested I get Ayrshire cattle and asked me to look at the herd belonging to P. O. Morin, at Leulon. I have written this man but might say they are registered stock and likely rather high in price. Mr. Byers writes, \u201cAs we cannot have the Shorthorne I would prefer Ayrshire but go ahead and use your own judgment\u201d.\n\nThe Holsteins I had in view are sold. However, I can still get good cows of this breed and eight good milkers will produce more milk than 10 or 12 Ayrshires or Shorthorns and therefore he can keep his limits.\n\nWill the purchase of Holstein cows meet your approval? I am trying to get cows just fresh or about to freshen within a month and not over six years old. A good bull can be purchased for \u00a3100.00. May I be advised at once concerning this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nJanuary 12th, 1938.\n\nL.R. R. A.

It appears to me there is little real value in the maintenance of a pedigreed herd at an Indian residential school. The purpose in maintaining these herds after all is to supply milk to the institution and provide the pupils with a certain amount of training. A Holstein herd, in my judgment, would be very satisfactory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. A. Bozy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. G.

St. Norbert.\n\nOne cow was fresh and the other nine due to freshen within six weeks, according to the records supplied. The cows were from an accredited herd and I had them tested for Bang's disease, with no reactors. They were owned by the Trappist Fathers and eight had been brought west from their farm in Quebec, a few years ago. All but two were under eight years of age and all had good udders and good teeth.\n\nThe Trappist Fathers are keeping nothing but pure bred Holsteins and thus their reason for selling. I got the exceptionally good price by taking the balance of ten cows. The freight and other expenses may run $60.00 or $70.00. I consider six of the cows purchased worth the money and I feel quite sure that Mr. Byers will be pleased.

We feel there might be some confusion if we make you a quotation now and then later on your Purchasing Agent at Ottawa would request a price on the same machines from our Head Office. If we are not correct in this matter, would you be good enough to drop us a line, when we would be glad to give you our quotations.\n\nWe sincerely hope we may have the pleasure of supplying you with your implement requirements for the season, and hope to hear from you at an early date regarding the above matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMASSEY-HARRIS COMPANY, LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\nManager, Winnipeg Branch.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nCecilia Jeffrey School\n\nKENORA, ONT.\u2014May 5th, 1938.\n\nCapt.

Stone Boat Manufacturing Co. - Other boats constructed or under construction - A busy place.\n\nWhile manufacturing plants all over the continent have been more or less beating time during the past few months due to the uncertainty of the demand for their products, the J. W. Stone Boat Manfg. Co. have been going ahead all winter as if there were no dull times. They have constructed a large number of skiffs for stock and also several large and attractive launches, for which they hope to secure a ready sale during the coming season.\n\nSplendid Boat for Indian Dept.:\n\nLast week the company commenced the construction of a large boat for the department of Indian affairs, and already the hull is in shape and giving evidence of its splendid lines. The contract was secured by them some weeks ago in open tender with large eastern boat building firms. The plans and specifications had been originally approved by Capt. F. Edwards, Indian agent for this district and he was particularly pleased that a local firm secured the contract.\n\nThe boat is 40 feet long with a beam of 8 feet 8 inches, is of the full cabin type. It will be equipped with comfortable sleeping accommodations for six persons with two bunks in the forward end and four in the after cabin. Those in the rear cabin will go up to the walls after the style of those in the standard sleeping car coaches and when not in use will only take up about five inches of space on each side. Every possible convenience in a boat of this size will be provided, including lavatory, pantry, etc. It will also be fitted with electric lights.\n\nThe motive power will be provided by a four cylinder Campbell, rated at from 29 to 40 h.p., equipped with electric starter, complete with all the latest improvements. Mr. Stone is proud of the model and the material going into the construction of the boat is perfect. Speaking to the Mining and News representative yesterday, Mr. Stone said it was his ideal of a boat and apparently he is determined to produce a boat satisfactory to himself and his customers and one particularly adapted to navigation of the Lake of the Woods.\n\nIn addition to the comfort and general utility of the boat, it will be capable of carrying large quantities of supplies, which is sometimes necessary in the work carried on by the Indian agent. The cost of the boat will be from $4,500 to $5,000.\n\nThe above is a clipping from the KENORA paper\n\nJune 15, 1922 - Gasoline launch \"Minifred E\" - Contract price $4,418. Accessories, including the starter, tools, etc., brought the total cost to $4,874.53\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER dated Ottawa, April 27, 1923,\naddressed to Frank Edwards, Indian Agent, Kenora, Ont.\n\nAs you were informed by our telegram of yesterday's date, we have purchased here a 55' launch for the Cecilis Jeffrey Indian Boarding School. The purchase of this boat was made on the approval of the Purchasing Commission of Canada, after a thorough inspection and trial in the water by a consulting naval engineer of the Naval Service.\n\nThe boat is a very heavily built V bottom boat, 55' long, nearly 9' beam, good freeboard, has a small cabin with washroom and toilet forward which will comfortably take care of two people. The engine is under a bridge deck to which all controls are led, leaving a very roomy cockpit aft for passengers or freight. The motive power is a four cylinder \"Sterling\", 45 H.P., motor, which gives a cruising speed of 13 miles and an easy maximum of 15 miles, and is a very dependable unit. The name of the boat is always kept if the Principal wishes, he may choose to give any name he desires. The price is $2,750 F.O.B. cars Ottawa. The boat was built by Meloche, Montreal, and is three years old. It is in perfect running order, and has capacity for at least two tons of freight. We are quite satisfied that this boat will meet the requirements, and will be found satisfactory in all respects for the purpose for which it is required. You will be advised of the date of shipment, which, it is expected, will be in the course of the next few days.\n\n(Signed) J. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy & Secretary.\nCOPY\n\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE\n\nKenora, Ontario,\n2nd June, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Launch shipped from Ottawa has arrived in good condition.\n\nIt is not as suitable for the Cecilia School as the one we had built here, owing to the amount of freight the School have to transport, and the Principal very much prefers to have the one we had. I have therefore given him ours and will keep the one sent from Ottawa.\n\nTo make this Launch suitable, we shall have to put a shoe and deadwood on same, lower the floor in the afterpart about 6 or 10 inches; have a light roof built over the boat strong enough to carry a light canoe, install a small generator and wet battery for electric lights and horn, also put in larger tanks for gasoline and we shall then have a more suitable boat than our old one, and it will not be a credit to the Department.\n\nThese alterations will not cost a great deal, and I shall be glad to receive instructions to have these things done at as little expense as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards,\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, December 9th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letters of the 18th and 29th ultimo, concerning the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School launch. The overhauling of the engine and the painting of the boat should be paid for by the school authorities. The Department will meet the other costs of repairing the boat, which you have estimated at $400.00. Please make the necessary arrangements and see that the launch is properly stored for the winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd.) A. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nKenora,\nFebruary 17, 1931\n\nE. W. Byers, Esq.,\nCecilia Jeffrey School,\nTown.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 16th inst., we consider that all the repairs necessary to the Cecilia Jeffrey School boat were necessary owing to the boat being sunk and partially wrecked. All the new planking and woodwork that was put into this boat had to have at least 3 coats of paint in order to be brought up to the finish of the rest of the boat and on account of all these new pieces being put into the boat it was necessary to paint the whole launch inside and out. The work made necessary on the engine was due to the boat having been sunk. We had to install a new coil, put new parts in distributor and magneto as well as take the engine all apart and properly overhaul and clean it.\n\nTrusting that this is the information you require, we are,\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe J. W. Stone Boat Mfg. Co. Ltd.\nJ. W. Stone\nManager.\nCECILIA JEFFREY SCHOOL\n\nKenora, Ont., Feb. 19th, 1931.\n\nCapt. Frank Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith an account rendered by the Stone Boat Manufacturing Co., for repairs on boat.\n\nI am also enclosing a letter from this same firm stating that all work done on this boat was on account of its having been wrecked.\n\nWe have also had an additional expense of re-equipping the boat. We had a full outfit of dishes and cooking utensils including a stove and all these were lost or destroyed. The pike pole was also lost and so was the anchor.\n\nThe boat was sent out in good condition having been overhauled a short time previously by Stone Co. We were also obliged to engage an engineer to give the engine an overhauling as we could not work the clutch which had been damaged and one of the Tappet rods was stripped. The engineer's time cost us over $60.\n\nThe total expense incurred should not be any charge against the school as we sent the boat out in good condition and it was not in as good a condition after the above work had been done on it.\n\nI shall appreciate it if you will explain this to the Department.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd.) E. W. Byers,\nPrincipal.\nKenora, Ontario,\nMarch 5th, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReference your letter IP9-2-14 of December 9th, 1929, re part payment for overhauling and painting the Cecilia Jeffrey School Launch, which the Department stated they would pay $400.00 for. We inclose Voucher for the amount of $400.00, the account is for $684.00 less the balance of $284.00, which according to your letter should be paid by the School authorities. We also inclose a letter from the Principal and a letter from the Stone Boat Co. to the Principal.\n\nIt is quite possible that the Dishes, Cooking Utensils, and Stove were lost or spoiled by the water, but the R.C.M.P. Police inform us that the Anchor was brought in.\n\nIn our opinion the clutch must have been defective when the boat went out, and the cause of the damage was through the clutch going wrong. The Principal thinks we should pay the full $584.00, but if the boat did not spoil the boat, I think the School should pay the difference in the Bill, or if they do not feel they should pay for the upkeep of the boat, it could be disposed of, although it is very handy for the R.C.M.P. Police returning children to the Schools but not used very much by the School Authorities, but if the Principal wishes to keep the boat, we do not think he should complain at paying for the upkeep, although we admit on this occasion, the boat was not being used on school business but on department service and the R.C.M.P. Police and Provincial Police were with it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards,\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 13, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 108-13 of the 5th instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, together with a voucher covering the cost of repairs made to the school launch.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that, when our new appropriation is available, a cheque to the amount of $400, being the sum this Department agreed to provide, will be forwarded to the J. W. Stone Boat Mfg. Co., Ltd., Kenora. This is the full amount of the cost of the repairs that the Department can provide.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nThe attached correspondence is a complete review of the action taken in connection with the boat at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.

The report was signed by T. O. Sprague and countersigned by J. A. McLellan. It reads as follows:\n\n\"The Trappist Fathers and T. L. Townsend's herd passed a clean sixty day test on Nov. 16th & 17th 1934 and are dealt with under the Restricted Area Regulations in the Port Garry Mlyb., Manitoba.\n\n\"These 10 head of cows all proved negative to the test for Infectious Abortion, samples of blood being taken on Feb. 18th 1935.

Hoey,\nDirector of Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nLast Autumn I received notification from your Department that our present herd of cattle should be disposed of owing to the prevalence of Bang's Disease.\n\nI would like to have authority to dispose of them now before turning them out on the grass as they would lose considerable weight when turned out especially the first two or three weeks.\n\nIt appears to me as a very serious mistake on Mr. Hamilton's part after our going to considerable trouble to clean up our premises after the former outbreak in our herd to go and purchase a new herd from the Trappists' Monastery who were selling part of their herd because of the prevalence of Bang's disease. He did have a test made but I certainly would not have gone near a herd whose Bang's disease existed.\n\nI would like your consent to dispose of the herd as soon as possible. Yours very truly,\n\nE W Eyers\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, May 8, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of a letter received by the Department from Mr. E. W. Byers, Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey residential school.\n\nI am anxious that you should take immediate steps to dispose of the herd of cattle now at the Cecilia Jeffrey school. All the cows at the school and the bull, if there is one, should be disposed of. If there is no local demand, you should consider the advisability of having the cattle shipped to Winnipeg and sold at the stock yards. When you have disposed of the cattle you should, either personally or through the local agent, undertake a program at the school which will result in the complete disinfection of the barn, stables, utensils, etc. I have never been convinced in my own mind that the clean-up program undertaken prior to the purchase of the last herd of cattle was in any sense complete. The records here indicate that the cattle purchased by you were according to our own up-to-date tests free of Bang's Disease when they reached the institution.\n\nThe money received from the sale of the present herd should be kept in trust for the purchase of a small number of good grade cattle toward the beginning of October. I regret to state that with our educational appropriation substantially reduced, funds other than the funds received from the sale of the herd now at the school will not be available for additional purchases.\n\nYour immediate attention to this matter will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMr. A. O. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n534 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nOttawa, May 8, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of May 5, in which you seek authority to dispose of the herd of cattle now at the Cecilia Jeffrey school, owing to the prevalence of Bang's Disease.\n\nI am today communicating with Inspector Hamilton and asking him to take immediate steps to dispose of these cattle. The money received from this sale should be put in a trust account and kept for the purchase of a small number of heifers toward the beginning of October. In the meantime, a clean-up program should be undertaken at the barn.

Basowsky\nWinnipeg, Manitoba,\nMay 17th, 1940.\n\nI, T. Basowsky of Fort William, Ontario, wish to purchase\nthe herd of twenty-one (21) head of cattle at the\nCecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, Kenora, Ontario.\nI am aware that a number of these cattle have reacted\nto the Bangs test. The cattle will be slaughtered and,\nunder no circumstances, will they be sold for breeding\npurposes.\n\nSigned [Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nand Ottawa. If consideration is given, I think the amount should not greatly exceed $400.00. We would then have $600.00 left and this would perhaps purchase five or six head. Some about to fatten will cost what is required from $75.00 to $100.00 each. A suitable bull will cost at least $150.00. It is my opinion that $700.00 will be required to replace the cattle.\n\nWould the Department request the Director of the Health of Animals Branch at Ottawa, to issue full and complete instructions as to the cleaning of the stables and premises. I would like a copy of these instructions.\n\nI hope the action taken, and the sale of the cattle for $700.00, meets the Department's approval.\n\nThe money has been deposited in the Manitoba Inspectorate Indian Trust Account.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nEnc.\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter 129-3-14 dated May 6th, re sale of cattle at Cecilia Jeffrey School, as some of these cattle are diseased, they must be sold for slaughter. Otherwise our Department might come in for severe criticism.\n\nThere was no local demand, but a local man, Mr. Alex Steele, made a bid of $450.00. A Mr. T. Kowalsky from Fort William also bids cattle from Ft. William to Winnipeg and has previously made purchases from Mr. Steele, bid $700.00. He gave a signed statement, a copy of which is enclosed, which should protect the Department. He affirms that the cattle are to be slaughtered in Fort William and, under no circumstances, are they to be sold for breeding. I have accepted this bid.\n\nThese cattle could have been shipped to two stockyards in Winnipeg but the reactors would be valueless as they were prepared to pay only for the hide. The other cattle would be valued at from $6 to $8 dressed. I was afraid that after paying freight and all other expenses of loading, unloading and slaughtering, our share would be almost 'NIL'.\n\nMr. Byers pointed out that seven head should be considered school property and that the school should receive a share of the selling price. He pointed out that such would be the case in the placing of a new herd at the school, but this did not meet his wish. He did, however, agree to leave the matter with the Church Officials and Ottawa...........\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA,\nOnt.\nOttawa,\nMay 27, 1940.\n\nDear Miss Lang:\n\nOwing to the prevalence of Bang's Disease in the herd of cattle at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School it was arranged to dispose of the whole herd and an amount of $700.00 was obtained. This sum is being held in trust by Mr. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Winnipeg, Man., and will be used to pay, in part at least, for the purchase of healthy cattle in the fall.\n\nIt is our intention to issue instructions for thoroughly cleaning the stable at the Cecilia Jeffrey School and to leave it unused for the next three or four months. In this manner it is hoped that all contagions will be removed and that, when the new herd is purchased, the same difficulty will not occur as in the past.\n\nThere were 81 head of cattle in the herd and Mr. Byers pointed out to James Hamilton that 7 head should be considered school property and that the school should receive a share of the selling price. In reply Mr. Hamilton advised him that such would be the case in the placing of a new herd at the school; and although this did not apparently meet Mr. Byers' wishes he consented to leave the matter to the joint decision of yourself and the Department. I am inclined to recommend we still agree to following the full $700.00 be kept in trust until the new herd is purchased and this amount can then be used for buying the cattle required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMiss J.

The only cows I could purchase were the culled. A farmer with a good cow would not part with it. This is due largely to the fact that there is no sale market and farmers hope to make their living from dairy products. Good milk cows have gone up in price. Mr. Wilson, of Roland, told me he sold a dairy cow last week at a sale in the stockyards here for $112.00, and I believe this is about the price that is now being asked for good milk cows.\n\nOn my return today I interviewed Mr. Diamond, of Diamond & Kars, to see if he had any suitable cows. I was greatly impressed with some 8 or 10 which he now has on hand, from which I can make a selection. These will cost in the neighborhood of $90.00 per head, tested both for tuberculosis and Bang's disease. Mr. Diamond is selling cows every day; therefore these may be gone at any time.\n\nI am positive it will be difficult and expensive to continue searching throughout the country for 6 or 7 cows, and would therefore request authority by wire to make the purchase from Mr. Diamond. Time is an important factor because these cows may be sold any day. I would request that the Department give its approval at once. The Government veterinary will inspect and test these cows when requested.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC. G.

G.

These seven cows will cost $656.00 in Winnipeg. This will leave only $35.00 out of the $700.00 now on hand. The transportation from here to Kenora will cost approximately $30.00.\n\nThese cows are all fresh or about to freshen; consequently it will be necessary to purchase a bull. It would be a waste of money to test these cows and then have them bred by a bull located in the Kenora area. I have located a bull which has just passed the Bang's Disease and the tuberculosis tests. He is slightly over a year old and has registration papers. The price is $80.00, and he could be sent to Kenora along with the seven cows without any further cost for transportation.\n\nI would like authority by wire to expend an extra $15.00 in order to purchase this bull, and the transportation amounting to approximately $30.00 will be vouchered for and can be paid from Ottawa. It is important that I receive authority at once as I intend to ship the cattle Friday, October 11th.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. H.

All were tested for tuberculosis and Bang's Disease. All passed the tuberculosis test, but two went down on the test for Bang's Disease. I wanted to purchase seven more, selected two more and again one went down on the Bang's Disease test. However, I now had seven cows and one bull, all having passed both tests.\n\nFour cows are fresh and three will freshen shortly. They are all well bred Holstein cattle, and with care and food should produce a good supply of milk.\n\nIn Manitoba we have only a few herds tested for Bang's Disease. The cattle in these herds are all pure bred, and none was for sale. I was, therefore, obliged to select cows from unlisted stock, test them, and take those passing the test. The cattle will be shipped by truck today.\n\nI was fortunate in securing the seven cows and 1 registered bull for $700.00, and as that is the amount held in trust here I will issue a cheque as payment in full to Mr. Diamond.

However, I now had seven cows and one bull, all having passed both tests.\n\n\"Four cows are fresh and three will freshen shortly. They are all well bred Holstein cattle, and with care and feed should produce a good supply of milk.\n\n\"In Manitoba we have only a few herds tested for Bang's Disease. The cattle in these herds are all pure bred, and none was for sale. I was, therefore, obliged to select cows from untested stock, test them, and take those passing the test. The cattle will be shipped by truck today.\"\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. F. Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nR.A. Heey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nCOPY\n\nCECILIA JEFFREY PRESBYTERIAN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nKENORA - ONTARIO\n\nJune 30, 1941.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Building,\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will remember our conversation of some time ago, when I spoke to you of our need for a larger herd of Dairy Cows.\n\nThe herd which you purchased for us last October has indeed proved excellent. We have been able to hold production close to 150 lbs. per day all through the winter and spring. They all proved to be still free of T.B. when recently tested. We have not as yet had them tested for Bang's disease.\n\nIs it the desire of your Office that we also have these tested for Bang's Disease.\n\nAlthough the present herd is doing very well it consists only of seven cows. They produce about 15 gallons per day but we consume about 21 gallons per day. This means considerable extra expense.\n\nSince we have all necessary feed, all necessary labour, sufficient Stable space, we feel that we could just as easily handle more cows. The overhead for a small herd is practically as great as for a larger herd.\n\nI believe that everything possible is being done to prevent further occurrence of disease in the cattle.\n\nIn view of our needs, and ability to handle more cows, I would respectfully ask that you take whatever steps are necessary to purchase for us (or allow us to purchase ourselves) at least a further seven cows. We would ask that we might have these for September, when school reopens.\n\nThanking you for your past help in this, and anticipating such help for our new herd,\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n(Signed) D.E. Pitts, Principal.\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed is a copy of a letter received from Mr. D. S. Pitts, Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School, Kenora, Ontario.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Pitts is well pleased with the stock already purchased for the school. I would draw your attention to the third paragraph of his letter, where he requests instruction as to re-testing his herd for Bang's Disease. Kindly advise if yearly tests are considered necessary.\n\nGood milk cows will, I am sure, cost $125.00 each, f.o.b. Kenora, so that 6 cows would cost at least $750.00. In view of the interest taken in the stock by Mr. Pitts and the fact that he already has feed, a considerable amount having been left over from last year, I would recommend that the purchase be authorized if funds can be secured.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa,\nJuly 8, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant enclosing copy of letter received from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School requesting the Department to purchase 5 cows. I note that you could secure these at a cost of $125.00 each F.o.b. Kenora.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation an amount of $800.00 was provided for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Cecilia Jeffrey School. We have already purchased new stove for this school at a cost of $644.00 and in today's mail I have a request for paint which will probably cost $125.00. This makes a total expenditure of $813.00 and leaves a balance of $187.00 still available. In a letter from Indian Agent Edwards he states that the mattresses are in very bad shape and will have to be replaced. I do not know just how many are required or what they will cost. However, if a large number of mattresses are necessary the amount of the present year's appropriation still unexpended will be exhausted. I doubt if we can provide funds for the number of cows suggested by the Principal but I feel we can secure the amount necessary to purchase two additional cows at the price mentioned in your letter. You may, therefore, arrange for their purchase and delivery to the school.\n\nI believe the Principal should arrange for yearly tests for Bang's Disease.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir:\n\nI acknowledge your letter 129-3-14 dated July 8, regarding the purchase of cattle for the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, Kenora, Ontario.\n\nIn view of the closing paragraph, might it not be advisable to make our test for Bang's Disease prior to enlarging the herd, as one never knows what results might be obtained.\n\nI would also suggest, provided we find no reactors, that Mr. Pitts be allowed to purchase the two cows locally, subject to all tests. I am doing this because transportation on the herd from Winnipeg to Kenora will, no doubt, be quite high. The last shipment was made by truck and was a full load, and thus shipping charges were kept at a minimum.\n\nKindly advise if my suggestions meet with your approval. If it is not possible to secure suitable cows near Kenora, it will then be necessary to purchase in Winnipeg.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa, July 17, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 14th instant, I feel it would be advisable to make a visit for Bang's Plaisance prior to enlarging the herd at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nIf there are no reactors, you may authorize purchase of two cows locally, on the understanding that the cost of these animals will not exceed the prices mentioned in your letter of the 14th instant.\n\nI note that if it is not possible to secure suitable cows at Kenora you will arrange for purchase in Winnipeg.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n588 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOctober 20, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI would refer to Departmental letter dated July 17, 1941, File 129-8-14, regarding cows for the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School, Kenora.\n\nMr. Pitts, in a letter just received, states that the herd purchased last year has passed the Bang's Disease test with no reactors.\n\nSuitable cows, tested for Bang's Disease, can be purchased at Kenora. I saw these cows and consider them a good buy. There are 5 registered Holstein cows and one grade together with one heifer calf eligible for registration. The price of these is $400.00. Mr. Pitts can raise $100.00. Will the Department supply $300.00, which is only $50.00 more than the amount already authorized? The cows are reasonably priced and should pretty well supply the school's needs.\n\nThe cattle purchased last year have received good care. There are 3 nice heifers which undoubtedly will make high grade cows. I trust consideration can be granted for this increased expenditure. Mr. Pitts assures me he has plenty of feed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nOctober 30, 1941.\n\nACTING DEPARTMENTAL SUPERINTENDENT\n\nRe: Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, Kenora, Ontario.\n\nThe herd at this school developed Bang's disease in 1940 and had to be totally destroyed.\n\nThe barns were thoroughly cleaned and some new cattle were purchased last fall. A recent test of these cattle showed that they are free of Bang's Disease.\n\nInspector Hamilton recommends that we purchase some additional cattle. He states that he can secure 3 registered Holstein cows, 1 grade cow and 1 heifer calf at a total cost of $400.00. The Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey School is prepared to provide $100.00 of this amount from school funds.

Paterson,\nSuperintendent, Kenora Agency,\nKENORA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Paterson:\n\nFollowing our recent conversation Re above noted, I wish to present the following information:\n\nAbout the end of last June, we found it necessary to kill our Pedigree Bull for the following reasons:\u2014(a) he was over two years an herd sire and was therefore approaching the time when his calves (heifers) needed to be bred. (b) he was becoming very dangerous.\n\nWhile visiting in Ottawa in July, I mentioned that we were considering Artificial Insemination. The Department officials were quite interested. However after considerable delay in answering our correspondence at Guelph, (O.A.O.) we find that the Artificial method is doubtful in results.\n\nTherefore, we are in need of a new Bull.\n\nFurther, in Consultation with Mr. Watt, who is with the Health of Animals Division, we have found that since we have a listed herd, (free of both T.B. and Bang's Disease) we may only bring a Bull from a listed herd into our herd. There is only one listed herd in Manitoba\u2014Holsteins.\n\nWhile in the East early in February, I found that Mr. Geo. F. Brennan, 15 College Ave., Guelph, fieldman for the Holstein Association, or Mr. Lorne Brubacker, 67 Weber St., Kitchener, Ont. would both be able to secure such animals. Also Mr. Ted Townsend, of Rockwood Holsteins, S. S. Herbert Man. might have some information Re purchase in the West.\n\nWe wonder if the Department would assist in the purchase of this animal, since they appear anxious that we maintain our listing. We should need an animal, Registered, Listed negative, and ready for immediate service.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario\n\nRe: Hard Sire, Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School\n\nA letter has been received from Mr. D.E. Pitts, Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, in connection with the necessity of purchasing a hard sire for the herd of Holstein at the school.\n\nA copy of Mr. Pitt's letter is attached for your information.\n\nIt is recommended that this request for a registered bull, receive your favourable consideration.\n\nNorman Paterson,\nSuperintendent,\nKenora Indian Agency.\nMarch 8, 1946.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 3rd instant, file 106-13 (129) enclosing a letter from the principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey School requesting us to purchase a herd sire. It is the practice of the Department to only supply cattle when a residential school is started. The school management has always been expected to keep the herd to the number required.

The step-father refuses to have anything to do with the above boy and the school has given him shelter and food and clothing for over a year.\n\nWe have not entered his name on the register previous to this quarter, the Church having assumed the expense of caring for him.\n\nWe have had a new teacher take charge of the room in which this boy was and she entered his name with the others taking it for granted he was a regularly enrolled pupil.\n\nThis boy has never been very strong physically and he contracted whooping-cough, then tonsillitis then basal pharyngitis and passed away during the night of the twentieth of present month. The Church provided him also a grave and in so doing avoided his being sent to hospital in which case there would have been considerable expense placed on the Department.\n\nI am sorry his name appeared on the last quarterly return but I have never been able to comprehend why he was never allowed to be admitted as a pupil. His mother is a member of our Church, his father was Anglican, and as for his age we have had pupils just as young as he.\n\nHad we turned him out of the school I do not think he would have found a welcome anywhere.

I think it might be operated on the present basis for a while until we can see clearly whether there is a local need for it and whether any considerable number of pupils from that district could be accommodated at the Ringwood Home. Steps will be taken to permit the authorities of the latter school to recruit for pupils in these districts during the summer; as it is highly desirable to have a full quota of pupils at the opening of the session. The necessary instructions will issue to have the kitchen plastered, the present building painted, and certain necessary repairs made to the place.\n\nOf course, if under any new arrangement the per capita sum is granted is increased so long as we continue the Boarding School it will receive the benefit of the increased rate.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Rt.

The school was closed on June 5 on account of sickness, and the average attendance for the period it was open was 28. There is provision for 40 pupils.\n\nI think that the excessive death rate at this school should be enquired into. We have no record of any of the pupils having been medically examined before admission, as they were nearly all enrolled before the school was placed on a per capita grant.\n\nI would suggest that a medical man should examine the pupils and any that are unfit should be discharged and that Mr. Agent West be instructed to attend to this matter and report to the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOTTAWA September 4, 1900.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nThe return from the Chapleau Boarding School for the June quarter shows that seven of the pupils died during that term out of an enrollment of 32.\n\nIn view of this excessive death rate the Department has to request that you will have an examination of the pupils in the school made by Dr. Thibault and any who are physically unfit should be mentioned by name and register number, with the nature of the ailment. The Department would also like to have a general report from you on the condition of the school and pupils.\n\nIn future no pupils are to be taken into this school without passing a thorough medical examination and a supply of blank forms for this purpose will be sent you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.

The drugs should be pure and of the best quality, and shipment should be made to the Principal of the Indian Boarding School at Chapleau, Ont.

Harrison, I.T., I.C.,\nPineau & Cumberland Sts.,\nOttawa, Ont.\nproceed with the erection of a new building and, as con-\nsiderable time must elapse before a new building could be\nprovided, the Department will be pleased if Your Lordship\ncan find it convenient to visit the Anglican Boarding\nSchool at an early date and see that the necessary steps\nare taken to provide for the mental and material welfare\nof the children. It is absolutely necessary that this\nshould be done if the school is to be kept on.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAss't Deputy and Secretary.\nThe school will accommodate and has pushed economy to the limit.\n\nThe Department is paying rent for a house for Mr. Prever in the town of Chapleau, in which he has his furniture stored, and if a proper staff is furnished him it will be necessary for his family to take up their residence there, as the school building would not accommodate his family and staff.\n\nThe equipment is primitive and inadequate. In a climate like Chapleau a sufficient supply of blankets should be provided. The bed clothing is not sufficient for the needs of the school and at the time of the inspection only two outfits of winter clothing had been received. The school is dependent on outside aid for clothing, which is furnished by the Women's Auxiliary, and without a regular supply the children are liable to suffer. The attic was full of an accumulation of articles which had been sent for the use of the school which were unsuitable and as a consequence the children were poorly and insufficiently clothed.\n\nSeveral of the people in the town who claim to be interested in the school gave it as their opinion that the children were not properly fed. The reason for this may be that Mr. Prever purchases little if anything in the town. He had a good stock of provisions on hand and no lack of good food was apparent. Mr. Prever had no notice of the intended visit and the officer who inspected the school considers that he found conditions in an ordinary state when his unexpected visit was made.\n\nThe Department recognizes the fact that the building at Chapleau is not suited to the needs of a residential school and regrets that it has not been able to proceed.\nthen being used by any of the pupils.\n\nThe present building is not adapted for anything like the number of pupils in the school, there being no study or recreation room. The girls have only the laundry and wash room, which is too cramped for the purpose, and the boys have the use of the summer kitchen, which is too cold for a play-room.\n\nMr. Prover, the Principal, has virtually no assistants outside of his own family, who live in the school and do nearly all the work connected with it. Mr. Prover acts as principal, teacher, man of all work and has general supervision and management of the school.\n\nThe forty children are divided into six grades and none of them have been higher than the third book. Mr. Prover's young daughter, who is not more than fifteen years of age, takes the classes when he is called away for other duties. This should be remedied and a qualified teacher appointed.\n\nMrs. Prover acts as matron, cook and does most of the general housework. There is a young girl from Manitoulin Island, who had only been there about two weeks, engaged as assistant, but she had had no previous experience, and during the short time she had been there she had contracted scrofula from the pupils. There was also an Indian widow with a two year old child engaged a few days previous to the inspection to attend to the patching and mending of the clothes.\n\nMr. Prover is reported to be a hard working man, who devotes his whole time and energy to the school and is doing his best to carry it on on the government grant and in his anxiety to make ends meet he has taken in more pupils than\nOttawa, December 29, 1918.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nEarly this month the Chapleau Boarding School was visited by an officer of this Department and report of his inspection shows that the school fails to come up to the requirements of the Department.\n\nThere were forty pupils in residence, twenty-seven in the main building and thirteen of the bigger boys sleep over the school-room in a separate building. The main building is not adapted for twenty-seven pupils, twenty-two being all that the air and floor space should accommodate.\n\nAt the time of the inspection the eldest girl in the school was occupying one of the smaller dormitories on account of tubercular trouble and some of the smaller boys had to sleep two in a bed on this account. This girl was in a bad way and should not have been kept in the school. She has since been placed in the Chapleau Hospital.\n\nA number of the smaller children were badly affected with eczema and apparently no steps had been taken to check the spread of the disease and, unless proper provision is made for washing and the cleanliness of the pupils, this disease is likely to spread through the whole school, in fact the Principal's own daughter had contracted it.\n\nThe washing facilities are most primitive, as there are only a few hand basins and one bath tub, which has no waste pipe and, although each child is supposed to have a separate towel, there is no visible means of preventing\n\nRight Rev. John B. Anderson,\nBishop of Moose Cree,\nCochrane, Ont.\nOttawa, January 4, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Benson of this Department, who visited Chapleau early last month, reported that besides the girl who developed tuberculosis at the Chapleau Boarding School there were several children afflicted with scrofula who had apparently not been receiving treatment. The Department would like these children to be attended to by Dr. Sheehan, the medical attendant for the Chapleau Indians, and you will be good enough to request him to visit this school at regular intervals or when specially called upon. As a remuneration for this extra service the Department will be prepared to give him an increase of $100.00 per annum from the last instant. Please advise the Department of his acceptance of this offer and inform the Principal of the school accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAss't Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWm. McLeod, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\nCamp or house of Indians without seeing some of the children with the marks of this skin disease, but it is not the expected that it can be eradicated at least from after this afternoon.\n\nI do not see what more could have been done in this case.\n\nThe most serious matter was the case of Francis Chabot, badly affected with consumption. This girl was a fine child, well fed, affectionate, kind, and very bright. She had been ill for several months, but she seemed to get worse instead of better. She had always appeared to be weak, but she seemed to get worse instead of better.\n\nThe doctor was called, and when he arrived, he found that she had been ill for several months. He diagnosed her illness as consumption. She was sent to the hospital, where she died shortly thereafter.\n\nThere has been much discussion about the cause of this illness. Some believe it was due to a lack of proper care, while others believe it was caused by a lack of proper nutrition. It is important to note that this case is not unique, and similar cases have been reported in other parts of the country.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge all concerned parties to take action to prevent the spread of this illness. It is our duty to ensure that those who are suffering receive the care they need.\n3.\n\nEarly commencement of the new school.\n\nI have received a criticism of the condition of the school based on the report of the Board's inspection. This I will answer in due time after I have visited the school, about which I expect to be able to do at an early date. I will only say at this present time that I also received a letter from the Principal on his Inspector visits comparing the two reports. I must say this is most incongruous. As stated previously last October, I knew then the school in much better condition and working order. All the boys and girls had been duties & everything seemed in excellent shape. There were also horses and cows and plenty to attend to, all the things that go with such property, which has never been before. The only difference now, perhaps, was a distance and from Mr. Anderson's residence, the fact of 5 weeks in September & December divided by school several times. But we have the few extra pupils, so that my feeling is, I am speaking from the standpoint of the Board's report in the criticism, among act of his work, is not altogether fair. The management of the school, the school for instance, the concern that very prevalent in the school that nothing apparently has been done to prevent its spreading, but that place, the Andersons think that this is not correct. They were told by the nation that they had been away an instant for the trouble all along. And another thing, the trouble stems off each child in perhaps and did not in the least affect their health. The fact of the matter is that it is a very common trouble with Indian children. Surely, we visit a\npromises made by the Department last spring, which were confirmed by Mr. Murray himself to me while we were having our dinner at the Albany Hotel last summer; that we would be occupying the new building this winter. I accordingly wrote to Mr. Murray to do his best in getting these funds. He did so, but very unsuccessfully. This is a most difficult matter to refuse to settle the children after you have accepted them from their parents and held them in your care. Of course, it is not easy to put off the struggle in favor of some other, sometimes much more urgent, but the result has been that nearly all promised were either bought by the parents or sent back with the children. It would seem that we have already 4 more pupils than we could have for the accommodation, and 10 old faces at the Ringwood. However, this is thought to be said that a good dozen of the children are very fine. It stands to reason that a child, but 7 years old, not yet able to write, will grow up and be here in five years. All conditions are unsatisfactory, especially as from the possibility of making satisfactory workers, Mr. Murray has had to remain in the building. Since he needed care supervision at the school, several months have elapsed and there has been no opportunity to display. Mr. Murray has been forced to make a living except for some provisions and supplies for the school, which could not have been kept in the school house due to the difficulties and inconveniences that result from occupying the present undesirable building. It was decided when first known...\nCathcart,\nJuly 19\n\nD.C. Smith Esq.,\nAssistant Chief, General Office of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nMy dear Mr. Smith,\n\nI am writing you in regard to matters connected with the Cathcart School, which are pressing.\n\n(1) We have had 45 Indian children brought to the school from Cathcart, whose funds aggregated over $3,000. These children were offered the school at Cathcart as a result of the yearly payment made by last summer. Mr. Brown, who was there and who signed the contract, thought it wise to accept them in view of the expectations that the new school would be built. This is nothing in the contract to show that the Department has any obligation to pay the fees, so far as the inference is that the Division is responsible for the completion of all cases. Mr. Smith's specific offer in this regard, that the Department will not pay the remaining expenses after paying some or all of these fees, is not a very distant date. We have paid fees often for the children from Biscay, Newmarket, etc., etc., etc., and we do not mind that I thought that the Department would consider this an exceptional circumstance, and be willing to pay such fees.\n\n(2) I hope that you are now in a position to fill the deficiency when the new school will be completed. This is a most important matter. You know that I really embarked upon...\nIt will be directed him to visit the institution, and I hope that good will result from this and Your Lordship's proposed visit.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nI regret exceedingly that I am not able to say anything very reassuring concerning the early erection of the new building. You will readily understand that the Government must curtail expenditure along certain lines at least, to an extent as great as possible. For this reason the Department may be unable to procure funds for extensive building operations. However, the Chapleau school will be one of the first to receive attention if funds are available.\n\nI note your remarks with regard to Mr. Benson's report upon conditions at the school, but shall leave consideration of them over until such time as Your Lordship has had an opportunity of visiting this school.\n\nI am pleased to be able to correct Your Lordship's impression with regard to charges made into the management of the school. No letters from any person in Chapleau have been received by the Department, although, through an indirect source we were informed that conditions were not altogether satisfactory. Just at the time it chanced that Mr. Benson was going to visit the school on other business, and as we have not had an inspection of this school for sometime, I thought\nJanuary 23rd, 1915.\n\nMy dear Bishop Anderson,\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 19th instant, in reference to the Chapleau Boarding School. Mr. Benson is at present confined to his home through illness. I thought, however, that I would like to acknowledge your letter and deal with some of the matters.\n\nIt is not the policy of the Department to pay for the transportation of children to boarding and industrial schools, only in cases where the children are sent or committed to the school by the orders of the Department. This policy is closely adhered to. As some of our Western schools have to face the same difficulty, having to recruit at long distances, it is not possible to make an exception in the case of the Chapleau school. I am sorry therefore that I cannot comply with your request.\n\nFr. Rev. J. A. Anderson,\nBishop of Moosonee,\nCochrane, Ont.\nFebruary 12th, 1915.\n\nDear Dr. Colquhoun,\n\nThe Department has an Indian boarding school situated close to the town of Chapleau in the district of Algoma. I would like very much to have the institution inspected by the Inspector of Public Schools for that district as is done with the Shingwauk Home, Baillie Ste. Marie. I would ask you, therefore, to be good enough to give instructions to the Inspector of that district to visit that school when he goes to Chapleau, and furnish him with the necessary blank forms, etc.; the usual fee will be allowed him.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nA.

I was also informed\nthat Mr. Mr. Reynolds had made no statement regarding the\nschool but in the town that he was well satisfied with\nits condition.\n\nI found by sight, in evidence, the soil placed in the Chapleau\nhospital during cold and arctic soil and boy taken as invalids\nsince Mr. Reynolds' inspection. This means that twenty-\nfour of the Orphanage pupils are accommodated in the main building,\na little increase of space limit. I suggested the removal of two\nof these boys to the school-room building, which has an apartment\nat its west end at present floor that will easily accommodate\ntwo more children bed can be added in the attic dormitory.\n\nI may add that in arranging for the attic dormitory and making\nthe necessary alterations, the Principal had in mind the fact\nthat the building which allows for pupils. I would remind\nyou that previous existence of the outside dormitory, etc.\nDiocese of Edmonton\n\nJOHN G. ANDERSON\nBISHOP\n\nI have received your letter regarding the inspection of the buildings at Fort Macleod. I feel that it was a mistake not to have sent someone there to inspect them. The Department has been considering allowing us that number of students, but we cannot afford to allow any more. We have already had too many students under our supervision. This year we have added two new classes in view of the promised new building. We need to provide for the alternation of the classes so that we can provide for the increased accommodation as well as to prepare for the larger numbers in the new school.\n\nI am investigating the case of the student who has since died. It appears that she was suffering from tuberculosis, which is why she was removed from the school. We have arranged for her to be placed in a hospital, where she will receive proper treatment.\n\nI am enclosing a report on the condition of the buildings and the number of students we can accommodate. We need to ensure that we do not overburden ourselves with too many students.\n\nThank you for your prompt response.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, School Files (1875-1930), Volume 26, File 146-1, part 1\nIt is not true that \"no steps had been taken to check the spread of typhoid.\" The local doctor had been notified and his prescription was used. The danger of serious harm or death in this connection, as I stated in former letters to the Deputy Superintendent, was suspected. Indian children are very susceptible to these skin troubles, and it is not to be expected that they can be wholly prevented in a short time after their admission to these schools. We hardly had disappeared long before pointed out the school and its exception of one little girl in whom it had occurred several times. The Indians very strongly assert the impression that the disease was spreading on account of the lack of washing and cleanliness of the pupils.\n\nUnder the conditions I do not see that much more can be done except to place help a dozen more provide washing facilities, except to place help a dozen more hand basins in a corner of the attic dormitory where I have let on bed will be done. As to the statement that \"this is no visible means of spreading,\" I agree from seeing me work. I cannot see what more could be done than in a large building with many space convenient possible. Each pupil has separate towel and her number cut, and each boy's wash cloth is kept quite separate, and they are kept jealous of this property and immediately report anybody who dare to lay hands on it. This matter has always been very carefully attended to, and the towels were all arranged o\nDiocese of Moosonee\n\nJOHN G. ANDERSON\n\nI would like to add what I know Mr. Brown would suggest, only he did not suggest the remedy. The solution.\n\nIn the case of education rooms, lunch facilities, he laid at our doors. The Department is responsible for its building. If you begin to criticize the number of pupils that can use the remedy and summer kitchen for education rooms, you will have to reduce our numbers to one dozen. But the fact of the matter is, as I understand from those who have visited schools, except those in duty at the time, they have practically enjoyed the benefits of this remedy.\n\nIt is true that Mr. Brown acts as Principal, Teacher etc., he goes out and the boys in doing his work and is then away about the school. This has not always been the case. He had for some months a man, his wife, to manage with the boys and women in the school, with the sick. The man was found neglecting his duties and after several warnings, had to be discharged. We could secure another suitable man once he has done the work himself. If he is willing to do so and also teach, I do not see why objection could be made, and action being carried out in the interests of the school. We have not unlimited funds at our disposal to keep Principal sitting in their offices. We should have nothing to do with the matter that we are dealing with.\nDiocese of Moosonee\n\nJOHN Q ANDERSON\nBISHOP\n\nDear Mr. Curry,\n\nI am writing to you in a way that makes it practically impossible to refuse. However, I have already drawn your attention to this fact, so let me now draw your attention to another point.\n\nThe expenditure of the school, and what will help the principal's salary coming from the Diocese. It is only right that economy shall be exercised as far as possible. I do not agree that it has been pushed to the limit.\n\nRegarding the residence of Mrs. Curry in the school house, I have already expressed my opinion that that is the best interests of the school will not do. I did not say for the house while the old staff was at the school, but I believe worse, as you must know it does in many cases show that another lady is more interested in the principal's wife than in the welfare of the school.\n\nI have written to Mrs. Curry, in the hope of getting her to build with the money a small structure which could be used as a new quarters for some purpose. In some cases, such a plan can be taken out of the house as soon as required.\n\nThe children have been very complimentary of the work done by Miss Anderson, the Diocese Secretary of the Women's Auxiliary, visited the school shortly before I did. Her attention was called to this matter, she said this was the first time that any complaint had ever been made, and that this was the third year that they had supplied for all similar schools. She was willing to send a second visitation in the near future, and stated that if the school was done only in one, she would have...\nDiocese of Moosejaw\n\nCochrane, Ont.\n\n[Handwritten text]\n\nIf this is the normal thing, I am contented.\n\nI am not alone in this matter. The children are very well.\n\nI have always been very nice at the school, and this is just how it has always been.\n\nThis is the first time that I have heard any complaint myself. Of course, if the Department wants to change, I suppose it can be done.\n\nThe women's assistance will no doubt fall into line. The shortage of clothing can be largely accounted for by the unexpected number of children who arrived at the school. This, however, is now being remedied, and outfits have all been ordered for all children.\n\nI have thus fully and frankly given you the results of my investigation with the committee. I feel it is right that I should be able to make an honest report as far as possible.\n\nIt is evident that the management should keep as far as possible in the spirit of the contract, and we are glad to have fair criticism.\n\nI do not wish to say that under the circumstances it is proper to close the school, but the threat of closing the school is unnecessary.\n\nI trust that the decision made with a view of satisfying everyone.

McLean\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. McLeod, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\nOttawa, June 7th, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to refer you to official letter of January 26th., 1915, in which you were informed that it would be your duty to visit the Chapleau Boarding School weekly and also to respond promptly to any emergency calls, which you might receive from the Principal of that institution. You were also requested to report to the Department any cases of tuberculosis developing amongst the pupils.\n\nThe Department has not received any reports from you, as requested, and I have now to ask that you forward at your earliest convenience a full report on the health of the pupils attending the Chapleau Boarding School. Kindly state definitely how many pupils have died since January 1st, 1915, giving the cause of their death. You should also state how many children at this school appear to be tubercular at the present time, what precautions you have taken to prevent the spread of this disease, and any recommendations you may wish to make.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nDr. J.J. Sheahan,\nChapleau,\nOnt.\nExtract Inspector's Report\nOn Chaplain Boarding School\nMay 3rd, 1915\n\nGENERAL REMARKS.\n\nVery good work is apparently being done by Principal Frewer. The one objectionable feature in connection with my inspection was seeing the sick pupils, tubercular, mingling with the well ones in their school work as well as in their play. There has been several deaths lately in the school, yet there are no facilities for separating the sick from the well. At the time of my inspection there were two little fellows, one in the last stages the other being noticeably affected, with tuberculosis. At meals, at school at play, direct contact with the healthier pupils pupils is inevitable. I wish a change could be made. I found Mr. Frewer to be a man very much interested in his charges. He gave me every possible assistance in my tour of inspection.\n\nSgd. W. J. Hamilton,\nInspector.\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR HAMILTON ON THE CROWFOOT BOARDING SCHOOL.\n\nIn my opinion it is a great mistake to have the education of these Indian girls and boys placed in the hands of entirely untrained teachers. After undergoing a course of practical training, the teacher would do as much in six months with them as will require, now at least twelve. And the lack of knowledge and of method results in work being taken up which does not appeal to the child and which does not appeal to the child and which savors of the kind of work done in our schools some seventy-five or one hundred years ago. These children should have the best we can give them\u2014\u2014\u2014-they deserve it.\n\nThe teacher, Miss Strickland, is an earnest, conscientious, hard-working teacher, very sadly handicapped by having had no previous experience in teaching. She is much interested in her charges and with experience and study should make a very suitable teacher.\n\nDate of Inspection.\u2014May 30th, 1929.\nChief on occasions of severe cold, would be to have the following at hand:\nwarm substantial food, wear warm clothing, and have the building warm with proper ventilation. These suggestions do not imply any criticism of the school authorities during the past year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. J. Sheahan\nJuly 2nd, 1915\n\nMr. J.W.

We need money to meet our needs. I do not know whether the other schools are doing any better. The situation here is very similar.\n\nWe have more than we need to feed the children as we do. We can manage at the Normal School under the present per capita grant because there are no commitments for the school year. However, we could not balance our budget without assistance.\n\nI would therefore appeal as strongly as I can, but to Department, since the per capita grant of the Chaplin School is too low or insufficient. However, for equivalent assistance as a temporary measure until a new contract with the Church is made.\n\nI am sure that you will appreciate the situation and do what you possibly can in the matter.\n\nI would be grateful for an immediate reply.\n\nI am leaving in a few days on my summer's trip to see friends and relatives overseas, so if you will communicate with Mr. Palmer direct, it will be even more satisfactory.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Name]\nDiocese of Moosonee\n\nJOHN G ANDERSON\nDiocese of Moosonee\nCOCHRANE, ONT.\n\nMay 19th, 1877\n\nTo:\nRev.

The transportation charges to Charlton were $83.42 and from Charlton to Moore @ $6 per ton = $10.50 additional.\n\nThus by the time the flour reached Moore, not counting the handling charges, there we paid $171.87 for transportation or $755.37, nearly 1/3 more than the original cost.\n\nTo bring all these charges into account, I conclude that a reasonable per capita grant which would cover about half the cost of maintenance in each school, would be an increase of $25 on the present grant, $115 for the Chaplain School and $150 for the Moore School.\n\nI trust that this request will meet with the favorable consideration of the Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohn S. Macdonald\nDiocese of Moose Cree\n\nJOHN G. ANDERSON\nBISHOP\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esq.,\nDeputy-Asst. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nThe Honorable Archibald Matheson has requested me to send you a statement as to our need for an increase in the per capita grant for our Indian Boarding Schools.\n\nHe mentioned that living everywhere in Canada is well known to you. It is needless for me to say that this fact is most keenly felt in the maintenance of our Boarding Schools where we have been having a very hard struggle to make ends meet, especially during the last four years and the struggle is becoming harder all the time. The increase of $10 per capita granted by the Department in 1916 was a matter promised but still wholly inadequate to meet the continually rising expenditure.\n\nAfter receiving his Private's letter I wrote to Principal Palmer of our Chaplain School asking him to give me the approximate annual cost of maintenance paid by the per capita grant of last year. His reply is that \"the Department paid us about $250 less than was promised, i.e., about one third of the cost of maintenance.\"\nA bill in action and we died in England some time before a tax revision. This is an additional reason why we should do what we can for them and provide the best possible educational advantages under the most favorable conditions of living.\n\nI wrote in some time ago regarding the pressing necessity of an increase in the per capita grants. The financial situation especially at Chaplean is serious. The principal in his report to me states that \"the grants for the present year at the old rate of $90 will just about meet one-fourth of our present year's expenditure.\" The cost of living in Chaplean is very high due to the fact that its town is so far removed from producing centres and at the mercy of the one railway. Without an ear to them because they can purchase in Canada but not enjoy the advantage of a fair margin, which we cannot do. Purchasing locally is very high and the freight or outside purchases is necessary limited quantities is almost prohibitive.\n\nI trust therefore that the Department will give our case a fair and sympathetic consideration and decide to give us at least the per capita grant I asked for in my former communication, which is not unreasonable in view of the very hard times through which we are passing. The increase will be all the more necessary for the needs of the new school if we are to do satisfactory and successful work.\n\nWith many thanks for past consideration and kindness,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJohn J.

I believe there will be no delay and that the school will be erected at once. It is almost unnecessary for me to mention how entirely unsuitable the present building is for successful work as you are well aware of the facts. Not only is the present building obsolete, but the need of increased accommodation is urgent. The epidemic of influenza has caused many deaths among our Indians and left many orphans whom we have to care for. We must act quickly and with whom we can do the best work.\n\nThe opportunity of obtaining land with whom we can do the best work is rare. The principal, Mr. Smith, has been in charge of the school for several years and has done an excellent job. He cannot accept as the school is now filled to the limits of its capacity. There are already 50 pupils ready for the new school. Now is the time for action and I do hope that the Department will take steps to proceed immediately with the building and acquire a suitable site which has been thoroughly investigated for good reasons.\n\nWe are proud of our Indians at the Chapleau Agency, and desire their connection with the local community. We believe that they are a valuable part of the community and should be treated with respect.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nMarch 24th, 1919.\n\nMy dear Bishop Anderson \u2014\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd inst., in reference to the erection of the proposed new school building at Chapleau and also the question of an increased per capita grant.\n\nI am sorry that I am not yet in a position to give Your Lordship a definite reply, but the whole matter both of the erection of new buildings and general increase in the per capita grants is at present under careful deliberation.

Geo. Prever,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Boarding School,\nChapleau, Ont.\nOttawa, August 27, 1920.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThe attention of the Department has been directed to the class-room work in the Chapleau Boarding School during the past year and to the lack of qualifications of the teacher engaged. The report of the Public School Inspector who inspected this school in April, last, recommends that properly qualified, well trained teachers be placed in charge of the class-room work, that the teachers be required to attend at least one session of a summer model school, that is during a part of July and August, and that, if qualified teachers were in charge, they would accomplish more in four months than they do at the present time in ten.\n\nIn view of the fact that the new school building will soon be occupied by the pupils and staff, the Department must insist that only qualified teachers be engaged and is, therefore, drawing this matter to your attention and would be pleased to receive a report at an early date stating the names, qualifications and experience of the teachers who have been selected to carry on the work when the school re-opens in the new building. For these reasons of first importance that the pupils receive the best instruction in the class-room that it is possible for them to obtain.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Geo. Brewer,\nPrincipal,\nChapleau Boarding School,\nChapleau, Ont.\nWe have obtained during the last few weeks several\nqualified teachers for day schools at salaries of from\n$700.00 to $907.00 and in each case they have to provide for\ntheir own living expenses.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nAugust 25th, 1920.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant with reference to class-room work at the Chapleau boarding school.\n\nWith regard to the position of the public school inspector, I would state that all our day and residential schools in the Province of Ontario are inspected by public school inspectors for the various districts under an arrangement made with the Ontario Department of Education. In making these inspections he is, therefore, acting under instructions from the department. While Mr. Brown may not have an intimate knowledge of matters relating to instruction he should be, as any other public school inspector, able to report intelligently on the work being accomplished in the class-rooms, and I have no doubt he is so competent. I am sending you herewith a blank form of the agreement under which the boarding school at Chapleau is conducted and I would refer you to sections 7, 8 and 9 which cover in detail this phase of your work.\n\nThe difficulties at the present time in obtaining qualified teachers is quite appreciated, but I am sure that you will do your best to remedy any defects at present existing. I think you will not find it necessary to pay the salaries of which you make mention when you apply living accommodation to teachers.\n\nRev. Geo.

Ontario\n\n30th May 1921.\n\nThe Inspector General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am instructed by the Synod of the Diocese of Moosonee which met in Chapleau on the 16th & 19th of this month to express to you its very warm appreciation of the endeavours of the Indian Department to meet the educational needs of the Indian people.\n\nThe programme of the Synod included a visit to the new Indian Boarding School at Chapleau. This splendid building and its equipment is sufficient testimony to the magnificent efforts of the Department to elevate a backward race.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary.\nJune 8, 1921.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge, with thanks, the expression of the appreciation of the Synod and the Diocese of Moose Cree, in connection with the work done by the Department at Chapleau, Ont.\n\nI have always taken a personal interest in the Indians of this district, and in the working of the school, as I was one of the Commissioners who made the Treaty with these Indians.\n\nI know that the school was conducted for a number of years under a great handicap in the way of unsuitable buildings, and I am very glad that we have been able to erect for them a modern institution, which will render the work of the management easier and more pleasant.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Archibald J.A. Woodall,\nSecretary, Diocese of Moose Cree, (Synod),\nPerkins Junction,\nOntario.\nI trust that you will be able to deal with the points I have raised upon their merits, and that instructions will be issued to the Indian Agent to cooperate with us in our effort to make the work play the part of a real factor in producing better results than have hitherto been achieved.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nBelieve me,\nFaithfully yours,\nGeo. Poveshell\nthe children are allowed to attend the school for a year or two and then drop out. It is expensive, and useless work, even if new children are found to take their places.\n\nWe have two very capable teachers this year, and I think the report of the Public School Inspector, who visited the school a few weeks ago, will bear me out when I say we have reached a standard of class-room work, since we started in our new building that would do credit to the work of any institution of learning in the Province.\n\nWe have 75 pupils now in attendance, and I think fully 100 more in view for the reopening, but there are one or two men rather prominent in the bands who are trying to evade the act by keeping their children away. This makes it difficult to deal with the rest, and may create difficulty when our pupils are asked to return.\n\nI think that the wisest plan would be to have a Truant Officer appointed with instructions to see to the return of all pupils to the school when it re-opens and to also see to the bringing in of those who are attempting to evade the Act.\n\nIt would also be a good plan to have a Form or Permit made out in which the parent or guardian signs an agreement to return the child at the time when the School re-opens.\n\nI find too that at some of the smaller places along the Railway, where there are groups of white settlers and they need a school in order to educate their children, and the number of children will not admit of their drawing Grants under the Education Act of the Province, the names of our Indian children are being used in order to augment the number of children of school age in the District, and the parents are told that they belong to that School Section, and therefore should not send their children to the Boarding Schools, and that in some cases, a small Grant is being asked from the Indian Department to assist in making up the amount required to pay the Teacher's salaries. The Indians get very little real benefit from this so, if the children attend at all, the attendance is very irregular.\nChapleau Indian Boarding School,\nChapleau, Ont., June 11th, 1921.\n\nT.F. [Signature]\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the closing of this School for the Summer Holidays, I would like to get a little more information as to the real intention of the Department for future guidance.\n\nI would like to know if it is the Department's intention to follow the Regulations as laid down by the Province of Ontario and to allow the School to close from the end of June to the beginning of September, and to allow the Grants to continue. Hitherto I have been led to the conclusion that the Department would allow the School to close for the same period as the Public Schools of the Province, but by doing this we should lessen our earning power, where the Grants are concerned, though a full month would be allowed, without any reduction being made.\n\nAgain, as regards allowing the pupils to go to their homes for the period allowed as holidays, this has always been understood as optional on our part. We have allowed this though, wherever possible, but we now see that, in view of the fact that we have a large staff and are preparing for a greater expenditure for the general good of the school, there may be some little difficulty in getting all the pupils to return. I find that some of the opponents to the Indian Education Act are rather insisting the Indians to make a test of the Department's ability to enforce the Measure by inducing the Indians to keep their children from returning.\n\nShould I refuse to allow these children to go for their holidays, I might then arouse a certain feeling against the Institution, which I do not care to create. On the other hand we cannot have the work played with or made the butt of some Political faction. If the children are allowed out for the holidays, we must have some assurance that they will return as soon as school re-opens. We can not make progress with the work when\nOTTAWA, June 14th, 1921.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant regarding the summer holidays allowed the Chapleau Boarding School.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that under the agreement for the maintenance and management of Indian Boarding Schools, one month's pay during the holidays is allowed with grant. This is the policy followed with grant to all Indian Residential Schools, and the Department is not prepared to make any exception in the case of the Chapleau Boarding School.\n\nWith reference to allowing the pupils to go home during the period granted as summer holidays, this is optional on the part of the Principal. In all cases where he is reasonably sure that the pupil will be promptly returned upon the expiry of their leave, he may grant them permission to spend the holidays at home. In cases where there has been trouble in the past in having the parents return their children, the question of again allowing such children permission to go home should be carefully considered. Where the Principal is justified in doubt that a child will not be returned, he should not allow him leave of absence, and in all cases where leave is granted, the Principal should obtain written agreement from the parent or guardian that the child will be returned promptly upon the expiry of leave.\n\nAs you are on the ground and have a better view of the situation, you may use your own discretion as to which pupils you allow to go home. At the end of the holidays, if any child fail to return, you know I immediately write to the Agent of the Band to which they belong and he should take the necessary steps to have them promptly returned to the school.\n\nThe Department has no form or permit which a parent or guardian can sign agreeing to return a child upon the expiry of the annual leave.\n\nIt is noted that you have a number of new pupils in view when the school re-opens, and it is hoped that you will be successful in obtaining the full number for whom the grant is allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMr. Henry Jackson,\nMassanabie,\nOnt.\nSir,\n\nI wish to report to the Department that I am having considerable trouble with one of the Indians of my Agency, one of the members of the Wapikotootin Band, he was the Chief of this band until very recently also when the band asked for a new Chief and was paying annuity this year an election was held and a new Chief appointed but previous to this he was inciting the Indians and since then has been acting very badly dressing up in feathers etc., and speaking to the Indians and inciting them to flout the school laws and all in connection with it running around among the different bands and inciting them against the Boarding school and the Principle and persuading them not to return their children and he has been successful in some four or five cases and the parents have openly rebelled and will not return their children.\n\nI have gone into the matter carefully and taken considerable time to get to the root of the trouble and find this man responsible for all the trouble and think it would be advisable to have him arrested and closed up for a short period and if this is done I believe it would stop all this trouble at once.\n\nThis man has been running around all summer among the Indians advising them to rebel against the school and has left his old widowed mother on the reserve with no means of support and says he is not going to support her and I would like the Department to advise me what had better be done as matters are getting serious and I would like permission from the Department to make an example of this man before matters go too far.\n\nMr. H. Jackson, the president of the Indian Council of Ontario, is here and he stated to me that I should act at once and that he believed that I would be doing wisely if I should arrest Candamase at once.\n\nWaiting your early reply, I remain,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent's Office\n\n[Stamp]\nI am not aware of any action that can be taken against Jacob Bandass for trying to influence him sending their children to boarding industrial schools.

The Indian Act does not provide for, nor do the provisions of the Ordinance Code, the parents or guardians of children of school age are liable to prosecution if they fail to cause their children to attend school after notice having been properly given by Sub-section 3 of Section 10 of the Indian Act. If this is brought to the attention of such parents they may decline to pay any further attention to Cundasse.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Agent, Deputy & Secretary.\n\nT.

Smith, the President of the Ontario Indian Councils and has agreed to try and make all right all the trouble that he has caused but whether he is sincere in his promises or not I do not know.\n\nBut from what I can learn I believe he has been responsible for a petition being circulated in fact he presented this petition to a great number of Indians asking them to sign it asking for immediate removal of the Principal of the school and in quite a number of cases the Indians signed this petition not knowing what they were signing and some of them feel very badly over the affair.\n\nIn several cases complaints have come in to me regarding cruelty to the children and after investigating the case find that it has in every single case been false.\n\nMost of the families who listened to the advice of this man have now sent their children back to school but there are some who still hold their children expecting that Mr. Prewer will be discharged from his duties, and my purpose in writing this letter to the Department is to warn the Department of the propaganda which is being carried on by the Indians and is being pushed on by some white men who want to start a school at French and cannot without the support of the Indians at this point and are insisting the Indians against the school here and should the petition be presented to the Department I do not believe it should be given one minute consideration.\n\nIn my many investigations and visits to the school, and I visit there some three or four times a week I find everything satisfactory and the progress of the children very creditable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.P.

We do not believe the children are receiving the schooling which the department of Indian Affairs wishes them to have for they are kept at various forms of employment during many hours when they should be at their studies.\n\nOur Chief, Johnson Quackenbush, protested to our Indian agent sometime ago against the continued employment of Mr. Prewer, but to date our protest has apparently been ignored.\n\nYou are personally conversant with facts covering many acts of cruelty and lack of consideration which show Mr. Prewer as entirely unfit for the position which he holds, and as our representative we expect you to put a strong case up to the Indian Department, and insist upon Mr. Prewer's removal.\n\nShould the department fail to act upon this our just appeal we shall exercise our duty as parents and take our children out of the school.\n\nSigned\nOttawa, October 14, 1931.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYou will find herewith a petition from cer-\ntain Treaty Indians at Pains, Ontario, asking for the\ndismissal of the Rev. Mr. Prever as Principal of the\nIndian School at Chapleau, Ontario.\n\nIn this petition certain statements are made\nas to my personal knowledge of the facts alleged against\nMr. Prever in this petition. I wish to disclaim any\nsuch knowledge and hand you the Petition as received by\nme on with this understanding.\n\nI would be glad to be advised that the Depart-\nment will investigate the conditions named against this\nInstitution.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nHenry Jackson\nPresident\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nThe Indians want Mr. Prever to be dismissed.\nThe attached petition from some Indians resident at Franz, Ont., asking for the dismissal of Mr. Preror as Principal of the boarding school at Chapleau, Ont., was handed in personally by Mr. Henry Jackson, President of the Grand Indian Council, last week.\n\nWhile I do not think that it is necessary to formally investigate the management of the school, I do think that a visit from the Superintendent of Indian Education at a convenient time would be in the interest of all concerned. We all know Mr. Preror has worked on his work here for years under extreme difficulties, and I think that a visit from the officer above referred to would be stimulating and encouraging to him.\n\nIf you agree, I would suggest that Mr. Jackson be advised that an inspection of this school will be made by Mr. Ferrier some time after the New Year. I am mentioning this date on Mr. Jackson's suggestion, as he says the Indians will all be on their reserves about that time.\n\nActing Asst.

He has been here since last fall and has received his meals, clothing, and books from the school and has been treated kindly by all the teachers. He has been very attentive and has worked hard at his studies. He is now attending school regularly and is doing well.\n\nAnd I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing it to be true and knowing that it is of the same force and effect as if made under oath and by virtue of the CANADA EVIDENCE ACT.\n\nDeclared before me at the Town of Chapleau in the District of Qu'Appelle this 6th day of January A.D. 1922.\n\n[Signature]\n\nCaroline X.

I have not heard or seen him do anything to improve the situation. I have never heard him say anything about improving the school facilities or the quality of teaching.\n\nAnd I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing it to be true and knowing that it is of the same force and effect as if made under oath and by virtue of the CANADA EVIDENCE ACT.\n\nSworn before me at the Town of Chipman in the District of Chipman on this day of January 1922.\n\nMARGARET NOLAN\n\n[Signature]\n\nPOOR COPY\nThe Mrs. Nolan who signs this affidavit gave trouble once before. She had a child at the Shingwauk Home and complained of the treatment at that school. She showed, on her boy's body, certain marks to Mr. MacLeod, then Indian Agent, and the Bishop of Moosonee, which, she declared, were the result of a beating. The Doctor was called in, who proclaimed the marks birthmarks, and Mrs. Nolan at that time admitted her falsehood.\n\nR.M.A.\nIn the Matter of certain Complaints against the administration of Principal George Proulx, Principal in charge of Chapleau Indian Residential School.\n\nJ. James Felician of the Village of Muskrat Lake in the District of Algoma, Ontario.\n\nI solemnly declare that I have heard read the declaration made this date in the above matter by my wife Beatrice Felician and that the facts stated therein are correct - of the present Principal of said school continues in charge thereof to remove them and send them to the Public School at French to be educated.\n\nAnd I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing it to be true and knowing that it is of the same force and effect as if made under oath and by virtue of the CANADA EVIDENCE ACT.\n\nDeclared before me at the Town of Chapleau in the District of Algoma this 6th day of January A.D. 1923.\n\nA Commissioner, etc.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPOOR COPY\nIn the Matter of certain complaints against the administration of Reverend George Haver Principal in charge Chaplain Indian Boarding School.\n\nI, Beatrice Fletcher, of the Village of Chippewa, wife of James Fletcher\n\nDo solemnly declare that I have two children, two pupils attending school, namely, Carrie Fletcher, seven years old and Charles Fred Fletcher, twelve years old. They have been at the said school for some four years now.\n\nThe children were at the Chippewa School for three years before coming to the Chaplain School. Charles attended in the first year but was not very attentive. He was very fond of playing with his toys and was often absent from school.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, 1923, Charles fell while playing outside. He received a serious wound which required medical attention. He was sent to hospital and remained there for several weeks.\n\nAfter recovering, Charles returned to school. He continued to attend classes regularly until the end of the school year.\n\nAnd I do make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing it to be true and knowing that it is of the same force and effect as if made under oath and by virtue of the CANADA EVIDENCE ACT.\n\nDeclared before me at the Town of Chippewa in the District of Algoma this 15th day of January A.D. 1924.\n\n(Signed) Beatrice Fletcher\n\nPOOR COPY\nCharles Fletcher did not freeze his toes delivering milk in Chapleau town, for, in a personal \"chummy\" chat with this boy, I found that only once had his feet been cold. Indeed, he had come to the school, and that was when he, in company with a lot of other boys, had gone some 300 yards from the school to watch a team that was floundering in the snow and to assist in shoring the load back onto the hard road.\n\nConcerning the cut on his knee, the affidavit mentions this winter, whereas it was a year ago that the boy's knee was sore. The boy says\u2014it was not particularly sore\u2014but that he did not do any work before Christmas 1920; that Miss Turner (an officer) attended to it regularly.\n\nThe affidavit mentions that Charles and Carrie Fletcher had been at the school for four years; but, after an examination of the register, I find that they have been there but two and a half years.\n\nI chatted with Carrie Fletcher, and I am convinced that she is clean and well cared for. She herself says she is happy and likes the school.\nIn the Matter of certain complaints against the administration of Reverend George Raven, Principal - charge Chapleau Indian Boarding School.\n\nI, Henry Sandilands, of the Village of Kenora, in the District of Kenora, Province of Ontario, do solemnly declare that I have a daughter, Emma, aged twenty-two years old, who attended the Chapleau Indian Boarding School for two years. The Principal promised my daughter that she would be able to complete her course at school and would be able to earn a living. However, although she completed her course, she was not able to find employment due to her lack of education.\n\nAnd I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing it to be true and knowing that it is of the same force and effect as if made under oath and by virtue of the CANADA EVIDENCE ACT.\n\nDeclared before me at the Town of Chapleau, in the District of Kenora, this day of January A.D. 1923.\nGeorge Bankies, mentioned in this affidavit, was not found dead under his bed. Mr. Agent Godfrey was practically in charge of the school at this time. A \"flu\" epidemic had attacked even some of the staff. Mr. Agent Godfrey states that there was an officer of the school in attendance when this boy died and that he himself was there one hour later and is certain that there was no neglect.\n\nR.M.F.\nIn the Matter of certain complaints against the administration of Reverend George Prater, Principal in Charge Chaplain Indian Boarding School.\n\nI, William Sahaktenway, of the Village of Missinabie in the District of Algoma, affirm, as a member of the Missinabie Band\n\nDo solemnly declare that I am the father of William Sahaktenway, a pupil at said Boarding School thirteen years of age. He has been ill for about four years and since February 1917, when he was admitted to hospital due to an illness which he had contracted while attending school. He was treated by Dr. Smith, who diagnosed his condition as a result of the effects of the flu epidemic which swept through the region. Despite his efforts, William's condition continued to deteriorate, and he eventually succumbed to the disease.\n\nAnd I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing it to be true and knowing that it is of the same force and effect as if made under oath and by virtue of the CANADA EVIDENCE ACT.\n\nDeclared before me at the Office of Chaplain in the District of Algoma this day of January A.D. 1923.\n\nWilliam X Sahaktenway\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nI chatted with Penison bahsketchaway who claims, in reference to his work at the school, that he has never swung an axe nor taken any wood into Chapleau; he has at times piled wood in the School yard. Concerning his sore leg, the boy told him in confidence that he had been ill all the time the leg was bothering him and that it had never been operated on by anyone. The boy's eyes are bad and may need treatment by a specialist.\n\nMr. McLeod of Chapleau, one time Indian Agent, was informed by William bahsketchaway, who signed this declaration, that he did not willingly want to say what he did but felt that the whole procedure was unfortunate. He told Mr. McLeod that he did not know why they were all trying to \"get\" Mr. Brewer; he had nothing personal against the man. Mr. McLeod told me that he believes William bahsketchaway did not know what he swore to. It was upon Mr. McLeod's advice that the son, Penison, went to the Doctor during his Christmas vacation.\nIn the Matter of certain complaints against the administration of Reverend George B. Smith, Principal in charge Chapleau Indian Boarding School.\n\nI, Louisa Biie, of the town of Chapleau, in the district of Algoma, do solemnly declare that I have been able to observe the following:\n\n1. Charles Biie, aged six years, who has been at the said Boarding School - also aged twelve years who has been at the said School two months; Charles aged four also at the School two months; Georgia aged eight years also a part of time for six months - have been ill and unable to attend school. They have been sick with colds, coughs, and other ailments. They have been unable to attend school due to their illness.\n\n2. The School Principal has been aware of these conditions but has not taken any action to ensure the children receive proper care and attention.\n\n3. The School Principal has not provided adequate medical care or facilities for the children.\n\nAnd I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing it to be true and knowing that it is of the same force and effect as if made under oath and by virtue of the CANADA EVIDENCE ACT.\n\nDeclared before me at the town of Chapleau, in the district of Algoma, this 7th day of January, A.D. 1922, after being sworn and having subscribed my name in my presence.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLouisa Biie\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nI chatted with the two sons of Louise Rice and I find that Louise's foot was badly rubbed by boots purchased by her parents before his admission to the school in November 1921. The older brother, Allan, says that an officer of the school gave attention to his feet at regular intervals. Both boys state that the feet in question were never frozen.\n\nAgain, the declaration does not give the true facts. Mrs. Rice did not come to the school to take the children home. They went to Chapleau on the milk rig on the morning of December 24th, and twice during the Christmas holidays Mrs. Rice asked to send her children back to school. The fainting fit mentioned was in November, some two weeks after the boys were admitted, and I have Mr. Agent Godfrey's assurance that this woman is in the habit of throwing a fit for its dramatic effect.\nIn the Matter of certain complaints against the administration of Reverend George Brewer Principal in charge of the Plains Indian Boarding School.\n\n1. Albert Matchewan of the Village of Pelican Point on the Canadian Pacific Railway in the District of Algoma of the Municipality of Algoma of the Province of Ontario.\n\nDo solemnly declare that I have an child, a boy named Joseph, aged 12 years old, attending school aged eleven years and three months at the school near by. I complain that my boy is not properly treated by the principal or head of the school. My boy was seen cutting wood instead of doing his work in school. He was also seen playing in a house near by. The principal ordered him back to school but he was ordered by the principal to work and promised him if the principal is not removed he will take my boy away from the school.\n\nAnd I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing it to be true and knowing that it is of the same force and effect as if made under oath and by virtue of the CANADA EVIDENCE ACT.\n\nSworn before me at the town of Chippewa in the District of Algoma this 7th day of January A.D. 1923.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAlbert X. Matchewan\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nI had a personal chat with Joseph Latchisene (Lichinnine). He states that he ran away and on his return was punished with a strap and was not kicked or beaten.\n\nK.T.F.\nIn the Matter of certain complaints against Mr. James Wilson, Principal in charge Chapleau Indian Boarding School.\n\nI, Alice Keigan of the Village of Nottawasaga in the Township of the County of Algoma do solemnly declare that on the 25th day of July, 1924, I took my two children David aged fourteen and Maria aged nine years to the above Indian Boarding School. On the 26th day of July, 1924, I found them in bed. They appeared to be ill. I went into their room and found them with their heads down and their bodies covered with blankets. When I asked what was wrong, they said they were sick. I then went to see the Principal, Mr. James Wilson, who told me that they were sick and needed medical attention. I then went to see Dr. Smith, who diagnosed them with typhoid fever.\n\nAnd I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing it to be true and knowing that it is of the same force and effect as if made under oath and by virtue of the CANADA EVIDENCE ACT.\n\nDeclared before me at the Town of Chapleau in the County of Algoma this 26th day of January A.D. 1924.\n\n(Signed) Commissioner\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nI went to considerable trouble to become \"chummy\" with David Moogan, and he himself assures me that once, when guilty of stealing apples, he was thrashed in his night-shirt, that the instrument used was a rubber strap and that he was sore for a couple of days. I examined the strap in question and find that it is of regulation type, wide enough and considerably shorter than those in use in most public schools.\n\nAlice Moogan who signs this declaration, when bringing her children home after the last Christmas holidays, thanked the Principal for his care and donated to the Chapel fund.\n\nR.T.F.\nIn the Matter of certain complaints against\nMr. William Wilson, Principal of the Chapleau Boarding\nSchool.\n\nI, Henry Black, of the Village\nof Frank\nin the District\nof Algoma, a member of the\nMishipeshu Indian Band\n\nDo Solemnly Declare that I have three children named\nJohn, Mary and Thomas aged five years.

Christopher Black's hand was sore for but a couple of days, and he himself says he did no work that hurt it at any time.\n\nR.J.F.\nIn the Matter of certain Complaints against\ntwo Administrative Officers named George Plamondon\nPrincipal of the Chapleau Indian Boarding School.\n\nI, Andrew Saunders \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 of the Village\nof Bussinabie \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nin the District \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 of Algoma, a member of the Board\nof Trustees of the Board of Education\n\nDo Solemnly Declare that I have two children, a boy\nnamed James aged about 12 years, and a girl named Josephine aged about 10 years,\nwho attend said Boarding School. They were sent there about three weeks ago\nto attend said Boarding School. Said children have been there since then and\nhave been attending said Boarding School for about six weeks now.

When his daughter, Lizzie, went on holidays (Christmas 1921) the Principal was in town and she was permitted to leave the school direct from the kitchen where she had been working, without a wash or a change of clothing.\n\nI might add, in this connection, that John Namakeese gave $2.00 to the Principal for his kindness to the children.\n\nR.J.F.\nIn the Matter of certain complaints against\nthe administration of Reverend George Henry\nprincipal in charge Chapleau Indian\nBoarding School\n\nI, Kitty Sackitshaway \u2014 of the Village\nof Wawa\n\nin the District of Algoma, in the Province of\nOntario, do solemnly declare that I have been a pupil at\nthe said Boarding School for about four years and was\ntherein employed as a teacher for about four years ago.\nI find myself obliged to work there for about two years\nand was very much obliged to the school but after I had\nbeen there about two years another girl asked me to\nwork there and she came and I did not come to a head\nwith her. The schooling in my house did not come to a head\nand I was forced to work there and I did not come to a head\nwith her. The schooling in my house did not come to a head\nand I was forced to work there and I did not come to a head\nwith her.\n\nAnd I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing it to be true and knowing that it is of\nthe same force and effect as if made under oath and by virtue of the CANADA EVIDENCE ACT.\n\nDelivered before me at the\nCourt of Chapleau\nin the District of Algoma\nthe 16th day of January\n1923\n\nA Commissioner, etc.\n\nKitty Sackitshaway\nI have the Rev. Mr. Brewer's word that Kitty Behsketcheway was treated by himself on perhaps two occasions, and the minor operation was always performed by a lancet, a surgical instrument suitable for this purpose, and never by a jack-knife.\n\nIt is interesting to note, in this connection, that this pupil was discharged because, being scrofulous, she would not keep to her own towel. Mr. Agent Godfrey assures me that Kitty Behsketcheway wanted to stay on at the school after her time was up.\n\nR.J.F.\nintelligent girl, was a pupil at the school, she says for ten years. She was in the third reader when she left but while she writes fairly well, understands nothing of arithmetic. All do-\nclerks on this point agree that not more than eight hours\nweekly, is devoted to study. In our public schools twenty seven,\nand a half hours weekly is actually spent in school. The building\nof the weekly period at the Chapleau school is for boys, spent\nin hard grinding labour or in the care of the circle, at scrubbing\ncleaning, and other domestic work. So far as my own observation\npicks up from casual enquiries made during three days, the school\noffers no advantages for instruction in agriculture, and the re-\nsults of the boys (many of them mere children) are seen in the\nsales of hundreds of cords of firewood in Chapleau town, at reduced\nrates. I was informed that in the winter of 1894-5, literally\nhundreds of cords of wood so produced were sold at Chapleau. To\nthe above should be added the amount of work palled or delivered\nin Chapleau by the boys. To sum up this phase of the complaints\nof the parents of these children, unless they receive an adequate\neducation at this school, they are acquiring no knowledge they\nmight not learn much better, by staying at home with their\nparents.\n\nSo far as the Reverend George Tower, Principal of this\nschool is concerned, should he be still considered he is a fit\nand proper person to administer the work of this government main-\ntained institution, I would ask on behalf of the parents of the\nchildren that the Department of Indian Affairs give effect to\nthe unanimous request made by them, they be allowed to remove\ntheir children from the Boarding school and send them to some\npublic school, where they can acquire a proper education.\n\nIf what I am informed is correct, namely, that the children\nat this school are not supplied with clothing of any kind except\nby their parents, that even so many of those actually so supplied,\ndo not receive such clothing, and that many of the children, girls\nas well as boys have no underclothing in such a climate as pre-\nvails in winter at Chapleau, I am sure it need not be pointed\nout to the Department, to have some adequate remedial measures\ntaken without delay.\n\nThe case of the complainants is now before the Department\nof Indian Affairs to be disposed of and it is to be hoped will be\nso dealt with by the Department as to obviate the necessity\nfor any further action on their part for relief.\n\nRespectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nprobation.\n\nJohn Saunders, when he went at Christmas, 1921, to take his daughter Lizzie aged ten home, found her covered with lice, both head and body, and very dirty. Andrew Saunders says when he came back three weeks before, to take his children James (II) and Jessie (II), home for the holidays, he found both of them, lousy and dirty. Alice Neigan took her children, M. and T., years of age, to the school in July, 1921. They both had the lice immediately, but it is now healing up. Kitty Sahakoteway says she was quite well when she went to the school but took scurfula there. The Doctor said her skin got it from some other girl. They all used the same towels. These are simply isolated cases. The complaint over the whole school can be imagined. Harry Black says the whole school is \"full\" of itch.\n\nMargaret Nolan says her son David has not received the clothes she bought him. Caroline Shequian says the same thing about her son Willie. Margaret Gideon says the Principal took the boots she had bought for her daughter Beatrice and made her go barefoot. She found her son Jack working in the bush and the clothes supplied him gone. Isaiah Dick says his children did not receive the clothing purchased by him for them. Mary Neigan says she supplied her daughter with clothing, but soon how when she saw her, the girl seemed not to have enough to cover her. John Saunders says he refused to wear it and when he asked her about it she said it had been put away, and that \"other children\" got it. Harry Black goes into this complaint with some detail. Alice Neigan makes a similar complaint regarding clothing of her children. I was informed verbally by the witness Harry Black that many of these children, girls as well as boys, are without underclothes, even at this season and in such a climate.\n\nThe progress of the children at their studies may be judged from the following:- Margaret Nolan says her son has been there nine years, is in the fourth reader, but has only the rudiments of spelling and arithmetic. Isaiah Dick says his two girls have been pupils at the school since September, 1921, but cannot say whether speak or understand English or know their alphabet. Beatrice Fletcher says her son, Charles aged 12, has been at the school four years and is now in the second reader and can read or write very little. His daughter Carrie is better, but she was a pupil at Shingwauk for a time. William Sahakoteway says his son Morrison, 13 years of age, has been a pupil there for about 4 years. He has chiefly been engaged in chopping wood, is still in the Primer, reads little and writes less. Henry Black has three sons, pupils at the school. They had been at the public school before their admission at Chapleau, but have made no progress at their studies since then. Kitty Sahakoteway, who seems a bright,\ntook her home, that the Doctor told him she had injured herself internally and could do no work; that for a year and a half he kept her at home during which time she was spitting blood, but that lately Mr. Prewer persuaded him to take his daughter back. An examination would probably disclose tubercular trouble in this case.\n\nAlice Neigam says last fall, Principal Prewer accused her boy Will, aged 14, of stealing apples, dragged him out of bed, took him off to the store-room and beat him with a stick till he was black and blue over his whole body. He then told the boy not to let his mother know.\n\nKitty Saskatchewan, aged 19 years, a former pupil got into trouble she says, as instructed by Dr. Evans, from some other girl, for they all used the same towel, and on three occasions sooner than call a Doctor, Principal Prewer lanced her neck with his jack-knife. She shows the long scars now.\n\nBeatrice Fletcher tells of her son Charles, a pupil then ten years old, in 1915, had his toes frozen delivering milk in Chapleau, and that for a week after was compelled by the Principal to keep on the same work, and only obtained relief when he went home at Christmas. At Christmas, 1916, when he was again home, his mother found his ankles raw and bleeding, also his arms. He told his mother it was from the work he had to do, of which he had complained to Mr. Prewer, who told him \"to keep on doing it.\" At Christmas, '17, when she came to take her children home she found this same Charles, with an unhealed cut on his knee which he said he had received when the snow came, and which he told the principal prevented him from working, but the Principal would not let him off. He had received no treatment whatever for this wound.\n\nMary Smith says her nephew George Patrick Hawkins perfectly healthy when he went to this school died there from neglected influenza eight months afterwards. He was found dead under his bed. If this be true, it would seem difficult to refute a charge of gross neglect.\n\nWilliam Saskatchewan tells of his son Hennison's case. Another instance of Mr. Prewer and his jack-knife.\n\nAlbert Latchiwaya tells how his boy Joseph, another pupil, was \"kicked and pounded\" by the Principal.\n\nThe story of Louise Rice of her little boy Charles (aged five) and his frozen feet, the efforts of Allan, the elder brother (aged 12) to wash and clean those of the younger, the whole month, of the child, and complete want of medical or other care, the surprise and shock to the mother when she went to take her children away at the condition she found them in, her collapse, the rude and callous conduct of Principal Prewer, is a pitiful one unless completely disproved, it would justify the most severe re-\nmaintain a place among their white neighbors; the present Reverend Principal not only signalily fails to, but actually by his methods, prevents the fulfillment of the benevolent intention of the Department.\n\nAccompanying this are sixteen statutory obligations duly imposed to from the parents of these children, which our actions set out fourteen cases of disease, insanity, and neglect; three cases of frozen limbs; several cases of disease acquired by improper management; two cases of filthy conditions causing ill-health; four complaints of the extent and purpose of the boys' woodcutting operations, and a number of cases of clothing alleged to have been diverted from the proper owners, in all of which instances direct responsibility of the Principal is alleged.\n\nA typical case of the methods alleged against the Principal, is that of former pupil Esther Tangoe aged seven years deceased. Her father William Tangoe says this child died of \"Pneumonia\" but the circumstances he sets out would indicate a more lingering disease. Anyway\u2014about 1st May, 1921 Mr. Prower sent the child to her father then in the bush, to come and take care of it. He did, and she died at his home on 3rd 15th. Dr. Wilkinson whom he called in said he could do nothing, it was too late. Tangoe says this child was not in the hospital. Now, if the Declaration of Margaret Gideon is read with this it will be seen how her child Beatrice aged eleven years, was compelled for two weeks steadily, to nurse this Tangoe girl, carry away and expose her to death by her, and how all this time the sick child was in a room with a lot of other girls and not removed to a separate sick-room. The evidence gives medical attendance. The consequence is that Beatrice Gideon herself took ill and is not well yet, though attending the school.\n\nHarry Black of Frank, says his son Davoy, a cripple, on this last 23rd December was sent home a distance of 83 miles by the Principal. His feet had through the sole of his boot and sock, and in consequence reached there with his toes frozen. As the father made this statement, the glass stood at 40 degrees below outside. Another son\u2014Christopher, in October last got his hand badly injured in a stump-puller. When he came home at 1:15 p.m., the wound had festored and his nails were coming off. From October till Christmas, the child aged 12, was put back forced to work with the wood in his own trade occupation, had no medical attention till his return home his father took him to a doctor who treated him, and he is now back at school with his hand in a bandage.\n\nIsaiah Dick says a pupil, his daughter Lizzie aged 12, had an accident which prevented her working, but that notwithstanding this Mrs. Prower, wife of the Principal tried to force her out of bed and work. That for four months after this accident during which his daughter remained at the school, she had no medical attention, which she only received at Cochrane when her father\nThe Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nInstructions were recently received by me from certain Indians, the parents of children attending the Chapleau Indian Boarding School to present complaints on their behalf against the administration of Mr. George Brewer, principal of said school. On the 16th and 17th January, 1922, I was at Chapleau for the purpose of receiving the statements of these people, which took the form of statutory declarations made by the several parties.\n\nI might say before discussing these complaints, that at my request the number of Indians in attendance was ascertained and found to be fifty-one only of whom had come a less distance than thirty miles, and some as far as 150 miles, to attend the charges. When one considers the inclemency of the weather and the great expense these people were met, it could not be said they were very much in earnest in their desire to better the condition of affairs at present prevailing in this school.\n\nThe charges against Principal Brewer are of cruelty and neglect of the pupils; the responsibility for a filthy and disgraceful condition of living among the children, causing serious ill-health; exposing the children in winter without proper clothing during a number of cases frozen limbs; the exploiting of the labour of even the younger boys at the expense of their education, cutting wood afterwards sold in Chapleau by these children at reduced rates; the almost total neglect of any instruction in English, or the simplest and most elementary steps for acquiring an education; diversion or postponement caused by parents for their children's compulsory paddling and delivery of mail in the river of Chapleau at all seasons of the year by children of the school, insufficiently clad, resulting in much suffering and some cases of frozen limbs; rudeness and domineering methods of the Principal to the parents of children; the remarks accompanying this service, so that it is evident the object of the Department of Indian Affairs to furnish these Indian children with a fair English education, equipping them for a changing condition of life among these people, and fitting them to take an\n\nNote\u2014Finding you each affidavit attached.

Godfrey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\nFourth, I am convinced that the charges would have been of less serious nature if it had not been for the activity of the lawyer, Chisholm. I am morally certain that Mr. Henry Jackson has placed the French Indians in touch with Mr. Chisholm and he was asked to present himself at Chapleau for whom the Indians subjected to a private investigation. Mr. Chisholm has used extravagant language in the affidavits and has aggravated the trouble by his duplicity. In fact, the charges are partly Mr. Chisholm's, for one may notice that the 16 affidavits are couched in similar phraseology. Further, Mr. Chisholm magnified the importance of these affidavits when he stated that the Indians made them before Chapleau for the specific purpose of laying these charges against the Rev. Mr. Francis. I have the assurance of Messrs. Godfrey and McLennan that the Indian people are generally at or near Chapleau at the time in question, and that some were delayed a few days for the meeting before returning to the bush. Mr. Chisholm, in connection with the situation at Chapleau, has been a trouble maker, by magnifying in the eyes of the Indians their own fancied wrongs.\n\nMy report on the Chapleau Indian Boarding School is attached. I will endeavour to clearly indicate the underlying causes for the personal enmity against the Principal in the above statement, and will offer suggestions as to remedial measures.\n\n[Signature]\nRussell T. Finnie\nSuperintendent of Indian Education.\nTo sum up my findings in connection with the specific charges in the affidavits presented by Mr. Chisholm, I wish to state that in every case the truth has been distorted and the testimony is largely false. It is the opinion of Mr. Agent Godfrey and Mr. McLeod of Chapleau, who was once an Indian agent and has the interests of the Indians at heart, that some of the Indians did not know what they were claiming and were not aware of the nature of the statutory declaration. I myself find that Mr. Agent Godfrey informed me that Henry Jackson asked the Indians at the time of the petition to swear to the charges they were making, and they refused.\n\nThe information which I gleaned concerning the individual charges mentioned in the affidavits has been placed on file in the form of notes attached to the individual declarations.\n\nI believe I can throw light on these ridiculous charges that have been brought against the Rev. George Prewer, Principal of the Chapleau Boarding school. The initial agitation was caused by one Jacob Candaasee. This man was a Church of England native catechist and was relieved of his duties by the Rev. Mr. Prewer a few months ago for misappropriation of church funds.\n\nSecondly, the Fletcher and Blacks of the Frans area are related to the Indian Candaasee, and appear to be at present the leaders of the agitation. It was Fletcher who collected the $325 in fees for Mr. Chisholm of Ontario, Ont., whereas Fletcher and Black have a personal grudge against the Rev. Mr. Prewer because he was so unsuccessful in literally forcing their way into the Chapleau school on June 30th last. Mr. Fletcher, on this occasion, actually had to defend himself from the assault of these two women in conjunction with Mrs. Chequain. (This last named Indian woman signed one of the affidavits.) This second explanation of the charges in the petition could be enlarged upon by showing that there is in the Indian community a dislike for the Rev. Mr. Prewer, due to his harsh-handed treatment of parents and others. The white citizens of Chapleau and other centres, in many cases are slow to take Mr. Prewer's side, due to his close-fisted business activities.\n\nThirdly, the storm centre is at Frans. Thirteen of the sixteen affidavits conclude with the statement that the parent wishes the child to be discharged from the Chapleau Indian Industrial School for the purpose of attending the public school, and nine of these declarations specifically mention the public school at Frans. The petition of last September was signed in Frans at the office of Mr. J. Belair, who, I understand, is on the trustees' board of the public school. The white community needs the support of the Indian families to make their school a success, and they are asking the Indians to have their children released for this manifest purpose. Underlying their action is their need for financial support; in fact, from the standpoint of the Indians, the court is before the horde. Mr. Godfrey's authority for stating that nearly $1,000 has already been paid by Indians of the Frans area to the support of the white school there.\nAFFILIATION OF CHILD LABOUR: I have been at many schools where our Indian wards work longer hours and heavier work than at the Chapleau Boarding School. The boys' hands present no evidence that they are or have been, overworked. The regular school hours, for the boys who are old enough to be of age, are 7:30 to 9:45 and 5:30 to 6, a total of 8 hours and 45 minutes per day. The boys who look after the horses and stock put in an extra half hour in the morning and at night, but these boys receive in payment of their extra service pocket money to the extent of 25 cents per day. The pupils last mentioned are in charge of the teams, do the milking and deliver milk to the town.\n\nIn the affidavits referred to \"paddling of milk and wood\" received frequent mention. The Reverend Mr. Inver makes all sales of milk and the boys (2) who deliver it have a regular route. They are well clothed, receive 25 cents per day for their extra work and clock at the school at 10 a.m. in time for the classroom instruction. The milk was supplied in the first instance at the request of Dr. Sheahan and others of Chapleau, because of the uncertain quality of the milk that had been supplied to the residents. As far as the wood-cutting operations are concerned, I ascertained that outsiders contributed to cut the wood and the boys in charge of the teams hauled and delivered it to residents in the town. Wood and milk have never been \"paddled\". Orders have been, in every case, taken by the Principal himself. Last winter some 300 cords of wood was sold in the town and the boys who drove the teams got One Dollar for their bank accounts when on this kind of work. Information concerning the sale of wood and milk was gleaned from the Principal himself, Mr. Godfrey and the boys who are at present in charge of the teams and the milk supply.\n\nCLOTHING: I am convinced that every child in the school has heavy under-clothing, in addition to adequate outerwear and footwear.\n\nMEDICINE: I enquired carefully into the cases of neglect mentioned in the affidavits, and, while I found that the principal has been somewhat slow to call in medical attention, he himself, because of his experience, is fairly well qualified to look after minor ailments; and I might say that the charges in this connection have been so greatly exaggerated that they are misrepresentations of the facts.\n\nCRUELTY: The discipline of the Principal is severe; but not one pupil corroborated the statements made in this connection in the affidavits. The second day of my visit, after having played with the boys and I believe won their confidence, I questioned each boy in private (with the knowledge of the Principal) and find that the affidavits are nothing short of a tissue of lies.\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Scott:\n\nI have the honour to report on my recent visit to the Chapleau Boarding School.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 17th, the department received here 16 affidavits and a covering letter from Mr. A. G. Chisholm, of London, Ont., all of which referred to the improper management of the Rev. Mr. Freer, Principal of the Chapleau Boarding School. You asked me to leave that same night for Chapleau, for the purpose of an official inspection. Previous to this, the Department had received from Henry Jackson, President of the Grand Indian Council, a petition, signed by certain Indians of the Chapleau and Frans districts, in which they asked for the removal of the Rev. Mr. Freer.\n\nIn view of the nature of some of the charges brought against the Rev. Mr. Freer, I thought it advisable to \"walk in on the school\" unannounced. I wished to check up: (1) the clothing in use; (2) the cleanliness of the pupils; (3) the condition of the school; (4) the hours of instruction; before any change could be made in the routine of the school. Later, I endeavoured to inquire into: (5) the care of the sick; (6) the progress of the pupils' studies; (7) the nature of the work done by the children, with particular reference to the sale of milk and wood.\n\nTen minutes after entering the front door, I saw 95 of the 98 pupils and was in a position to know something of the daily routine. I had not been in the building one-half hour before I had examined four boys and two girls, with a view to ascertaining the nature of the clothing provided, the cleanliness of the pupils, and the presence, or absence, of body and head vermin.\n\nI hold the following convictions concerning the charges made in the petition and affidavits that came to hand:\n\nFILTHY CONDITION: The children are fairly clean; head lice are practically nil; no body lice were found and there is but a minimum of skin disease (eczema and scabies).\n\nLACK OF ACADEMIC INSTRUCTION: 85 junior pupils are receiving daily 4 hours of classroom teaching and 39 senior pupils 5 hours per day. 4 older boys in charge of the teams receive somewhat less classroom instruction, but they are paid for their extra work. These 4 boys spend alternate days at work and in the classroom.\nA report on the Chapleau Indian Boarding School is not complete without a special report on the Principal. The Rev. Mr. Brewer has devoted his life to Indian work. He is proud of the Chapleau Indian Boarding School and his ability to finance without outside help. He drives a hard business deal, pays no interference and deals with all school matters in an altogether autocratic manner. His methods make him disliked in the community and inflict upon himself an ever-lasting stigma. The effect on the pupils is two-fold: they have to work faithfully and endure a severe discipline. I have suggested to the Principal that it may be necessary for him to have the M.B.C.C. or the Board of Education's deficit if the Chapleau Indian Boarding School is to present a pleasing picture to the white community, the Indian parents and the pupils themselves. The man's personal appearance is not prepossessing; in addition, he is a cripple; he believes the world to be against him and glories in it.\n\nI made the following requests and suggestions to the Rev. Mr. Brewer: (1) More careful attention to the cleanliness of the building; (2) more thoughtful consideration of the feelings of the staff; (3) the thoughtful and earnest avoidance of any treatment of the pupils that could be considered by outsiders as pitiless; (4) an immediate cessation of any work bordering on the nature of the exploitation of child labour; (5) a consistent reference to the Medical Officer in cases of injury or illness. I promised a definite understanding with Dr. Sheahan, the Medical Officer.\n\nI informed the Principal of the nature of my report and advised him that I would make an effort to have both the M.B.C.C. and the Department of Indian Affairs come to his assistance, so that the unpleasant features that have given rise to the local adverse criticism could be eliminated.\n\nGenerally speaking, the Chapleau Indian Boarding School is doing splendid work for our Indian wards. The cause would receive a severe setback if the services of the Rev. Mr. Brewer were lost.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent of Indian Education.\nOTHER INSTRUCTION: The teaching activities in the Chapleau Boarding School are largely confined to academic instruction in the classroom. A more efficient staff and a better time-table will have to be provided to permit of an all round training. I will make a suggestion concerning these matters in the form of a brief memorandum.\n\nCONDITION OF THE BUILDING: A new building should be practically spotless, and I have to report that the Chapleau Boarding School is only fairly clean. The boys' side is more at fault than any other portion of the institution. I wish to draw your attention, in my memorandum, to one alteration and one repair that I believe to be necessary.\n\nFARM: The Chapleau Indian Boarding school is severely handicapped financially, because of the nature of the property. I cannot foresee that the farming operations will ever be a source of revenue. Secondly, the pasture facilities are poor, and it will be some years before the farm at Chapleau will be an asset. The majority of Indian residential schools, as you know, find their farming activities a source of revenue.\n\nDAILY ROUTINE: At all seasons of the year the following time-table is adhered to rigidly:\n\n5:30 a.m. Reveille - milking and the care of stock, preparation of breakfast.\n6:30 a.m. Breakfast and prayers.\n7:00 a.m. Chores, cleaning and other work.\n9:45 a.m. Preparation for school.\n10 a.m. School - every pupil except the two boys with the teams, in attendance.\n12 a.m. Lunch.\n12:30 Recreation.\n1:30 p.m. School.\n3:00 p.m. Lunch.\n4:00 p.m. Recreation.\n6:00 p.m. Supper and Evening prayers.\n7:00 p.m. Younger children retire - Senior classroom instruction.\n8:00 p.m. Senior pupils retire.\n\nI criticised this time-table, especially for the winter months, and informed the Principal that we would have instructions for him in this connection. My recommendation will be presented in the form of a memorandum.\nOttawa, January 25, 1922.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Scott:\n\nI wish to offer my report on the Chapleau Indian Boarding School:\n\nSTAFF: This institution is a \"one man\" school. The Rev. George Brewer is Principal and his wife Matron. There are 7 others on the staff, only 3 of which can properly be called teachers or officers: Miss Thomas, Senior Teacher, well qualified and of excellent spirit - Miss McCauley Junior Teacher and Girls' Matron and Miss Tracey, Boys' Matron, the last two also splendidly equipped for their work. I consider Mrs. Brewer an excellent officer, without whom the institution would have been decidedly unpopular; she has a tempering and beneficial influence upon the Principal, her husband. The four other members of the staff are nothing more than hired help - three women who are in the kitchen, laundry and dairy and the man who does all of the work. Rev. Mr. Brewer is not negligible although somewhat crippled, he supervises every detail of the school activities and is quite often found at hard manual labour himself. The accommodation for the staff is very limited, and in the future we shall have to provide a principal's residence. There is a real and immediate need for a strong assistant who can eventually take over the principalship. Such a man could take off the shoulders of Dr. Brewer the burden of details and enable him to concern himself with general administration. The Rev. Mr. Brewer would leave the Indian work if he felt the institution that he has fostered for the past ten years would be a continued success. I understand that he has private means which, it is only fair to state, have to the best enabled him to keep the school in excellent condition. The hired help on the staff should be replaced by officers who can give instruction in domestic training and farming and gardening operations.\n\nCLASSROOM: The two teachers now in the school are specially fitted for Indian work in addition to being professionally qualified. The instruction in English, and generally has been in the past but fair. On the other hand, the reasoning faculty of the older pupils shows a careful training in Arithmetic that compares favourably with the best students in most of our residential schools in the Prairie Provinces. Both rooms are very crowded and I suggested to the Principal a different daily routine which will enable him to place one teacher in each room in the classroom at a time. In the Junior room there were 50 boys and girls and in the Senior room 35 the morning I made my census of the pupils. This is too many for successful teaching. In both rooms I made an effort to offer pedagogical methods that I believe are efficient in an Indian classroom.\n(b) To rearrange the time-table and the daily routine of his school for at least five winter months, the hour of rising to be 6.30 a.m. instead of 5.30 and the routine known as the \"half day system\" be initiated.\n\n(c) To immediately cease such activities as the sale of milk and wood and arrange to give the older girls and boys more instruction in domestic training and gardening and farming, respectively.\n\n(d) To give careful and thoughtful attention to the discipline problem of his school and to assiduously avoid any treatment that could be considered by outsiders as pitiless.\n\n(e) To call upon the services of the medical officer without hesitation, in case of injury or sickness.\n\n6. That the Department immediately make a definite arrangement with Dr. Sheahan, who has in the past been uncertain concerning his exact position in relation to the Department of Indian Affairs and the Chapleau Boarding School.\n\n6. That the Department write to Canon Gould, assuring him that the serious charges brought against the Rev. Mr. Irwin were largely without foundation. I feel that nothing should interfere with the M.B.C.S. taking over the responsibility for this and the other institutions that are at present not under their jurisdiction.\n\n7. That the Department direct a strong letter to Mr. Chisholm, of London, Ont., informing him that his activity in the Chapleau area has magnified, in the eyes of the Indians, their own fancied wrongs and has caused considerable trouble to the Department of Indian Affairs and to the management of the school. Amongst, that the charges, which he has maliciously extracted from the Indians, are largely misrepresentations of the facts.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDept. of Indian Education.\nWith a view to bettering conditions at the Chapleau Boarding School, I wish to suggest that the Department take the following action to assist the Rev. Mr. Prewer in his work. I am convinced that the activities which have made the school unpopular with certain groups can be curtailed if the Department and the Diocesan authorities commit to relieving the Principal of his financial burdens. Further, Mr. Prewer's untiring energy will be released for more truly educational work and for the general administration of the school.\n\nMy recommendations are as follows:\n\n1. That the Department place the Chapleau Boarding School in the Western group, in order that the per capita grant will be raised to $120. In this category, along with first class buildings, owned by the Government, Western group, we have at present only one Ontario Boarding school, that at Fort Frances.\n\n2. That the Department inform Bishop Anderson of the requests that we are making to the Rev. Mr. Prewer. These instructions will make it more difficult for him to finance his school, because he will have to eliminate any activity that might be considered exploitation of child labour. We could explain to the Bishop that we are helping the school financially, by changing its category, and we could ask the Church to give some financial assistance in the event of a deficit from year to year.\n\n3. That the Diocesan authorities be approached, with a view to having them place an able assistant principal at the Chapleau Boarding school. Such a man could relieve the present principal of some of his most onerous duties and would also be a check on conduct and management that has in the past made the institution unpopular. I might state that the Rev. Mr. Prewer would welcome such an appointment to his staff.\n\n4. That the Department instruct the Rev. Mr. Prewer:\n   (a) To get rid of his \"hired help\" and employ officers who can be of truly educational assistance.\nOttawa, February 1, 1922.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nThe Department is requesting the Rev. Mr. Frewer, Principal of the Chapleau Indian Boarding School, to curtail certain activities which, I believe, are the underlying reasons for the unpopularity of this institution with a clique of Indian people of the Frank area. Further, we are asking the Diocesan authorities to augment the staff of the school.\n\nThese requests will make it more difficult for the Principal to finance, and I have to inform you that the Department has changed the category of the Chapleau Boarding School: It has been placed in a class known as \"First class building owned by the Government, Western Group.\" This allows for an increase of $50.00 in the per capita grant.\n\nBishop Anderson has been written concerning these matters and his sympathy and assistance have been enlisted.\n\nThe advisability of the M.A.C.C., having an oversight over the Chapleau Boarding School impresses me more and more, as I review the facts that have lately come to our attention. Again, as you know, the Department of Indian Affairs eagerly awaits the time when each religious denomination will have an organization with an oversight over all the Indian work in Canada that comes under its care.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould, M.B.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nChurch of England in Canada,\n181 Confederation Life Bldg.,\nToronto, Ont.\nI am convinced that an able assistant principal should be appointed to the Chapleau Boarding School. Such a man could relieve the Rev. Mr. Prover of some of his most onerous duties and might assist in alleviating conditions that have in the past made the institution unpopular. Mr. Ferrier, the Superintendent General of Indian Education, states that the Principal would welcome such an appointment. The man that Your Lordship selects for this position should have such capacity and character as would fit him for a principalship of an institution.\n\nThe appointment of a strong assistant principal and our instructions will make it more difficult for the Rev. Mr. Prover to finance. Our activities will be eliminated that may rise to certain charges as the exploitation of child labour, etc. The Department of Indian Affairs has therefore charged the salary of the Institution, in order to increase the per capita grant by the sum of $10.00. The Chapleau Indian Boarding School will belong (April 1, 1928) to the class known as \"First class buildings owned by the Government, Western Group.\" The Diocesan authorities will be expected to give some financial assistance in the event of a deficit from year to year.\n\nIf the Department of Indian Affairs and the Diocesan authorities somewhat relieve the Principal of his financial worries and assist him to gather around him a stronger staff, the Rev. Mr. Prover's untiring energy will be released for more truly educational work and for the general administration of the school. I believe that with Your Lordship's cooperation the Chapleau Indian Boarding School will become an institution concerning which we will all be proud, and I ask your kind and early attention to the requests of this communication.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. G. Anderson, D.D.,\nBishop of Moosonee,\nDavenport, Ont.\nOttawa, February 1, 1928.\n\nRev. Reverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform Your Lordship that during the past few months complaints have been brought to the attention of the Department concerning the conduct of the Chapleau Indian Boarding School under the principalship of the Rev. George Fraser. These complaints were largely directed against the principal himself and his administration, and during the past month became of such a serious nature that the Department saw fit to investigate.\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education spent several days at the Chapleau Boarding School and in the vicinity, and I am pleased to inform you that conditions are much better than had been reported; yet, there are certain changes and improvements that must be made, if the cause among our Indian wards at Chapleau is to prosper.\n\nThe following instructions are being given to the Rev. Mr. Fraser:\n\n1. That he get rid of certain \"hired help\" and employ officers who can be of value in educating Indian children.\n\n2. That he rearrange the time-table and daily routine of the school for at least five of the winter months - the hour of rising to be 6.30 instead of 5.30 a.m.; we are also advising an initiation of the \"half day\" system for these months.\n\n3. That he immediately cease such activities as the sale of milk and goods, and arrange to give the older girls and boys more instruction in domestic training and gardening and farming, respectively.\n\n4. That he give careful and thoughtful attention to the discipline problem of the school and assiduously avoid any corporal punishment that could be considered by outsiders as pitiless.\n\n5. That he call upon the services of the Medical Officer without hesitation in case of injury or sickness. (The Department is endeavouring to make a more definite and satisfactory arrangement with Dr. Maclean of Chapleau).\nOttawa, February 8, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that during the past few months complaints have been brought to the attention of the Department concerning the conduct of the Chapleau Indian Boarding School under your principalship. These complaints were largely directed against you, personally, and concerning your administration. During the past month they became of such a serious nature that the Department saw fit to have an inspection.\n\nMr. Ferrier, the Superintendent of Indian Education, has made his report, and I am pleased to inform you that conditions are much better than we had been led to believe. However, there are certain changes and improvements that must be made, if the cause among our Indian wards at Chapleau is to prosper.\n\nTherefore, the Department of Indian Affairs requests your careful attention to the following instructions:\n\n1. Get rid of certain \"hired help\" and employ officers who can be of value in educating Indian children.\n\n2. Rearrange the time-table and daily routine of the school for at least five of the winter months - the hour of rising to be 6:30 instead of 6:00 a.m.; we also advise an initiation of the \"half day\" system for these months.\n\n3. Immediately cease such activities as the sale of milk and wood, and arrange to give the older girls and boys more instruction in domestic training and gardening and farming, respectively.\n\n4. Give careful and thoughtful attention to the discipline problem of the school and assiduously avoid any corporal punishment that could be considered by outsiders as pitiless.\n\n5. Call upon the services of the Medical Officer, without hesitation, in case of injury or sickness. (The Department is endeavouring to make a more definite and satisfactory arrangement with Dr. Sheehan of Chapleau).\nI am convinced that an able assistant principal should be appointed to the Chapleau Boarding School. Such a man would:\n\n(a) Relieve you of some of your most arduous duties,\n\n(b) Release some of your untiring energy for more truly educational work and for the general administration of the school,\n\n(c) Eventually be in a position to take over the principleship of one of our residential schools.\n\nMr. Perrier assures me that you welcome such an appointment. To take care, I have communicated with the Rt. Rev. J. G. Anderson, D.D., Bishop of Moose Cree, enlisting his aid in this connection.\n\nThe appointment of a strong assistant principal and our instructions will make it more difficult for you to finance. Therefore, the Department of Indian Affairs has changed the category of the school in order to increase the per capita grant by a sum of $10.00. From the beginning of the new fiscal year (April 1, 1928) the Chapleau Indian Boarding School will belong to the class known as \"First class buildings owned by the Government, Western group\". The Diocesan authorities have been asked to give some financial assistance in the event of a deficit from year to year.\n\nI believe that, with Bishop Anderson's cooperation, and with any help this Department can give, the Chapleau Indian Boarding School will become an institution concerning which we will all be proud; and I ask your careful attention to the subject matter of this communication.\n\nMr. Agent Godfrey is being informed of our action.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeacon\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nReverend Geo. Frewer,\nPrincipal,\nChapleau Boarding School,\nChapleau, Ont.\nOttawa, February 8, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Godfrey:\n\nI am enclosing, for your information, a copy of my letter to the Rev. Mr. Power, Principal of the Chapleau Indian Boarding School. The enclosure explains itself. Any assistance that you can give to the Principal at this time is requested.\n\nIn the light of recent developments at this school, and with reference to the instructions the Department has given to the Reverend Principal, will you make a special report on the Chapleau Indian Boarding School and its activities. This report should be on conditions as they exist about the middle of this month.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nT. J. Godfrey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\nOttawa, February 8, 1922.\n\nDear Mr. Frewer:\n\nI have prepared, out of my experiences when visiting residential schools, a time-table based on what is known as the \"half day system.\" This routine has been found especially valuable in the winter months and in most schools, round the year round. There are many variations from this routine; but, as near as I can remember, it is the typical plan in use. The students of a residential school of 100 pupils are divided into three groups: A, 50 morning boys and girls; B, 35 afternoon boys and girls; C, all day students.\n\nThe older boys and girls who are of value in the departments of a school, and who should receive the benefit of domestic and farming instruction, are divided evenly into morning and afternoon groups. Roughly, 30% of the children are better off in school and at play for the entire day; they are known in my plan as group C.\n\n6:30 a.m.: Morning.\nOlder boys - barns (Farmer)\nIntermediate boys - wood and inside chores (Asst. principal)\n\nOlder girls - preparation of breakfast (Cook)\nIntermediate girls - dormitory and household duties (3 lady officers)\n\n7:15 a.m.: Breakfast and prayers.\n8:00 a.m.: Group B to the departments (Department officers)\nGroups A & C - recreation.\n\n9:00 a.m.: Group A <school> (Senior teacher 50 pupils)\n(Junior teacher 55)\n\n12:00 a.m.: Lunch.\n12:30 p.m.: Groups A, B, & C - recreation.\n1:00 p.m.: Group A to the departments (Department officers)\nB & C - recreation continues to 1:30.\n\n1:30 p.m.: Groups A & C - school.\n4:00 p.m.: Groups B & C - recreation.\n\n5:00 p.m.: Group B - chores\nGroup C Recreation\n\n6:00 p.m.: Supper and prayers.\n7:00 p.m.: Groups A & B - school.\n(The two teachers take alternate evening duty, giving instruction in general lines, (as Composition, Story-telling, debating, etc.)\n\n7:30 p.m.: Group C retire\n8:00 p.m.: Groups A & B retire.\n\nRev. Geo. Frewer,\nPrincipal,\nChapleau Boarding School,\nChapleau, Ont.\nThen group A or group B start their half day's work.\n\n* Larger boys report to the farmer for duty, 3, to the assistant principal for outside chores, 4, to a lady officer for inside chores, 5 girls report to the cook for instruction and the preparation of the meals, 6 like number to the matroness and the same quota to the matron for household duties and chores.\n\nIt may be necessary to have the older boys who are caring for the stock and the girls who are preparing the breakfast rise earlier than 6:30; but this can be arranged by the two officers who are on duty in the early morning. Variations from the above plan for work in the departments will be necessary on washing and baking days; but this is a detail that can be worked out.\n\nIt may be necessary, in individual schools, to depart from this routine in a large degree, but I wish to be of help to you in any way possible and felt that you might be glad to have a routine to discuss with other principals. If I can be of assistance in any way, it will be a pleasure to respond so far as is within my power.\n\nLetters have been directed to the Diocese and to the M.S.O.C., and better arrangements are being made with the Medical Officer, and, as I promised, I recommended a change in the category of the Chaplain boarding school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nsupt. of Indian Education.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to thank you for your favour of the 2nd instant, in which you comment on various questions arising out of Mr. Perrier's visit of inspection at this institution, and for the kindness and consideration shown in dealing with the various items in connection with the recommendations made by your Department relative to the administration of affairs here.\n\nI am certain that you appreciate fully the fact that there is nothing so absolutely perfect state of affairs, in any department of any one office, as that which the management of our Institution has been trying to bring about as close to the line as it is possible to do, with due consideration for the welfare of the work and the Indian people in general.\n\nSchools such as this, which have practically come into being within a very short period of time, require very closely for first-time administration, orders and directions, criticism, and suggestions, and in the course of inspection, jealousies and criticisms, not only where the Indians are concerned but from the political standpoint, it is period of political upheaval, and I am congratulating ourselves that we have been able to maintain serious enough when taken as read, have been able to maintain a few, in fact, and that the persons having been in these instances, deliberately state that they do not know the contents of these declarations, and are not responsible for what was supposed to have said.\n\nRegarding the suggestions contained in your letter, we will take a reversal policy of the school, as will realize that it will take a period of time to make any changes, and that the best thing to do would be to keep the present order, or to make a new order.\n\nWe have already acted in the matter of compensation, and have increased the salary of Mr. Jo... at a rate of $15.00 per month.\n\nWe have also acted in the matter of the dormitories, and have provided additional accommodations, there being no outside assistance, and believe that we can fully carry on the salary demands but fear that the lack of accommodation will materially interfere with our securing new personnel, and therefore, since seeing here a number of applications for positions of several capable men (name), simply because no excuse could be procured, and therefore, seeing the last applicant go by simply on the ground that there is no accommodation for himself and wife, to be.\nWe thank you, too, for placing this Institution in the category\n...and the substantial aid this additional grant will bring in terms of food and other necessaries are gradually being realized. We could not have asked for more to finish our work. I fear that we shall still have to make less and feel of more lest financial crisis should arise, but we only handicap us in our work and add to our burdens without reflecting to the detriment of the general work of the Church. In consequence I shall have to go more into my own resources as circumstances require.\n\nI must therefore appeal once more to you for your help before I venture upon the course which I am now taking.\n\nAssuring you of our continued hearty cooperation in all matters, I am, etc.,\n\nGeo. Packer\nOttawa, February 14, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to a matter arising out of your communication to the Deputy Minister, of the 10th instant. This letter reminds me of your shortage of accommodation for staff. The thought has occurred to me that it might be possible to use one or two of the rooms on your third floor. If my memory serves me right, you had certain rooms at the head of the stairs leading to the assembly hall, that were used for storage purposes. The Department will be pleased to hear from you in this connection.\n\nI was pleased to learn of your efforts to conform to the wishes of the Department at this time, and I wish to repeat our offer of any assistance that we can give.\n\nConcerning the repairs and alterations in the children's play rooms, it might be well to direct a communication to the Department, as soon as weather conditions permit of working at the plumbing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. Geo. Brewer,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Boarding School,\nChapleau, Ont.\n\nR. T. Ferrier,\nDept. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, February 14, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 10th instant, referring generally to conditions at the Chapleau Indian Boarding School. I am pleased to learn that you are already taking action which, the Department believes, will better conditions. You may rest assured that any assistance we can give will be freely offered, in connection with the changes you are trying to make at the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Geo. Powers,\nPrincipal,\nChapleau Boarding School,\nChapleau, Ont.\nat the present time.\n\nThen our barn was only roofed in temporarily and for rafters and supporting only second hand lumber. The rafters were of 2x4 material which would prove to make the length required. All under fairly well supported and broad, but roof, under the heavy weight of snow and ice, is beginning to sag, and the building requires completing in accordance with the original plan. We have only the size of the gable in width to store our hay and feed and sometimes are so crowded that it is impossible to get at what we really need.\n\nWe have improved our land to such an extent that we hope to grow ten acres of cornage, five acres of corn and five acres of another mixture, for fear that the corn might prove too tender for our climate, which however was not the case last year. This will mean that we shall need our silo and filling equipment.\n\nThen the buildings built a year ago require paint, and there is a great deal of fencing to be done to prevent our stock straying and also for the protection of our crops. For this purpose several hundred rods of barbed wire will be needed and upwards of 1000 cedar posts, together with sharpening stones and wire stretchers.\n\nThe staff and pupils can perform all the labour connected with the fencing of the Department is satisfied to supply the posts and other material. In order to ascertain as to the cost of 1000 cedar posts, or the standard size and quality, I have already posted up notices calling upon parties to tender. Ordinarily posts have been very difficult to purchase in this locality, but there are a number of men and teams in the neighbourhood who are content to work with one or two engaged in the work of setting out wood and timber. I find that there is a probability that sufficient may be had at fairly reasonable prices. We have no cedar on our School property, and I know of none except on limited already taken. As a result we could not produce them ourselves even were we in a position to do so.\n\nAs cost of material and labour goes today I cannot see how these improvements can all be added, under a cost of less than $15,000.00 to $20,000.00. Not when we consider the permanent class of buildings the Department calls for, and such as would conform to what we already have here.\n\nThere is every likelihood of the school maintaining its rated pupilage, and it is not improbable that within a short time, the Department and the Church, working together, may see the enormous advantage and the economy, in centralizing all its educational work, to take care of all the Indian population, in this part of Northern Ontario, at this particular place, so called which, from experience, I think it well worth while working towards.\n\nI would like the Department's opinion on the matter of the improvements suggested, and to know whether you would sanction the small expenditure mentioned for fitting up the temporary building for our farmer.\n\nI am mailing a copy of this letter to Mr. Indian Agent Geoffrey, in case you may care to take up any of the matters referred to with him.\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nCapilano Indian Boarding School\nCapilano, B.C., Feb. 17th, 1923.\n\nJov D. McLean Esq.,\nActing Deputy Assistant Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nUnder date, Feb 2nd, inst., I received a communication from the Deputy Superintendent General, with reference to several changes which he pointed out as being essential to the better carrying out of the work for which our present building was purposed.\n\nAmongst these important changes, which we are bending every effort in carrying out, is the matter of employing a much larger staff.\n\nAt the present time, besides myself and Mrs. Prewer and our family of one child at home, we have seven members already on the staff, and I am expecting a young Eastern man to take the position of Farmer and Outside Superintendent at any time.\n\nWe occupy the suite of rooms on the North-East corner of the building on the first floor, which is composed of two bedrooms and a sitting-room.\n\nIf you examine the plans, you will find that there are four other staff rooms - two doubles and two singles - these are all filled, and for lack of space we have had to make use of the boy's Infirmary, and as it is so small it difficult in the case of an epidemic of any kind. As it is the school has just been experiencing a mild outbreak of chicken-pox. Four boys have had it, but they had mixed with the others most of the time we did not place them in the Infirmary.\n\nOur Farmer-Superintendent, is to be married either early in April or May, and his wife, who is from an office in Ottawa, a young girl, would not qualify for a position at our establishment.\n\nBesides the engagements of Mr. Franklin Scott's letter advocates the appointment of an assistant medical, and to carry out the suggestions will mean a revision of our time-table, which, if we are to take care of all the dependents as they ought to be, will mean the appointing of fully one more female worker.\n\nThis will certainly mean that we shall require a great deal more accommodation for our staff. As it is we have a great deal of difficulty in grouping our workers, in order to make their positions and temporary assignments, so as to enable them without friction to share a double room. Each worker claims they are entitled to a separate room. I think you will quite see the situation. However, it is impossible for us to comply with this. Even with the four rooms occupied by the six helpers the accommodation is far short of what is really needed.\n\nWhen your Mr. Farmer was up about a month ago, I pointed all this out to him, and Mr. Indian Agent Godfrey, and would have gone into the matter but no way appeared to suggest itself except to build another house residence. One a separate building, or one attached to the old one. The latter would be more economical, as it would be less costly to build an addition to the old building than to erect a new one.\n\nMr. Farmer has consented to occupy the West end of the Camp, which served as a Cookery for the cook-stoves and which we did not pull down for the summer months provided we fit it up to serve as a separate building. I think could be done at a cost of not more than $100.00. This is about as much as it would cost to rent a building of this kind in Capilano for this time, and we could still use it as a Carpenter shop afterwards - the purpose to which it is being put.\nOttawa, February 27, 1882.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 17th instant, concerning the changes at the Chapleau Indian Boarding School, and outlining the requirements that will have to be financed in the near future, in order to properly cater to the educational needs of the children under your care.\n\nIn reply, I beg to state that it is extremely doubtful if the loft for the barn and the silo can be built this year. The appropriation for Indian education will allow of practically no new buildings this fiscal year. I have asked Mr. Agent Godfrey to ascertain the cost of the fencing that is needed.\n\nI have noted that the west end of the contractors' building can be fitted up as a temporary residence for the farmer, at a cost of $100. Mr. Agent Godfrey has been authorized to proceed with this work.\n\nIt has been suggested that the cottage from the old site be moved to your present location and put into condition as a residence. The Department has directed Mr. Godfrey to ascertain the cost of this enterprise. I have asked his opinion as to the advisability of making this difficult move. If you think the cottage will stand up under such treatment and will do for a farmer's residence, I am sure he would be grateful for any advice you can give him regarding moving the building across the river and railroad.\n\nI might state that the Deputy Minister is quite pleased with the manner in which you have endeavored to carry out the suggestions in his communication to you of the second instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. Geo. Perrier,\nPrincipal,\nChapleau Boarding School,\nChapleau, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. T. Perrier,\nAsst. of Indian Education.\nSir,\n\nThere are also a few matters I would like to mention, and that is the limited quarters available for the staff. Apparently this was overlooked when the plans were being prepared for this Institution consequently the quarters are not adequate for the staff if the required number are employed.\n\nFirst there are the quarters for the Assistant Principle who has been selected or the man who would take charge of the outside work. With the staff as at present they have very limited quarters but with the addition of the Asst. Principle and Farmer at present I cannot see where room is to be found for them.\n\nA good man has been secured for the farm work and he is to be married shortly and some provision will have to be made for this man and his wife. The man is satisfied for the present to make use of one of the construction buildings left standing providing it is made habitable but this would only suffice while the man is by himself which will only be for probably three months and would hardly be suitable to take his wife to live in but I believe if a capable man is to be kept on this work some provision in the way of a dwelling will have to be supplied.\n\nI thought perhaps the Department might consider moving the cottage from the old site but this also appears out of the question to the River and then the Hallway however I do not think it impossible if a suitable Contractor would take hold of the proposition and this appears the easiest way out of the difficulty so far as the farm staff is concerned but the Asst. Principle's quarters would be another matter requiring careful consideration and I can suggest a way out of this difficulty.\n\nReferring to the staff again a new instructor has been secured for the kitchen who the Principle thinks will be satisfactory.\n\nHoping I have touched on all matters vital to the best interests of the school I beg to remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIndian Agent.\nFebruary 20th, 1923\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to Mr. Scott's letter of February 2nd relative to the Chapleau Indian Boarding School I wish to make the following report.\n\nTaking each clause in the instructions as they appear:\n\n1. One of the hired help referred to has already left leaving shortly after Mr. Ferrier visited the school eliminating the necessity of discharging him as he was not at all suitable for position.\n\n2. The time table has been rearranged to conform to the instructions from the Department.\n\n3. Steps have already been taken to discontinue the sale of milk and wood; this will take effect the first of April. The sale of wood has already been cut out but the sale of milk will be carried on to a small extent until the first of April to allow these remaining patrons to secure other service.\n\n4. I believe more thoughtful consideration is being given in the matter of funds and supplies.\n\n5. More attention has been given to the studies of the children since Mr. Ferrier's visit he having pointed out to the Head Principle some noticeable faults in his methods.\n\nGenerally speaking I feel the Principle is giving more of his attention and energy to the educational work and administration of the school since he decided to spend less time looking to the financial aspect of the institution, and which perhaps was being done in all good faith but to the detriment of the pupils.\n\nThe Rev. Principle is trying hard to secure a capable staff and feels that since the Department has allowed the extra increase in per capita that it is great encouragement to him to put forth every effort to make the work a success and to carry it on to the satisfaction of the Department.\nOttawa, February 27, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 26th instant, referring to the Chapleau Indian Boarding School. I have noted that certain changes are being made on the staff, that the time-table has been re-arranged, that steps have been taken to discontinue the sale of milk and wood and that the Principal is giving more of his attention and energy to educational work and the administration of the school. Your remarks concerning the limited staff accommodation will receive the careful attention of the Department.\n\nBoth you and the Rev. Mr. Brewer have suggested making temporary use of one of the outbuildings as a residence for the farmer. The Principal believes that an expenditure of $100 is necessary in this connection. You are authorized to have the west end of the outbuilding built up in addition to temporary quarters for the farmer. The rent in this connection should be kept as low as possible and should not exceed $100. I understand that this building could be used as a carpenter shop in future.\n\nConcerning the moving of the cottage from the old school site, I have to ask you to secure prices in this connection. If this building is in good condition and could be used for a residence, the Department feels that it is advisable to have it moved to the new location, if the cost is at all reasonable.\n\nWill you ascertain the cost of the fence that the Rev. Mr. Brewer is asking for at this time. He mentions 1000 cedar posts, together with staples, gates and wire stretcher. What is your opinion regarding the need for this improvement at the present time.\n\nIt is unlikely that a principal's residence will be erected this coming fall or winter, as the amount is very slow to vote funds for new buildings. However, the need of the Chapleau Indian Boarding School for more staff accommodation and for a completion of the barn will be kept in mind.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Inform Principal Brewer.\"\n\n(Signed) J. D. McLean.\n\nAs you are by this time aware, I secured Nurse M. Macaulay, of this city, to supervise the nursing duties at the Chapleau Indian Boarding School during the serious illness that has visited the school. Miss Macaulay left for Chapleau last night. It is understood that the nurse will act under the instructions of the Medical Officer and will be, of course, subject to your supervision as well. I explained to her that she would be given help by the members of the staff and nurses' girls.\n\nThe Department regrets to learn of these cases of pneumonia and trusts that rapid recovery will be made by the children who are suffering. As soon as it is possible to get along without the services of Nurse Macaulay, I am sure that Dr. Wilkinson and you will inform her and she can look to Mr. Agent Godfrey for assistance in connection with making out her vouchers for expenses and salary. In regard to this, would you inform Miss Macaulay to make out vouchers covering the expenses incurred on her trip and salary to the end of the present fiscal year (March 31). This is desired so that our books will be completed. A cheque will be sent her for the amount of the voucher, less the $25.00 (her accountable cheque No. 3967).\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nDept. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Geo. Brewer,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Boarding School,\nChapleau, Ont.\nOttawa, March 9, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to confirm the Department's telegram of yesterday, as follows:\n\n\"Please meet Nurse Massawley from Ottawa tomorrow (Thursday) evening. Inform Principal Brewer.\"\n\n(signed) J. D. McLean\n\nI have arranged to have Nurse M. Massawley employed temporarily at the Chapleau Boarding School, to supervise the nursing activities at this time. I have informed her that you are the Department's representative and that she should take her instructions from Dr. Wilkinson and Rev. Mr. Brewer. Any assistance you can give her in the making out of her vouchers will be appreciated. I have written the Rev. Principal, asking him to have Miss Massawley make out vouchers covering her expenses and salary up to the end of this month. It is desired that this account be settled, as March 31st closes our fiscal year.\n\nAny assistance that you can give the Chapleau Boarding School, as they pass through this trying time, will be appreciated by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nAsst. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. J. Godfrey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\nInstitution of a similar character as our own will be closed to either of your children, and if report is correct there is every likelihood that we may not have an opportunity of attending a public school, unless you remove from your present location.\n\nI have gone to almost unheard of pains to secure, as teachers in our school, some of the best and most approved women the Dominion has to offer.\n\nIn the person of Miss Olive Thomas, as Senior Teacher, we secured her at a great financial sacrifice where she is concerned, taking her from a position in a City school where she was receiving a salary of $1500.00 per year, leaving with her own people in her house. I will challenge you to find, in spite of all your pretended knowledge of education and matters, her equal, as a teacher, anywhere in a school of this kind.\n\nWith the exception of some few articles of clothing, your children have been maintained free of cost to you, and they have not only been given a very fair education and taught other matters of equal importance with book learning, but their moral and religious interests have been thoroughly safe-guarded.\n\nPractically ever since your children have been resident here both yourself and your wife, especially the latter, have sought to be little by little being made in their behalf, as also that of a number of other pupils.\n\nThe very ungrateful attitude of yourself and wife is making it not only difficult for myself to see that it is worth while doing very much more for your children, and were I to show the same disposition towards them that you have both shown, I am quite certain that their positions here would have been made very uncomfortable.\n\nA family like your own, claiming to be leaders in missionary, especially in religious things, should be better employed than in an attempt to destroy the work of an institution of this kind, which has not only been classed as a school whose day will have an untold influence upon the younger generation of Indians of the locality, but which is destined to play an important part in the whole educational system of the Dominion.\n\nYour feeble attempts remind me of a small boy with a pair of moccasins on kicking a huge rock, the harder he kicks the worse he suffers, and the rock remains as firm as ever.\n\nIt will be well for you both, instead of rushing on in a hasty frenzy of denunciation of our policy and plan, where your children are concerned, to stop and think whether such acts are going to do yourselves or your children any good.\n\nI am not certain what steps the Department intends to take regarding your false declaration. I know however that it is engaging its attention at the present time.\n\nFor your future guidance however, I wish to call your attention that neither yourself or wife will be permitted to visit the school more than once a month, during the time of the residence of either of your children here, and then only through arrangements between myself and Indian Agent.\n\nI am forwarding a copy of this letter to the Department at Ottawa and one to Mr. Indian Agent Geoffrey.\n\nFaithfully Yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nThere are a few matters relating to this Institution affecting the conduct of yourself and wife of which I wish to write and to call your attention to.\n\nIn the first place you have two children here, Carrie and Eddie. According to the records on file with the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa, these children were admitted to the school on May 15th, 1914. At the present time Carrie is in the Junior Grade and Eddie is in Grade 2. It was not until we had met your children in school that we realized how much they needed our help. Carrie has been doing very well in her studies and Eddie has been doing quite well too. We have been working hard to improve their grades and we believe that they will do even better next year.\n\nPossibly you may not be aware of the fact that in making such a statement, the person is guilty of a very serious offense and can be prosecuted for perjury. We have heard that your two children entered the school on May 15th, 1914 according to actual calculation. It is also true that they had been here just about two years and three months when they were enrolled in the school. We have taken into consideration that during this time your child has been instructed from the Indian Department and has been enrolled in the school for moving into the new building and for dislocation during the moving period, so we say that your children are now enrolled at the school and have been there for more than two years.\n\nIn the case of Eddie, I am sure that you will find in the weeks of his residence at school in any public or private school, he would be in any manner progressing notwithstanding he is not one of the brightest of our pupils.\n\nYour boy is not sick and has not a single blemish on him so may have been suffering from the effects of weather change. We are grateful for your cooperation and have arranged for your son to be seen by a doctor and have paid his stay in hospital. However, he is recovering and we are pleased to report that he is doing well.\n\nIn conclusion, we urge you to consider your boy's future and to make the best decision possible. We feel that it is in the best interest of your boy that he should be able to continue his education.\nChapleau Indian Boarding School,\nChapleau, Ont., March 16th, 1922.\n\nMr. John D. McLennan, Esq.,\nChief Inspector, Indian Affairs, Ottawa,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wired you by night letter last night as follows: \"Have eight cases of Pneumonia this. Would like you to authorize a nurse to take care of these. Staff not sufficient to continue for long period. Better supply one from Ottawa.\"\n\nFor the past month there has been a great deal of whooping cough amongst the smaller boys and girls, and a few cases of Chicken Pox.\n\nThe Chicken Pox had been prevalent all around in Chapleau and its points along the railway and, although we take every precaution, cases have been brought in in some way. There has been no whooping cough so far as we can gather, this season, anywhere in the neighborhood, etc., except here developed here.\n\nWith children having a tendency towards lung weakness, an epidemic of this kind is sure to go very hard, and the children have been given every care, but in spite of all we can do this kind trouble is beginning to show itself. I know cases too numerous of the children have been under nourished from infancy and have very little rallying power.\n\nLate last night we had to send for the Doctor to see little girl who we thought could not possibly pull through the night. We managed to restore her, however, and had her partially recovered when he arrived.\n\nI had him examine other cases which have been rather stubborn, with the above result.\n\nWe feel that with careful nursing and our present equipment we ought to be able to handle these without any serious results, but would like to fail, in any event, that everything possible had been done for them. There are more Pneumonia cases in our locality this year than in any former years, and Doctors and Nurses are kept very busy. In fact, are not able to keep up with the demands, outside help having been brought in.\n\nOur own child, a girl of thirteen, was we hoped would write on her entrance this year; and who has been staying with a family in town until recently, the Public School, when visiting home during the week end, developed Scarlet Fever, and we have had to isolate her with an old child's room, i.e., one of the Infirmary rooms, she has barely been in two weeks, but as the regulations call for a six weeks' isolation, we cannot use this part of the building for fully a month yet. We are most anxious to prevent contact in any way.\n\nWe have amongst our staff, those who are very willing to take a share in the work of nursing, but unfortunately, one of our workers has broken down at the work, and the doctors have advised our immediate removal to hospital. Our kitchen matron has been called away on account of the outbreak of influenza here, and hope to fill these vacancies, but mean while the staff has quite all right. It is possible for them to do to care for the ordinary wants of the Institution.\n\nWe shall appreciate anything the Department can do to help out at this time.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nMarch 6th, 1937\n\nDear Mr. Smith,\n\nBefore signing my name to this, I thought it well to visit the Chaplain School, as soon as I could, and discuss its whole situation with its Principal on the spot. This I did last week, and went as thoroughly as possible into all the problems under your letter.\n\nIn the whole I believe that the proposed change of policy is in the right direction and am willing to cooperate with the head of any house. There are however several points which need careful consideration. There can be no doubt you need a more accommodating, if not assistant, mindful and patient air about yourself in addition to the present staff. Such an attitude will prove very useful in the future. It seems to me that a housemaster should be patient, kind, and a friend's house as well as a teacher's. He should be able to handle things in such a way that he can satisfy everyone who has visited him, particularly those who have visited but once or twice. He should be able to explain his policies and ideas in such a way that they will be understood by everyone who visits him. He should be able to handle the difficulties which may arise in such a manner that they will be resolved in a peaceful manner.\n\nI believe that the proposed change of policy is in the right direction and am willing to cooperate with the head of any house.

Nurse Macaulay will have, no doubt, a grasp on the situation and will lend herself to easing the onerous duties of the staff.\n\nThe Department regrets to learn of the illness of your daughter, and I hope that her recovery will be rapid.\n\nI have noted the contents of your letter to James Fletcher, of Missanabie.\n\nI have to inform you that the Bishop of Moosonee has offered some questions to the Department, and I am enclosing, for your information, a copy of the Deputy Superintendent General's communication to him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSup't. of Indian Education.\n\nEnclos\n\nRev. Geo. Frewer,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Boarding school,\nChapleau, Ont.\nThe Rev. Principal's energy might thus be released for:\n\n(a) general religious activity,\n(b) supervision of the educational features of each department,\n(c) business management.\n\nYou will understand that such a division of duties is but speculative. The individual residential school has peculiar problems and, of necessity, must work out the details as the experience of actual practice dictates.\n\nI have to thank your Lordship for your interest and cooperation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.,\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, March 15, 1922.\n\nRev. Rev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge Your Lordship's communication of the 6th instant, referring to the situation at the Chapleau Indian Boarding school. I have noted that you have been able to visit Chapleau, and I am grateful that we are to have your active cooperation.\n\nYou have drawn the department's attention to the need for more staff accommodation, and I wish to assure you that this matter is receiving our most earnest consideration. The department is already in communication with the Hon. Principal and Mr. Agent Godfrey, in an effort to make temporary arrangements for the housing of the former. I trust that a principal's residence will be provided for as soon as Parliament sees fit to vote funds for new buildings.\n\nI am of the opinion that an assistant principal at Chapleau should be entirely gained by the instructions of the Rev. Mr. Prover. His duties might be as follows:\n\n(a) General supervision of the boys' activities.\n   1. Dormitory duties in the early morning and at bedtime.\n   2. Boys' chores in and out of the building.\n   3. Athletics and indoor games.\n   4. Boys' clothing and bathing.\n\n(b) Oversight of the heating and electric equipment and supervision of the boys who are doing the actual work in this connection.\n\n(c) Certain religious exercises.\n\n(d) To act as understudy to the principal. The assistant principal should learn as much as possible of the general management and administration of a residential school. He should be initiated into the buying and other financial activities. This training would prepare him to take over the principalship of a residential school. At present, in Western Canada under Church of England auspices there is one vacancy, one temporary principal and a third school where the principal is extremely desirous of retiring.\n\n- The Rev. principal's -\n\nRev.

However, I trust that the health of the pupils is now such that a skilled nurse is no longer necessary. A cheque for $185.00 in payment of your account to the end of March is being forwarded under separate cover.\n\nConcerning the payment for your services for the present month, and your expenses from Chapleau to Ottawa, I believe the best arrangement would be to have this matter straightened out when you come to the office in Ottawa. You should keep an account of your expenses on the return journey. It will be quite in order for you to spend some time in your home at Pembroke. If you had been making the journey direct to Ottawa, I could have forwarded you requisition for transportation and berth; but, in view of the stop-over, the best arrangement will be for you to pay your expenses yourself and submit your accounts when you arrive in Ottawa.\n\nI am pleased to learn that the young ladies on the staff have been of assistance to you, and I would like you to give Miss Thomas, particularly, my best regards.\n\nYour very truly,\n\nRussell T.

Pauw.\nOttawa, Oct. 20, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have a copy of your communication of the 30th ultimo to the Bishop of Moosonee, in which you resign the principalship of the Chapleau Indian Boarding School. I have noted that your decision is not a hasty one and that this action on your part is necessary.\n\nI am sure that the M. S. C. will be grateful for the three months' notice, and I trust that they will make arrangements for a strong successor to carry on the important work that you have been doing.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\n\nRev. Geo. Fraser,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Boarding School,\nChapleau, Ont.\nChapleau Indian Boarding School,\nChapleau, Ont., Sept. 30th, 1928.\n\nJoh. T. McLean, B.A.,\nDeputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI write you with reference to our herd of Registered Brahman stock, now at our Institution here.\n\nThis herd has been selected with the greatest of care, or rather the foundation stock have, from some of the most noted herds in Canada.\n\nAmongst them are stock tracing back three times to the world's Champion cow Lady Jane Sylvia. There are also the deep tracings of the Pontiac Syndicate and the Alberta.\n\nI believe we have 27 that are or will register, besides about twelve or fourteen good grades.\n\nThe wintering of this stock is going to mean quite an expense to the school as a great deal of the feed will have to be imported; and since we are under a promise to the Department not to engage in the sale of milk, our income will be greatly lessened for the coming winter, making it unprofitable for us to keep such a large herd.\n\nI feel that we could easily spare 20 head of the choicest of this stock. Some would be milch cows, some yearling heifers and some this spring's calves, and one young yearling bull.\n\nAll the stock from which these young animals have sprung have been Tuberculin tested, and the herd has always been free from abortion.\n\nGoing to our senior herd sire, King Bohe Champion, becoming too fat and heavy during last winter quite a number of our cows failed to become with calf early in the summer, but through importing a new bull and reducing the bigger bull in flesh we have virtually overcome this difficulty. Most of the cows have been in milk for nearly nine months however and, on this account are not making such a great showing, giving not more than half of what they would be giving under normal conditions.\n\nWhile paying a visit to the Mohawk Institute near Brantford last week, Mr. Rogers, together with the Principal, Mrs. Boyce, expressed a great desire to go into the work of raising a good herd of this particular cattle, and said they would endeavour to get the consent of the Department as also to secure some financial aid towards the purchase of such a herd and felt that by co-operation of this kind the Institutions would benefit mutually.\n\nIf the Department could see its way towards some such arrangement I for my part should be ready to meet the Mohawk Institute with a reasonable figure as it would be possible for me to quote for enough to make up a full ear-load. I may add that all Pedigreed stock are transported at half cost.\n\nTrusting that this suggestion may meet with your kind consideration.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, October 9, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have yours of the 30th ultimo, concerning the herd of registered Holstein stock at the Chapleau Indian Boarding School, and your wish to sell some 20 head to the Mohawk Institute.\n\nIn reply I wish to state that there are no funds available from this year's Vote to purchase stock for the Mohawk, and any increases to their herd will have to be met from their per capita grant. You might do well to communicate direct with the Principal, Mrs. Boyce.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Geo. Frewen,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Boarding School,\nChapleau, Ont.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nRussell T. Perley, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to inform you that the Indian and Eskimo Commission of our Society, at a meeting held on the 8th instant, decided to recommend to our Executive Committee in Toronto, for submission to you for your approval, that the position of Principal of the Chapleau School, from the beginning of next year when the Rev. J. Prever, the present Principal, will sever his connection with the same, be given to the Rev. J. A. Macgrah, the present rector of St. Mary's Church, Brandon, Man., and I trust that his appointment may commend itself to your approval.\n\nMr. Macgrah, who is thirty six years of age, is a graduate of St. John's College, Winnipeg, and has already had considerable experience in institutional work having assisted for some time his foster father, the Rev. T. E. Wilson, when he was Principal of the Shingwauk Home, and subsequently when he held for six years the position of Teacher at the Elkhorn School in Manitoba.\n\nIn recommending Mr. Macgrah for this position our Commission feel confident that they are recommending a man who is well qualified in many ways to make the School a pronounced success.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nField Secretary and Acting Secretary I.S.O.C.\nOttawa, Nov. 20, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, nominating Rev. J. A. Magrath of Brandon, Man., to the principleship of the Chapleau boarding school. The Department is pleased to learn of the effort you are making to secure the services of well qualified Rev. Gentlemen for the Indian residential schools, and your action is approved in this connection.\n\nMr. Magrath has had experience that should fit him for our work. I believe he would be well advised to visit the school at Brandon and make a study of the methods in use at that institution. The Rev. Principal and the senior teacher - Mr. Burns - are both recognized as quite prominent in Indian education. It would be of convenience to your nomination if there could be much value in a visit to the Portage la Prairie boarding school. The Rev. Mr. Hendry is most successful and manages an institution which is quite similar in size and scope to the Chapleau School. The Superintendent of Indian Education will direct communications to the Rev. principal at Brandon and Portage la Prairie, asking them to welcome and assist the Rev. Mr. Magrath if he presents himself.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nRev. T. H. H. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary & Acting Gen. Secretary,\nMissionary Society, Church of England\nin Canada,\n41-45 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nI have also to call your attention to the shrinkage in the attendance due no doubt to various causes. One may be the fact that we had a very serious outbreak of sickness resulting in several deaths last spring; though this has never been alleged as an excuse.\n\nI believe the main cause is due to the fact that Mr. Chisholm who claims to be a Council for the Indians has advised these people that they are not compelled to send their children to a Boarding School when a Day School is at hand. We are well aware that the Indians very rarely send their children to the day schools, and this is only given as an excuse.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nThe Mission World\n\n41-43 The Bible House, Alexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man., November 27, 1922.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring my visit to the Chapleau School on the 22nd and 23rd instant I was informed by the Rev. G. Prever that he had been requested to withdraw his resignation of the Principalship of that Institution, and as he declined to make known the name or names of those who had presented him with this request I am writing to ascertain if it proceeded from your Department.\n\nBy concurrent post I am forwarding a letter to the Bishop of Moose Cree asking if the request in question proceeded from him, and further action in connexion with the assumption by our Society of responsibility for administering this School from the beginning of next year will depend on the replies which are forthcoming to these letters.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary & Acting General Secretary\nM.S.C.C.\n\nTRB/WIC.\nOttawa, Dec. 1, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 67th ultimo, relative to this Department's wishes with respect to the Chapleau Indian Boarding School. I have noted that during your recent visit to this institution the Rev. Principal intimated to you that he had been requested to reconsider his resignation.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that it is the wish of this Department that the Chapleau Indian Boarding School come under the administration of the M. S. O. C. This is in line with our policy of centralized control. Further, we have at no time requested that the services of Rev. Mr. Brewer principal be continued. In official communication of file number of the 50th ultimo, the temporary appointment of Rev. J. A. Maclean of Brandon, Man., was confirmed. May I assure you that you, as Acting General Secretary of the M. S. O. C., would be the first to be informed if the Department's wishes had undergone any change.\n\nI have to inform you that the Rev. Mr. Brewer visited the Department this week, and he is somewhat worried about the future of the splendid dairy herd at Chapleau. It is my opinion that the transfer of the institution from Lioness to M. S. O. C. control would be facilitated if you can assure His Lordship the Bishop of Moose Cree that a competent stockman will be on the staff.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Society, Ch. of England in Canada,\n41 - 43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nMinn., M.N.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter dated December 6th, I beg to inform you that owing to certain unforeseen difficulties which have arisen in connection with the transfer of the Indian School at Chapleau from Diocesan control to that of our Society, the Indian and Eskimo Commission of the M.S.O.C. were most reluctantly obliged at their last meeting, which was held in this city on the 20th inst., to recommend to the Executive Committee of our Society that they defer assumption of responsibility for the administration of this Institution until April 1st of next year.\n\nAs the next meeting of the Executive Committee will take place in Toronto somewhere, so far as I am aware at present, about the middle of January, you will receive another communication in connection with this matter at the earliest opportunity after that date.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary and Acting General Secretary M.S.O.C.\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, Dec. 28, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, informing the Department that the M. O. C. O. will not assume the responsibility for the administration of the Chapleau Indian Boarding School until April first, 1923.\n\nIn reply I beg to state it is regretted that difficulties have arisen in connection with the transfer of this institution from Diocesan control to that of your Society, and I trust that on the date above mentioned the negotiations will be complete.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. H. Postgate, D. D.,\nField Secretary & Acting Gen. Secretary,\nMiss. Society, Church of England in Canada,\n61 - 45 The Duke House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nMy dear Dr. Westgate,\n\nI have yours of the 25th inst., from Toronto.\n\nI thought I had already made my attitude clear regarding the future administration of the Chapleau School. In my letters to you and the Archbishop of Dec. 4th, and at other times, I stated that I was prepared to stand by my action in transferring the Chapleau School and at the same time expressed my strong desire that Mr. Prewer be continued as Principal in view of the fact that the present status of the School is almost, if not entirely due to his strenuous work and able management; as well I may add, as his knowledge of the Indian language. I have no reason to change my opinion and until further developments or necessity requires, I cannot approve of the appointment of the Rev. J. H. Gibson or anybody else. I cannot see why there should be such a hurry to appoint somebody else, utterly untried in Indian School work and affairs, when Mr. Prewer has made such an outstanding success and is willing to go on. I have no intimation from the Commission that they are going to make any effort to ascertain whether Mr. Prewer is willing or not to continue. From statements he has made to me recently, I understand that he is willing. That being the case, I consider that it would be simply an act of insensitiveness and injustice, if the Commission practically dismissed Mr. Prewer, after all he has done for the Church in connection with the school; and especially so in view of the fact that he withdrew his resignation at the urgent request of Mr. Nicholson that he should continue as Principal and help to carry out the wishes of the Church. Give Mr. Prewer a fair trial anyway, which will be only British fair play.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(signed) John G. Moosonee.\nThe Rt. Rev. Dr. Archbishop\n\nAs much, therefore, as far as I can see be prepared to retain that office on the first of April next or face the possible humiliation of being asked to do so by the Department of Indian Affairs as well as by our own Missionary Society. In postponing assumption for control of the school from January 1 to April 1 of this year I have endeavoured to protect Mr. Procter from action of this sort but a matter of no great importance at this juncture in question has not been brought forward in an indefinite period. Initially because of the nature of one man who apparently is unable to make up his own mind as to whether he wants to go or to stay and the Commission are looking to your Lordship to assist them in settling this question at the earliest date possible.\n\nWhile Mr. Procter's services may not be retained in the capacity of Principal I am prepared, as a partial solution to the difficulty, and as a result of writing him, to recommend that his services be retained for six months or one year either in the capacity of Manager or Vice Principal and if this arrangement is not agreeable to your Lordship and to Mr. Procter then I can see no other course to pursue but to insist on his vacating of the premises on the first of April next.\n\nAs the staff which had been engaged by the Commission to enter on their duties at this school on January 1, last, have been either assigned to other institutions or their contracts cancelled the Commission are now to face with the problem of securing workers to fill any vacancies which may be found when the school comes under their administration and as they desire to have at least one month of notice disposed for this purpose I shall be glad to have your Lordship's opinion at the earliest date possible as to whether you are prepared to agree to the retention of Mr. Procter's services for a period of six months or one year in the capacity mentioned and to the relinquishing of the Rev. Jollis' position as Principal of the school until 1 more.\n\nWith humble duty and sincere regards,\n\nI remain\n\nYour Lordship's obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary and Acting General Secretary\nCOPY\nFOR YOUR INFORMATION\n\nREMEMBER THIS\n\n48-49 The Duke House, Alexander Ave.,\nToronto, Ont., February 9th, 19--\n\nThe Rt. Hon. Mr. Anderson,\nLord Bishop of Quebec,\nMontreal,\nCanada, Ont.\n\nMy dear Lord Bishop,\n\nIn reply to your letter of January 30 and with reference to the Principalship of the Chaplain School, I beg to state that this is a question which must be definitely settled in one way or another during the next two or three weeks.\n\nYou state in your letter that it would only be \"Christian fair play\" to give Mr. Foster a chance to carry on as Principal after his denial came under our control. In this connection I beg to state that Mr. Foster would have been given this chance had he not sent in his resignation to you and to the Indian Department at the end of last September. It was not necessary that he should have sent a copy of his resignation to the Board of the C.A.C. as he was not responsible to them as their nominee but he did this and his action in doing so does not admit of any other interpretation than that he had fully made up his mind to remain at the school after it came under the Board's control. Since otherwise his resignation he did not inform the Board and communications which have been addressed to him by me and other members of the Commission he appears to have ignored as no reply, after some weeks have passed, has yet come to hand. As the retention of Mr. Foster's services in the capacity of Principal of the Chaplain School is not acceptable to His Excellency or the U.S. or the C.A.C., or the Department of Indian Affairs, the Commission find it quite impossible to recommend that he be given this appointment as they have not the slightest confidence that he would endeavour to carry out their instructions or even attempt to conform to their system of administration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nI would be pleased to have a communication from you, relative to the plans of the M. H. C. C. with respect to the Chapleau Boarding School.\n\nI am sorry that difficulties have arisen, for the time being, the transfer of this institution from diocesan control to that of your society, and I hope that by the first of April next, the negotiations will have been completed. I will be pleased to learn if definite arrangements have been made for your responsibility for Chapleau as from April 1, 1923, and I would also be glad to learn who is to be principal.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary & acting General Secretary, M.H.C.C.,\n41 - 45 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nI would appreciate it very much if you would kindly send me a frank statement as to whether or not the Department of Indian Affairs has approved the establishment of a new school in the Diocese of Monseigneur.\n\nI am writing this letter because I wish to convey my concern regarding the situation at the present time. The Department of Indian Affairs has been unable to provide any information regarding the status of the proposed school. It appears that the Department is not aware of the need for such a school and is unwilling to take any action to address this issue.\n\nI would be grateful if you could provide me with any additional information you may have regarding this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nDiocese of Monseigneur\nOttawa, Feb. 20, 1925.\n\nDear Bishop Anderson:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 18th instant, relative to Chief Lepage's wishes with respect to the future of the Chapleau Indian Boarding School. While this Department recognizes the ability of the Rev. Mr. Freer as a manager and financier, we have practically come to the conclusion that, if the school is to progress and to become a model for Western Ontario, his services would have to be dispensed with. I was greatly relieved when Mr. Freer offered his resignation.\n\nI am convinced that it is in the best interests of the work, generally, to have centralized control for the Indian residential schools under each church in Canada interested in the work. The Presbyterian and Methodist authorities have dealt with Indian educational work from general offices, for some years, and there is now a similar central committee which acts as a clearing-house for all Roman Catholic requests and other business. The advisability of having the Church of England Indian residential schools under the jurisdiction of the M. B. C. C. has caused me to lend my support to that Society's officers, and I am hopeful that the Chapleau Indian Boarding school will come under their auspices on April first next.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt.

Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nTHE CHAPLEAU SCHOOL\n\nDear Sir\u2014\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 12th instant (65-1-1) in which you request information as to the plans of our Society in connection with the Chapleau School, I beg to state that the responsibility for the maintenance and administration of this Institution cannot be assumed by our Society until a Principal has been found whose nomination will be agreeable to them as well as to his Lordship the Bishop of Moosejaw. Up to the present, agreement in this connection has not been reached.\n\nAs the retention of Mr. Prewer's services in the capacity of Principal would be unacceptable to our Society after the School has passed under their control, they are desirous that this position should be given to the Rev. J.H. Gibson, who is, in their opinion, amply qualified to fill the same. However, as the Bishop of Moosejaw has expressed himself as opposed to Mr. Gibson's appointment on the ground that Mr. Prewer's services should be retained, some further delay beyond April 1 may be occasioned before our Society can undertake any responsibility in connection with this Institution.\n\nI have the honour to be sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.R.W./Inc.\n\nField Secretary and Acting General Secretary\nM.R.C.C.\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, Feb. 21, 1925.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th, in which you inform me that definite arrangements have not been made for the transfer of the Chapleau Indian Boarding School from Diocesan to M. S. C. C. control. I note that the difficulty is in the retention of the Rev. Mr. Frewer's services as principal.\n\nI have been hopeful that, at an early date, the M. S. C. C. would take over the responsibility for the school at Chapleau; and my wishes were made known in a communication of yesterday's date, to His Lordship the Bishop of Moosonee, following his request for a frank statement from this Department. I also informed His Lordship that, while we recognized the ability of the Rev. Mr. Frewer as a manager and financier, he had practically come to the conclusion that, if the Chapleau Indian Boarding School is to progress and to become a menace to Southern Ontario, a new principal would have to be appointed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

C.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the Chapleau Boarding School, dated February 14th, 1927.\n\nI still object to senior pupils being taken out of school in order to attend various phases of work around the building. Six boys were engaged in hauling wood, etc., the day I was present. As these are large husky boys, and as one of them is the son of Mr. Blair, they are handicapped in their educational work by being put to manual work during regular school hours. As these hours are from 10 to 12 and from 2 to 4 any absence from class is decidedly noticeable. They should be at school every day without fail.\n\nUnder the efficient control of Mr. Prewer and the able assistance rendered by the matron, Mrs. Prewer, the general outlook of the school is splendid. The principal reports to me that with the outside help which he has it is not at all difficult to supervise the building and the grounds.\n\nThe only suggestion that I feel like making is that I regret qualified teachers who have had some experience in addition to their training are not available. Miss Thorpe and Mr. Acres are doing splendid work, with Miss Thorpe especially; the lack of someone is a serious drawback. But the enthusiastic interest combined with a genuine desire to assist these wards of the nation, will cause her to put forth every effort which she is doing most successfully. I am more than pleased at the efforts being put forth by the two teachers who are now employed at this work.\n\nW. J.

It is found that the register number given a pupil was frequently changed, and although this was at the time pointed out to the school authorities, the returns were incomplete as regards the keeping of the same number each quarter for the same pupil.\n\nI am enclosing several of the returns for the first few years but cannot find an occasion, and it may be that you can get the information you desire from these returns. When you are through with them, please return them to the Department as they are required for our records.\n\nRegarding pupil No. 043, we have carefully checked over the returns and cannot find that there was ever any pupil admitted under this number. This number appears to have been entirely omitted in giving a register number to the pupils entering the school.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAust. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. H. Gibson,\nPrincipal, Indian Residential School,\nChapleau, Ont.\nJune 11th, 1924,\n\nDear Canon Gould,\n\nReferring to our conversation this morning during the course of which you mentioned the creation of day schools by the Department in the Chapleau district, I said at the time that I had no recollection of authorising the establishment of any schools in that part of the province and find upon reference to the schools branch that we have not taken any action along this line and do not at present contemplate erecting any day schools in that district.\n\nI am sure you will be glad to know that the reports are without foundation. I wish you could give me some inkling as to the source from which you got the information.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPapacy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Canon B.

This correspondence is self-explanatory. I have, in addition, I feel certain, though I cannot lay my hands upon it at present, a copy of a further letter from Mr.Gibson to Dr.Westgate in which he states explicitly that permission has been given for the withdrawal of 16 (?) pupils from the Chapleau Residential School as a consequence of the opening of a new day school. You will doubtless secure further particulars from Mr.Gibson.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Secretary\nMay 23, 1924\n\nRev. Canon Gould,\n[Address]\nChurch House, 504 Jarvis Street,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nI enclose herewith a copy of a letter just received this morning from the Principal of the Chapleau School, and I am sending it on to you in order that you may see how the extension of the policy of establishing day schools is likely to affect the attendance at our Residential Schools.\n\nAt the moment I do not know that there is anything that can be done in the matter, but am of the opinion that it might be well to have a talk with Mr. Scott sometime on this subject. We are willing to having an understanding that the policy of the establishment of day schools may not be allowed to be carried out to such an extent as to render the maintenance of capacity attendances at the Residential Schools an impossibility.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nT.J. Huestigate,\nField Secretary L...\nAnllonan Indian Residential School,\nChapleau, Ont.,\nMay 20, 1924\n\nWINNIPEG, MAN.\n\nDear Dr.:\n\nReferring to the comunication from your office re getting more pupils for this school, I do not think the prospects for such are very good. Day Schools are being established in many of the centres from which our pupils come, and parents are petitioning the Indian Department to release some who are here at present.\n\nI have spoken to the Bishop, and written to Mr. Brewer, but there are no results so far. It may be that after the summer holidays we shall get a few more applications, but I do not look for enough to fill the school. I shall also write to the Indian Department. They may be able to send some like they did last year to the school in Barryville. If other nearer schools are full we may expect some from that source. Those sent are good children and we would be glad to have others like them.\n\nI shall do my best with the points near here, and hope to have some good results, but the outlook is none too good.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) Jno. H. Gibb.\n\nPrincipal.\nJune 19th, 1924.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been furnished with a copy of letter of the 20th May addressed to Dr. Westgate with reference to recruiting for the Chapleau school. I note your remarks with regard to the prospects which you state are not very good, owing to a large extent to the establishment of day schools in many of the centres from which your pupils come... Will you kindly advise me to what reserves you have reference.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nJohn H.

Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Sup't General\nDept' of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn recruiting for pupils for this school at several of the centres from which we have pupils, the day-school question was made the excuse for not sending to the Indian school.\n\nThe Bishop, Mr. Prewer, nor Mr. Godfrey gives much hope of increasing our attendance. We could do with about 20 new pupils.\n\nI can't give you the names of reserves in question, but the following centres have schools which no doubt affect our enrolment:\n\nFrans, Elams, Foloyet, Oma, and Gogama\n\nI was not registering an objection to these schools but only giving a reason why our enrolment was not up to the maximum.\n\nWe have a splendidly equipped school, with a staff capable of caring for the full 100 pupils. If your Department could help us again I should be very grateful.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, June 25th, 1924.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. MacKenzie,\n\nWe have no record of any Indian children attending schools at the points mentioned by the Principal of the Chapleau Residential School. There may be Indians living in the towns mentioned which are on the lines of railway in Northern Ontario, and their children may be attending white schools in those places. Between September 1st, 1916, and June 30th, 1918, we paid a tuition grant for 3 or 4 Indians' children who attended the French Catholic school. No reports have been received since that time and no grant has been paid. If there are Indian children at the points mentioned, and they are attending white schools, unless their parents are willing, we could not place them in the Chapleau Residential School without taking action under Section 10 of the Act. It seems to me there should be a sufficient number of Protestant Indian children on the reserves to fill the school if the Agents and Principal took active steps to recruit them.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. H. MacKenzie\nJune 30th, 1924.\n\nDear Canon Gould,\n\nReferring to our correspondence regarding recruiting for the Chapleau boarding school I am in receipt of a communication from Rev. Mr. Gibson in which he states that the day schools, the establishment of which he stated was interfering with recruiting, are located at Frans, Klans, Joliet, Oba, and Cogama. No schools have been established at these points, neither have we any record of Indian children being in attendance. In any event we are paying no grant for tuition. You will see, therefore, that Mr. Gibson was under a misapprehension.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. Canon B. Gould,\n604 Jarvis St.,\nToronto, Ont.\nthe time being the building of the implement shed and to use the money which had been set apart for this purpose in completing and furnishing the farmer's house. I very much hope that this arrangement may meet with your approval and that the new house may be ready for occupation in the immediate future.\n\nFor your information I should state that the Vice-Principal who is now at the School comes to this service with very good qualifications and equally good testimonials. He is a graduate in Arts of Manchester University, England, and has been teaching for some time in Ontario. He holds a lay reader's license from the Bishop of Moosejaw and has conducted services with much acceptance in different parishes in the absence of the resident Ministers, and I am very hopeful therefore that the assistance which he will be able to give to Mr. Gibson who still retains the title of Acting Principal, will be such as will enable this School to carry on all its activities at a very high state of efficiency.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.

In order that the School may be administered at a high state of efficiency our Society is finding it necessary to relieve Mr. Gibson for the time being of practical all responsibility and has appointed a Vice-Principal for this purpose. As the Vice-Principal who has been appointed to take the place of Mr. Crawley who is leaving us for a time on the expiration of his contract, is a married man, and can not very well be accommodated in the main school building, it has been found necessary to have the farmer's residence completed and furnished in order that this might be occupied, for the time being by Mr. Gibson. It was under these circumstances that I requested you in my night letter to defer for\nOttawa, July 7, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to conditions at the Chapleau Indian Residential School. Official letter of the 2nd instant informed you concerning our arrangements for the completion of the cottage. The Department regrets to learn of the illness of the Rev. Mr. Gibson, but I am grateful that you have made arrangements for the incumbency of a strong vice-principal for the time being.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. O.,\n61-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir:\n\nI beg to report the children from Gibson, Parry Island and Shawanacee visited the Chippewa Industrial school on the 10th inst.\n\nI wish to state that I made a thorough inspection of the school and I am satisfied that the children are being well looked after. The whole of the staff is excellent and from my observation I would compare the management of the school as something near what is done in England and in Scotland in the boarding schools, by this I mean Private boarding schools such as Preparatory schools. The children appear happy and as I walked about the grounds I spoke to quite a number and it was a pleasure to me to notice how frank the children were in answering my questions.\n\nI am convinced that it is not a matter of dollars and cents that keeps the Chippewa Industrial School in operation and I know by little actions which I see while I was there, that the love of God is in the hearts of the staff and by the kindness and actions of the children, it would appear to me that the staff is gradually imparting that same feeling into the children.\n\n(Sgd.) John M. Daly,\nAgent.\nSeptember 1st, 1975.\n\nDear Mr. Godfrey:\n\nMr. P. Phelan, of the Schools' Branch of this Department, will arrive in Chapleau at 12:30 noon Thursday, the 3rd, for the purpose of a general inspection of the Chapleau Indian Residential School. Please give him every assistance in this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. Molson,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nT. J. Godfrey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\nI found 55 boys and 36 girls\u2014a total of 91 pupils in the school. 42 of these are in the senior room and the balance in the junior room. With the exception of Louise, who has been sick for some time but is kept isolated from the other pupils\u2014although the medical officer states she is not a menace to the health of the other children\u2014all the pupils appeared to be in excellent health and appeared well satisfied at the school. I visited the dining room at the time of one of the meals and found the pupils were obtaining sufficient wholesome food. It might be mentioned that whole milk is given to the pupils in generous quantities. During the month of August, the cow at the school gave 2784 quarts of milk, all of which was used for the pupils and staff.\n\nSIX NATION PUPILS:\n\nParticular attention was given to the 13 children recently sent to the school from the Six Nation agency. I had a private talk with each of them and not one made any complaints regarding the school or the treatment they were receiving from the staff. All of them were in good health. The vice principal stated that shortly after they came to the school he had some difficulty with two or three of the boys running away; but he located them quickly and has had no further trouble in that regard.\n\nBUILDINGS:\n\nA special report regarding the cottage for the vice principal\u2014minor repairs to building\u2014and complaints of the management regarding the heating system will be found on File 65-1-5.\n\nGENERAL:\n\nI found that the classroom registers are properly kept. Upon enquiry, I ascertained that the pupils have not practised fire drill. The vice principal, however, stated that he would make immediate arrangements to have this done regularly in future and Mr. Agent Godfrey promised to see that this was carried out.\n\nTwo of the pupils, Emily Donald and Harvey Black, are attending the high school in Chapleau. The school management arranges to have these children taken to the school and brought home each day. There are 9 pupils in the senior classroom who, it is expected, will try the Entrance Examination in June, 1926.\n\nOn the whole, I feel that this school should show further progress in the future. As noted above, there are now 91 children in the school. Mr. Agent Godfrey has some more in view in order to bring the number up to that for which grant is allowed. Mr. Godfrey gives the management every possible assistance and visits the school at least two or three times each week.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPhilip Kelan\nSept. 10, 1925.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. [signature]\n\nAs instructed, I visited the Chapleau Residential School on the 3rd and 4th instant.\n\nThe Staff:\n\nMr. G. Snowden, Vice Principal and teacher of the Senior Classroom.\n\nMrs. J. H. Gibson, Teacher of the Junior Classroom.\n\nMrs. Snowden, Girls' Supervisor.\n\nMiss Treadaway, Boys' Supervisor.\n\nMiss Rilly, and Miss McMullen, In charge of the kitchen.\n\nMr. Burridge, Farmer and Furnace man.\n\nMiss Bowlby, the Matron, was absent on leave.\n\nAs the Department is aware, Rev. J. H. Gibson has been seriously ill for some time and is totally unable to do any work. He and his family are still residing at the school and it will be noted that Mrs. Gibson is teaching the junior classroom.\n\nIt is intended for the Vice Principal and his wife to live in the cottage, which will soon be completed. The M. S. C. O. has placed Mr. Snowden in full charge and has also approved of Mr. Gibson remaining in his present principal's rooms in the main building. While this is not an ideal arrangement, as it would appear that the man actively in charge should be in the main building; but, to avoid undue friction, the present arrangement has been decided upon by the M. S. C. O. as a temporary expedient and is apparently satisfactory to all parties concerned. Mr. Snowden, the vice principal, has been in Canada for about three years. During the past winter, he taught at a white school not far from Chapleau. He is a graduate in arts of Manchester University, England, and appears to be much interested in the work and the school should prosper under his management. All the other members of the staff appear to be capable and taking an active interest.\nOttawa, Sept. 12, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that an officer of the Schools Branch has recently inspected the Chapleau Indian Residential School. Particular attention was given to the 12 children from the Six Nation Reserve. All were in good health, and, after a private talk with each, the officer was satisfied that they were quite happy and receiving proper care and training. You may inform any that are interested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nLt. Col. G. E.

Unless the Church authorities are prepared to put proper qualified men in charge of this portion of the school work, the Department will be called upon to pay, from time to time, unnecessary accounts for repairs.\n\n[Signature]\n\nARCHITECT.\nOttawa, February 17, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI regret to draw to your attention a report which has reached the Department concerning Mr. Harbridge, who is in charge of the heating plant and mechanical equipment at the Chapleau Indian Residential School. It is stated that this officer is not competent and that the mechanical plant is being improperly operated. I must request you to arrange for a suitable incumbent at the earliest opportunity, as the Department cannot be responsible for repairs which are found necessary because of unsatisfactory supervision.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

To illustrate what I mean in this connection, I enclose herewith copies of letters dated February 4th and February 17th addressed by the Principal of the Onion Lake School to Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham in connection with the difficulty he was experiencing with the heating plant and mechanical equipment at the school.\nOttawa, March 10, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, concerning the qualifications of the engineer at the Chapleau Indian Residential School.

Two of these are Maggie Sutherland and Louise Edglin which the Department have authorized sending to Sanatorium as soon as vacancies occur, and the boy George Hokey, should be removed to his home as soon as possible and I am awaiting instructions from the Department regarding this boy his discharge from the school should be granted owing to his condition being very serious of health, and Dr. Sheahan does not recommend his being sent to the sanatorium but that he be sent home to his mother as she wishes this and he is 17 yrs. old.\n\nThere are many things at the school that require attention in the way of repairs, new equipment for the school as well as the whole school needs renovating.\n\nThere is also the matter of the farm work which has been badly neglected and every thing has gone into absolute chaos but the C.C.M. have at last seen fit to send a man to take charge of this important work and he seems from my observation to be a very capable man but he has nothing to work with in the way of facilities and has asked that he be given tools etc. to work with and he feels confident that he can build up the outside work to the extent that it deserves.\n\nThis new man Mr. Jones, states that if the Department will supply him with implements, tools and blacksmith tools that he can do all the work necessary in minor repairs as well as teach the boys this work and asks if the Department will supply this school with the same outfit as supplied other schools as he comes from one of the schools in the West and very highly recommended.\n\nThere are so many things that should be gone into thoroughly that I thought better to ask that the Department send up Mr. Phalen or some other man from the Department to go over this situation with me.\n\nWaiting your instructions I am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 4, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, with reference to your general inspection of the Chapleau Indian Residential School.

Snowden, M.A., as \"Principal of our Society's school at Chapleau, Ontario\". I would point out that the Department has not received any intimation from you of his appointment.\n\nYour letter of July 23rd, 1926, is the last communication the Department has received with reference to the principalship of the Chapleau School. It will therefore be necessary for me to hear from you regarding this matter and at the same time advise what arrangements have been made with regard to Mr. Gibson. Will he continue to occupy the Principal's rooms in the main building, or has it been arranged for him to use the cottage which, as far as the Department is aware, has been occupied by Mr. Snowden since the fall of 1925?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.D.

He has, however, retained the title of Principal right up to the present time and has been a salary allowance from our Society up to the 1st of February when arrangements were made for his to be used in receipt of certain private funds to augment the funds in order that the allowance which he was receiving from our Society might be available, (1) to augment the salary of the Acting Principal, and (2) to add another man as assistant to the staff. Action has already been taken by our Commission in the two ways mentioned, but Mr. Gibson still retains the title of Principal and continues in an honorary capacity. He still occupies that part of the main building which he has occupied since his appointment to this School, and as Mrs. Gibson is teaching on the staff, our Commission have never entertained any thought of having him removed. Mrs. Snowden prefers to live in the cottage, and as the existing arrangement is fully satisfactory to all the staff agents as well as to our Commission, and in no way, so far as we know, affects adversely the management of the school, we should strongly advise that it be allowed to continue. Should our Society decide to recommend Mr. Snowden for the Principalship of this School, you will in due course receive a recommendation to that effect from our Executive Committee in Toronto.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nTORONTO, ONT., 18th October, 1927\n\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to inform you that our Commission are nominating the Rev.

The present building stands on the bank of Kapesequahesing River, which separates the School grounds from the Town of Chapleau, a most desirable & important consideration for the sake of the preservation of privacy & protection of the Indian children. The site is at an elevation of about twenty feet above the River.\n\nDrainage:\nThe drainage is excellent.\n\nWater:\nGood water has been found about 200 yards from the School.\n\nWood:\nThere is abundance of wood in the vicinity.\n\nHeating:\nThe present heating system is by stoves, which I consider unsafe.

I also send statement of accounts showing what has already been paid out from Diocesan Funds. And I may here say that beyond anything the \"Women's Auxiliary\" may be able to do by way of assistance, we shall be entirely dependent upon the Grant made by the Indian Department.\n\nThe diminishing Diocesan Funds will not permit of any allowance another dollar for Indian Schools.\n\nI am leaving for James Bay in a few days, but am leaving instructions for the completion of the present building & the erection of the kitchen. I hope to return about August 15th., & may be able to let the contract for the addition. But with the present building finished, & the kitchen completed, we may be able to accommodate twenty-five (25) scholars next Winter. But unless we have a Trust for a Teacher, I don't at present see how two Matrons, alone, can manage that number, & the teaching as well.\n\nI understand from Mr. Scott, when I saw him in Ottawa, that the report \"rant began on April 1st 1907; and we have no printed Return forms of your Dept..

Yours truly\n\nGeorge H. Pope\nBishop of Moosonee\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa, June 4, 1907.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nThe Bishop of Moosonee, who was asked to furnish plans and specifications showing the style of building to be erected for the Chapleau Boarding School, has written giving particulars as to the cost and forwarded a photograph showing the building under construction, together with a sketch plan of the proposed additions, which will cost when completed about $7,000.\n\nThis year's supplementary estimates contain an item of $5,000 to assist in the completion of this building, as well as a per capita grant of $60 for each of 40 pupils.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the Bishop should have undertaken the construction of a building before submitting plans and specifications to the Department, as I fear the structure, if finished in accordance with the sketch plan, will be very unsuitable for a school, owing to the way it is laid out, and I would suggest that Mr. Ogilvie be asked to try to remedy some of the defects noticed in the plan.\n\nThe Bishop is going North and will not return till about August 15, and if proper plans could be prepared by that date, he would be in a position to call for tenders for the additions. Of course, no money can be paid at present, as there are no accounts before the Department, and as it will take nearly all the grant to pay for the additions, I think it would be well to hold onto the funds until the contract is under way and that he should be advised to the above effect.\nOttawa, June 6, 1907.\n\nRight Reverend Sirs\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 28th inst., forwarding plans, specifications and estimates for the additions to the boarding school building now under construction at Chapleau, and in reply I beg to say that it is unfortunate that building operations were undertaken before consulting the Department, as it will be a difficult matter now to make additions to the present structure which will be suitable for a boarding school.\n\nHowever, the Department will see what can be done, and its Architect will prepare plans and specifications for additional accommodation, which will be sent you by August 15, next.\n\nThe estimates contain an item for the payment of a per capita grant of $50 for each of 40 pupils from April 1, last, and upon receipt of returns showing the actual number in attendance payment will be made. Blank forms for this purpose have been sent you.\n\nThe amount voted for the completion of the present building will be paid as the work progresses upon receipt of vouchers showing the expenditure for labour and material, which should be sent through the local agent at Chapleau, Mr. H. A. West.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nRight Rev. Sirs,\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Right Rev.

The matter will be laid before the Bishop on his return from James Bay, which will be about the 10th of August next.\n\nI am, Dear Sir\n\nYours respectfully\n\nA. M. Blair Banting\nDiocesan Secretary\nOttawa, June 28, 1907.\n\nMr. Awoye:\n\nI would like you when at Chapleau to visit the new boarding school building and see what work has been done and what accommodation the present structure provides.\n\nThe Church authorities have submitted a sketch showing the proposed additions, a blue print of which is attached hereto. You will notice that the wing on the right will cut off all light from the main building on that side, while the addition in the rear will be most inconvenient, as the only entrance to the main building will be through the kitchen or the boys' and girls' lavatories or else they will have to go all round the building to the front door, which would cause great dirt and discomfort in the winter and wet season. It is, therefore, a question, whether it might be better to put up an entirely new building to meet the extra requirements instead of making a batch job of the present one.\n\nYou will ascertain whether a convenient site is available adjacent to the present building. I should also like you to ascertain what facilities there are for a reliable supply of water and drainage and how they propose to heat the building.\n\nMr. H. McClain Banting is the diocesan secretary at Chapleau and you might ask him to accompany you, and I would like you to make your report before going north.\n\nThank you.\nAug 26\n\nFor Mr.\n\nEnclosed herewith plans for\nChaplain Building etc.\n\n- [Signature]\n\nTo Mr.\n\n[Signature]\n[Stamp]\nChapleau Ont.\nAug 10th 1927\n\nHon.

These details can be added to the plan later, as I will be at headquarters before they will require attention.\n\nIt is understood, that, the Bishop will have the personal oversight of the building while under erection, and as the construction will be similar to the other portion of the building, and as my time is very limited, I have not prepared specifications.\n\nShould they, however, be required if you will send me a blueprint of the plan in the care of the Commissioner at Victoria, or to Winnipeg I will prepare them before returning to headquarters.\n\nI will stop over at Chapleau on my return past and see the progress.\nOttawa, August 30, 1907.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nRe Charlevoix Boarding School.\n\nAn addition is required to the building which has just been erected and Mr. Ogilvie has just sent in plans providing for such addition. It is almost too late in the season to carry out the work, even if approved of, but a kitchen is provided for at the rear of the main building in Mr. Ogilvie's plans, and in a letter received from Bishop Holmes, he says that the kitchen is needed at once.\n\nI would, therefore, suggest that the Bishop be authorized to go on with the kitchen extension and in the meantime that Mr. Ogilvie should prepare specifications for the other additions, so that tenders could be called for or an estimate of the probable cost obtained.\n\nThe current year's estimates contain an item of $5,000 to assist in the completion of the building, and it is doubtful whether this amount will be sufficient to carry out Mr. Ogilvie's plans. However, there will be plenty of money for the kitchen extension.\nOttawa, September 4, 1907.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 27th ult. In further reference to the new boarding school building at Chapleau, and in reply I beg to say that a blueprint of Mr. Ogilvie's plan, showing the proposed enlargement of this building is being sent you under separate cover; but before you are authorized to proceed with the erection of the kitchen wing, which you wish to have built before the winter sets in, the Department will require an assurance from the Ontario Government that the school site will be granted your Diocese, as it is not disposed to go to any expenditure on buildings on land to which you have no valid title.\n\nI would, therefore, suggest that you communicate with the Commissioner of Crown Lands for Ontario and find out upon what terms a title to the land in question will be given. In the meantime you should obtain an estimate of the cost of material and labour for the kitchen wing and forward the same to the Department, and as soon as the question of title is settled, you will be further advised.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nRight Reverend Sir,\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.

B. Michelson. This indicates that the charges therein are not satisfactory without receipted sub-personally vouchers, unless Mr. Michelson supplied the lumber, brick and other articles charged for.\n\nThe charges for wages of men should be supported by receipted pay-lists.\n\nIt is observed that $75.00 was charged for a snow purchased from Magean Lumber Co., the receipt in connection therewith is only for $35.00, and therefore refund of $40.00 should be made without delay.\n\nThe certified voucher should be in duplicate. Kindly return the accounts (now enclosed) with as little delay as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.A.

I have to request that you will kindly have the necessary work done, at as reasonable rates as possible. You should give the matter early attention.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.A.

D. Molen\n\nAssistant\n\nH. A. West, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\nChapleau July 13th, 19--\n\nMr. Mo. Lean Esq.\nSec. Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing you bill handed me by the contractor who is finishing the school.\n\nThis work is progressing as fast as possible, but is not near completed yet. The school was in very bad condition and needed much more done than we anticipated at the start.\n\nThis man needs money, and is bothering me all the time. I wish you could arrange to give him some before I go away on my trip.\n\nI saw Mr. Miller from Kostogama the other day and told him I did not expect to be in there before the latter part of the month.\n\nThe flies are fierce now, but I am ready to go anytime.\n\nYou will give me a few days notice so as I can get my things together and ship the canoe to Bisco.\n\nI have given the Doctor all the information I could as requested by the department.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nH.A. Wesh Agent\nOttawa, 15th July, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has received the account which you forwarded recently in favor of Mr. G. Grilling for work done in connection with the Charlevoix Indian Boarding School, and in reply I beg to say that this account is unsatisfactory. If, as stated in the account, the work was performed under contract a copy of the contract should be forwarded to the Department. If the agreement was a verbal one then full details of all expenditure incurred must be furnished. You should, it is thought, be thoroughly aware of the requirements of the Department in respect to the manner of rendering accounts. I may say that the last accounts received for expenditure in connection with the Charlevoix School were unsatisfactorily rendered, and as a result a great deal of correspondence has taken place between this Department and the Auditor General in the matter. Further payments will not be made unless accounts are rendered properly and attached to the regular voucher forms, the printed certificate on which should be signed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. A. [signature]\nIndian Agent,\nCharlevoix, Ont.\nChapleau July 2nd 1865\n\nJ. D. Maclean Esq.,\nSec.-Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter dated July 13th No. 306200-5 in reference to Mr. Gralliers account re-Indian school. I beg to state it was not expected you would accept this account as final in this form. I sent it to show you something of the amount of work completed, as this man was bothering me for some money, and I thought the Department might give him some on the account. This man is not very well fixed financially, but a very honest man. Bishop Holmes made the agreement with him to do the work before leaving for the old country. I understand it was to be so much a yard for plastering.\n\nI promised Mr. Scott I would look after the work and see it was done right, and this am doing. The painting outside will be finished today, but there will be a lot to do inside and when finished is going to look fine.\n\nI will go over this afternoon and measure the plastering and try and get it in better shape so as you can advance him something on the work, and when the Bishop returns we will have no difficulty in fixing the whole thing satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\nINFORMATION\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nTo: T.B.

It is a good job, and the building is in first class\ncondition, well ventilated walls, floors and beds clean and in\ngood order.\n\nRegarding the new contract, I am enclosing you letters from Mr.\nJones.

In fact I don't know what to do.\n\nAs I explained previously, this man is a poor fellow who cannot afford to take large contracts and wait so long for his money. And the men who supplied him the material are dogging him all the time, and the consequence is, I am the one who gets the blame. I cannot see where I am to blame; I promised Mr. Scott I would look after the work, and see it was done right, this I did, and the work has been done, and done well, and something must be done or a lien will be put on the building.\n\nThis I should be very sorry to see, especially just at the present time.\n\nPerhaps if the Bishop was here, he might enlighten us somewhat, but he will not be back before spring.\n\nI am enclosing you a form of contract Mr. Sonne has given me and says this is all he is to give, and cannot do any more.\n\nPlease have the Department look into the matter, and see if the matter cannot be settled in some way.\n\nI shall be very careful in future how I get mixed up in a contract of this kind, for I have had my troubles over this one.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nDec 27th 1909\n\nReceived from Bishop Holman the sum of forty-eight dollars and fifteen cents, on account of labor and material on Kitchen & Indian School at Chapleau.\n\n$48.15\n\nDec 27th 1909\n\nReceived from Bishop Holman the sum of forty-eight dollars and fifteen cents, on account of labor and material on Kitchen & Indian School at Chapleau.\n\n$48.15\nChapleau Boarding School,\nWork on old building.\n\n| Item Description                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Plastering building 1 coat                            | $203.75|\n| Laths, four bundles                                   | $35.60 |\n| 600 feet shelving at $40 per thousand                | $24.00 |\n| 37 pine and birch balusters                           | $5.56  |\n| 1 plank 5/8\" x 10\" x 16\"                              | $0.75  |\n| 34 feet moulding                                      | $0.72  |\n| 1015 feet T. & G. flooring at $30 per ft.             | $30.42 |\n| 1500 V. joint sheathing at $30 per ft.                | $39.00 |\n| 492 feet 1/2 round at 1 ct per foot                   | $4.92  |\n| Hardware                                              | $5.70  |\n| Labour carpentering 210 hrs at 50 cts                 | $63.00 |\n|                                                        | $75    | $40   | $30.00 |\n|                                                        | $110   | $56   | $58.50 |\n|                                                        | $65    | $25   | $16.25 |\n\nThis labour is on both house and stable & outhouse.\n\n| Item Description                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 500 feet rough lumber at $20 per ft.                  | $10.00 |\n| 3 pieces 1 x 9 x 18                                    | $1.35  |\n| Hardware                                               | $2.10  |\n| Tar paper 1 roll 90 cts, 21 hrs labour $1.             | $1.90  |\n| 10 lbs lath nails                                      | $0.45  |\n| Storm porch material                                  | $8.40  |\n\nTotal: $581.76\nChapleau Boarding School\n\nAddition to School,\n\nStone - $30.00\nCarpentering work - $285.00\nPlastering and lathing - $169.00\n38 hours removing windows and doors etc., between buildings - $12.80\n250 feet base - $18.75\nMaterial for stairs 2\" x 10\" 16' - $5.20\n2\" x 6\" - $.78\nMouldings 70 feet at .03 - $9.10\nHardware - $3.50\nPressed lumber, new building - $5.00\n\nTotal - $468.67\nWork on stable etc.\n\n250 feet clapboard at $30.  $68.00\nMetal shingles, stable and wood-shed,\n15 square at 45\u00a2 per square  $75.00\n\n$141.00\nStatement of account due.\n\n$453.67 addition to school.\n141.00 materials in stable.\n$81.76 improvements to old building.\n$1185.43 advance paid temporarily by Bishop.\n$1221.43\nCertificate\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nChapleau Oct 27 1905\n\nCertificate\n#1125-72\n\nShewly certify that C.

This however is not fit for use in the school owing to sewage being emptied into the river a short distance above from Chapleau.\n\nI have instructed the Rev. Mr. Sowens to drive a well near the river in the hope of procuring a plentiful supply there which will be available at all times.\n\nIt will also be necessary to provide drainage from the kitchen sink to the rear of building.\n\nStorm sash should also be provided for windows not now fitted with them, and also a porch to protect the rear door.\n\nThe exterior of stable should also be painted to prevent rapid deterioration of the building by the weather.\n\nWith respect to the accounts of the contractor I may say that I have gone into them very carefully and have issued a certificate for one thousand, one hundred and twenty-five dollars and forty-three cents ($1125.43) the amount due him.\n\nIt will be noted that Bishop Holmes has advanced two hundred and three dollars and fifty cents ($203.50) which amount it will be necessary to deduct from the contractor's cheque, and send cheque for this amount to the Rev. Mr. Sowens at Chapleau to replace the amount temporarily paid.\nOttawa, October 27, 1908.\n\nFor the Deputy Inspector,\n\nI beg to report that as instructed I proceeded to Chapleau and on Tuesday October 20th, made an inspection of the Indian Boarding-school there in company with the Indian Agent.\n\nThere has been erected in the rear of main building a substantial kitchen wing on stone foundation, which provides ample accommodation for the intended use on the ground floor, and a convenient school-room on the floor above.\n\nIn addition to the new wing very considerable necessary improvements have been made to the main building, such as alterations to stair-way, putting on a finishing coat of plaster over the entire main building (which had been previously been left in the rough coat), painting this building outside and inside, flooring and ceiling the attic and fitting up as a store-room.\n\nA substantial stable has also been erected in connection with the school, also other outhouses and closets which were necessary for their health and convenience.\n\nThe work has been fairly well done, and the materials generally of fair quality, with the exception of a portion of the siding which is inferior and had not been properly seasoned before using.\nIndian Affairs School Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6191)\n\nFile 461-14, part 1\nKenora Agency - Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School - Livestock. 1928-1938\n\nFile 461-14, part 2\nKenora Agency - Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School - Livestock. 1938-1948\n\nFile 461-23, part 1\nKenora Agency - Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School - Deaths. 1938\n\nFile 462-1, part 1\nChapleau Residential School - General Administration. 1907-1927\n\nFile 462-5, part 1\nChapleau Agency - Chapleau Residential School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts - General Administration. 1907-1908\n\nFile 462-5, part 2\nChapleau Agency - Chapleau Residential School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts - General Administration. 1926-1929\n\nFile 462-5, part 3\nChapleau Agency - Chapleau Residential School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts - General Administration. 1929-1935\nIndian and Eskimo Commission of the Missionary Society\nOF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND IN CANADA\n\nHEADQUARTERS: 41-45 The Bible House\n136 Alexander Avenue\nWinnipeg Man.\n\nANGLOCANADIAN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nChapleau, Ont.\n\nApril 26, 1926\n\nT.J.

The windows as they stand at present may present some difficulty, but this could be overcome, and the whole alteration required effected without any very heavy expenditure to your Department. The adoption of this room for class-room purposes will leave the institution without a chapel, although the school management have been endeavoring to secure sufficient funds to build a chapel, apart from the main school building, they have not yet succeeded in securing the full amount required. If the present room which is made to serve as a chapel is transformed into a class-room I should be glad to know if your Department would make a grant towards the erection of the chapel in question. The old laundry room which is now used as a chapel cannot also well be made to serve the dual purpose of a class-room and a chapel.

As the roof of this building is in very bad condition as set forth in my letter to you on August 9th, I trust that steps may be taken at the earliest date possible to have a new roof supplied. The cost, according to a local contractor's estimate would be $260.\n\nWith regard to (b) viz., the installation of the pump supplied last March, the action suggested by my letter of August 9th does not yet appear to have been taken. As the cost of installation could not be very high, although I have received no estimate from the Principal, I trust that you may authorize the local Indian Agent to have this undertaken in the immediate future.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.O.\n\nTHS/JF\nOttawa, October 6, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to the reroofing of the barn at the Chapleau Indian Residential School.

I note that the only contractor in Chapleau has offered to do the work for $260.40. It has been decided to proceed with this improvement without delay. You should have Mr. J. A. Bernie place 41 squares of 2 ply Barret's roofing on the barn and 50 squares of the same material on the dormer. When the work has been satisfactorily completed, you may submit a certified account in duplicate in his favour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

T. Snowden, the Acting Principal of our Society's School at Chapleau, relative to repairs to the brick arch support of the furnace, I beg to state that Mr. Snowden's telegram was dispatched to you at my request shortly before I left the School on my way to visit the Shingwauk Home. I would have sent the telegram myself only I was doubtful about receiving a reply before I was due to leave.\n\nI may state for your information that before this wire was dispatched I endeavored to establish contact with Mr. Indian Agent Godfrey but failed to do so. Moreover, I was informed by the Principal that fully six weeks before the time of my visit, which extended from noon on January 2nd until noon of January 4th, Mr. Godfrey promised him personally to undertake these repairs but had failed to do so. The situation was so critical at the time that I instructed the Acting Principal to have some boiler iron and asbestos cement secured and utilized in effecting a temporary repair. The sum requested in the telegram was to cover this expenditure. It is very much to be regretted that the Indian Agent does not manifest a greater interest in and sympathy with the present school management.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nField Secretary, M. S. O.

In letter above referred to, you were requested to make immediate arrangements to have this furnace repaired.\n\nIn a communication received from Rev. Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary, Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, dated the 16th instant, he states as follows:\n\n\"I may say for your information that before this wire was dispatched I endeavored to establish contact with Mr. Indian Agent Godfrey but failed to do so. Moreover, I was informed by the Principal that fully six weeks were the time of my visit, which extended from noon on January 2nd until noon of January 4th.

Godfrey, M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\n\nJ. H. Molan,\nAsst. Deputy A Secretary.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring my recent visit to the Chapleau School which lasted from January 2nd to 4th, I went carefully into the requirements for this school for the current year. You will have before you the list of requirements presented to your Department through our General Secretary for all of our body's Indian Residential Schools, the Chapleau School included. In addition to those mentioned for the Chapleau School, my attention was directed during my visit to the following requirements:\n\n1. The kiln-drying of the walls and furnishing of the woodwork of the interior and the renewal of the rough cast to the exterior of the main school building.\n2. The provision of new tables and benches for the children's dining room.\n3. The renewal of the fire brick in the base of the heating system.\n4. A new gasoline engine for cutting wood.\n\nThe most urgent requirements of this school are, of course, (a) the extension of class-room space, (b) the building of a chapel, and (c) an implement shed. I was pleased to note that a new felt roof had been placed on the barn but regret the walls were not raised at the same time. It is, however, that provision has been made in your estimates for the current year to meet the requirements enumerated above and will be obliged if you will inform me at your earliest convenience if such is the case.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, January 24, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letters of the 18th instant, enumerating further repairs and replacements that are necessary at the Shaples and Shingwauk Indian Residential Schools. Notes in this connection have been taken for the estimates for the coming fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. K. Leggate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.O.C.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nChapleau January 17th, 1927.\n\nIn reply to your letter of January 19th, No. 65-1-5 relative to the repairs to the Boiler at the School this work was ordered done by Dr. Wesgate, and is not done to our satisfaction so the account I can not send in until such time as the Mechanic completes it.\n\nDr. Wesgate's statement saying that the Principal had informed me of the condition of the Boiler six weeks before his visit, this is a gross misstatement as I have a record of my visit called at the school over this winter, on the 2nd day of December and at that time the Vice Principal advised me that the boiler had been in this condition for some months but he had neglected to inform me and I criticized his action at the time in not advising me but he claimed he had overlooked it.\n\nDr. Wesgate did not try very hard to locate me as I was at my office every day that he was in Chapleau and he never came near my office but he did try to make me come out to the school immediately and which I had not the time to go even had I the inclination to Dr. Wesgate imagining that I must jump every time he says it and because things are not going just as smoothly at the school as they should I am not going out there to listen to his ravings against the staff and everybody in general as well as myself who am not responsible for the way things are going at the school.\n\nI show Dr. Wesgate every courtesy but I have no intention of listening to his uncalled for remarks against myself and others because I can not recommend everything he suggests or because he resents my connection with the school.\n\nI had already ordered the repairs for the boiler which had to be sent out for and which only arrived couple of days before I received your letter. Dr. Wesgate takes the excuse that the situation was critical to cover up if it was critical which it was not why did not the Principal advise before the expiration of months and it is becoming quite an ordinary thing for work to be ordered done at the school without my knowledge & which possibly I would not recommend.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 5, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the repairs to the boiler at the Chapleau Indian Residential School.

You should consult Mr. Jones, who has recently been placed in charge of the farm work at this school, regarding the various tools which you would recommend be supplied.\n\nWhen we have full information as to the cost involved, consideration will then be given to authorising the purchase.

Fallow, Chapleau. His quotations lowest and his material best of any we have tried.\nSir,\n\nRelative to your letter No. 86-1-1 of March 4th, I beg leave to report that I have gone into the matter of tools etc., required at the school and enclosed please find a list of tools and equipment required for use at the school.\n\nThere is one item on the list namely the Lathe. I do not recommend this equipment but in its place I would recommend Two sets of Stocks and Dies One for use in connection with threading bolts and the other for farm machinery and the other for threading pipes in connection with the house and plumbing system as well as a cutter for cutting pipes; this would be far more useful equipment and should cost in the neighbourhood of $50. I cannot see the use of a lathe unless they intend to keep a mechanic on hand to teach the boys this work.\n\nThere is also a set of second hand farm implements which I would strongly recommend buying as they can be bought for $50, having only been used one year and are as good as new and are badly needed for the farm work and the cost of which is very little above half their cost value.\n\nThey also wish for a gen-purpose plow which is badly needed, and One Whitewashing hand spray pump hose, lime etc., for disinfecting the barn and stables.\n\nRegarding equipment for the school I would strongly recommend that new tables be supplied for the dining room of the enamel top type as the old wooden tables are almost beyond repair and owing to their old and battered condition are not sanitary.\n\nThe whole building needs renovating and the following material would be required.\n\n250 Pkgs. Calomine\n1 gal. Varnish\n1 gal. Tar\n3 gal. Inside white paint\n3 gal. Outside white paint\n2 gal. Grey Paint\n2 gal. Magnesium\n2 gal. Brown Paint\n2 gal. White metal paint\n2 gal. Black lead paint for iron work in barn & stables etc.\n2 gal. Paint Oil.\n\nThere is considerable work required on the plastered walls and stucco outside, also the whole heating system needs a thorough going over and should be inspected especially the heating boilers require inspection by a thoroughly qualified Inspector and I would again recommend that the Department send a man up from there to look over the whole proposition just as soon as convenient.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOttawa, March 26, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, recapitulating the repairs, replacements and improvements required at the Chapleau Indian Residential School. I note your recommendations as follows:\n\n| Item                          | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|\n| Maintenance tools             | $100.00|\n| Blacksmith and carpenter tools| $200.00|\n| Farm implements               | $450.00|\n| Plough and sprayer pump       | $50.00 |\n| Gasoline for getting wood     | $300.00|\n| New dining room tables        | $100.00|\n| Interior decorating           | $100.00|\n| Plastering and outside stucco | $100.00|\n| Inspection of the heating plant| $100.00|\n\nI may inform you that certain funds will be available for this school this year. You might let me have an estimate of the cost of the paint, calcimine and varnish listed in your letter and also of the plastering and stuccoing that is desired. Please comment also on the relative importance of these different items, and, as you list them in order, place therein two other items mentioned by the church authorities, viz.: an implement shed and new flooring for the barn.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

We have taken the matter up and we can quote you same Table and Benches as used in the newer Western Schools as follows:\nTable 12' long, 3' wide and 2'6\" high, made in B.C. fir, top covered with linoleum. Also two Benches 12' long, 12\" wide, and 17\u00bd\" high. Six Benches and table make a unit for the price of $90.00 f.o.b. Chapleau.\n\nWe understand that you require 6 units for the School, which will mean a total cost of $540.00.\n\nFrom information supplied us, these are very durable, sanitary and give every satisfaction.\n\nWe would be very pleased to have your order which will receive our careful attention, and we are positive that you will be well satisfied with the goods.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSMITH & CHAPPLE, LIMITED,\n\nPer [signature]\n\nVTC/nw\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter #85-3-1 of March 28th, I beg leave to report as follows.\n\nThe following in order are my suggestions as to the relative importance of the expenditures necessary:\n\n- Repairs to the building: $800.00\n- Farm implements including a Spray: $499.15\n- Maintenance tools: $300.00\n- Implement shed 20x40': $600.00\n- Dining Room Tables & benches: $400.00\n- Gas Engine for cutting wood: $300.00\n\nIn addition to the above expenditures there is also the necessary repairs to the heating plant and the plumbing of the school which on the whole is in a very bad state of repair, and cannot be repaired or a reasonable estimate given on it until the fires are allowed to go out. There was temporary repairs made to the boiler last fall but this work was only superficial and has been winter and thoroughly examined of the boilers and all brick lining removed as well as other repairs to the boilers and mains. A new main steam valve placed on the system, and the whole plumbing and heating system is in such a disgraceful condition that I would appreciate a man being sent up from the Department as soon as warm weather comes to look over the whole situation.\n\nRegarding the flooring for the barn this can be taken care of from the material of the old buildings torn down.\n\nThe principle has asked for fencing wire for fencing thirty acres.\n\nI am enclosing prices on Paints, Varnishes etc., as well as a price on Tables and benches.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nthe tank to be cleaned at least every 6 months.\n\n9. 1 inch hose piping is almost a necessity. There are also two 18\" manholes needed, one in the kitchen and one in the dining room. These are needed on the 3-way joint on newrange connections. As parts of the system are rust-eaten a supply of half three-quarter, and one inch piping ought to be in stock to enable us to take care of bursts at once. We have to wait for supplies to come down. I would suggest that the Dept. be approached to grant supplies for stock.\n\n10. New chapel.\n\n11. Laundry Machinery. I would like to have permission to have this inspected by Mr. Godfrey. I would like to see it placed in first-class condition.\n\n12. All other items can be held over. They are not urgent necessities.\n\nIn connection with the above the item of greatest importance is, of course, No. 4, the extension of class-room space. There is a close connection between this item and No. 10 viz. the building of a chapel. If a chapel were provided apart from the main building, the room now used for this purpose could be adopted to class-room work.\n\nI commend all of the above needs to your sympathetic consideration and remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.O.O.\n\n[Signature]\n\nTRH/JF\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs\u2014\n\nRe: Repairs etc., Chapleau School.\n\nWith further reference to your letter of March 28, (65-1-1) and my reply on April 2, relative to repairs, equipment, etc., at our Chapleau School, I beg to state that I have just received in a letter dated Chapleau, April 13, the following information from the Principal in this connection:\n\nOrder of importance of requirements\n\n1. The tools and farm implements are required as soon as possible in order that work can be started. These are as listed on the Dept's letter to Mr. Godfrey 65-1-1 of March 28, 1927.\n\n2. New dining room tables & benches. Estimate from Smith & Chepple $540. f.o.b. Chapleau.\n\n3. Mr. Godfrey is handling the interior decorating, plastering, stucco. I believe the contract is let.\n\n4. Extension of class-room space.\n\n5. Repair to roof of school & general.\n\n6. Implement shed.\n\n7. The heating system needs a thorough overhauling. A new steam gauge is a necessity. The old one does not register correctly. I have had it repaired but it cannot be made good. New grates and brick arch required. A 5 and 1-2 inch main steam valve is required for safety. Also 6 valves are required in radiators which are not working properly. The cost of repair parts would be $3.50 each plus labour.\n\n8. The water system from tank is also in need of valves at different points. Especially are large valves needed to enable...\nmaintenance tools 108.35 (with)\nblacksmithing 200.00 (Board)\nPiano adjustment 50.00 (not included)\n39.25 (through)\n\ninterior decor\nMartin, Miss\n300.00\nHansen\n200.00 (with)\n540.00 (with)\nhanging decorations\n\nimplement shed\n600.00 (with)\n\nextension classroom\nlarge item vote #4\nbenchwork\n\ngas engine shed 300.00 vote #4\npainting time man 75\nheating fuel (from #3)\nplumbing system 20\nChapleau April 28th, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nRelative to my letter of April 11th, in connection with the farm machinery for the Chapleau Indian school.\n\nThe farm overseer has advised me that there is no machinery at the school at present suitable to carry on with, and I have looked into this and find that what he says is correct, and the soil is now ready to be prepared and I am anxious to get started to work but require a plow immediately so that he can get the soil ready for seeding.\n\nThere is also the farm implements that I mentioned in my previous letter that were offered for $450.00 I would like to recommend the immediate purchase of this lot as they are in first class shape and about half their original cost and just what are required for the school.\n\nWill you please advise me regarding the purchase of a suitable plow and the machinery as early as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 8, 1927.\n\nT. J. GORMLEY,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\n\nReference your letters March eighteenth and twenty-eighth ultimo you may purchase one general purpose plough and also the second hand outfit of ten farm implements at price of four hundred and fifty dollars.\n\nJ. D. McLEAN.\nWhen you have received these prices, you should forward them to the Department for consideration, with the letters showing the proposal of each contractor or firm.\n\nYou may arrange to have a competent plasterer proceed to the school for the purpose of repairing the plaster and stucco that is in bad condition. Only the most necessary work should be done, and you should see that no unnecessary expense is incurred. If possible, have two or more respectable plastering contractors quote on the work.\n\nYou may purchase the lumber, after securing competitive prices, that will be required in the erection of a 20' x 40' implement shed. You may also engage the services of one competent carpenter to assist the older boys and staff of the school in the erection of this building. The cost of this implement shed should be kept as low as possible and on no account exceed the original estimate of $600. The carpenter that you employ will also be asked to furnish you an estimate of the materials required.\n\nI note that old materials at the school are being used to repair the barn floor. In view of the expenditure the Department is making at this school this year, you should see that the school management attends to this floor repairing as soon as convenient.\n\nYour representations concerning the advisability of an inspection of the heating and water systems will receive our attention.\n\nDr. Westgate intimates that the roof of the main building needs some repairs. Please let me have a report and estimate of the cost in this connection.\n\nI trust that you have already taken action in connection with the purchase of the farm implements authorized by my telegram of the 2nd instant.\n\nI regret that the extension of the classroom and the erection of a chapel, and the purchase of a gas engine, with wood saw, cannot be undertaken this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, May 10, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of the 11th ultimo concerning the most urgent requirements at the Chapleau Indian Residential School. The Department has also heard from the Field Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church in Canada in this connection. You are authorized to expend the sum of $500 in the purchase of maintenance carpenter and blacksmith tools listed under number of your letter of March 14th. Do not purchase more than the first item on the list, but substitute therefor 2 sets of stocks and dies. Approximately one-half of the second portion of the list of tools cannot be allowed, as our funds are extremely limited. You should go over this list with the Rev. Principal and determine what items are the more important. Competitive prices should be secured before awarding the business.\n\nYou may purchase, for interior decorating and general painting, the following materials, after securing competitive prices:\n\n- 250 Pints. Kalsomine or Alabastine,\n- 50 Quarts. Varnish\n- 10 Quarts. Surpentine\n- Inside White Paint\n- Outside\n- 2 Quarts each of the following Paints:\n  - Grey, Green, Brown, White Metal\n  - and Black Metal\n- 2 Gals Paint Oil.\n\nYou may also arrange for the engagement of one painter who will work on the job and will supervise the activity of the older boys and any members of the staff that can be released for this duty.\n\nYou should call for prices from responsible concerns for the supplying of 6 units of benches and table for the school dining-room. Inquiry was made by specification prepared by Smith & Co. who quoted a price of $90 each unit F.O.B. Chapleau. Their specification reads as follows:\n\nTable 12' long 3' wide and 2'6\" high, made of D.C. fir, top covered with linoleum, with 2 benches 12' long, 12\" wide and 17\" high.\n\nJ.

It was not necessary to forward the three tenders for the paint and for the tools, as you were instructed to make purchase from the firm quoting the lowest. You should purchase the tools from Desjardins, Langley & Wolfe, at their price of $156.65, and the paint from Smith & Chappie, at their price of $268.95. You may arrange for the engagement of one painter, who will work on the job and supervise the activity of the older boys and members of the staff. These tenders are all returned herewith.\n\nI am also returning the offer of Smith & Chappie and of E. Pellow in connection with the dining room tables and benches. The quotation of E. Pellow is so much more reasonable than the other, that the Department wishes to give it consideration. Please see Mr. Pellow, inform him that his price is the lowest and ask him if he will guarantee the workmanship and materials and will provide a table entirely suitable for the intended purpose. If he will, you should give him the business at his price of $216 for the 4 tables and 12 benches.\n\nYou may have the repairs to the roof undertaken and do the stucco work and plastering necessary, at the estimated cost of $244.55.

The heating system was in such poor condition that it was necessary to have a competent steamfitter and plumber examine the plant with a view to determining what repairs were required. They are more extensive than anticipated. Tenders have been secured from the only two firms in Chapleau and the lowest quotation is $1400.\n\nI believe the work should be undertaken, but I am not satisfied that the Department should meet the entire cost. I have discussed the matter with both Mr. Orr and Mr. Helean, who have been at the school when I visited it, and I believe there are two reasons why repairs and replacements of this kind are so costly at this school: First, the engineer cannot be well qualified, and Second, the number of breakages supports improper supervision of the boys during their off hours.\n\nI shall be glad to have your instructions.\n\n[Signature]\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, July 8, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, enclosing tenders for repair work on the heating system at the Chapleau Indian Residential School. You may accept the offer of V. Grisham to do the work specified for $1,400. I am returning their letters which you will please attach to the certified voucher in duplicate when the work has been satisfactorily completed. Ask them to quote a price on the installation of the 25 radiator valves and forward this to the Department as soon as possible.\n\nI have to inform you that the Department considers all these repairs to the heating system would not have been necessary if there was a well qualified person in charge of the mechanical plant. It is possible, also, that the discipline among the boys is not good and that there have been breakages which were avoidable. Please let me have an expression of your opinion in this connection. I am taking no action at the present time relative to the replacing of 10 complete water closets. I shall be grateful if you will let me know why it is necessary to replace this equipment which, I believe, was put in good condition by the Department only a few years ago.\n\nRECL.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

As Mr. Indian Agent Godfrey very kindly came to the school at the time of my visit we were able to consider these requirements together and it was agreed that your Department should be asked to supply the following:\n\n(1) Six new drain pipes of vitrified tile each 4 ft. long to repair the drain from the furnace room. The estimated cost about $16. If the tiles are provided by your department the school management will install the same.\n\n(2) New steps to the verandah at the end of the building which has been used as a school and is now being used as a class-room.

Leonard & Sons, and they stated the only safe and proper method was to put in Brick arch instead of the plates, and as the plates were thin and upon examination of them myself I readily saw that they would not stand the tremendous heat in the front of the fire box so did not let him put them in and as this was holding up the work I authorized him to put in a proper brick arch which he would guarantee and which with the cost of the large cast plates which he had ordered and were on hand he estimated at $40.00, my reason for authorizing this work was the absolute necessity of it and the fact that the man who was doing the brick work was brought in from Kenora and could not be again secured if let go and when receiving word or authorization from the Department it would cost much more to have the work done.\n\nThere was also some other small extra emergency work I had the boiler maker do while working on the boiler which could not be detected until the brick work was taken down.\n\nHoping my action in this matter will meet with your approval I beg to remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nV.

When we have this information, consideration will then be given as to whether this equipment can be supplied or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Godfrey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\nChapleau April 23rd, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 65-1-5, of April 21st, relative to the installation of the telephone and connecting to the Chapleau central station I have gone carefully into the cost and the amount stated is the lowest figure that it could be installed for but by using No. 18 Gauge wire a saving of $25.00 would be made.\n\nRegarding the existing service it is of no practical use as it is out of commission most of the time owing to it being only a ground line and the single wire from which it is operated is often broken strung on the high voltage electric lights lines when the Dynamo is working it is almost impossible to use it consequently they have very little connection with Chapleau and in cases of emergency have to drive in for the Doctor or other urgent messages, and for fire protection alone it would be a safeguard, and while we have the new fire pump installed at the school this would be of very little use outside the main building and no protection whatever to the Barns and other buildings which are situated some distance from the main building.\n\nWhile the Phone system is not absolutely necessary as we have managed these number of years without it I feel owing to the small cost involved, and the staff offering to secure and erect the pole line that I should recommend the expenditure of the $250.00 which is the cost of the line using No. 18 wire.\n\nWaiting your instructions in the matter I remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 26, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, in further reference to the cost of installing telephone connection between the Chapleau central and the Chapleau Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $450 in the purchase of the material and for the expert labour required in installing the service. You should arrange for the purchase of the wire, No. 12 gauge being considered satisfactory, and for any other materials required.

Removable glass windows should be installed for winter use and screens for summer use. You should see that the work is completed in a first-class manner to conform in general appearance to the rest of the building. The total cost should not exceed your estimate of $400.

As it is important that these improvements should be effected during the Summer season, I shall be glad to have your reply at your earliest convenience. It will also simplify matters very greatly for the Principal and for our society, if you will instruct Mr. Indian Agent [name] to have the sanctioned improvements carried into effect.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.B.C.C.\nOttawa, June 12, 1926.\n\nRev.

The sum of $400 has also been authorized towards the cost of installing lines and new windows in the north building. There is a balance of $150 remaining of the amount provided for improvements at the school, which was set aside for fencing. If you consider that this amount should be utilized in making more urgent repairs and improvements than in providing for fencing, I shall be pleased to have your recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst.

Funds are limited for this purpose at the present time, and only the most necessary work can be authorized. You may replace the outside laundry steps, repair the windows and effect the other minor repairs, listed in such list portion of the Principal's memorandum marked in blue. Fifty feet of fire hose, 2 step ladders, 12 foot stair treads and the paint and nails requested may be purchased.\n\nI should be grateful if you would secure an accurate estimate of the cost of the two doors to the recreation rooms and raising the barn roof. There are no funds for new chapel building this year; but, at a later date, it may be possible to authorize the purchase of some of the other improvements requested. Please let me know something of the urgency of the power saw, 10 dozen chairs for the assembly hall, the main corridor linoleum, the electric wiring of three small outbuildings and the fencing requested. You may purchase the lumber requested to repair the stalls in the barn and for general repairs.\n\nI am returning the Rev. Principal's requisition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nP. J. Godfrey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\nIn the junior classroom there are 10 double seats which are out of keeping with an institution of this kind. They should be replaced at an early date with 20 single seats. A plan was approved whereby a row of 7 seats could be secured by taking over a row of 7 seats which are too small for satisfactory use in the senior room. In this plan 7 new and larger seats should be procured for the senior room and the additional 13 new single seats for the junior room.\n\nIn one respect, however, the accommodation seems somewhat limited. I refer to the recreation rooms provided for the boys and girls. In discussing this matter with the Principal, Canon Vale, he pointed out that the difficulty could be overcome by using the basement present used for a chapel, for a recreation room. This would provide ample space for outdoor games as well as for organized physical culture. This suggestion would involve the addition of a new chapel. The Principal's suggestion was with my approval. Canon Vale also suggested that for various reasons exits should be provided from the basements. He pointed out that this could be accomplished by changing two windows into two doors. His plan seems worthy of adoption.\n\nThere is at present a lack of outdoor games for the girls. Some attention should be given to this matter. Some slides of the type at present found on city playgrounds would be very much appreciated.\nSt. John's Anglican Indian Residential School\n\nRev. A.J.

In this connection I have to request that you will inform the Department of the name of the manufacturer of the desks at present in use, so it will be necessary, in order to have uniformity in the seating arrangements, that any new desks supplied be of the same type. This information will, no doubt, be stamped in the headings on the present desks.\n\nIt is noted that the Principal requests that 7 large and 13 small size desks be supplied. For your information, I may say that desks are manufactured in the following sizes:\n\n| No. | Pupils 15 to 18 years of age |\n|-----|-----------------------------|\n| 2   |                             |\n| 3   | 11 to 14                    |\n| 4   | 10 to 13                    |\n| 5   | 7 to 9                      |\n| 6   | 5 to 7                      |\n\nYou should ascertain from the Principal the exact sizes of the extra desks he requires, and inform the Department accordingly.

Chapleau, Ont., Government Rates, Tax Included, and you will note that our prices are based upon our style No. 10 Single Desks, as illustrated on Page 6 of our School Furniture catalogue, a copy of which we believe is already in your hands, and our reason for offering the No. 10 instead of the No. 14, which you specify, is that because of defects and weaknesses which we found in the solid plate part of the casing of the No. 14, we have discontinued manufacturing it, and it has been replaced in our line by the style No. 10, above referred.\n\nThe prices for the Desks, F.O.B. Chapleau, sales tax paid, packed K.D., invoices included, are as follows:\n\n- 3 Sizes 8, No. 10 New Globe Single Desks, @ $7.00\n- 7 Sizes 8, No. 10 New Globe Single Desks, @ $7.20\n- 6 Sizes 4, No. 10 New Globe Single Desks, @ $7.30\n\nWe assume that these Desks are intended for use in the Indian Boarding School in Chapleau, and if such is the case, we beg to call your attention to the fact that we have been supplying desks for this school for several years, the last two shipments having been forwarded in December 1921, and September 1922. The style of Desk forwarded, being our style No. 101 Globe Single Steel Desks, as illustrated on page 9 of our catalogue.\n\nThe only difference in the desks forwarded at that time, and as they are now regularly supplied by us, is that in the style No. 101 Steel Desks already furnished, the steel parts were finished in Black, whereas in the present stock, the finish of the steel parts is a rich olive green enamel.\nCiteau, July 11, 1929.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, quoting on the desks required for delivery at Chapleau, Ont. In this connection it is noted that, in filling former orders for desks for the point, you supplied your style No. 101, Globe Single Steel Desk.

Ink wells should be supplied with each desk.\n\nThese desks should be supplied at the total aggregate price quoted, viz., $111.25. T. o. b. Chapleau, Ont., Sales Tax included. Please forward your account, in duplicate, covering the order, to T. J. Godfrey, Indian Agent, Chapleau, Ont., who is being informed of the order placed with you.

I have made enquiry of the Chapleau Electric Power Company as to the cost of such light. They inform me it would cost $100 to install and keep in repair, other than actual breakage, a total of $20 per annum.\n\nI may point out they are putting lights at their own expense on either side of us and this would create a very dark area around the placing of this lamp at our gateway would be appreciated and give us what we really need some light on the road.\n\nWe appreciate any aid you can give us in this matter as we are exposed to danger here more now than ever before.

Principal of the Chapleau Indian School in connection with placing a light at the entrance to the Indian school grounds, and what he says in connection with it being a very dark place for the children in the darkness as well as the staff of the school is correct as there is a light some distance away on each side of the entrance to the school grounds leaving a very dark and dangerous place at the entrance.\n\nI would like to recommend that a light be placed at the entrance as it would light up all the grounds at the back of the school as well as the entrance from the Highway cars are using at all hours of the day and night.\n\nWaiting your instructions in the matter I remain.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, November 28, 1929.\n\nI have your letter of the 25th inst., containing a communication from the Principal of the Indian Residential School in which he states that the entrance to the school should be placed at the entrance to the school grounds. The Principal also requests that the annual charge for the use of the school grounds be paid by the school from its pay roll. I have therefore requested the Principal accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nAgent, Deputy and Secretary.\nIn the near future, the matter of providing new and adequate seating accommodation for the Assembly room should be taken into consideration as the present arrangement is not satisfactorily meeting the needs.\n\nNew play-ground equipment consisting of tennis material, separate slides for the girls and boys and balls and bats for the playing of softball should be provided.\n\nI was pleased to note that all the double seats have now been removed from the classrooms and twenty new single desks have been added since last inspection. In the senior room an extra back is needed for one of the rows and two additional backs to replace two complete seats which cause crowding against the rear wall.\nOttawa, December 16, 1929.\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Chapleau Indian Residential School, states that, in the near future, the matter of providing new and adequate seating accommodation for the school pupils should be taken into consideration as the present arrangement is not satisfactorily meeting the need. You should consult the Principal regarding this matter and furnish a report and recommendation as to the new seating accommodation required.\n\nThe Inspector further recommends that more playground equipment be supplied. This Department furnishes footballs, indoor baseballs and bats, volley ball equipment, basket balls and goals. If the Principal will forward a requisition for the equipment of the above nature required, early next spring, favourable consideration will be given to supplying same.\n\nRelative to the seating in the senior classroom, the Inspector suggests as follows: \"An extra back is needed for one of the rows and two additional backs to replace two complete seats which cause crowding against the rear wall. If you will state the size of the rear seats required, an order will be placed for suitable same. The desks at present in use are supplied by the Globe Furniture Company, Limited, Waterloo, Ont.

You should, therefore, draw this matter to the attention of the Department in April, next, when consideration will then be given to supplying the chairs required.\n\nRegarding the three rear seats for the No. 2 desks, I have to say that we are today placing an order with the Globe Furniture Co.

Leonard & Sons, of London Ontario, and is Numbered 66.R.F.-9517. But this firm should know just the exact size and kind of grate required which is a coal grate.\n\nThe grates while not all damaged if the right section was ordered the rest of the set would do for the balance of the winter but it will be necessary to have the whole new set before another winter sets in.\n\nThere was also the matter of the Pressure Gauge for the Boiler pressure, this gauge was defective and it was very dangerous to run the boiler without it and I ordered one from Messrs Smith & Chepple to replace the broken one as I was afraid something might happen with nothing to advise them of the pressure in the boiler.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 13, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant reporting on the condition of the grate in the firebox of the boiler at the Shingwauk Indian Residential School. It is noted that if one new section is obtained and installed at the present time the balance of the grate could be satisfactory for the present winter's use. You may, therefore, arrange to obtain from the manufacturer of the boiler one grate section of the type required and have same installed. Early next summer you should draw to the attention of the Department the matter of installing a set of new grates, which work could be carried out before the furnace is required next fall. Your action in obtaining a pressure gauge for the boiler and having it installed is approved.\n\nYou should forward certified accounts, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in installing the new section in the grate of the boiler and for the purchase and installation of the gauge.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

S. C. C., requests to be supplied with FIRGAS fire extinguishers. In each case, it was stated the principals were advised by you that the Department would favourably consider any requests for this equipment made through their local Indian agent.\n\nThe Department does not appear to have any record on file, giving the authority mentioned above. While we are prepared to thoroughly consider supplying FIRGAS equipment, it is not the intention to replace the extinguishers of other types which are in good condition at any of the schools. It is noted from the circulars received, descriptive of the FIRGAS, that same can be obtained only on a rental basis and remains the property of the company manufacturing same. Each application will be dealt with on its merits and the supplying of FIRGAS will be considered should any extra fire extinguishing equipment be required at any of the schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This will give us time to erect them during the vacation time.\n\nI would also like once again to press our need for a Power Saw to aid in the cutting of the wood for the use in the kitchens.

Was the Principal or yourself considered the supplying of folding chairs for the assembly hall? If so, could you obtain and furnish prices for same?

I was very favourably impressed by his earnestness and interest in the school work. He is of a quiet easy-going manner with a pleasing personality and is working hard to bring the school back to the standard it had reached a few years ago. The buildings and equipment are well cared for and in good condition. The interior of the school is kept very tidy and spotlessly clean. There are about 25 remaining during the holidays - looked real well, happy and enjoying themselves. Owing to the nature of the land, which is principally bush and rock, very little is being done along agricultural lines. There are 10 acres sown in oats, which is cut green for feed; hay has to be purchased. There is an excellent garden and is sufficient to provide potatoes and vegetables all winter.\n\nThe stock consists of 17 pure bred Holstein cows, six head of young stock, a pure bred bull, three pigs, two young sows and a male for breeding purposes, two teams of heavy horses, a driver and about one hundred hens. All the milk and butter produced is used by the pupils and staffs. Dr. Sheahan reports the health of the pupils very good and free from tuberculosis.\n\nThe barn has not been completed to provide a hay mow. This work should be done, if the necessary funds are available right away. Hay and oats for feed have to be stocked outside all winter, reducing the feed value very considerably.

A.J.Vale,\nPrincipal,\nSt. John's Indian Residential School,\nChapleau, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter of Sept. 3rd, has been received and we are sorry there was a misunderstanding in quoting price on Caroline Engine outfit for cutting wood.\n\nOwing to the fact that no dimensions were given we inferred that the saw itself was not required; therefore we quoted an extremely low price for engine and frame only at $250.00.\n\nThis outfit was procured from the United States and we are sorry there was some delay in obtaining it.\n\nOwing to the fact that our quotation to you was addressed under the name of Rev.A.J.Dale instead of Rev. A.J.Vale, the quotation was not connected when order was received from Ottawa. The instructions from Ottawa read One 5.H.P. Gas Engine and one Horse power steel truck saw frame, therefore, no irregularity was noted.\n\nYou have not yet stated what size saw is required but we believe you will find a 30\" saw the best and most serviceable for your work. This can be supplied for $85.00.\n\nSaws in 20 and 25 inch can be supplied at a little lower price. We shall await definite instructions before placing the order for the saw.\n\nWe regret the misunderstanding and shall be glad if you will refer to our file R 263 when replying.\n\n(signed) The T.Eaton Co., Ltd.\nChapleau Sept. 14th, 1930.\n\nI hereby beg leave to enclose copy of letter sent to the Rev. Cannon Vale relative to Power plant for cutting wood at the Chapleau Residential school, as per your order referred to in Official letter No. 5, of July 16th, 1930.\n\nEvidently according to the letter from The T.Eaton Co., the saw should have been ordered separately, and in this connection the 30\" saw is what is required but the machine is of no use without this.\n\nWill you kindly place the order for the saw and ask that they rush the order.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 17, 1930.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nRe Mail Order No. 2261.\n\nRev. A. J. Vale, Principal of the Indian Residential School, Chapleau, Ont., has forwarded your communication of the 12th instant relative to providing a 30\" saw to be used in connection with the power plant for cutting wood which was supplied by your firm. In this connection I have to request that you will ship charges prepaid, addressed to Rev. A. J. Vale, P.O. Box 15, Chapleau, Ont., the saw should be supplied at the price quoted in your letter to Mr. Vale viz., \u00a326.50. It is presumed this quotation is F.O.B. Toronto. I shall be pleased if you will arrange for early shipment.\n\nYour account, in duplicate, covering the cost, together with receipt attached for the amount of charges prepaid, should be forwarded to F. H. Paget, Esq., Canadian Arctic Supply Co., who is also informed of the order placed with you and requested, upon receipt of the saw, if satisfactory, to certify the account and send it to the Department, when payment will be made.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.

The Department of Justice have ruled that where work is being carried out on a percentage basis, receipted accounts for materials, and also labour returns must be furnished before payment can be made. In connection with this work, it would appear from recent correspondence that this firm has not the funds available with which to pay the accounts for materials until such time as the Department has reimbursed them for the materials purchased and the labour performed.\n\nWith a view to making an early settlement of their account, a letter has today been sent to Mr. Godfrey, Chapleau, instructing him to pay the accounts for the materials supplied, and to forward receipted accounts to the Department, and it is hoped that in this way the matter of payment to Messrs.

Coonchette & Knight of Sudbury, on a proven cost plus ten per cent basis.\n\nMr. Knight was foreman for the contracting firm that built the Chapleau school, and was therefore well acquainted with the building and its construction, which was of great assistance in carrying out the repairs. Mr. Knight was doing work in the town of Chapleau at the time that the repairs were started at the school, and it was owing to this fact that it was possible for him to undertake the work.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nAugust 31, 1910.\n\nPersonal\n\nDear Mr. Godfrey,\n\nIn the accompanying official letter you have been authorized to have the repairs made to the boiler at the Chapleau Residential School.

I wish to explain, at my request, Messrs Wolfe and Collins of Chapleau sent for six valves. On their delivery the account was sent in to the Department. When I tried to install them I found they were not the correct type. I had not specified they were to be the Automatic kind.\n\nWe returned them and now have received the Automatic kind but unfortunately the price is higher for these. I have therefore requested them to send in the complete account for these and a copy of the amount formerly paid on the others so it may be deducted from this total now being sent.\n\nI regret making the error and hope this explanation will make the transaction clear.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOffice of the Chaplain Indian Agency,\n\nJanuary 15th, 1932\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. ....................,\namounting to $38.00 ........................................ in favour\nof Wolfe & Collins Ltd.\nfor Balance at R Value for Chaplain's\nIndian School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorised by Departmental\nLetter No. 65-1-5 dated Oct. 27, 1931.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nChapleau January 1st, 1952.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to letter #65-1-5 of 2nd Jan., I herewith beg leave to enclose receipt for the amount paid on your behalf for the Manure Spreader at the Chapleau Indian School and which was express and not freight.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo: Penitent Institution\n\nJuly 18th\n\nNo. 256\n\nI hereby certify that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nAgent\nOffice of the Chaplain Indian Agency.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. ............ amounting to $17.62 in favour of Bennett Maclean & Co. for supplies for Duncan Smith at Chopakee Indian School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 65-1-8 dated Nov/9th 1931.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo Mr. Smith\n\nDATE: Jan. 24th 1937\n\nSERVICE: To Emergency Repair & Painting of Chopman Indian School\n\nAMOUNT: $8.69\n\nI Humbly Certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent\nCHAPLEAU ONT.
