What course he will adopt in this emergency remains to be seen, but he will doubtless dissolve the House and appeal to the country.\n\nPreparations are being made in the North-West, along the C.P.R., for the visit of Sir John Macdonald, who will pass through about the latter part of this month on his way to Victoria, B.C. It is a pity the Premier cannot find it convenient to take a trip through Saskatchewan and the Edmonton, and thus become acquainted with the Saskatchewan country which is by far the most valuable portion of the great Northwest. But as we cannot have the honour of a visit from him we will have to content ourselves with wishing him an hon. voyage.\n\nTHE TOWN AND DISTRICT OF PRINCE ALBERT.\n\nLake Edmonton, St. Albert and other places to the north and west, Prince Albert district is in its history. Though not quite so old nor so far removed from civilization as the former settlements, still its founders, and its early settlers had to contend with the same disadvantages, had to overcome the same obstacles, which beset the paths of their brother pioneers farther west.\n\nIn 1866, just twenty years ago, the late Rev. James Nesbit, a Presbyterian minister, came here with a party of men, arrived at this point. An H. R. Post had been established some time previous, and Rev. Mr. Nesbit was to establish a Mission in connection with the Presbyterian Church, which he did succeed in doing. As the years crowded on, and as settlers commenced pouring into Manitoba, and there was a prospect that the tide of emigration would flow this way, the western branch of the then Presbyterian Province, many of the settlers of Kildonan, and French halfbreeds from St. Boniface, as also many Canadians, came to settle in this district, and the vermin. Thus slowly but surely the country increased in population and importance from a community of half a dozen white men, in 1866, to a population of thousands today. In 1866. It is not too much to say, as we might, the hardships which the early pioneers underwent. Those who have had any experience of Northwest life have a good idea of what they went through. Their history is but a repetition of that of the early pioneers of Canada with this difference, of course, that the latter had a different class of Indians to deal with, and the difficulties of their struggles were filled with vengeance and death and constant terror. Had the Northwest tribes been of a bloodthirsty disposition, had they looked upon the whites as the eastern tribes did, we think, we would have no fear however. Instead, they seem to be anxious to build another town on the sods of the detriment of this place, but we think the Government, if our claims are properly put before them, will, instead of pursuing us for our enterprise, be glad to see another town, and their encourage us to increase expectations in the direction of developing this district by locating the new police barracks in or close by the town of Prince Albert.\n\nBut though the permanent police barracks should be granted to us, if we would continue to prosper we must have railway communication. At present we have only a railway branching off from the C. P. R. in a northwesterly direction, one from Portage la Prairie, one from Hudson and one from Regina. The objective point of all these is definitely known, while that of the Northwest Central is Battleford. The Regina and Long Lake Railway will soon be completed to and through Prince Albert, connecting the Lake and Regina, and the work of construction will still continue toward along the Lake shore. The objective point of this railway is not known, although there are some people in this district who do not have Prince Albert at one end of a railway and Regina at the other, think that the great majority of the people are quite content to have railway communication with the outside world even by way of the capital of the Northwest. At all events this railway seems to us to afford the quickest means of escape from our present position, and we believe that Mr. Albert should be its proposed terminus and its promoters have the necessary financial strength to complete it. As matters stand, however, we would seem to be left out in the cold by the whole thing.\n\nGENERAL NEWS.\n\nPresident Macdonald was married at the White House on the 2nd inst., to Miss Francis Polson.\n\nArchibald Forbes, the distinguished journalist, who was in Winnipeg lately, has returned to his home on the North-West.\n\nMiss Margaret, wife of Louis Riell, died at St. Vital, May 31st.\n\nThirteen rebellion medals are reported to have been sold in Montreal.

The principal business of the meeting was to arrange a prize list for the fall show now being held at the fair grounds, with the addition of an old silver cup, cost \u00a320 (300) donated on behalf of the Hudson's Bay Company by Mr. H. C. Clarke, Chairman of the Society.\n\nAfter the minutes of the previous meeting were read and approved, Capt. Hoey and Mr. Chas. Robertson advanced stock, as seems to be the custom of the members of the Society, so that such a valuable prize could be given for the importing of a few thoroughbred horses. It was thought that if we have a hard year\u2014would be of incalculable value to the farmers in improving their stock.\n\nThe young interest was very clearly put forward by Mr. Tiss. F. Miller, who was able to account for his horse, No. 15, which, in a very forcible manner, convinced the directors present that grass was the best food for a good animal, and that it was not necessary to give grain to a horse.\n\nI was then moved by Mr. Tiss. F. Miller, seconded by Capt. Craig Maclean, that the Society should be prepared for the next exhibition of grain, consisting of fifteen bushels of wheat, (two colours), oats, barley, rye, buckwheat, black, and ten bushels of hay, and that this be sent three out of five years to the Exhibition Committee, and that the winner of each year receive a medal as a prize for having won the prize.\n\nThe motion was carried by a majority of the members present.\n\nThe next day decided in case there was no competition the awarding of a prize to the best horse.\n\nTiss. F. Miller James Thompson, W. Paterson, J. Maclean, Geo. Wilson, the Board of Directors, were appointed a committee to draw up the general prize list, and they expect to have it printed by the end of June.\n\nFactory working to do some special prizes should kindly send them to the Secretary, as soon as possible.\n\nFor the purpose of discussing the matter pertaining to purely agricultural matters.\n\nCapt. Craig proposed, and Mr. John Scott seconded a motion that the meeting recognize the delegates that are being sent from the Lorne Counties to the representatives of the Society, so that the President and Secretary with the mover will be under no appointment to make any report or statement regarding the proceedings of the meeting, and put the same into the hands of the representatives, so that they may bring the same before the Government at Ottawa without delay. Carried unanimously.\n\nThe committee having met, agreed to place before the Government in the strongest light possible, the serious feeling of the people of the district, whether members of the Society or not, that the government, which it aims at doing the greatest good to the district in the Saskatchewan District, should be located at or near the Town of Prince Albert, and that the reason for this feeling being that the said Town is the centre of population and wealth of the district, and that the farmers, who live in the Saskatchewan district are located here, have done much hard pioneer work, and are therefore entitled to every consideration, and that there should be a large mercantile class who have, at least, an outlet, both for the purchase of lumber and farming implements, and that during the late rebellion it was quite evident to everyone that the Government, in connection with the approach of danger immediately moved into Prince Albert as the natural point of safety, and that it was felt that those people still look to the town in the same way and would regard any attempt to remove the Government, or the withdrawal of the forces, or the bulk of them, from this place as entirely improper, the same as a similar movement in any other part of the country, which they consider themselves entitled to expect from the Government of the country; the committee request the delegates to impress upon the Government the fact that for several years in succession the farmers of the district have been struggling against a series of adverse circumstances, which have been prevented, and that the immigration on this extensive section of the continent has been delayed, from causes beyond our control, the greatest satisfaction and interest having been manifested by the farmers, who have been greatly encouraged by the Government, and that the recent talk of the Police at a distance from Prince Albert is discouraging in the highest degree, and it is sincerely hoped it will not be carried out.\n\nWM.

It took him two weeks to make the assessment, and he made the assessment, for which the Council allowed him $100.00.\n\nMr. Betts stated that he had understood that only those who were assessed for income were assessed.\n\nADVERTISERS\n\nCan learn the exact cost of any proposed line of Advertising in American Papers by addressing Geo.
