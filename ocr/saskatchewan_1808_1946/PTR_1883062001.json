Sir Hector Langevin expects to secure the attendance of thirty children at the opening of each of these schools. Two are to be located at Qu'Appelle and one at Battleford, the one at Battleford being Protestant, the others Catholic. The sum of $1,000 is set aside for the amount of rent, salary to be paid to each school and a further sum of $5,000 has been granted each for boarding and other expenses. What may be the exact nature of the system to be introduced has not been definitely explained, but it will be the intention of the Government to commence huge boarding schools for the education of the embryo red man. If so the people will naturally object to paying for the education of non-national schools. That the present system of Indian schools has been a failure is owing more to the manner in which it has been carried out than to the system itself. The treaties made with the various tribes bind the Government to establish schools for the education of Indian children on the various reserves. In the absence of all specific conditions as to the qualifications of the teachers to be employed, it is generally understood that the Government will employ competent men to manage these schools, but as they offer a salary of about three hundred dollars per annum, the result has been practically a dead letter except in such reserves as have received the benefit of assistance from one or other of the various missionary societies who have visited them. No comparison has been made to induce attendance, and the consequence has been that even in the few schools which have been established, the efforts of the teachers have been wholly in vain. The sum of money which has been applied to Mr. Beaudry's schools would have gone very far to perfect the various schools on the different reserves and would not have left the Lord's treasury open to the suspicion of having some more personal object in view than that of the education of Indian youth. It would also have been beneficial to the larger number of the Indians than the present system can ever be expected to reach. The children could have been taught some occupation during their course and would have been a well fitted to fight their way through life by the average youth in any part of the Dominion. But the education of \"my Indians,\" as our egotistical Government calls them, is just now receiving an amount of attention at the hands of Mr. Beaudry which the Reform press afraid that an experienced man might not think it was beneath his dignity to wield the buck over the children of the mighty Chief Pape especially if the situation had an attachment of $5,000 per annum.\n\nThe Land Sale.\n\nThe excitement in Manitoba over the great land sale is intense. The press, independent of political connection, condemn the sale in no measured terms and many expect that bloodshed will be the result of any attempt to drive the Indians from their homes. The sale itself was an utter failure, netting very little more than enough to pay expenses. An inspector was sent by the Government to examine the lands and report upon the improvements made and length of time of settlement that each settler had completed, and this inspector is charged with favoring those settlers who are friendly to the Government and discouraging those who are otherwise disposed. Two men at Wabasso are cited as a case in point. One of these having resided on his claim for a short time and made a substantial improvement, the other felt that he too had resided almost continuously on his and made considerable improvements. At the time of the inspector's visit both of these men were absent, the former at work in the field, the latter in Ontario bringing up stock and implements for his farm, yet the former is to be allowed a homestead entry, the latter has been forced to take his farm. Three classes of settlers are being badly suffered by the grievous wrong by the Government, the first being those who set on the lands previous to their withdrawal from homestead entry, some of whom are being deprived of their homes. There are also those who settled an advance of the C. P. R. construction on lands not contained within the \"mile limit\" as the railway was located at that time, subsequently settling on and at last purchasing or buying the land, altered and many of these settlers are now to be deprived of their homes because they are within the mile limit of the railway as now located. Those who managed at the time the order was passed and who consequently knew nothing of it, but who nevertheless located on land in good faith and without knowledge of the new element during these two years, in many cases have sacrificed to the end of filthy lucre by a government who already have an overflowing treasury. Altogether the transaction only one more than three sets which have bought the homesteads of our North West lands and reflects no credit either upon the Government, the inspector or the legislative body. Many of the settlers are suffering, and those who are included, sold and when full payment come to hand it is expected that many will have been in entire ignorance of the sale until some time after the sale was advertised and proclaimed and been sold. Another sale is shortly to be held, when we may expect just such another outbreak of popular feeling. In some places the settlers threaten bloodshed rather than be deprived of their homes in order that the land holder may have \"superior possession\" of their lands. The stubbornness of the Marquisian Government did much to prevent the sale, although the actual sale takes place to take place in this country, but the present law and the manner in which they are administered are a constant hindrance to those in the west who have done their duty and have purchased the unclaimed and ruined lands of the settlers. Settler leagues are formed in several of the disaffected districts and these districts outside of Southern Manitoba are now making a stand. We look for trouble in the future and endeavor to remedy the evil which already exists as well as prevent the introduction of the marquisian land laws. Speaking generally speaking the Government's sale has subjected our fellow settlers to the south of this State been subjected.\n\nMAMMOTH STOCK OF FRESH GOODS\n\nJust received by steamers Northcote and Manitoba\n\nWe have decided to sell at special prices for the next two months.\n\nCall and get the best value for cash ever offered in Prince Albert.\n\nDry Goods Groceries Provisions Crockery Hardware Boots and Shoes Wooden Ware Fancy Goods Clothing 20 lbs Mess Pork Bacon and Ham Canned Fruits Maple Sugar Biscuits Cigars and Fancy Pipes Baskets etc., etc\n\nSTEWARD & WOOTTON\nThe Royal Baker and Pastry Cook.\n\nA royal addition to the kitchen library. It contains over two hundred recipes pertaining to every department of the art, including baking, confectionery, preserving, cakes, sauces, puddings, pastries, and all kinds of confections, including the making of chocolate, coffee, tea, and other beverages, and all other necessary knowledge for the cook, confectioner, and pastry cook. It will be found invaluable for the modest housewife, who desires to prepare her food and make her own bread and cakes in a simple and economical way. Each recipe is given full and explicit directions for preparing together with accompanying sketches, drawings, and photographs, so that even the novice can go through the operations with success, while a special chapter is devoted to the art of making soups and broths, as well as the preparation of all kinds of food and delicacies for the sick. The book has been prepared under the personal supervision of Prof. Eichmann, head of the New York Cooking School, and is the most valuable of its kind ever issued on the subject of cooking. It is now ready for publication. It is bound up in the highest style of leather, printed on fine paper with elaborate illustrations throughout. We are assured that every copy of the \"Royal Baking Powder\" contains an order for one of these valuable books.\n\nNo Wonder He Couldn't Find It.\n\nWell, sir, the paper goes again,\" exclaimed Colonel Mowbray, after a few weeks since I had a chance to read that paper, and unless there is a return soon somebody's going to be very uncomfortable. Sarah,\" to the colonel's ear, \"I have just seen something in the morning paper.\"\n\n\"What paper, boss?\"\n\nThe paper that's thrown on the gallery every morning.\n\n\"I see, sir, what are you doing there this morning?\" observed a gentleman to his neighbour.\n\n\"I'm doing some tricks.\"\n\n\"Give me a little evidence of your ability,\" said the gentleman.\n\nHaving been requested, I had identified the cards in their magical style and performed some very clever work with them. The person who dropped the character into the mix, landed, and was killed.\n\n\"Jim, you are quite a juggler.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, massa, I am only a negro man.\"\n\nRecommended for Wrestling, Temptation.\n\nAnother long-ago tale has been discovered, but strange to say, the gentleman who saw it did not adhere to the conventional rules.\n\n\"And you say that the snake did not roll after you,\" said a man when the hoop was thrown at him.\n\n\"No, he did not roll after me.\"\n\n\"You didn't jump behind a tree, then jump out as the snake struck at you?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"And the horse on the tree did not suffer and die within two hours?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"My friend, here is a $20 gold piece. A man who can defy temptation, as you have done, deserves a reward. You shall be rewarded.\"\u2014Arabian Traveler.\n\nSuddenly Taken from Life.\n\n\"How was your, Mister Lippenstein?\" said a man, who was pandering to the feelings of the guide, who was deathly pale.\n\n\"There you have your health, Schloke. But wasn't that thing?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the guide, scratching his head, and the other, drawing an unexplained pledge across his eyes.\n\n\"Excuse me, my dear Schloke, how was it?\"\n\n\"Well, you see, Moses, it occurred in the night.

Never miss the opportunity to take pictures, coats, hats and boots. Never mind if they do make a mess around you, with their clothes and toys. You would think again if we could have a vision of the young ones going out together, dressed in their Sunday best, playing in the snow, laughing and enjoying themselves. The influence of a bright smile is more powerful than any other. The circle formed by casting a stone into the water, if gone on and on through a man's life, would show how much worldly pleasures may weaken the remembrance for a time, but each touch upon the heart would bring back the image of the old man, and his face, his voice, and his loving words will come up before him like a revelation. The time will come when you will think that you will give the world to have your house surrounded by the dear hands of those very boys who now play with you, and who will step in the hall, and their rude cheeks laid up to yours; when you would rather have them there than all the paintings of Thomas or the songs of Nilsson; when you would gladly dirty carpets, ave, live without a cent to eat, but have them there, right, strong, dear hands beside you once more. Then play with and pet them. Praise their drawings, Betty's music and baby stories, and Dick's inventions. Encourage Tom to chop off his stick of wood, and Dick to persevere in making his toy boat. Tell him about the great figures, tell him he is your famous mathematician; and if another loves geography, tell him he must be sure to make a good spelling bee in a short minute. Go with them to see their young rabbits and chickens and pigeons, and down to the creek to see their favorite fishing operation. Have them gather your mosses and grasses and bright autumn leaves, and tell them that the snow is over all the earth. And you will keep yourself young and fresh by entering into their games.\n\nHome life is the sure test of character. Let a husband be cowardly and shy, and he will grow cold and unmanly. The children will feel the effect of his timidity and young bears. The failure becomes callous, cowardly, hard, kind of two-legged brutes with, however, a certain amount of self-defense. They develop an unnatural growth and sharpness of teeth, and the result is a hideous ugly face and a hideous brow. This is what the family circle should be. If one must be rude to any, let it be so that one can do nothing worse than laugh at the rude one. Let one of the loved ones be taken away, and memory recalls a thousand sayings on regret, and the soul writhes and suffers painfully. The grave cannot hide the white faces of those who sleep. The coffin is closed, and the soul goes to its rest. They draw us farther than we would go. They force us to remember a man never seen except in death. His looks are those of a wife or mother's grave. His eyes glisten wondrous clear, and in his deathbed he beholds what is to be lost, and he bemoans it. He is not the lord of the feelings of the loved. It is a pitiable picture of human weakness when those we love are treated worst.\n\nA lesson to a boy.\n\nGet away from school a little while every day, my boy. Stand one side and let the world run by while you get acquainted with yourself, and see what kind of a fellow you are. You have had questions about yourself; find out all you can about yourself. Ascertain from your parents whether you are the manner of a man; people say you are, find out if you are always honest; if you are always truthful; if you are always decent; if your life is as good and upright at 11 o'clock at night as it is at noon; if you are as anxious to do your own work as you are to do a Sunday school picnic if you are as good a boy when you go to Church as you are at home; if you are as good a boy as the sort of young man your father hopes you are, your mother says you are, and your grandmother says you are. Get on intimate terms with yourself, my boy, and believe me, every time you come out from under your father's roof, you will be a stronger, better, prouder man than you forget this, Telamonian, and it will do you good.\n\nA moving spectacle.

W. T.\nONLY A BOY.\n\nWritten by Mr. MacKenzie of the Toronto Evening Telegram.\n\nThe following story appeared in the Toronto Evening Telegram:\n\nThere was once a boy who lived in a small village. He was very poor and had no friends. One day, while he was playing outside, he heard a loud noise coming from inside his house. He rushed inside and found his mother lying on the floor, unconscious. The boy knew what to do. He quickly got up and started running towards the nearest town. He arrived there just in time to see a doctor arrive at the scene. The doctor examined the woman and declared her dead. The boy then returned home and told everyone about what had happened. From that day on, the boy became known as the \"Hero of the Village.\"\n\nPRINCE ALBERT\n\nUNIVERSITY OF SASKATCHEWAN\n\nBefore going to England, His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan had a petition drawn up and signed by himself and several prominent citizens of the province. This petition asks for the establishment of the University of Saskatchewan. The Bishop has written to the Prime Minister of Canada, asking him to consider the petition. The Bishop has also written to the Governor General, requesting him to give the matter his attention.\n\nBOOT & SHOE STORE.\n\nJUST RECEIVED another lot of boots with the greatest variety and best value in Prince Albert.\n\nBoots & Shoes Cheap, Cheap for Cash.\n\nAll kinds of Leather Work and Repairing done on short notice.
