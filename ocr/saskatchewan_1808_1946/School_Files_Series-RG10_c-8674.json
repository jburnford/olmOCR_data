This criticism has come to us from a representative of the Anglican Church, who informed us that it has been your policy, until recently, not to furnish teachers' residences in the agency. Quite recently, however, you requested furnishings for the Big River R.C. school. These furnishings, I notice, were authorized in a letter dated July 13, 1942. This critic seemed to resent very bitterly what he referred to as unfair discrimination or favoritism in the district. You can readily imagine how difficult it is for the Department to meet criticism of this kind. The officials are of the opinion, therefore, that the whole policy of furnishing teachers' residences in your agency should be carefully reviewed and that the greatest possible care should be exercised in sending forward requisitions for supplies or furnishings. This man, who had a lengthy interview with the Director, seemed to be fully informed on every item of the furnishings supplied at the Big River school, the man employed in the construction of the building and the general policy of the Department in that section of Saskatchewan. The Director finally suggested to him that his complaints should be outlined in writing and forwarded to the Department. He was assured that if he did this the complaints would be very carefully reviewed by the officials of this Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. R. S.

Davis,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter I07-6-8 and 392-I-6 dated August 22nd, regarding the policy of furnishing teachers residence on this Agency.\n\nI must refer you to your letter of July 3rd 1942, in which you requested that I forward a requisition for the necessary furniture for the Roman Catholic Teacherage at Big River Reserve. In this letter you also informed me that the Sisters of Providence were taking charge, and I consider that I am not to blame if any discrimination has taken place, as I only followed your instructions.\n\nI have always tried to be fair, and as we have two schools on this Reserve, I have been careful to treat each alike, I have only changed this policy when requested to do so.\n\nI would recommend that when a teacher is appointed for the Church of England school, the teacherage be furnished exactly the same as the Roman Catholic teacherage, and then refuse to furnish any more teacherages. If this is not done, I am afraid more criticism will result.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S. Davis\nIndian Agent.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 12, 1948.\n\nRe: Furnishing of Teachers' Residences.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 7th instant and note with interest the information supplied therein.\n\nMay I point out that the criticism to which I referred on August 22nd was not directed against the Department for supplying furnishings to the R. C. School on the Big River Reserve. The Government, in my experience, is seldom, if ever, criticized for the expenditure of money. The criticism was directed against us for what was alleged to be discrimination on your part, not for furnishing the teacher's residence at the Big River R. C. School, but for your refusal from time to time to purchase furniture for teachers' residences operated by other churches. It was alleged also that in the employment of men certain favours were shown. However, the critic promised to submit the whole matter to the Director in writing, and I do not know that any good purpose can be served by an interchange of correspondence on the subject at this time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

(RG 10, Volume 6291, file 617-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nWhen visiting the Montreal Lake Indian Day School recently Reverend G.J. Waite, the teacher, brought to my attention the condition of the teacher's residence. This residence was built in 1938 and reported at that time by Dr. Robertson, then Inspector of Indian Agencies, as satisfactory. Since that time different attempts have been made to improve it but always by starting the wrong way.\n\nBad judgment was used in selecting the site in the first place. The classroom building is built on fairly high ground and at a good location. The residence was built at a distance of about 300 yds. from the classroom building for some reason which I am unable to explain. Where the classroom building is situated the ground is sufficiently high and well drained that a basement could have been placed beneath the building and a pipeless furnace would have made it quite warm. Instead of this the residence was erected on low-lying ground where there is water 18\" below the surface. Some attempt was made to excavate a small cellar but it is always filled with water. A furnace of a kind was constructed at the rear of the building on the ground level. This furnace is an ordinary box stove with a drum above it, the whole bricked in with a complete brick wall. Two heating pipes lead from this for the purpose of heating the living room and the bedroom, a considerable distance away, through two walls. These heating pipes travel about 20 ft. horizontally with no rise whatever consequently no heat travels through them. The drum above the box stove being bricked in cannot be cleaned without removing the brickwork and it is now so full of soot and ashes that the stove cannot be used as it simply fills the house with smoke. The residence is a log building built of very heavy logs and I believe it would be a very difficult job to move it to a proper site without dismantling it and rebuilding it.\n\nMr. Waite is doing good work as a day school teacher and would be willing to remain at that point if he had a comfortable home. Mrs. Waite informed me that she will not live in the house another winter. The building should be dismantled and moved to higher ground near the classroom building and placed on a full sized basement with a furnace. In no other way can it be made comfortable for the long cold winters ordinarily experienced in this province. Is there any hope of this being done this year, please?\n\nThe classroom building needs.......\nThe classroom building needs paint and varnish throughout. The interior walls of this building are mostly of beaverboard or some similar material with the exception of approximately 3\u00bd ft. around the base which is of V-Joint wainscoting. This is satisfactory where it has been done but the cloak-room in the back has no V-Joint wainscoting and the beaverboard which runs practically to the floor is in very poor shape evidently through being leaned against and possibly kicked occasionally by the children. It would be possible to correct this with a very small expenditure.\n\nThe main construction of this building is of logs plastered with mortar. Some of the logs have warped and twisted sufficiently to break the mortar. The whole of the building therefore needs re-plastering with mortar on the exterior between the logs. Acting Agent J. Bryce is submitting a requisition for the necessary work on the classroom building.\n\nIf anything can be done to make the residence more comfortable for the winter I would strongly recommend that some action be taken at once otherwise we will probably lose the services of one of our best day school teachers.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, July 26th, 1945.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n414 Federal Building, Regina, Saskatchewan.\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant,\nwith reference to the teacher's residence at the\nMontreal Lake Day School and I discussed the matter\nwith the Director this morning.\n\nIt is noted that you consider the building\nwill have to be dismantled before moving it. Would\nit not be possible to move this building without\ndismantling it as it would involve less expenditure?\n\nAs the season is advancing, the Department\napproves your making arrangements for digging the\nbasement and we will be prepared to purchase the new\nfurnace if you give us specific information as to the\ntype and size of the furnace required.\n\nIt has also been decided to allow you to\neither move or dismantle the building on the\nunderstanding that you will keep the cost as low as\npossible.

It is made of very heavy logs and considerably longer than there is any need for. Because of changing the windows on one side most of the logs on that side are cut in very short lengths and would probably start to fall out if we were successful in getting the building jacked up to move it. On the other side of the building the logs have warped and twisted. These would have to be taken out and replaced in order to straighten up the wall. There is no need for a residence as long as the present one which is 40' long and 30' wide, outside measurement. A house in this country cannot be kept warm in the winter without a full sized basement to keep the floor warm. A full sized basement 30 x 40 ft. is a great deal larger than there is any need for. Nearly one third of the present house is taken up by furnace, cistern, and cupboards which should be, and will be, in the basement.\n\nAs soon as Indians are available for the excavation it will be commenced. Mr. Bryce is going to endeavour to get Adam Ahenakew of the Sandy Lake Band of Indians to perform the work of dismantling and rebuilding the house. He is a good carpenter and will perform the work satisfactorily if we are able to get him. If we are unable to get him we may have difficulty in having the work done before the cold weather sets in.\n\nThe new building will be approximately 30 ft. square with no upstairs. A pipeless furnace is required of 12,000 cubic ft. capacity, and it should be a wood burning furnace. I am enclosing the necessary requisition for this.\n\nI would estimate the total cost of moving this building and rebuilding it on a full-sized concrete basement with a furnace will be in the neighborhood of $1,000.00...........\nhood of $1,000.00. This seems like a large expenditure but it is the only way in which this residence can be made permanently comfortable in the winter. An attempt by any other means would be just a further waste of money.\n\nThe requisition in connection with painting and decorating of the classroom building at that point will be forwarded by Mr. Bryce shortly.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, August 18, 1945.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n414 Federal Building, Regina, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, in connection with moving the teacher's residence at the Montreal Lake School. I have discussed your letter with the Director this morning and you may arrange for moving the building and rebuilding it on a full-size concrete basement, at a cost of approximately $1,000.00.\n\nI am forwarding the requisition for the furnace to the Purchasing Branch. On this requisition you state the price, installed, as $250.00, but you do not state the name and address of the firm from whom you received this quotation, nor whether the amount mentioned covers sales tax. The information just mentioned should always be given when prices are quoted on a requisition.\n\nPhilip Phalan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, No. 107-6-8, in connection with the teacher's residence at Montreal Lake Day School.\n\nSince my visit to the Montreal Lake Day School on the 6th instant Mr. Bryce, the Acting Indian Agent, Carlton Agency, has been making many enquiries in an effort to find someone who would undertake the dismantling and rebuilding of the residence. No one seems to want the work at any price. This is the time of year when there is a great demand for casual labour in the harvest field where more money can be made than at any kind of local work. Adam Ahenakew, the Indian mentioned in my letter of the 10th instant, refuses to have anything to do with this work until after harvest this fall.\n\nIf men were available to hurry the work I would still be in favour of immediately dismantling the building and rebuilding it as suggested in my letter of the 10th instant. As there is now a great deal of doubt about the work being completed before the cold weather sets in I do not think it should be started this fall.\n\nI would also recommend that no further action be taken in connection with the purchase of a new furnace at the present time. From further enquiries which Mr. Bryce has made and which I have made I am now doubtful that it is advisable to try to move the old building at all. If it is found advisable and more economical to build a reasonable sized cottage, of lumber, for the use of the Day School teacher at that point it is quite probable a different type of heating plant would be required, and in any case it seems that no good purpose would be served in buying a furnace until we are certain how we can make out this winter.\n\nIf a possibility arises to rush the work as suggested in my letter of the 10th instant I shall do so and advise the Department.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nOn Mr. Ostrander's last visit he advised me to submit estimates for a new lumber teacherage to be built on a new site at Montreal Lake Reserve. The present house is of log construction. The logs have been so badly cut up with windows and doors, and as the bottom logs are no longer sound it would not be advisable to attempt to move this building, the labour and cost to dismantle and move the old building would go a long way towards the erection of a new lumber building.\n\nAnother difficulty is that we have been unable to get men skilled enough to dismantle and salvage the inside fittings or to undertake the dismantling and erection of a log building and replacement of new logs.\n\nIn the event of a new building being built the old building could be of more value used as a place to teach the boys vocational training, a council hall and community centre, and a place where the local Homemakers Club could gather for their activities.\n\nJ. Bryce,\nActing Indian Agent.\nOttawa, 13th September, 1945.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n414 Federal Building, Regina, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo with reference to the teacher's residence at Montreal Lake Indian Day School and I have also received a letter along similar lines from Acting Indian Agent Bryce.\n\nUnder the circumstances it appears inadvisable to make any attempt to move a building this fall.

However, I discussed the matter with Mr. Hoey yesterday, and we can probably find $1,500.00 or $2,000.00 in the current year's appropriation. Would it be possible to make any improvement to the present residence with this amount of money?

Jones and requisition amounting to $90.50, for heater, stove pipes, and labour for making a hole in the chimney in order to somewhat improve the present teacher's residence for the coming winter.\n\nI would recommend that Mr. Jones' suggestion that lumber up to the amount of $2,000.00 be purchased at once from Messrs. R.D. and K.R. Brooks, who are sawing lumber at the Montreal Lake Reserve near the site of the school, be approved. The lumber presently being sawn is not fit for immediate use as it unseasoned, but if properly piled and left until next summer would then be fit for use. If this suggestion receives the approval of the Department I will ask Mr. Jones to prepare a requisition covering the varieties and quantities of lumber needed for the teacher's residence and which can be supplied by Messrs. Brooks. Most of the lumber required for the new building can be supplied by this firm.\n\nAgain referring to the Department's letter of June 14th, I think it would be a great mistake to spend any appreciable amount of money trying to make the present teacher's residence a habitable home as the money would be practically wasted. The house is very badly planned and built on a muskeg, consequently it is impossible to put a basement below it. The only way in which it can be heated is by the use of several stoves and in that manner it cannot be properly heated. Because it is built on a muskeg the walls are sagging and nothing can be done to prevent this.\n\nJ.P.B.

Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n414 Federal Building, Regina, Saskatchewan.\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to the teacher's residence at the Montreal Lake Indian Day School.\n\nYou may authorize the Indian Agent to purchase the heater and stove pipes at a cost of $77.00. It is noted that the labour for making a hole in the chimney will be $3.50.\n\nYou may also arrange to have the Agent forward us a requisition for the lumber which you state can be secured from R.D. & K.R. Brooks. When forwarding the requisition, the post office address of the firm should be given.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nLeask, Sask.,\nNovember 12, 1946.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina.\n\nFurther to our conversation in Prince Albert re Rev. and Mrs. Waite's house on the Montreal Lake Reserve. I visited Montreal Lake on November 4th last and am of the opinion that the floor joists at the back of the house in question have broken down. The floors and doors in the outer kitchen, the kitchen and dining room are twisted every which way.\n\nIt was decided to tear out the brick furnace arrangement in the outer kitchen to remove weight from the floor. The chimney in the outer kitchen is not built from the floor as is customary, but rests on a five foot block of wood. It would be impossible for anyone to live in the house if this chimney were torn down, however, it is anything but safe. Consequently, if the floors, partitions, etc., move many more feet, the house will definitely have to be vacated which will mean closing down the school.\n\nI will visit Montreal Lake again as soon as possible. If I do not receive further word from Mr. Waite in the meantime, I will report on my return as to the whereabouts of the house.\n\nSgd. E.S. Jones,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI received a report that the day school teacher's residence at the Montreal Lake Indian Day School had suddenly become unsafe because of the floor sinking. I asked Indian Agent Mr. E.S. Jones to investigate and report to me.\n\nHerewith is a copy of Mr. Jones' report which would indicate that the situation is rather serious.\n\nAs previously reported, this building was very badly constructed and there has been considerable correspondence between this office and the Department in connection with erecting another residence. If the house becomes unfit for habitation this winter it will be necessary for Mr. and Mrs. Waite to move out and there is no other house for them to occupy anywhere in the vicinity. The result will be that the school will have to be closed until another residence can be built.\n\nI am writing to Mr. Jones asking him to endeavour to make the house habitable for the remainder of the winter with the hope that some better arrangement can be made next summer. If it is necessary to close the school I presume we will have to permit Mr. and Mrs. Waite to make use of the class-room building as a home for the winter as they will probably be unable to find any other place in which to live, and I have so advised Mr. Jones.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nOttawa, 27 November 1946.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nREGINA, Sask.\n\nWe have your letter of the 18th instant with reference to the teacher's residence at the Montreal Lake School.\n\nAs you are aware, there has been considerable correspondence about this building for the past two years and previous communications from the Department authorized expenditure with a view to making the residence habitable. For various reasons nothing has been done and no reply has been received to our last communication in regard to this building dated Aug. 15, 1946.\n\nIt is noted that you have written Indian Agent Jones with regard to this building and I would appreciate hearing from you as soon as he has replied. It is hoped that Mr. Jones will act promptly and do everything possible to make the residence comfortable.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI wish to refer to Department letter of the 27th ultimo, File No. 107-6-8 (W.T. 1), in connection with the school teacher's residence at the Montreal Lake Reserve.\n\nI am now in receipt of a letter from the Indian Agent, Mr. E.S. Jones, of the Carlton Agency, informing me that Mr. Waite, the teacher, has not been successful in having the brick furnace arrangement torn out. However, he states that definite arrangements have been made with the Millwright of the Brooks Mill to proceed with this work and also to cut a hole in the wall between the living room and dining room to enable stove pipes to be connected up with the chimney.\n\nI believe that in this regard the house can be made habitable for the remainder of the winter.\n\nI am again reminding Indian Agent Jones that he has not yet submitted requisitions for the lumber from Messrs. R.D. and K.R. Brooks, referred to in Department letter of August 15th last.\n\nJ.P.B.

Hoey, Esq.,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nNo doubt you have had a report on the condition of the interior of the residence at Montreal Lake both from Inspector Ostrander and Indian Agent E.S. Jones. Like me they are worried about it, as to its safety. I am seriously considering getting out, before it collapses with the chimney coming down.\n\nBefore I came here, there was supposed to be a cellar, but it was full of water, and in winter it was a sheet of ice. There was a hole about 8 or 9 feet deep. I saw it before the alterations were made.\n\nWhen the alterations were made, this hole was filled in with logs (some poplar logs), and earth, the floor was laid; then on top of the floor right over this hole a 2 ft. box stove was placed with an oil drum on top through which the smoke passed in one end, out the other into the stove pipes to the chimney, then the stove and drum were cased with bricks. These were taken down the other week to ease the weight off the floor. Then the chimney was built within 3 inches of the cut in the floor. There is a big log about 5 feet long with at least 16 feet of brick chimney resting on this log like this:-\nAbove the ceiling there is 2 feet of shavings for insulation. The floors have sagged like this. You feel you are walking down and then up; none of the inside doors will close properly, some you can put your hand through at the top at one end, the other end is tight, you can put the toe of your boot under the door posts. In places the quarter round has left the floor, at others it is on the floor with the partitions of the room two inches above the quarter round. In one room you can put your hand through and touch the outside logs, where the floor has sagged.\n\nWe have had to put blocks under one end of the kitchen stove so that my wife can cook properly. The dining room table has to be blocked up to keep it level and from running away.\n\nMr. Ostrander and Mr. Jones have suggested putting blocks under the chimney but I doubt if the chimney will stand the pounding and hammering.\n\nI can assure you it is not very pleasant living under such conditions. If I have to get out you will understand the reason.\n\nThere is no living accommodation here. We are going to pack our trunks with clothes and put them in an old building so that we should not lose everything in case the chimney and floors collapse.\n\nI am sorry to worry you about this, but think you should know my side.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) Rev.

To be fair to all parties, this is due in part at least to conditions over which our officials had no control.\n\nHowever, we are again writing to Inspector Ostrander and I enclose a copy of our letter for your information.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Waite\non the subject, I have to say that I visited the Montreal Lake Day School on\nthe 13th ultimo accompanied by Indian Agent Mr. H.S. Jones. We examined the\nhouse and discussed the matter with Mr. and Mrs. Waite.\n\nThe foundation of the chimney has sunk away considerably and I\ngave instructions to have part of the back kitchen removed in order to\nexamine the foundation beneath the chimney with a view to temporarily bracing\nit if it was found necessary. Mr. Jones had already arranged for a man to call\nto do some work on it and my instructions were additional instructions to that\nwhich had been given by Mr. Jones. I had heard nothing more and assumed that as\nthe result of the work having been performed the chimney had been temporarily\nmade safe for the remainder of the winter. This seemed to satisfy Mr. and Mrs.\nWaite.\n\nAny such work performed on the chimney or any other part of the\nhouse is only a temporary measure for the remainder of the winter.\n\nIn conversation with Mr. Jones over the telephone today he informed\nme that the foundation of the chimney has further given way with the result that\na fire was started in the roof of the house but that it was kept under control and\nno serious damage resulted.\n\nMr. Jones is going to Montreal Lake at once to enquire further into\nthe matter and advise me.\n\nI am returning herewith Mr. Waite's letter which is practically\nin accordance with the facts with the exception of that part of his letter which\nstates:\n\n\"Mr. Ostrander and Mr. Jones have suggested putting blocks\nunder the chimney but I doubt if the chimney will stand\nthe pounding and hammering.\"\n\nMy instructions were that if it was found practical to do so when the wall was\nremoved and the base of the chimney examined wedges should be inserted in the\nbase of the chimney to prevent it sinking further. This would not require any\n\"pounding and hammering\" that would be likely to further endanger the chimney\nbut would temporarily prevent the chimney sinking further and should have been done.\nI assume from Mr. Waite's letter that he later decided against this action which\nwas the reason why it was not done.\n\nThe only suitable quarters available in the vicinity other than the\nteacher's residence would be in the day school and that is practical only if the\nschool is closed for the remainder of the winter. Naturally Mr. Waite does not wish\nto have to do this if it can be prevented because his salary would stop.\n\nI wish to assure the Department that Mr. Jones and the writer have\ngiven every possible attention to the situation at the Montreal Lake School residence\nand there is nothing further which can be done until spring other than to have\n\nMr. and Mrs. Waite move into the......\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am having the chimney taken down.\n\nThis is what happened. About two o'clock on Saturday afternoon the chimney caught fire. I knew what it was directly. I went for help and Mrs. Waite got pails of water ready. Some one rang the school bell and in less than five minutes I had 4 or 5 men and they soon got the fire out. It burnt all round the chimney, fortunately there was no wind, plenty of snow on the roof, and daylight.\n\nThe cause of the fire was this. In October I had the chimney swept down. Apparently the chimney was O.K. but the chimney went down further. The ridge boards were wedged tightly against the chimney, for at the chimney the roof has sagged a bit. Then when the rest of the chimney went down the piece out of the roof did not go, the result the break. The man handed me down one of the bricks, no mortar, all on it. You can move the top part of the chimney with your hand. There were no braces to the other. I think the break had been there some time with the result that the cold air coming in at the break caused the soot to collect. The men moved the cook stove and medicine into the living room. Today I closed school at noon and helped my wife straighten up.\n\nI hope to get the rest of the water out of the big tank tomorrow to save it from freezing. We have moved our perishable things in to the front room, which we can keep warm. I don't know how the other part of the house will be on very cold nights. We have filled in the holes between the kitchen and other room.\n\nI guess we will manage.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. G.J. Waite.\n\nWhere the break in the chimney is, you can lift off the bricks. I think a tin cowl should be obtained for the other chimney. It is a big chimney and the wind blows down it so much that it makes the stove pipes very dirty so soon. They need cleaning about every three weeks.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith further reference to Department letter of the 7th instant, File No. 107-6-8 (W.T. 1), and my reply dated the 13th instant, in connection with the condition of the day school teacher's residence at Montreal Lake, I am enclosing herewith copy of a letter received from Reverend G.J. Waite through Mr. E.S. Jones, Indian Agent, giving a report of the damage which resulted from the fire referred to in my letter. Apparently no serious damage was done. The unsafe chimney has now been dismantled and arrangements made to close up the back part of the house. Mr. and Mrs. Waite will live in the front of the house for the remainder of the winter and it is hoped that a new house will be built in the coming summer.\n\nJ.P.B.

We are still struggling too much every day and are tired by nightfall. We had a month's holiday in July last. We drove to Winnipeg via Prince Albert, Saskatoon & Brandon. Joe & Ruth had their holiday & came to Winnipeg from Quebec to spend 10 days with us. It was nice to be with them.\n\nI tried to get a move last year & come east, we felt we would like to be a little nearer to Joe & Ruth, especially as we are now grandparents. I tried the division of Quebec but Bishop Cameron said due to having a different pension system he could take no one over 46, so that was that. I wrote to your Bishop. He said he had a few vacant parishes which entailed a good deal of travelling, and were more fitted for a younger man. If some people could see the house we put in they would wonder how we kept going. The work seems heavier than ever. Yesterday I had my two services all in Cree - Holy communion in the morning with 104 in the congregation, evening prayer & 3 baptisms. In the afternoon with a congregation of 72 at the week I teach school. I have 58 children on the roll. This includes 9 extra ones who had to return home from Lac La Ronge (about 90 miles north) when the residential school burned to the ground about a month ago. Fortunately the fire was in daytime & all the children got out safely. I have to divide my school. I have about 30 older ones in the morning & the younger ones in the afternoon. I have 30 in grade 1. The Bishop sent me an assistant - a young Indian whom we fixed up in a small house near ours. He had finished college & would have been ordained but he left 3 weeks ago to go to a sanatorium for J.B. We live in the teacher's house. It is not an old house, but is so badly built & in such a poor place that is utterly to pieces. The Indian Dept inspector condemned it two years ago & promised to build a new house last year - but it was not done. When we came back from our holiday, we noticed the floors were beginning to sink, but nothing was done.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Before we came, they had put in a new chimney (which added considerable weight on the floor) plus a 700 gallon soft water tank. About weeks ago this chimney caught fire & set the roof on fire. Fortunately, it was daytime & no wind & we soon put it out. We found there was a break in the chimney of about 6\" & we covered it with bricks. The result - we cannot live in half the house. We had another chimney at the other end of the house, for an open fireplace, so we use that. They will have to build a new house this year. The Bishop showed me a letter the other day, in which he told Ottawa we were living under the most deplorable conditions. It is very hard on Nelly. We have to work up the kitchen stove to make it level & the dining room table sometimes slides to the bottom. The Bishop comes up once in a while with the Indian Dept doctor.\n\nWe have had steady cold weather all winter with the lowest temperature being 50 below zero. Yesterday morning it was 20 below & no sign of a thaw all winter with so much wind.\n\nYes, you are right. There is no recognition for our kind of person. You just go on day after day.\n\nI had to go to the doctor last week, my legs were bothering me, as the veins are bad. He told me to keep off my feet as much as possible. Some chance of doing that here.\n\nWe have to go 80 miles to see a doctor. Of course the Indian Dept doctor will do anything for us, but he is not in private practice.\n\nI don't go to a doctor very often - the last time I went was 12 years ago, & the doctor was away. I went to Nelly's doctor this time.\n\nShe worked it so nicely about my going. In a letter to the Bishop, I told him I was very tired & my legs were bad. The next Monday he came with the Indian Dept doctor. When they arrived I was at school & so between Nelly, the Bishop & the doctor it was all arranged that I go back with them in the car. They came up to the school, & told me to get busy & come. I came back in the mail truck.\n\nThe Indians have sold their lumber & now there is about a million feet of lumber to ship out.\n\nYour affectionately,\n\nGilbert & Nelly.\n\nIndian Affairs.

J. Hazelgrove  \n17 Lakeview Terrace  \nOttawa, Ontario\n\nMarch 24th, 1947\n\nDear Mr. Percy,\n\nEnclosed please find a copy of a letter I received from the Rev. Gilbert Watts of Montreal, Quebec, with the more personal parts deleted.\n\nMy connection & interest in this matter is the fact that Gilbert's brother Arthur married my sister.\n\nFeeling that something should be done, I showed this letter to Bishop Jefferson. He definitely thought so too, & sent me to Dr. Alderwood, who in turn sent me to Colonel B.F. Nearly. In place of the latter, I spoke to Mr. Phelan, who, in his turn referred me to you.\n\nI know & like Gilbert & his wife Kelly & know them both to be conscientious & earnest in their work. I was rather...\nappealed to learn of what conditions are like in Montreal Lake. I would imagine that a clergyman able to preach & teach in Cree would be hard to replace & for that reason alone, should be shown consideration about living conditions. Some years ago when they were stationed at John Smith's reserve, Mrs Waite told me that the government used to allow her $40 a month for her nurses work among the Indians, but for some reason, it was cut off. She kept up the work at her own expense.\n\nBy this letter just received, it would seem that they are a long way from a doctor, & Mrs Waite's services as a nurse is surely worth considering & necessary expenses for medicines supplied.\n\nIf you feel it is beyond your province to expedite the carrying out of necessary requirements, at\nMontreal Lake, do you think I could interest outsiders by having this copy of Gilbert's letter printed in \"The Churchman\"?\n\nIt would have a far reaching influence by so doing.\n\nI would not do so without your permission, or unless you tell me you can do nothing in a hurry. Needless to say, Gilbert does not yet know of my activities on his behalf.\n\nWould you be kind enough to let me know what is doing?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDora Haggstrom.\nOttawa, March 25th, 1947.\n\nDear Mrs. Hazelgrove:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant enclosing copy of a letter which you received from Reverend G. Waite of Montreal Lake.\n\nWe have been aware of the condition of the teacher's residence at this reserve for some time past but owing to the difficulties of securing material and labour, have not been able to make the required repairs.\n\nWe have been in communication on several occasions with the Inspector of Indian Agencies for Saskatchewan and also with the local Indian Agent. Both of them are as anxious as we are to provide suitable living quarters for Mr. Waite who has given us very faithful service.\n\nWe expect to remedy the condition during the coming summer.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDirector\n\nMrs. A.J.

MacKenzie, of that firm, on the 17th instant.\n\nThe building referred to as \"Montreal Lake Day School\" is for a two-bedroom teacherage, Plan No. 251 RB, fully insulated with extra Rock Wool insulation in the attic for which is added $28.00, making a total of $3078.00 F.O.B. Winnipeg. We have to add to this: Trucking $364.00; Special Saskatchewan Truck Permit, $5.95; Erector's Expenses, plus basement and furnace. I imagine that these will add perhaps $700.00 to the price, or probably we will have a completed building according to this plan at about $4200.00\n\nThe other quotation, referred to as \"Victoire\" - 13 miles north of Kamsack, is an error. I was discussing with Mr. MacKenzie's Farming Instructor's residence at Victoire (Big River Reserve, Carlton Agency), and one on the Keeseekoose Reserve of the Pelly Agency, 13 miles north of Kamsack. However, it appears that he has based his quotation on shipment by truck from Winnipeg to Kamsack. With this in mind, it will be seen that the cost of the Farming Instructor's residence under Plan No. 255L, a three-bedroom storey-and-a-half house, with full Rock Wool insulation, is F.O.B. Winnipeg $3946-20 Freight to Kamsack, $226.70 Special Saskatchewan Truck Permit, $5.55, plus Erector's Expenses, travelling, etc., allowing an additional estimated $1200.00 for basement and furnace, would mean that the cost of this building would be approximately $5500.00.\n\nIn my letter No. 780-300-4A, of yesterday's date, I advised the Department that it is impossible to get Mr. Lidfors to do any work for us this year. I would therefore recommend that an order be placed with the North American Building Limited for immediate erection of Montreal Lake Day School Teacherage, House Plan No. (251 RB) delivery by truck to Montreal Lake, and Farming Instructor's residence, House Plan No. (255L), delivered at the Keeseekoose Reserve of the Pelly Agency, Kamsack, Saskatchewan, by truck.\n\nIt must be understood, of course, that if the Department decides to carry this out it will be necessary to advise me in order that arrangements can be made for the excavation and the concrete work to be completed before any action is taken to deliver the remainder of the materials. Sills and bolts have to be supplied by the North American Buildings Limited, together with instructions for proper completion of the basement walls. If these two buildings are to be erected as more or less of an experiment I would like to have them completed at the earliest possible date before deciding what shall be done about the remainder of the buildings authorized for this year. I may say that Mr. MacKenzie told me in conversation that, so far as he is aware, at the present time\n\n........over\neither of these buildings, or both, can be completed within thirty days of the receipt of order for delivery.\n\nJ.P.B.

We are advised by the North American Building Company that this 27' x 25' basement put on a 9\" x 7'6\" wall with a 30\" x 10\" footing and a 4\" floor will take 36 cu. yds. of concrete with 144 bags of cement in a six to one mix.\n\nYou will note on the right side of the plan, diagrams of the anchor bolt setting in the 2\" x 6\" sill. The bolts are placed approximately 6' apart, 3\u00bd\" from the outside edge of the basement wall.

I do hope you will not consider me unduly importunate, but I am deeply concerned regarding our Indian work, hence my letters.\n\nAs you know, for some two years past a house has been promised for Mr. Waite, the day school teacher at Montreal Lake, and we have been informed from time to time that a house would be built. Your Mr. Clark can give you full particulars of the deplorable condition of the present teacher's residence. This year I was greatly pleased when heard that this new residence would be definitely built this summer. Two weeks ago I was at Montreal Lake and was greatly disturbed to see that the house was not yet built, although the cement foundation had been laid. Upon inquiry, I was informed that building operations would definitely commence on October 1st, and that a pre-fabricated house would soon be erected. Mr. Waite has just been in to see me, and I very much regret to inform you that nothing has been done. The present residence is unsafe and impossible of occupation for the coming winter, and I do hope that you will take the necessary steps to see that action is taken in this matter.\n\nI do hate to bother you with these matters, but apparently it is my only means of securing definite action. The need of this teacher's residence is most imperative.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is just one day after the beginning of the new fiscal year when the funds for the construction of this teacherage became available.\n\nThe fact that there has been this long delay is due to the difficulties which have been encountered in putting in foundations and in arranging for delivery of the building from the North American Builders Limited in Winnipeg. However, we are writing to our Inspector of Indian Agencies in Winnipeg, requesting that he contact the Company and try to expedite the delivery date.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRt. Rev.

I would ask you to communicate with the Agent, Mr. Rowland of Battleford, and submit to the Department a report showing in detail the accommodation that you consider necessary. You have seen some of the buildings that have been erected by the Department on the John and James Smiths Reserves. If this building at Red Pheasants is to be erected near the site of the present one, which was only put up a few years ago, it may not be necessary to provide other accommodation for the dining-room and store-room, as the present school-room can be utilized to some purpose. In regard to the class-room you should state definitely the number of children for whom provision should be made. I shall be pleased if you will at once see Mr. Rowland so that he may report in full to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon J. A. MacKay,\nBattleford, Sask.\nOttawa, February 19, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has under contemplation the erection of a teacher's residence and day school building on the Red Pheasant's Reserve. Ven. Archdeacon MacKay of Battleford is being written to and asked to communicate with you so that a full report can be made to the Department in the matter. Archdeacon MacKay is familiar with the line followed by the Department in reference to what is known as improved day schools and will be able to give you full information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. Rowland, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nOttawa, February 27, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of the 19th instant in reference to the erection of a teacher's residence and school-house on the Red Pheasant's Reserve I have to inform you that the Department desires to have these buildings located on the reserve and not on that portion of land which is owned by the Church Missionary Society and which is within the boundaries of the reserve. I am enclosing herewith a blue print of the plan of the reserve and I would ask you to consult Ven. Archdeacon MacKay, select a site and indicate the position on this print. There should be sufficient land with suitable soil for a garden and for ample play grounds.\n\nKindly give this matter early attention as it is proposed to proceed with the work as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. Rowland, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nFeb. 29th 1912\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 117054/1 of the 19th inst., and in reply to state that I shall confer with the Agent, Mr. Rowland, as soon as I return to Battleford, and submit to the Department as full a report as I can, but, in the meantime, I would say that if it is decided to erect the buildings for the improved day school on Red Pheasant's Reserve, near the site of the present one, the school might be utilized, as you suggest, for the dining-room and store-room. In regard to the classroom, I think provision should be made for at least forty children, that is if the Department decides to combine the two schools.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nand to provide conveyance for the children of\nthe Stony Reserve to the Red Pheasant School.\n\nSo far as I know, the buildings on the\nJohn and James Smith's Reserves are satis-\nfactory, but, as I am on my way now to\nvisit James Smith's Reserve, I shall look\nthrough the building there very carefully, and\nsubmit any suggestions that may occur\nto me.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to\nthe agent Rowland.\n\nI am, sir,\n\nYours obediently,\nJ.A. Mackay\nOttawa, March 8, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department contemplates the erection on the Red Pheasants Reserve during the coming summer of a new day school and teacher's residence.\n\nIn connection with the school it has been suggested that it should be made large enough to accommodate the children now attending the Stony School and some arrangement for their conveyance to and from the school made. The Stony School for many months past has been a failure in so far as attendance is concerned and the Department is inclined to look with favour on this suggestion, but it would like to have a report from you. There might be a question as to whether the Stony Indians would be willing to send their children to a school attended by Crees. I would like to know how far they would have to be driven, provided you have this information at hand.\n\nKindly let me have a reply by return mail, giving your views on the question of amalgamating the schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. J. Chisholm, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to say, with reference to your communication upon the subject of the proposed school house and Teacher's residence: I have as yet been unable to interview the Ven. Archdeacon Mackay, on account of him being absent in Prince Albert - I have however received a letter from Archdeacon Mackay; and expect that he will be here very shortly, when we will go over the ground, and discuss the subject of the most favourable site for the buildings: I will then advise you of the location, mark it on the Blue Print, and forward on to you.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D. McLEAN ESQ'RE.\n\nASSISTANT DEPUTY AND SECRETARY,\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nOTTAWA.\nBattleford, Sask.\nMarch 15th 1912\n\nWith reference to your letter No. 117054/1 of the 19th ult., and my reply of the 29th ult., I beg to say that, while on my visit to James Smith's Reserve, I looked through the building erected for the teacher and consider the plan all that could be desired for a teacher's residence but the arrangement of the kitchen and dining room for the pupils, being all in one, and that not a very large room, might I think be improved. If, however, in building on Red Pheasant's Reserve, the present schoolroom is utilized for a dining room, this objection would be removed. But, I consider the arrangement of the house on John Smith's Reserve, where the kitchen and dining room are in the same building but in separate rooms, is much better.\n\nI am sorry to say that Mr. Rowland, the Indian agent, is absent at the present time, and, as my duties necessitate my leaving Battleford again before he returns, I shall not be able to confer with him on the matter. I have however asked Rev. E.

(RG 10, Volume 6291, file 618-1, part 1)\nNORTH SASKATCHEWAN INSPECTORATE,\nBattleford, March 21st, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th inst., No. 117054/1, with reference to the proposed amalgamation of the Red Pheasant and Stony day schools in this agency.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that I have just returned from a tour of these reserves, in the course of which I visited the schools, and discussed school matters with the Stony band and with individuals of Red Pheasant's band.\n\nThe Red Pheasant school as at present conducted is a signal failure. There are 12 children of school age on the reserve, besides 15 of day school age in attendance at the Battleford industrial school and 2 at the Duck Lake boarding school.\n\nThere were only 4 pupils present on the day of my visit, which is about the average for the past year.\n\nThere are 13 children of school age in the Stony band; and there were 8 present at the time of my visit.\n\nThe Crees have absolutely no objection to the amalgamation of the schools; and would appreciate the services of a properly qualified teacher, and the other advantages of an improved day school. I have good reason to believe that under such conditions a much better attendance would be had, even without conveying the children.\n\nI had discussed the question of an amalgamation of these schools with the late Indian Agent and with Archdeacon McKay some time ago; and the Indians having heard\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nof the suggestion had been discussing it among themselves. I found the Stonies to be of one mind on the subject, and quite agreeable to their children attending a day school along with the children of Red Pheasant's. They had, however, the impression that such a school would be located somewhere near the line dividing the two reserves, there being a favourable site on the Red Pheasant's side of the line, which would be central and acceptable to both bands. But they did not express themselves as opposed to the location of the new school on a site adjoining the site of the present school if it should be deemed advisable to build there, on condition that a comfortable conveyance should be provided for the children.\n\nI have considered the question for some time past, and have no doubt as to the advisability of amalgamating these schools; and believe that the amalgamated school can be made a success both as to attendance and results.\n\nAs to the site I should not like to express myself too positively until I have a further opportunity after the snow has gone to examine different possible sites and to have tests made for water; but I think it very likely that a better site than the present one can be selected; and accordingly the present building need not be taken into consideration. It would answer for dining-room in case the school were near by; but is is not a valuable building, and if discarded it could be given to a destitute family for a dwelling.\n\nThough the figures above given would indicate that the school population of the two reserves, in case of the closing of the industrial school, would be 40 children, yet for a few years to come it is unlikely that a larger attendance than about 30 could be secured, as several of those included in the 40 now enumerated are 14 or 15 years of age and would not likely attend. A building for 30 or 35 pupils\nwould answer the requirements; for in case of any material increase in the school population an additional teacher and a separate class-room would be required.\n\nThe question of conveying the Stony children will not be affected by the selection of the site. Moreover, I think it likely the Cree children will also have to be conveyed, if the best results are to be obtained, no matter which site is selected.\n\nA few of the Crees asked that boarding accommodation be provided in connection with the teacher's dwelling, as has been done elsewhere; but unless the Department has decided to adopt this plan uniformly I would not recommend it.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, March 28, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant reporting upon the amalgamation of the Red Pheasants and Stony day schools in the Battleford Agency.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your remarks have been noted. The Department would like to have definite information with regard to the site and size of the buildings that will be necessary at the earliest possible date. It is probable that new plans will have to be prepared for at least the school and this work will take up some time. The closing of the Battleford Industrial School at an early date is under consideration and in the event of definite action being taken educational facilities should be provided on the Red Pheasants Reserve for the children who will leave the industrial school and return to their homes. The Department purposed using the plan of the new school building on the James Smiths Reserve, but this would not be large enough if the two schools above referred to are amalgamated.\n\nWith regard to the teacher's residence Venerable Archdeacon MacKay considers that the building on the James Smiths Reserve would not be large enough in so far as dining-room and kitchen accommodation is concerned, if this amalgamation takes place. The Department would like to have your opinion.\n\nW. J. Chisholm, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nopinion with regard to these matters. Archdeacon MacKay suggests that the plan for the John Smiths residence be followed in this case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNo. 105\nALSO\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER.\n\nReference your Letter No II7054/I February 27th 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to say that, in company with The Revd Mr Matheson who was deputed by Archdeacon McKay to fill his unavoidable absence, we went to Red Pheasant Reserve for the purpose of selecting a site for the Day School; the snow was too deep for us to locate a suitable place; so in the course of another week or ten days we are going back again to complete this work; and will then immediately advise you.\n\nYours obediently\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D. McLEAN ESQ'RE.\nASSISTANT DEPUTY AND SECRETARY,\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOTTAWA.\nReferring to your letter of the 28th ult., relative to the new day school and teacher's dwelling which it is proposed to erect on Red Pheasant's reserve during the coming summer, I have the honour to report further as follows:\n\nIt appears to me that there is little room for doubt as to the advisability of amalgamating the Red Pheasant and Stony schools, as the amalgamation should contribute in some measure both to the saving of expenditure and to the efficiency of the work. It is true the Stony children would have to be conveyed to and from school, which would involve an increase of expenditure; but in most other respects there would be a saving effected through the union of the schools; and for the outlay involved in the conveying of the children there would be a return in a better and more uniform attendance. As all who have had this question before their attention since it was first raised are of one mind as to the advantages of the amalgamation of the schools, I shall assume that the suggestion has received, or will receive, the approval of the Department, in order to be able to proceed on this basis to a consideration of the size and site of the proposed buildings.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nWhile the actual school population of the two bands, in the event of the closing of the Battleford school, as shown in my letter of the 21st ult. will be 40 pupils, yet as it is practically certain that most of those approaching the age limit of 15 years will not attend, it would be safe to figure upon an attendance of 30 as a maximum; it will rarely be larger and generally in all probability considerably smaller. Of course, much depends upon the interest and enthusiasm of the teacher who may be placed in charge, and the support he receives. Under present conditions he will be assured of sympathy and support in his efforts from the agent and the farmer, both of whom are intelligent men and concerned about the progress of the Indians in educational and other respects. In case both these bands continue to occupy these reserves, concerning which they appear quite settled at the present time, the school population is liable to vary, and very likely to increase within the next few years; but there should not be more than 30 pupils to one teacher in any of our Indian schools; and in the event of the actual attendance becoming materially increased the best way to meet the circumstances would be to provide an additional class-room and a second teacher.\n\nThe new school on James Smith's reserve affords space and accommodation for a maximum of 24 pupils; but the school-room is not well proportioned, being too narrow in proportion to its length, a condition which along with other disadvantages renders the blackboard space on the right of the pupils less valuable than it otherwise would be. To adapt this building to the circumstances now under consideration, that is, to the requirements of an attendance of 30 pupils, I would suggest that the width of the building be increased from 17 to 21 feet, or better to 21' 6\", and that the height of the ceiling be made 12 ft. instead of 11 ft. These changes will afford the necessary air space and floor space according to the Department's regulations, and will make a well proportioned school room.\nWith regard to the site for the proposed new buildings, I may say that at the time of my last visit to these reserves there was still too much snow on the ground to admit of our leaving the beaten trail for the purpose of making a minute examination of the surface, elevation, drainage, etc., of different possible sites. The site of the present school on Red Pheasant's reserve is clear, well drained, and favourable from a sanitary point of view, and has the advantage of being on the shore of a small lake of good water. But it is not quite central even for Red Pheasant's band; and would be less central for the two bands. All the Stony children would have to be conveyed to and from a school so situated, five miles each way; and to secure a full attendance of the Cree children it is probable some of those to the south-east would also have to be conveyed. The present site is convenient to the Church of England mission, which might have some advantages. It is also convenient to the farm buildings, which, however, are to be rebuilt presently and possibly not on the same site.\n\nThe locality referred to in my letter of the 21st ult., as that on which the Indians had set their minds offers many advantages; and now that the season is favourable for the purpose tests should be made for water there, a question which should be settled before a change of location is decided upon. The determination of the exact location of the buildings need occasion no delay in the alteration of the plans or the letting of the contract, so far as I can judge, as there is nothing in this that can affect the calculations of any contractor in figuring out a tender. If good water is to be had I think the location last referred to, which is near the line between the two reserves, affords the greatest advantages; and I could make an opportunity to go over the ground carefully with the Agent and select a suitable site if the Department should approve of this suggestion.\nWith regard to the teacher's residence, it is my opinion that the building on John Smith's reserve is suited as to both plan and dimensions to the requirements of the proposed amalgamated school hereunder consideration. The attendance of pupils may be expected to be as large, as the school population is considerably larger; and it is probable the teacher and his family will require accommodation similar to that afforded in the dwelling at John Smith's.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nNORTH SASKATCHEWAN INSPECTORATE,\nBattleford, February 24th, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter No. 117054, of the 15th June last, I have the honour to state that I prepared a form of agreement for the signature of the Indians of the Red Pheasant and Stony bands and forwarded it to Mr. Agent Rowland, requesting that he obtain, if possible, the signatures of the Indians at the time of the treaty payments. Those of the Red Pheasant Indians were secured with little difficulty, but the Stonies refused to commit themselves, although they had previously expressed themselves to Archdeacon McKay and myself as well satisfied with the arrangement and the selection of a site.\n\nAs it was important that the matter should be settled without further delay, I visited the reserves last week, accompanied by the Agent, and in connection with a regular inspection of the reserves took an opportunity to meet the Stonies together and to go into the matter fully again. They gave their signatures cheerfully and no serious objection, the man with the largest number of children of school age coming forward voluntarily and giving his consent. I now beg to transmit a copy of the agreement, signed and duly witnessed.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. A. Rowland, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nSir,\n\nThey respectfully draw your kind attention to the need of taking immediate steps to make the improved day school on Red Pheasant's Reserve a success. The school buildings are completed, a capable teacher has been appointed, and all that is needed now is the attendance of the pupils. The school, as you are no doubt aware, is situated on the Red Pheasant Reserve but near the line between that and the Stony Reserve, and is\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nintended for the children of both Reserves, thus doing away with the need of two schools. It is hopeless to expect a satisfactory attendance unless the children are conveyed to school. The distance is too great for them to walk, especially in winter, and considering too that most of them are poorly clad. The risk to health and safety would be too great to justify anyone in urging the children to walk to school, except in a very few cases.\n\nIt seems a great pity that after the Department has gone to the expense of putting up first class buildings and employing a competent teacher at a good salary, that the school should not make\na good start.\n\nThere is also the consideration that\nthe Department contemplates closing the\nBattleford Industrial school before\nvery long, and, as most of the children\nremaining in that Institution at the\npresent time belong to Red O'Rearant's\nReserve, it is essential that the Red\nO'Rearant's school should be in suc-\ncessful operation before the Battleford\nschool is closed.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ. A. Mackay\nOttawa, February 17, 1915\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the closing of the Battleford Industrial School I beg to advise you that the Right Rev. J. A. Newnham, Bishop of Saskatchewan, has been informed that the Department wishes this school to be closed on March 31st, the end of the current quarter. I have, therefore, to request that you will make the necessary arrangements for the return of the pupils then in residence to their homes.\n\nAs most of these children come from the Red Pheasants and Stony Reserves they should attend the improved day school on the Red Pheasants Reserve after the closing of the Battleford School. The Department would like you to make arrangements for the transport of the pupils who should attend this school during the winter months at least.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAast.

MacKay,\nBattleford, Sask.\nReferring to the last paragraph of your letter of the 17th ult., dealing with the closing of the Battleford Industrial School, I have the honour to state that yesterday in company with Mr. Agent Rowland I visited the Red Pheasant day school for the purpose of arranging for the transport of the children of the two bands to and from school daily. We engaged Thos. Wuttannee, of the Red Pheasant band, who is to provide team, harness and conveyance, bring the children to school and take them home, for $1.50 per day. He has no suitable team at present, but has been able to hire one temporarily; and the Agent will submit to the Department an application for the purchase of a suitable team for this man, the price of the same to be refunded out of his earnings.\n\nWe also engaged Sheenasappa, a Stony, and a man of somewhat advanced years, who has been bringing a few of the children of his band occasionally, (but not all of them nor very regularly), to bring all the Stony children of school age, every day, and take them home, at the rate of $1 per day.\n\nThe rates arranged in the two instances are proportionate to the work involved, as nearly as can be estimated; and in case the arrangement is justified by the results attained I would recommend that it be continued both summer and winter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, March 13, 1914.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant with reference to the transport of children to and from the Red Pheasants School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of the arrangement made by you for the transport of these children, which may remain in force until the end of the school year, the 30th of June, next. The question of its continuance will be dependent upon the results obtained and the Department would like to have monthly reports as to how this arrangement is working out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I shall be pleased if you will state whether Mr. Marshall is to be paid for this service or not and, if so, what remuneration he should receive.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Marshall is doing very good work, giving extra classes as a night school, etc. Mrs. Brown is doing most valuable work (she is our employee) visiting the Indians on both reserves, whole and sick, daily and all day long, looking after their morals and spiritual welfare as well as their health and comfort. She has her own horse and drives round among them from end to end. Agent, Instructor and Teacher are loud in their praises of her. Mrs. Marshall has a baby and cannot do very much among them. Of course we pay Mrs. Brown, a pittance. If the Indian Department could in some way recompense her splendid work I should be glad.\n\n(Sgd.) J.A. Saskatchewan.\nOttawa, June 10, 1914.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nIn reply to that portion of Your Lordship's letter of the 18th ultimo in which Your Lordship refers to the good work being done on the Red Pheasants Reserve by Mrs. Brown and suggests that she be reimbursed in some way I beg to say that the Department lately allowed Mrs. Brown the use of the old school-house on the reserve free of charge. If, as Your Lordship says, Mrs. Marshall is at present unable to take charge of her work as field matron some arrangement might be made between Mrs. Marshall and Mrs. Brown as to the sharing of the salary now paid Mrs. Marshall for this work. The Department is not prepared to pay both these ladies for virtually the same services.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst.

Marshall the teacher at the Red Pheasant and Stoney School, and myself have decided to keep this school opened until the Annuity payments are made, which will be about July 15th. Our reasons for doing this are that the Indians are away to their hay camps long after school is reopened after the mid-summer holidays, and most of the pupils are absent until well on in October.\n\nHoping that this will meet with your approval, I Remain\n\nYours Obediently,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ.

If you will prepare another return on the regular quarterly return forms showing the names of the pupils in attendance, the number of nights the school was open and the number of hours you taught this school each night the Department will allow you the same rate of payment as other teachers who have been conducting similar schools, viz.\u2014fifty cents per hour. You should forward this return as soon as possible when payment of the amount due you for this service will be made.\n\nYou should not have undertaken this work without proper arrangements having been made regarding it and the sanction of the Department having first been obtained.

You should state definitely whether in your opinion as viewed from the results achieved you would recommend its continuance.\n\nA return has been received from Mr. Marshall, the teacher, showing that this school was open fifty nights for two hours per night during the period from January 6th to June 29th, last, and according to the agreement made with Mr. Marshall he is being paid at the rate of fifty cents per hour for this service and a cheque for $50.00, being the amount due therefor, is being sent to him in your care.\n\nKindly report on the above matter as soon as convenient.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.

Although I have not personally visited the school, yet I have heard a lot of favourable comment from the Indians attending it. It has been the means of keeping the young Indians away from dancing and other useless amusements, and is helping them to get a better knowledge of English, and through this a better chance to look after their interests.\n\nThe small extra cost to the Department will be more than made up by the benefits derived by the Indians.

It should be in operation two nights per week for two hours per night and for this service the Department will pay Mr. Marshall at the rate of 50 cents per hour.

He is now in receipt of $500.00 a year and his wife, who is matron, is paid $300.00. They are conducting an improved day school and from the reports from the Agent and the late Inspector, Mr. Chisholm, they are doing excellent work and meeting with marked success. When Mr. Marshall took charge of this school in December, 1913, the average attendance was only four. The average for the past four quarters has been 23 out of an enrolment of 28. Mr. Marshall is the holder of provincial qualifications and has had several years experience in public school work and taught for two years at the Battleford Industrial School.

Original on 117054/7.\n\nI have to report what I consider is an irregularity on the part of Rev. Fr. Lacombe, the R.C. Missionary. On the 20th instant, Geo. and Hoskin Thomas and Isaiah Benson were absent, and when asked by the teacher the reason, they informed her that the Rev. Fr. Lacombe had them at his house for religious instruction. I consider that Rev. Lacombe should not take these children away from school for this or any other purpose, but his action in this respect is on a par with some of his previous performances, and of which the Department have had notice.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that Mr. J. M. Marshall, who returned from Active Service overseas with the C.E.F., about a month ago, has again taken over his duties as Teacher at the Red Pheasant School.\n\nMrs. Marshall, who has been acting in that capacity during the absence of her husband, automatically resumes her former position as Field Matron of the Red Pheasant and Stony Reserves.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 13th March, 1919.\n\nSir:-\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 6th instant, I beg to say that the Department has noted the report therein with regard to arrangements on behalf of field matron work at Red Pheasant's and Stony Reserves.

Howland, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nTheo Wattunee of Sweet Grass has made application for an increase of .50\u00a2 per day for driving the children to and from school on this reserve. He has been paid at the rate of $1.50 per day and for the time it takes him, his request seems reasonable and I would recommend that the increase be granted him.\n\nHe had his resignation in with Mr. Rewland for March 31st in the event of his request not being allowed and it would be a difficult matter at present to replace him.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMr. Agent Macdonald writes that Thos. Wattunee, one of the drivers for the Red Pheasants School, has made application for an increase of 50 cents a day. He is now paid at the rate of $1.50 and the Department is also paying another driver for bringing the Stoney children to the school at the rate of $1.00 a day.\n\nThe driving of these children is costing the Department about $500.00 per annum. If Wattunee's wages are increased, the other driver will likely ask for an increase also, which, if granted, would bring the cost of transport up to about $700.00 a year.\n\nThe average attendance for the past two years has only been thirteen and the highest enrolment thirty-one. The teacher, in his last annual report, states that all the children live within three miles of the school and that the average distance of the pupils' homes from the school is only two miles.\n\nThe driving of the pupils to school in the Carlton Agency was discontinued sometime ago, without there being any appreciable difference in the average attendance.\n\nIf Wattunee is not willing to continue for $1.50 a day I would be inclined to accept his resignation, which Mr. Macdonald says he handed to Mr. Rowland. The children should be able to get to school during the spring and summer, even if they have to walk.\n\nMartin Buxton.\nOttawa, April 16, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th ultimo, requesting that Thomas Wattunee be granted an increase of 50\u00a2 per day for driving the children to and from the Red Pheasant Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will allow this man the increase asked for and he will be paid at the rate of $2.00 per day for each day he does this work. This increased rate will date from the 1st instant. You will be good enough to forward properly certified vouchers covering the payment due Mr. Wattunee for his services at the end of each month.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nS.

On January 13th, there were no children present, both Stony and Red Pheasant drivers failed to collect them.\"\n\nIt would appear from this that the drivers are not performing their work satisfactorily.

M. Marshall,\nTeacher.\nMemo. as to vacant schools in Saskatchewan.\n\n2. Thunder Child's reserve has been demanding a school for years. 3. Red Pheasant's School will be vacant after June 30th; teacher leaving. Before I can secure a teacher I ought to know (1) what salary for a teacher with Normal School Certificate? (2) If married couple go there, is there any further work and pay (Dispensing, &c.) for the one not teaching? I have a couple in view, the wife a splendid, all-round teacher. (3) Would you prefer a single, male or female, teacher?\n\nJ. A. Saskatchewan,\nBishop.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nHis Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan in a memorandum to the Department states that the teacher of the Red Pheasants School will be leaving on June 30th, next. He requests to be informed as to what salary the Department will pay for a teacher having a Normal School Certificate. He states that he has a married man in view, the wife of whom is a splendid all round teacher, and further asks to be informed as to whether there would be work for both of them, and also asks whether a single, male or female, teacher would be preferred instead.\n\nWith reference to the question of salary, we are, in several instances, paying $900.00 per annum, which is much lower than the salaries paid in the provincial schools. I think there is no doubt that to obtain a competent teacher we will have to pay at least $900.00.\n\nThere is no need for the services of a married couple, as field matron work has been discontinued, not having met with much success. I think that a female teacher having the necessary qualifications would be the most suitable for this school.\n\nI shall be pleased to be informed as to the salary that will be allowed and also whether a married couple or a female teacher be engaged.\n\nThere is an enrolment at this school of 25 pupils, with an average attendance of 15. The present salary paid is at the rate of $600.00 per annum.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

He has asked that this matter stand in abeyance until next summer, when he will personally investigate and advise as to the best plan to provide educational facilities for the children of this reserve. He will consider the erection of a teacher's residence at Fort \u00e0 la Corne; moving the residence from the James Smith's School; the re-opening of this school; or the removal of these schools to some central point on the reserve, and report as to which of these schemes he considers to be the most advantageous.\n\nSecond,- Thunderchild's Reserve. The question of providing a day school for the children of this reserve cannot be favourably considered at the present time. It is hoped to be able to provide for the education of these children in residential schools.\n\nThird,- Red Pheasants. It is noted that the teacher will be leaving on June 30th, next. The Department will be prepared to pay a salary at the rate of $900.00 per annum for a teacher with a Normal School Certificate. There is no need for the services of a married couple at this school, as the present situation will have been discontinued and there is no need for a dispenser. It is considered that a single female teacher would best meet the requirements at this school, and the Department will be pleased if you will endeavour to secure the services of a female teacher with a Normal School Certificate in time to take charge upon the re-opening of the school after the summer holidays.\n\nFourth,- Big River School, Carlton Agency. In November, last, Your Lordship brought to the attention of the Department the question of re-opening this school and appointing a teacher. Mr. Agent Fair was instructed to inform you that a salary at the rate of $600.00 per annum would be provided to any agent that you undertake to obtain a suitable teacher. The Department will be prepared to pay a salary at the rate of $900.00 per annum for a teacher with a Normal School Certificate.\n\nRight Rev. J. A.

(RG 10, Volume 6291, file 618-1, part D)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWith reference to the accommodation, the present house is owned by the Church and it is considered that Your Lordship should arrange to have it repaired and made comfortable to provide the necessary accommodation. Mr. Commissioner Graham is being written to regarding school matters on this reserve and requested to advise the Department as to his views in connection with the carrying on of the day school and the repairs necessary to the school building. As he is familiar with the conditions at this point the Department will await his decision regarding the re-opening of the school.\n\nFifth.\u2014Regarding the salaries the Department is prepared to pay for qualified teachers; I beg to say that a salary at the rate of $900.00 per annum will be paid to teachers having Normal School certificates. The names, qualifications and experience of teachers nominated by you should be submitted for approval in each case.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAct., Deputy and Secretary.\nBattleford, Sask.\nApril 7th, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. J.M. Marshall, Teacher at Red Pheasant has tendered his resignation to take effect June 30th or at the end of this quarter, on account of his health. This is to be regretted, as Mr. Marshall has been making a great success of this school and is trusted and liked by the Indians of both Reserves.\n\nIn filling this position I would recommend that a man and wife be hired to act as Teacher and Field Matron, as they have been without a Matron since Mrs. Marshall's resignation last summer. Of course if the woman has children they are not a success, as Field Matrons and not able to give the time to the Matron's work that they should. Failing this, two old maids would be as good as anything.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n(Sgd.) S.L. Macdonald,\nIndian Agent.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of letter received from Mr. S. L. Macdonald, Indian Agent, Battleford, advising me of the resignation of Mr. J. M. Marshall, Teacher at the Red Pheasant Reserve, and also making certain recommendations for a successor to Mr. Marshall, as well as a Field Matron for this Reserve.\n\nI would ask that the Department take this matter up with the Church Authorities with a view to the appointment of a teacher after the summer vacation.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, April 16, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant enclosing a copy of a communication which you received from Mr. Agent Macdonald, Battleford, advising you of the resignation of Mr. J. M. Marshall, teacher of the Red Pheasants Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan has already informed the Department that Mr. Marshall was giving up his duties on the 30th of June, next. His Lordship was informed that there would be no need for the services of a married couple at this school, as the field matron work had been discontinued. He was informed that a single female teacher would be likely to best meet the requirements at this school and that the Department would be pleased if he would endeavour to secure the services of such a teacher having a Normal School Certificate. For a teacher having these qualification the Department will be prepared to pay a salary at the rate of $900.00 per annum.\n\nIt is hoped that His Lordship will be able to secure the services of a suitable teacher in time to begin duties upon the re-opening of this school after the summer holidays, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Macdonald, Indian Agent\nBattleford, Oringim on 160370-26E.\n\n=====\n\nRED PHEASANT DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThis school is on the Red Pheasant Reserve, close to the boundary of the Stony Reserve and the children from both reserves attend it, being driven to and from school each morning and afternoon. The teacher Mr. J. M. Marshall takes a genuine and personal interest in the children and the progress in the last year has been exceptional. Mr. Marshall has the confidence of the people of both the reserves and the results can be seen in his quarterly reports and averages. A noon meal is served to the children each day by Mrs. Marshall.\n\nIt is to be regretted that Mr. Marshall has tendered his resignation to take effect at the end of the next quarter as he will not be easily replaced.\n\nThe school and teacher's residence are good stone foundation, frame and shingle buildings, well lighted and sanitary.\n\nS. L. Macdonald,\nAgent\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 117054-1 of the 16th instant, in which you inform me that His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan has been advised that Mr. Marshall was giving up his duties on the 30th of June next. I also note that His Lordship has been informed that there would be no need for the services of a married couple at this school.\n\nI might state that a married couple is exactly what is needed at this point and is what Mr. Macdonald recommended in his letter. The man could act as teacher and the woman as Matron. If we do not engage a married couple, surely we could not expect a lady teacher to live on the prairie alone among a lot of Indians. I think His Lordship should again be communicated with and put right on this matter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan, in writing, stated that he had in view a married couple, the wife being a qualified teacher.\n\nAs there will be no work for the husband in this case, it was not considered advisable to make such an appointment. The Department had in mind your previous reports, regarding the lack of efficient work on the part of field matrons, and it was considered that it would be more advisable to have a single, qualified teacher undertake the classroom work. I, however, would have no objection to the appointment of a married couple if the wife is competent to do the field matron work, and the husband is a qualified teacher. It is almost impossible, however, to obtain the services of people of this kind at the present time. His Lordship, however, will be informed that, if he can secure the services of a competent married couple, the Department will make the appointment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\n\nW.

Gen'l.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Red Pheasants' Indian School.\n\nWe have now a possible teacher in prospect for this School and desire to know what remuneration will be provided by the department. The party consists of a man and wife, the latter having good normal School Certificate, and both have had experience in Indian work at the Mackay Boarding School. Latterly the wife has been teaching in the school at Big Eddy near the Pas. The matter was taken up with Mr. and Mrs. Bird before the Bishop of Saskatchewan left for England. In his absence and that of Archdeacon Mackay at Lac la Ronge I have been taking up the matter as Bishop's Commissary and would be glad to have a definite offer to make to them for their acceptance before submitting their names to you for the appointment. I understand that the stipend for a teacher with the necessary qualifications is now $900 a year. This would be, I take it, for the teaching only, and the Bishop gave me to understand there would be a further allowance for a married couple.\n\nI shall esteem it a privilege to have an early reply so that there may be no delay in making an appointment.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop's Commissary.\nOttawa, August 9, 1920.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to securing a teacher for the Red Phasasant Indian Day School.\n\nIn official letter of June 1st, last, addressed to His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan, the Department expressed the desire to secure the services of a married teacher, provided that he and his wife had the necessary qualifications for the duties of teacher and matron, respectively.\n\nFrom your letter it appears that Mrs. Bird would act as teacher. No mention is made of what duties Mr. Bird would perform. The Department does not, therefore, feel in a position to sanction their appointment as it is felt the greater success will be met with if a married couple were secured with the qualifications outlined in official letter of June 1st.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nRight Rev.

As it is not stated what qualifications Mr. Bird possesses nor what duties he will perform, the approval of their appointment cannot be considered until this information is furnished. If he is a fully qualified teacher it would consent to his appointment to that position and that of his wife as field matron. A married couple should be secured with the necessary qualifications as teacher and matron respectively and the Department must insist, in the interests of the work on this reserve, that a married couple having the necessary qualifications for these positions be secured.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Asst.

Scott, Esq.\n\nRed Pheasants' Indian School.\n\nOn behalf of the Bishop of the Diocese of Saskatchewan I beg to nominate for the vacancy in this school Mr. and Mrs. E. V. Bird, now at Big Eddy, The Pas, Man. Mr. and Mrs. Bird have both been engaged in Indian work at the Mackay Boarding School, The Pas, and latterly Mrs. Bird has been teaching in a school near there.\n\nMrs Bird holds a second class Normal Teachers' Certificate for the Province of Saskatchewan and taught for some time in the public schools of this Province. She left this work to go into Indian work at the Mackay School, relinquishing a much larger salary from Missionary motives. Both are desirous to give their lives to help the Indian.\n\nIn view of the fact that they must go almost immediately if the school is to be opened at the proper time I have instructed them to be ready to go as soon as I receive word of their appointment by the Department. Will you please wire me whether you accept this nomination or not and please follow at the earliest date possible with instructions in reply to my letter of July 27th.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH. N.

His appointment is approved on the understanding that his retention in the position will depend upon the success with which he meets in the work. The salary provided for the teacher at the Red Pheasants School is $600.00 per annum and for the field matron $300.00 per annum, with bonus additional during the time it is continued to teachers in Indian Bay schools.\n\nInstructions will be sent regarding the duties to be performed by the field matron.\n\nMr. Commissioner Graham and Mr. Agent Macdonald are being informed of the appointment of Mr. and Mrs. Bird.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nVen. Archdeacon A. D. Dewdney,\n151 Twentieth St., West,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that it has been decided to approve of the appointment of Mr. and Mrs. E. V. Bird as teacher and field matron respectively on the Red Pheasants Reserve. They have been nominated for these positions by the Venerable Archdeacon Dewdney, Prince Albert, who stated that you strongly approved of their appointment.\n\nThe Archdeacon is being informed that, while the Department will approve of Mr. Bird's acting as teacher, yet it is not altogether satisfied with the qualifications that he possesses and that his retention in the position will depend entirely upon the success with which he meets in the work he will carry on his duties as teacher under the direction of Bird, who will be responsible for the class-room work.\n\nThe salary allowed the teacher is at the rate of $600.00 per annum and the matron $300.00 per annum, with additional during the time it is continued to teachers in Indian day schools.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform the Department the date upon which Mr. and Mrs. Bird begin duties on reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nOttawa, August 20, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that Venerable Archdeacon Dewdney, Prince Albert, has nominated Mr. and Mrs. E. V. Bird, who have both been engaged in Indian work at the Mackay Boarding School, as teacher and matron respectively on the Red Pheasants Reserve. He is being informed that their appointment is approved.\n\nI may add that the Department is not altogether satisfied with the qualifications which Mr. Bird possesses for the duties as teacher, but his appointment is strongly urged by Archdeacon Dewdney, who states that he is prepared to teach under Mrs. Bird's direction and that she will be responsible for the teaching as well as attend to the field matron work. Mrs. Bird holds a second-class Normal teacher's certificate for the Province of Saskatchewan and taught for sometime in the public schools of that province. The salary allowed is $600.00 per annum for the teacher and $300.00 to the field matron, with bonus additional.

Bird of The Pas, has been appointed for the position of School Teacher at Red Pheasant, and his wife as Field Matron, and that they will be leaving for Battleford on the 16th inst. I have had no intimation from the Department of these appointments, and should be glad to be advised if this information is correct.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 105-6-1 of the 20th inst. advising me of the appointment as Teacher and Field Matron respectively on the Red Pheasant Reserve, of Mr. and Mrs. E.V. Bird. I note that the Department is not altogether satisfied with the qualifications which Mr. Bird possesses for the duties as teacher, but that he is prepared to teach under Mrs. Bird's directions, and that the latter will be responsible for the teaching as well as attending to the Field Matron work. This does not appear to me to be a satisfactory arrangement, for if Mrs. Bird is to direct the teaching at the school, her work as Field Matron will probably suffer.\n\nIn view of the circumstances narrated in your letter, I am requesting Mr. Agent MacDonald to report to me as to the success of this arrangement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDiocese of Saskatchewan\n\n161 Twentieth St. W.\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nSeptember 1st, 1920.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.\nAas't. Deputy and Sec'y.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your telegram of the 20th ult., and letter of same date, confirming the appointment of Mr. and Mrs. Bird as teacher and matron respectively on the Red Pheasants' Reserve, and to thank you for your acquiescence in their appointment. Mr. and Mrs. Bird, out of their interest in the welfare of the Indians gave up positions from which they derived a joint income of $175 a month, besides free house, to accept this work. In view of their experience in Indian work, their knowledge of its difficulties, their qualifications, and their readiness to sacrifice their own personal interests for the work, I feel that no mistake has been made. Mr. and Mrs. Bird have proceeded to Red Pheasants to take up the work. I note the salary provided and would ask how much the bonus amounts to which is given in addition to the stated salary. Would you also kindly inform me whether the $900 salary for teachers with Normal School Certificates as stated in letter No. 33341/1 of Apr. 15th, 1920, is with or without bonus.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop's Commissary.\nOttawa, September 10, 1920.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant, in which you inform the Department that Mr. and Mrs. Bird, who have recently been appointed as teacher and matron respectively on the Red Pheasants Reserve, have proceeded to take up their work.\n\nThe bonus allowed is at the rate of $150.00 per annum each. This bonus, which is appropriated by parliament, is for the fiscal year ended March 31st, next, only.\n\nThe salary of $900.00 allowed for teachers having Normal School certificates will also be supplemented by the bonus at the above rate. I may say that this salary will only be paid in cases where teachers having Normal School certificates are appointed to schools in which there is a good average attendance. In cases where the average is small the Department would not feel warranted in paying salaries at that rate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon A. D. Dewdney, B.A.,\n151 Twentieth St., W.,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that Mr and Mrs Bird started at Red Pheasant as Teacher and Field Matron on August 23rd.\n\nI regret this delay in reporting this information to the Department, which was through an oversight on my part. I included in my August report that they were installed on the 21st, but did not start work till the 23rd.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nExtract from Report of Inspector W. Murison on the Battleford Agency. Original on 427021-5\n\nRED PHEASANT DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThis school is situated on the Red Pheasant Reserve and serves the Stony Reserve as well. The school is a modern building 22 x 24 ft. with basement. It is heated with a hot air furnace and is a good frame building on a stone foundation. The walls and roof require repainting as the paint has not been renewed since the building was erected seven years ago. The teacher's dwelling and pupils dining room is also a commodious frame building. The interior of the dwelling has been recently kalsomined throughout by the teacher. The outer walls and roof require painting.\n\nThe old well is situated about 100 yards from the school at the edge of a slough. It does not provide sufficient water and should be deepened at once and put in order and a pump provided. The water supply is now hauled from the farm house over a mile away.\n\nMr. E. V. Bird and his wife have just recently been placed in charge as teacher and field matron, respectively. I feel satisfied that the Department has made a good selection in these people both of whom have had considerable experience at teaching Indians. A large garden has been planted and allowed to become a forest of weeds. Mr. Bird, although only two weeks at the school has got it cleaned up and is also getting the premises neat and tidy. Two drivers are employed to bring the children to school. The number enrolled is 25, six girls and nineteen boys. The average attendance during the past year is 20, which is good for an Indian day school. The class standing shows 19 in Standard I and 6 in Standard II. As the school has just been re-opened the attendance was small only six being present on the date of my visit. They looked bright as well as being clean and tidy.\n\nW.

I understand Mr. and Mrs. Bird are going to take charge of the MacKay Boarding School at The Pas.\n\nI wish that the Department would make a careful selection for the positions that are being vacated as it is important that we should have an extra good teacher and matron at this point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. GRAHAM,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nOttawa, August 11, 1925.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform Your Lordship that Mr. Commissioner Graham, of Regina, has accepted the resignation of Mr. E. V. Bird, who has been teacher at the Red Pheasant Indian Day School, south of Battleford. This is a promising school, and I wish to urge that, when you are arranging for a new incumbent, a man properly qualified as a teacher be chosen.\n\nThe Department has, in the past, allowed a salary of $600, supplemented by $150 bonus. In the event of a certificated teacher being appointed, we are prepared to allow $800 per annum, plus bonus.\n\nThe position of field matron for the Red Pheasant Reserve has been filled by Mrs. Bird, the wife of the teacher, and the Department can likely arrange with the Civil Service Commission to have the wife of the new incumbent act in this capacity, provided she is qualified and willing to assume the duties. The salary of the field matron is at the rate of $300 per annum, supplemented by any bonus provided by law.\n\nI trust that Your Lordship will be able to cooperate with the Department, and that satisfactory officers will be nominated in the very near future.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

This is, as you state, a promising school, and we are anxious to follow your instructions, and have the work taken up by properly qualified officers.\n\nI note that your wish is that \"a man properly qualified as a teacher be chosen.\" We will endeavour to find a qualified male teacher whose wife could fill the office of field matron.

(RG 10, Volume 6291, file 618-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI am now in receipt of a letter from him in which he advises me that his recommendation was not accepted, and the Dept. stated that it must have a certificated teacher.\n\nSir, apart from Mrs Godfrey's First Class English certificate, I have never claimed to be certificated, but have worked in conjunction with Mrs Godfrey's direction, and have always understood from former Indian Agents Messrs McArthur and Borthwick, as well as from Mrs Inspector Chisholm, that the teaching given and the results obtained by each of us were scarcely equalled in the West, and as far as their knowledge went was not excelled.\n\nAllow me, Sir, to say that I know that there are few teachers in Canada today who can excel Mrs Godfrey as such, and as I fully copied her methods and never attempted to alter unless we both saw fit, I have always attributed my success at the Sturgeon Lake School as owing to my wife's training and experience.\n\nThe fact that the Ven Archdeacon Mackay has offered two schools to us, and that former Bishop Newnham offered me again the Sturgeon Lake School in 1917 (at which time I was taking medical treatment at the Military Hospital Saskatoon, owing to wounds received in\nin France, and not physically fit at that date to take\na school) should be proof that the work in which we\ngave our best is standing the test of time, and we have\nhitherto always flattered ourselves that the Dept itself\nfully recognised the success of the united efforts of\nMrs Godfrey & myself.\n\nHaving sincerely the good of the Indians at heart,\nI have several times since sent in an application for\nan appointment as Indian Agent, but the usual verdict\nof the Civil Service Commissioners was that \"Mr. \u2014 was\nthe successful applicant.\" In my applications I have\nalways referred to my experience with the Indians both\nbefore & when teaching school, and given as a reference my\nrecord in the Indian Dept. It would appear that these\napplications have been futile on the ground that the\nreference given was not sufficient to warrant the Dept.\nagain employing me as a teacher in an Indian school.\n\nAmong the Indians themselves there is a general desire\nto have our presence with them again. When casually\ncalling in at a meeting of the Anglican Synod held in\nPrince Albert in 1922, an Indian from Sturgeon Lake\n(one William Charles) immediately brought one of the clergy\nto me, to introduce the Rev Canon Paul to \"the teacher\nwhom the Indians wanted back,\" and, Sir, I had left\nthem eight years before, and have never been in that\nReserve.\nReserve since I felt flattered, but as the wife and I have been repeatedly appealed to by the Indians at Fort a la Corne to return to them there (where I was but a silent and unofficial helper) I was not wholly surprised.\n\nCan you wonder, sir, that we are taking the Dept's recent decision much to heart?\u2014not so much on account of loss of position applied for, but that it would seem that our former sacrifice in the old days when the Indian Day school work was in the pioneer stage, and the success attained thereto, is as a dead-letter and wholly forgotten by the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nAs a proof of the above statement of success in the pioneer days, may I quote from a treasured letter in Mrs Godfrey's possession from Hon David Laird, which reads:\n\n\"Madam,\n\nI am very pleased to have a very gratifying report from Mr Inspector Chisholm in regard to your work at South Fort a la Corne.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nD Laird, Indian Commissioner\"\n\nThanking you for your kindly interest always in us since your own visit to South Fort a la Corne in 1910.\n\nI beg to remain\n\nYours Very Sincerely,\n\nLt Godfrey.\"\nOttawa, Oct. 4, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Godfrey:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, regarding the offer made by the Ven.

It is desired, if possible, to obtain the services of a qualified teacher for the important work at this school. I would point out that you have no professional qualifications and therefore, after careful consideration, the Department was unable to approve of your appointment. The services of both yourself and Mrs. Godfrey, while at Fort \u00e0 la Corne and Sturgeon Lake Schools, were satisfactory and I can assure you that your earlier career can be commended as one of much usefulness.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

F. Bradley, of Naicam Sask. I am not personally acquainted with Mr. Bradley. He states that he has had twelve years teaching experience, that he has a second class certificate for this Province, that he has been Principal of a two roomed village school for two years, and served overseas for three years. He is 34 years of age and married. Mrs Bradley, He states, is not a trained nurse, but she has had much experience in nursing. She has an excellent knowledge of sanitary requirements, and he feels confident that she would prove an enthusiastic Field Matron.\n\nI have asked Mr. Bradley for references. If his statements are confirmed, may I ask what joint salaries the Department would offer?\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ. A. Mackay\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Oct. 17, 1923.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, in which you inform the Department that you are in correspondence with Mr. G. F. Bradley, in connection with the vacancy at the Red Pheasant Indian Day School. In view of Mr. Bradley's qualifications, a salary of $800 for the ten teaching months, plus any bonus provided by law, will be allowed if he is appointed.\n\nThe position of field matron for the Red Pheasant Reserve is also vacant and the Department can, in all probability, arrange with the Civil Service Commission to have the wife of the day school teacher act in this capacity. Mrs. Bradley's qualifications are satisfactory, provided her household duties would not interfere with her field matron work. You should intimate whether or not there are any children in the family and ascertain how many hours per week Mrs. Bradley would be prepared to devote to the work on the reserve. The salary allowed for the field matron at this point is $500 per annum, supplemented by any bonus provided by law.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nVen.

I have received a letter from the Indian Department dated 17th inst. in reply to mine recommending you for the Red Pheasant School, in which letter it is stated, \"In view of Mr. Bradley's qualifications, a salary of $800 for the ten teaching months, plus any bonus provided by law, will be allowed if he is appointed\".\n\n\"The position of field matron for the Red Pheasant Reserve is also vacant and the Department can, in all probability arrange with the Civil Service Commission to have the wife of the day school teacher act in this capacity. Mrs. Bradley's qualifications are satisfactory, provided her household duties would not interfere with her field matron work. You should intimate whether or not there are any children in the family and ascertain how many hours per week Mrs Bradley would be prepared to devote to the work on the reserve. The salary allowed for the field matron at this point is $500 per annum, supplemented by any bonus provided by law.\"\n\nAs the bonus at the present time is believe $150, so this would mean that you would receive $950 and Mrs Bradley $450, altogether $1400, the same as I understand, you are receiving in your present situation.\n\nAs I stated in my former letter, the Department supplies all the fuel. There is at the present time a year's supply of good fuel piled up conveniently to the house and school. Also there is a supply of vegetables, stored in the basement of the residence.\n\nWith regard to furniture, there is not any in the residence of much account. As you intimated that you have a good supply in your present residence, it would probably be advisable for you to bring with you what you really need.\n\nThere is a good kitchen range, with all the utensils required for the preparation of the mid-day meal for the pupils, also dishes, plates, cups, etc.\n\nIn seeing after the preparation of the mid-day meal Mrs Bradley would generally be occupied during the forenoon, but I would assume that in the afternoon she would be free for any duties that might require attention in connection with her office as field matron.\nI am hoping to be able to spend a week or so with you at Red Pheasant's, to help you to become acquainted with the people and the work, and to make a fair start.\n\nI am at present living mostly at a similar school in the Battleford Agency. The work at Little Pine's is progressing successfully, and I hope to see Red Pheasant's school equally successful.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to the Department with the request that if your appointment is decided on, you should receive notice to that effect direct from head-quarters.\n\nKindly let me know if you receive notice of appointment, in order that I may be able to make arrangements to give you all the help I can.\n\nHoping that you will receive the appointment, and that you will find the work congenial and encouraging,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nJ. A. MacKay.\nTo whom it may concern.\n\nThis is to certify to the excellent character and competent ability of Mr. George F. Bradley.\n\nThe writer has been somewhat intimately acquainted with Mr. B Bradley for the past three years, and has every reason to believe him to be a man of blameless character.

She is quite\ncapable of seeing to the preparation of the mid-day meal.\n\nShe is a good needlewoman and a great social worker. She is a thoughtful\nand patient nurse and much interested in the work.\n\nI consider it a good opportunity to be able to carry on with Missionary work\nin this country as I have always had an ambition in that direction.\n\nIt is somewhat difficult to get a testimonial from our New Canadians\nbut I am asking Mr Brigham ex Sec.

There is a residence provided, and, although it is partly furnished, it would be advisable for you to arrange to use your own. The kitchen range is, however, in good condition.

I have to inform you that on the 14th ultimo the Department agreed to the appointment of Mr. H. S. Roberts to the position of teacher and to the temporary appointment of Mrs. Roberts as field matron, but the formal approval and notification to you were postponed until Mr. and Mrs. Roberts agreed to accept the positions. Upon receipt of your letter I telegraphed to His Lordship and I am in receipt of a reply to the effect that Mr. and Mrs. Roberts are already on duty at the Red Pheasant Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department approves of the appointment of Mr. Roberts to the position of teacher, at a salary of $800 for the ten teaching months plus any bonus which may be provided by law. The position of field matron is not exempt from the operations of the Civil Service Act, but the Department approves of the temporary appointment of Mrs. Roberts, at a salary of $480 per year plus any bonus allowed by law. The Civil Service Commission will be asked to approve of her permanent appointment as soon as the necessary formalities can be complied with. In this connection you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nOttawa, May 7, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department has approved of the appointment of Mr. N. S. Roberts to the position of teacher at the Red Pheasant Indian Day School, at a salary of $800 for the ten teaching months plus any bonus provided by law - appointment to date from the first instant. Mrs. N. S. Roberts has been appointed temporarily to the position of field matron, at a salary of $480 per year plus any bonus allowed by law. The Civil Service Commission will be asked to approve of her permanent appointment. These workers were nominated by His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan, who has been informed of our approval. Mr. Indian Agent Macdonald also has been informed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nI beg to report that the Red Pheasant Day school was reopened again on the 12th, many of the Indians were absent so that a full attendance was not possible. Mr & Mrs Roberts as Teacher and Matron are showing a great interest in their work and I believe they can make a success of this school.\n\nThe New Thunderchild Day School was opened on the 15th, and the same day the teacher Miss Amy D. Wrigley wrote me a description of the opening and I am enclosing her letter for the Department's information. Since the date of her letter considerable more school equipment has been supplied and the desks should be along in a few days, so that she will be able to carry on the school in the regular manner.\n\nI was at Thunderchild on the 13th and instructed her to open the school even without equipment, if only for a half day each time till the supplies were received; this was to get the children used to the routine as none of them had ever been to school before.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 28th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, informing the Department that the teachers who were appointed have taken up duties at both the Red Pheasant and Thunderchild Indian Day Schools, and enclosing a communication from Miss Wrigley regarding the opening of the latter school. In reply I beg to say it is noted that the teachers are interested and that you consider they will make a success of their work.\n\nRegarding the equipment for the Thunderchild Day School, it is hoped that you will be able to place the order for the desks as instructed in our letters of the 5th and 10th instant, and also purchase the stove and other material required. It is also hoped that the blackboards which have been ordered through the Government Stationery Office will arrive in the very near future, and that Miss Wrigley will be able to carry on without undue inconvenience until such time as all the classroom equipment is installed. Her letter describing the opening of the school was read with interest, and we are pleased with the good attendance and interest taken by the parents.\n\nIt is hoped that there will be a steady attendance of all the Indian children of school age who are eligible to attend at both these schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nRed Pheasant School,\nRed Pheasant,\nSASK.\n\nOctober 10th, 1924.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Education,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Indians on the Red Pheasant and Stoney Reserves have requested me to institute Evening Classes for them this Fall and Winter.\n\nThe request comes principally from the Stoney Indians, whom I think would be greatly benefitted, as only a small minority speak English to any extent.\n\nIn accordance with the Regulations I propose holding two sessions per week of at least one and one half hours duration at 7-0 p.m., on Monday and Thursday evenings.\n\nThe subjects of instruction, according to the Regulations, shall be English, including Composition and Literature, Penmanship and Business Forms; Arithmetic; Canadian History and Civics. I would, however, suggest that Agriculture be added or substituted in this curriculum.\n\nIf these classes are inaugurated there will be a minimum attendance of at least ten persons.\n\nI shall be glad to have your approval together with any instructions or suggestions as to the curriculum, conduct, etc.\n\nIf this project is carried through I shall require lamps for lighting the School, as at present there are none installed.\n\nI am, sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTEACHER.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith, a letter from Mr. N. S. Roberts, teacher at Red Pheasant, with regard to holding night classes for the Indians of Red Pheasant and Stoney reserves.\n\nIt is apparent from the attached letter that Mr. Roberts is taking an interest in educational matters at his reserves and I would certainly recommend that four Glass Wall lamps and brackets be supplied, as well as Coal Oil necessary for the school use, which should not exceed ten gallons for the winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Nov. 3rd, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, enclosing a communication from Mr. N. S. Roberts, teacher of the Red Pheasant Indian Day School, regarding the holding of night classes for the Indians of the Red Pheasant and Stony Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may purchase and have delivered 4 wall lamps and brackets, as well as a quantity of coal oil. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred. We note that Mr. Roberts intends to conduct these night classes two evenings a week. It is presumed that there will be no expense to the Department other than the above authorized expenditure in the conducting of these classes. The teacher should see that good order is maintained and that no damage is occasioned to the school or furnishings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nI visited this school, which is situated on the Red Pheasant reserve, on October 1st. The pupilage for this school is drawn from the Red Pheasant and Stony reserves. There are two drivers engaged to take the children to and from the school, one from each reserve. There are 21 pupils on the roll, 11 boys and 10 girls. The average attendance for the quarter ending September 30th was 13-2. The teacher, Mr. N.I. Roberts, was appointed last May. He holds a Second Class Professional Teacher's Certificate for the Province of Saskatchewan, and appears to be fairly well qualified for his work. His wife, Mrs. Edith Roberts, acts as Field Matron for the reserve. The pupils in the school are all in the Primary Grades, and it is a difficult matter to obtain satisfactory progress in a school such as this where the attendance is irregular.\n\nBuildings\n\nThe school buildings are in a good state of repair, and the school room, children's dining room, and teacher's residence are kept very clean and tidy. The school premises also found in a tidy condition, but noted that some repairs the fence were required. The water supply is not large but is sufficient for their present requirements and the water is of a very good quality. The class room is heated by hot air and is quite large enough to take care of any attendance which may be anticipated from these two reserves.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6291, file 618-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nExtract from Report of Inspector Murison on the Red Pheasant Day School - dated March 23rd, 1926.\n\nMr. Stanley Roberts is teacher. He has 2nd class Saskatchewan standing. His wife is the Field Matron. She prepares the midday meal for the children and visits the homes on the two reserves. I find her very capable and energetic. Her house and children's dining-room are scrupulously clean.\n\nThere are 22 pupils enrolled. The average attendance is about 18. The children were poorly clothed and some of them looked under-nourished. The Provincial School Inspector reported favourably on the class-room work. I was not favourably impressed. The pupils mumble and do not speak up well. They were backward in answering questions. Their writing is very good.\n\nIn a letter dated April 13th, 1926, Commissioner Graham makes the following remarks regarding the above report:\n\nThe report on the Red Pheasant School is satisfactory. The Inspector, however, points out that the children are poorly clothed and some of them look under-nourished. Mr. Murison does not agree with the Provincial Inspector's report on the classroom work.\nSr.\u2014\n\nRe summer holidays at the Red Pheasant Day School, the Teacher would like to keep the school open during July and August and have the holidays come in September and October.\n\nWe have found that during the latter two months that the Indians are nearly all away on harvest work and take their families with them, which knocks the attendance at the school and we would like to try this plan to see if the results would be any better.\n\nI would recommend that the school be kept open during July and August, and the holidays be allowed in September and October.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 18th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, in which you recommend that the Red Pheasant Indian Day School be kept open during the months of July and August, next, and that the annual summer holidays be taken in September and October, and stating your reasons for making this change.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, if you and the teacher are satisfied that there would be a good attendance during the two summer months mentioned, the Department would have no objection to giving this arrangement a trial during the coming summer. We have noted that the average attendance has been slightly lower during the quarter ended September 30th than for the previous quarter. The teacher and yourself are in the best position to decide as to the advantage to be gained in the change in the usual annual holiday period, and this matter will be left in your hands.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will advise the Department at a later date as to whether the school will be conducted during the two months mentioned and the annual holidays taken during September and October, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nSir,\n\nIn my July report, I mentioned that Mr Roberts, Teacher at the Red Pheasant Day school, was taken sick and had to close the school on July 2nd.\n\nMr Roberts was brought in to the local Hospital since and yesterday was examined by a specialist who states that he will have to go to the Sanitorium for special treatment for two or three months.\n\nMr Roberts is very anxious to retain his position at the Red Pheasant school and again take up the work as soon as his health permits. I would recommend that some local woman or girl be employed as temporary teacher and stay with Mrs Roberts at the reserve till he is again able to take up his duties.\n\nIf this was not acceptable to the Department, perhaps the Church Authorities could send some woman to do the teaching and reside with Mrs Roberts till his return from the Sanitorium. If it is allowable to get some local Woman as teacher, please advise me what salary per month would be allowed. Mrs Roberts who is well educated and familiar with the Teaching and necessary work could assist with the teaching as well as attending to her Field Matrons duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 24, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, informing the Department of the illness of Mr. N. S. Roberts, teacher of the Red Pheasant Indian Day School, and recommending that the services of a woman teacher be temporarily engaged until Mr. Roberts' health permits him to resume duties.\n\nIn this connection I beg to enclose herewith copy of a communication to His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan under whose auspices the school is conducted relative to the appointment of a temporary teacher. His Lordship and yourself may complete arrangements for the securing of a suitable substitute, and you should inform the Department as to the arrangements made, stating name, qualifications, etc., of the substitute teacher employed. As stated in our letter to His Lordship, the salary allowed the substitute teacher will be at the rate of $80 per teaching month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nOttawa, August 24, 1926.\n\nRight Rev. Sir:\n\nA communication has been received from Mr. Agent Macdonald, Battleford, in which he states that Mr. N. S. Roberts, teacher of the Red Pheasant Indian Day School, will require leave of absence on account of illness for two or three months. He states that Mr. Roberts was examined by a specialist and that he will have to go to a sanatorium for special treatment. Mr. Roberts is very anxious to retain his position at the Red Pheasant School and resume work when his health permits. The Agent recommends that a local woman or girl be employed as temporary teacher who could reside with Mrs. Roberts on the Reserve until Mr. Roberts is again able to resume duties.\n\nThe Department would agree to the appointment of a temporary teacher until such time as Mr. Roberts resumes duties, and I have to request that Your Lordship will endeavour to secure a woman teacher having the necessary qualifications, and complete arrangements with Mr. Agent Macdonald for her temporary appointment. We would allow a temporary incumbent salary at the rate of $80 per teaching month. It is hoped that you will be able to obtain the services of a competent person to take up the duties as teacher at this school during the absence of Mr. Roberts, and that the arrangements will be completed in time to reopen the school after the present summer holidays. Mr. Agent Macdonald will advise the Department as to what arrangements have been made for the securing of the services of a temporary teacher, giving the name, qualifications, etc.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour Lordship's obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRt. Rev. G. E. Lloyd, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Education,\nIndian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: Sickness of Mr. N.S. Roberts, Teacher of Red Pheasant Indian Day School.\n\nAs arrangements were made with the Department to keep open Red Pheasant Day School for the period July and August, I would request that the Department should pay my husband's salary for this period, especially in view of the fact that Dr. Norquay, Medical Officer for the Battleford Agency, took his vacation during the period of sickness and another doctor had to be obtained.\n\nA considerable hospital bill was entailed also, and I understood that employees were entitled to free medical attention.\n\nI should be glad if the Department would consider the payment of salary to my husband for the whole period of sickness, as his health was excellent on taking up his appointment here and it is now seriously impaired. If this is not possible, I should esteem it a favour if the Department would kindly inform me what they can do in the matter.\n\nI am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6291, file 618-1, part 1)\nOttawa, September 23rd, 1926.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, requesting that payment of salary be made to your husband, Mr. N. S. Roberts, teacher of the Red Pheasant Indian Day School, for July and August last, to reimburse him for expenses in connection with his illness.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that all salaries are based on ten teaching months in the year, and if the school was reopened on September 1st with a substitute teacher to replace Mr. Roberts, it will be difficult to make any payment from the salary provided. We are communicating with Mr. Agent Macdonald to ascertain when the substitute teacher began duties. When we have full information from the Agent, your request will receive consideration.\n\nI may add that the Department does not pay medical fees for its employees. I regret that there are no funds available to continue salary to your husband during the whole period of his illness.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMrs. N. S. Roberts,\nIbstone P.O.,\nSask.\nOttawa, September 23rd, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of August 17th, last, and the Department's reply of the 24th of the same month, relative to the appointment of a temporary teacher to assist Mrs. Roberts in the work at the Red Pheasant Indian Day School until such time as Mr. Roberts is able to resume duties. I shall be pleased if you will state whether the services of this substitute has been secured.\n\nOwing to the ill-health of Mr. Roberts, this school was not conducted during July and August, last, and I shall be pleased if you will state whether it reopened on the first of the present month or not. If it has not yet reopened, please state the date on which it will do so. It is hoped that the Church authorities have secured a temporary assistant to carry on during Mr. Roberts' absence. If so, you should state name, qualifications, etc.\n\nI may say that we have a communication from Mrs. Roberts in which she requests payment of salary to Mr. Roberts during the months of July and August to reimburse him for expenses occasioned by his illness. As we only pay salary for ten teaching months in the year, it will be difficult to arrange for payment to Mr. Roberts for the period mentioned, as there would, if the school reopened on the 1st of September, last, be an overlapping in salaries. We are informing Mrs. Roberts that we will be unable to decide regarding her request until we are aware of the time when the school reopened after the summer holidays.\n\nYour early reply giving the information asked for will oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nI am in receipt of Department letter No.105-1-6 Sept 23rd, as temporary Teacher for the Red Pheasant Day school.\n\nI beg to report that Miss Ruth W. Johnston, second Class teaching certificate arrived here on the 20th and opened the school on the following day, so that her time would start from that date.\n\nMr Roberta has not yet been admitted to the Sanatorium, but expects to get word of his admittance at time, and is at present staying at the school, but is not able to do any work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 5th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, informing the Department that Miss Ruth W. Johnston, who holds a second class teacher's certificate, has been engaged as temporary teacher to assist Mrs. Roberts in the work at the Red Pheasant Indian Day School until such time as Mr. Roberts is able to resume duties.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the temporary appointment of Miss Johnston. As stated in previous correspondence, the salary allowed her as substitute teacher will be at the rate of $50 per teaching month. We note that she began duties on the 21st ultimo.\n\nIn connection with the request made by Mrs. Roberts, which was referred to in official letter to you of the 23rd ultimo, relative to the payment of salary to Mr. Roberts during the months of July and August to reimburse him for expenses occasioned by his illness, I beg to say that we can allow him payment for one month's salary only during the quarter ended September 30th, last. When payments of the salaries due for that quarter are being made, a cheque to the amount of $95 will be forwarded in favour of Mr. Roberts.\n\nA return should be prepared by Miss Johnston, showing the days she taught and the attendance between the 21st of September and the end of the same month. When this is received, payment of the salary due her will also be made.\n\nI may add that it is presumed the Church authorities concur in the appointment of Miss Johnston.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford,\nSask.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, October 5th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that Mr. H. S. Roberts, teacher of the Red Pheasant Indian Day School, has, owing to illness, been obliged to give up duties temporarily. Leave of absence has been granted him for two or three months in order that he can go to a sanatorium for special treatment. He is anxious to retain his position at the Red Pheasant School and resume work when his health permits.\n\nThe Church authorities have nominated the services of Miss Ruth W. Johnston, who holds a second class teacher's certificate, as temporary teacher until such time as Mr. Roberts resumes duties. We have approved of the appointment of Miss Johnston, with salary at the rate of $80 per teaching month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M.

(RG 10, Volume 6291, file 618-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that I have Mr & Mrs Roberts resignations, as teacher and Field Matron respectively at Red Pheasant and Stony reserves, to take effect at the end of November. Mr Roberts will not perform his duties any more, but Mrs Roberts will continue the Field Matron work till that date. Mr Roberts has been informed by the Doctors that he will not be able to teach any more for a while but will have to take outdoor occupation, in the mean time Miss Ruth Johnson as substitute teacher will continue teaching and would like to carry it on till the Xmas Holidays, but this would mean hiring a temporary Matron for three weeks and as the house is only equipped with a cook stove and no other household goods, they would hardly move out this material for three weeks work.\n\nThe attendance generally, is so poor and as the Indians of both reserves apparently use every excuse to keep their children or avoid sending them to school, that I am inclined to recommend that the school be closed up and the boarding schools used. It is certain that the attendance does not justify the cost of keeping this school open with two school drivers, with matron and teacher and also the upkeep of the place, the only difficulty would be the absence of a Field Matron, and this could be overcome if the Department would appoint a nurse to cover this work as well as the Sweet Grass and Moosomin Reserves, she could be boarded very cheaply at the Farm Instructors places at each of these reserve and be from one to the other as the case demanded.\n\nIt is costing well over ten dollars a day to operate this school, with rarely over twelve small children in attendance and it is almost necessary to use coercion to get them there.\nSir,\n\nThese two reserves are about half and half Anglican and Roman Catholic and it is very hard to make a success of a denominational school and this school has never been what could be called a success, if shut down for a while and any available children recruited for the boarding schools or rather compelled to go, might bring these Indians to time and if occasion warranted, the school could be reopened again.\n\nThe few that are compelled to attend are so irregular, one or two months there and a month away, that at the end of the year, there is very little benefit to the pupil. This cannot be overcome as the parents claim they have to go away to earn a living and take the children with them, if I go after them about it, there reply is always the same, that \"if you feed us we will stay\" as there is no rations to feed families for this purpose I cannot go any further with it and that is about the situation of the Red Pheasant day school.\n\nI have purchased five tons of hay for the school before knowing of Mr Roberts resignation, but have made no arrangements for fuel and will not do so till I receive further instructions from the Department, there is enough fuel and supplies on hand to finish the present term.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 28, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 126-302 of the 21st instant, questioning the advisability of continuing the Red Pheasant Indian Day School. I am writing to the Church authorities and to the Indian Commissioner in this connection and, at a later date, will have a further communication for you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

(RG 10, Volume 6291, file 618-1, part 1)\nOttawa, October 28, 1926.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nIt has been suggested that it might be advisable to close the Red Pheasant Indian Day School at the end of the calendar year. The attendance is only fair, the average having been 15.3 for the last two academic years. The expenses of the school are quite high; for, in addition to the salary allowed, special provision has to be made for driving the pupils to and from school and for a noonday hot lunch.\n\nDoes Your Lordship believe that the children of the reserve should be recruited for the Onion Lake and other residential schools, or do you feel that the day school should be continued for the time being?\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The attendance is only fair, the average having been 15.3 for the last two academic years. The expenses of the school are quite high; for, in addition to the salary allowed, special provision has to be made for driving the pupils to and from school and for a noonday hot lunch.\n\nDo you believe that the children of the reserve should be recruited for the Onion Lake and other residential schools, or do you feel that the day school should be continued for the time being?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your 105-6-1 of the 28th ultimo, suggesting the advisability of closing the Red Pheasant Indian Day School at the end of the calendar year, and reply to say that I heartily concur in this move. This school has not been getting results, and the cost of management is exceedingly high, almost $12.00 a day I am told, and it seems to me a very unwise policy to keep it open any longer, in view of the fact that we have two Anglican Residential Schools where these children can be admitted, viz:- Onion Lake and Elkhorn.\n\nI am led to believe that we will experience difficulty in getting the parents to consent to send these children away to school, and the Agent says that they will not be sent for a year. This, of course, is absurd; they should be sent to school at the first of the year without fail, and, if necessary, compulsory measures should be taken to do this. The Moosomin Indians are a hard lot to handle, but I think it would be unwise to allow the children to remain at home any length of time if the school is closed. The parents should be warned of this now, and with your authority I will have Dr. Norquay at Battleford examine each child and make a report.\n\nKindly advise me what action you propose taking, so that I can take the matter up with the Principal of the Onion Lake School, and also the Elkhorn School if necessary,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, November 10, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 302-11 of the 4th instant, with reference to closing the Red Pheasant Indian Day School. I shall have an answer to your communication when I receive a reply to my recent letter in this connection to the church authorities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nM. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nReasons why the School should not be closed now:\n\n1. The Bishop of Saskatchewan has worked very effectively hand in hand with the Indian Department in the work of placing these Day Schools on a good footing. He has tried to work jointly with the Department on a certain policy and I feel therefore that it would be advisable to wait till he comes back before the question of closing the School is raised.\n\n2. In the meantime we can find a teacher who will look upon his work at the school as a Cause. There are children growing up and I feel that by June next there should be others added to the roll. I shall give the school my personal attention as I do with the Little Pine and Thunder child Day Schools.\n\n3. I feel that once the School is closed, there is very small chance of its ever being reopened. This being so, a fair trial should be given to it before it is closed.\n\nI would therefore recommend that the Commission ask the Indian Department to defer the question of closing the School at Red Pheasants till the end of June 1927.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEdward Ahenakew\nGen. Indian Missionary\n\nCanon McKim,\nChairman of Commission\nSynod Office\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nDear Canon:\n\nWith reference to the proposal to close the Red Pheasant's Day School I have this to report:\n\nPrior to Mr. Roberts' appointment it was difficult to find a teacher for the School; this was owing to the fact that the Indian Agent asked us to recommend a married couple to take the teacher's and matron's positions respectively. There was difficulty to find a suitable combination. The other reason was that Archdeacon Mackey's health was failing when he was looking for the appointments for the school.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Roberts were appointed eventually. My own impression of Mr. Roberts from the beginning was that he had not that energy which is needed for an Indian School if there is to be success. However, he had a good report from the Provincial Inspector and I could not report incompetent work on the face of that. We usually try to get missionary heartedness in our teachers; he seemed to have had none. The result was that there seemed to be lack of motive power to enable him to put his heart into his work and he failed to get the confidence and the continued support of the parents. Any teacher that shows results with the children will have the support of the Indian parents.\n\nMr. Roberts' health was not the best and he asked for leave of absence a few months ago. Miss Johnson was appointed temporary teacher with Mrs. Roberts continuing to act as Matron.\n\nI hear that Mr. and Mrs. Roberts have now resigned their resignation to take effect at the end of this month, November. I went to Red Pheasant's a week ago and I find the following facts:\n\n1. There are 16 children on the roll.\n2. There are two drivers in connection with the school each getting 2 dollars a day.\n3. The children get the mid-day meal.\n4. There were about 12 children at school on the day I was there. If this were the average the cost would be near one dollar per child per day.\n5. Mrs. Roberts is willing to stay till Christmas with Miss Johnson, in order to tide us over the time that would be needed for arranging for other workers, if the school continues.\n6. I heard from one or two sources that Miss Johnson is doing good work and that the attitude of the parents is favorable to her.\nPRINCE ALBERT,\nSASKATCHEWAN\n\nFirst,\nDecember,\n1926.\n\nMr. J. D. McLean,\nAss't Deputy & Sec'y,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the absence of the Bishop I am replying (though rather late) to your communication No.105-6-1 re Red Pheasant, Indian Day School.\n\nI have taken this matter up with the Rev. E. Ahenakew, our Indian Superintendent of that district, and have requested him to report to me the condition of things as he finds it and any recommendations that would enable us to come to a wise decision. I beg to enclose herewith, Mr. Ahenakew's report and suggestion.\n\nI can only add that I am in accord with Mr. Ahenakew's desire that the School should be tried out a little longer under better conditions, and that if possible, the decision of the Department should be held over until the Bishop of Saskatchewan has returned from England, and has had opportunity to give personal attention to the matter.\n\nI know that the Bishop is very anxious to keep open any Indian Day Schools that are meeting a real need, but at the same time he is aware that the Department must consider carefully, the question of efficiency and cost. If your Department can delay decision until the Bishop's return, I am sure that he will appreciate your consideration.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCharles W. McKim\nActing Chairman of Commission.\nOttawa, December 7th, 1926.\n\nVery Rev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the last instant, enclosing a communication which you received from Rev. E.

We are informing Mr. Commissioner Graham and Mr. Agent Macdonald accordingly. I shall be pleased, however, if you will draw this matter to the attention of His Lordship the Bishop upon his return, when the Department will be pleased to receive his views regarding the closing of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Canon McKim and the local missionary have requested that, owing to the absence of His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan, the closing of this school be held over until the Bishop has returned from England and has had an opportunity to give his personal attention to the matter. They request that the school be continued in operation until, at least, the end of the present school year, June 30th, next, and the Department is concurring in this request.\n\nRev.

E. Ahenakew who is now in charge of our Indian Work in the district including Red Pheasant, and he is of the opinion that it would be difficult to test out the situation at Red Pheasants if only one teacher is employed and the meals formerly given to pupils discontinued. We are anxious to see what can be done to build up the work there and Mr. Ahenakew believes that with the right staff good results may be obtained by the end of June, but he feels strongly that a teacher without an assistant can hardly cope with the needs of the situation.\n\nWe have in view a Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds who are in every way exceptionally well qualified for the work at Red Pheasants but they could not go for the salary of one. Mr. Reynolds now holds a good position as principal of a school at Crescent Hill, Sask. He is anxious to take up the work at Red Pheasants but it would be necessary to have Mrs. Reynolds appointed as Matron at the usual salary in order that Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds could afford to make the change. Would your department please consider continuing the position and salary of Matron for the balance of the school year so that we might try out the school with Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds? The Reynolds could go in a month's time and that would give them about four months at Red Pheasants.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCharles W. McKim\nVice Chairman of Bishop's Commission\n\nIndian Affairs.

INSPECTOR MAGEE,\ndated September 27th, 1927, on his in-\nspection of the Red Pheasant Indian\nDay School.\n\nOriginal on File 105-6-6.\n\nTeacher - Henry Reynolds.\n\nSuccess. - Fair. An energetic and alert teacher\nbut not fully in sympathy with his pupils who\ndiffer in mode of thought from children of white\nparents.\n\nThe teacher is confining his attention\nto reading, writing, number-work, nature work and\nmodelling with plasticine. He has not paid much\nattention as yet to drawing and I suggested to\nhim that he might use this as a means of interest-\ning his pupils and leading them thus to a greater\ninterest in other school work. He is also giving\nsome attention to the practice of oral composition.\nThe children are not advanced beyond Grade 1.\n\nWhat is wanted of a teacher in such a\nschool, it seems to me, is that he (or she) should\nbe so in sympathy with the pupils that he would\nlearn what interests them and make use of such\nmaterial to prepare reading, number-work, and com-\nposition lessons which would especially appeal to\nthe minds of these pupils for it is not natural\nthat the same things would interest these pupils\nas is of interest to white children.\nRED PHEASANT AND STONY DAY SCHOOL\n\nI visited this school on January 20th. Mr. H. Reynolds has been appointed as teacher since my last visit, and his wife as Field Matron for the reserves. Mrs. Reynolds also prepares the mid-day meal for the school children. They both impressed me as being well qualified to fill their respective positions.\n\nThere are 24 pupils enrolled: 12 boys and 12 girls. There were 19 present: 10 boys and 9 girls.\n\nThe average attendance for the December Quarter was 16.39 but an improvement was noted in the attendance for January. Two drivers are provided and there should be no excuse for not having a full attendance except in cases of sickness.\n\nThe parents are indifferent and do not appear to appreciate and take an active interest in the school. The attendance has been better under Mr. Reynolds and I look for further improvement as his influence becomes greater.\n\nAs an example of the attitude of the Indians I spoke to one man who resides not more than three\nhundred yards from the school and asked him why his children were not attending. His excuse was that the driver had not called for them and if we wanted the children we should see that the driver brought them. I talked to that Indian quite forcibly.\n\nThe pupils were clean and warmly clothed although some of them had a ragged appearance.\n\nThe school-room was clean but should be re-decorated. The twelve double desks are old and broken and will have to be replaced very soon.\n\nWash basins and individual towels are provided and the children required to clean up each morning.\n\nWater is obtained from a well. The supply is ample and of good quality. The school premises were tidy but the fence requires repairing.\n\nMrs. Reynolds visits the houses on the reserves and appears to be very interested in her work.\nRegina, Sask., Feb. 16th, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report on the various schools in the Battleford Agency which were visited by Mr. Inspector Murison during the month of January.\n\nIt is noted that there is an improvement at the Red Pheasant and Stony Day School under the management of Mr. Reynolds. I believe he will make a good teacher.\n\nW. M. Graham.\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, February 23rd, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received the report of Mr. Inspector Murison on his inspection of the Red Pheasant Indian Day School in January, last. He states that the schoolroom, while clean, should be redecorated and that 12 of the double desks are old and broken and will soon have to be replaced. He also states that the fence requires repairs.\n\nPlease furnish a report at your early convenience as to the redecoration required to the interior of the school, and also state whether it is necessary to supply any new desks. You should also report on the repairs required to the fence. An estimate of the cost of the redecoration and repairs to the fence should be stated. If you recommend that any new desks be supplied, you should give the sizes and number of each size, also the name of the manufacturer of the desks at present in the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nRED PHEASANT DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThis School is on the Red Pheasant reserve and close to the boundary of the Stony reserve and is to supply the needs of both reserves.\n\nIt is under the Anglican church but supposed to Non-denominational and for the use of the Catholics as well, but is not very successfull in so far as the Catholics attending, some do attend, but there is always a sort of underground opposition from the parents and Missionaries.\n\nThe present teacher is Mr Henry Reynolds assisted by Mrs Reynolds as Field Matron and they are doing very good work, both attendance and progress being better than they have been for a long time. They take a genuine interest in the work and are good substantial people and already have the full confidence of the Indians of both reserves.\n\nTwo school drivers are employed here, one for each reserve and both have circuits of approximately seven miles to make twice a day, they also act as truant officers and usually take quite an interest in seeing the children get to school when they should.\n\nThis as well as Little Pine are improved Day schools where a hot noon meal is served for the Children and in many cases means the health of children. The Field Matrons prepare this mean, which usually consists of Hot stew with Beans, peas, Barley or rice and the usual school biscuit, some days Oatmeal porridge is given as a change and the children all relish this meal.\n\nThe buildings with the exception of some interior decorating that is required and in good shape, and this will be done as soon as the school is closed for the holidays.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to submit herewith the Annual school report for the Battleford Agency, for the year ending March 31st, 1928.\n\nThere are four schools operating in this agency, the Thunderchild Residential school and day schools at Red Pheasant, Little Pines and Thunderchild reserves, with an attendance of approximately 190 children.\n\nS. L. Macdonald,\nIndian Agent.\nThe Superintendent\nof Indian Affairs\nCanada\n\nDear Sir,\n\nNow that the Dominion Government has become fairer and more generous (see Pension), I beg that you will accede to my request, which I have delayed until my husband of the Battleford Court House Staff should be retired, this retirement comes into effect the end of this month after 12 years service; he is 72 years of age, his monthly salary is now $110.00, the pension will probably be half that amount, an impossible sum for two people of our age to live on.\n\nI am asking for a Pension for myself on account of 24 years continuous service as a Department Teacher on Indian Reserves (with never a reprimand) at a Salary of $25.00 per month\u2014without any other grant from Church or outside sources. Not only did I teach, but cut out the clothes for my pupils & helped the mothers to make them; provided a daily lunch at our own house and expense, to encourage children to attend, also acted as housekeeper for all these years\u2014without any of the modern buildings and comforts now provided for department officials.\n\nIt is worth a good Pension from the time I resigned, for an educated white woman to have lived among Indians for 24 years. It would not create a precedent; for to my knowledge, there is no other Day School Teacher in Saskatchewan, with such length of service, I am now 66 years of age.\n\nI commenced teaching 21 September 1888, in the Day School on John Smith's Reserve, Duck Lake Agency, living there with my brother who was farming Instructor and unmarried; after several years we were exchanged with W. M. Joseph Price, Red Pheasants Reserve, Battleford Agency. My brother left Battleford for the South African Campaign\u2014Sometime afterwards I married Robert Jefferson, farming Instructor of that Reserve & also of the Stony Reserve, I still taught until 1912.\n\nIndian Affairs.

D. McLean\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMrs. Robt. Jefferson,\nBox 426,\nBattleford, Sask.\nRed Pheasant and Stony Indian Day School:\n\nThe school is in charge of Mr. H. Reynolds and the roll calls for nineteen pupils. There were only ten present, six boys and four girls. The grades range as follows:\n\n- Grade 1 - 9\n- Grade 2 - 4\n- Grade 3 - 6\n\nThe attendance is only fair and I understand this is pretty much the case throughout the year.\n\nThe school is in good repair and was painted this year.\n\n- The children -\nThe children were clean and fairly well clothed. Progress is slow due, no doubt, to the irregular attendance. At present there are a number of cases of whooping cough on the Red Pheasant Reserve, so that no doubt the attendance will be held back on this account.\n\nA noon-day meal is served and this is prepared in the teacher's residence and served in the children's dining room, which is an addition built on the teacher's residence.\n\nThe teacher here is qualified and exerts his best efforts towards the advancement of the children. His wife, Mrs. Reynolds, acts as Field Matron and I believe renders good service.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSir:\n\nI have an application from Mr Henry Reynolds, Teacher at Red Pheasant, for one week's absence in June to attend the Anglican Synod at Prince Albert, he is keeping the school open an extra week during the Easter Holidays in exchange for it.\n\nAs there was not time to get a reply from the Department, I allowed him to keep the school open for the extra week, feeling sure that his request would be granted.\n\nHe was appointed delegate for the reserve and district to the Synod, I trust that the Department can allow him the week in June.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 14, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, relative to the application of Mr. Henry Reynolds, teacher of the Red Pheasant Indian Day School, for one week's leave of absence in June, next, in order that he can attend the Anglican Synod at Prince Albert.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that you granted Mr. Reynolds permission to keep the school open for one week during the Easter holidays, in order to make up for the period he will be absent in June. The Department approves of leave of absence being granted Mr. Reynolds to attend the Synod; and your action in granting him permission to make up for this time by teaching during the Easter holidays is approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI am both especially under the present conditions to put any employee out of a position, but at the same time would feel remiss, if I did not report what I cannot help consider as unjustified expenditure.\n\nI refer to the Red Pleasant Day School; this school is kept up, with a Teacher, two drivers and a hot noon meal prepared by the Field matron at an annual cost of well over $2000.00, for an average attendance of approximately 11, making the cost per child in excess of the Boarding schools.\n\nThe attendance is poor, irregular and with the frequent absences, and the Indians apparently are indifferent and continual coercion is required to keep the attendance at what it is and in my estimation with a very few exceptions is very little benefit and they might better be at Boarding schools.\n\nThe above situation is no fault of the staff or Teacher, Mr Reynolds has worked hard and Mrs Reynolds was one of the best Matrons we have ever had. This school never was a success and in my opinion never will be, as stated, the Indians are indifferent and scattered over too big an area and on the move all the time.\n\nThe closing of this school for a while, might forceably bring home to the Indians, the benefits they have neglected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 25, 1932.\n\nDear Bishop Hallam:\n\nYour Lordship will remember that, during our recent interview, there was one school with which the Department was not altogether satisfied. I have examined our files and I find I had reference to the Red Pheasant Indian Day School. This has been kept open during the past 4 years, at an average cost for current expenses of $2,400, with an additional $250 per annum expended on buildings, etc. The average attendance for the past year has been 11 pupils, and Mr. Indian Agent Macdonald, of Battleford, in a recent report, states the Indians are indifferent to the benefits of the school. It is true that they are scattered over a large area, but it should be remembered that there are two vans engaged by the Department for the daily journey to the classroom. These Indians move around for a part of each year, and this, of course, hurts the success of the school.\n\nAs I review the file, I find that the attendance has never been very satisfactory. Mr. Inspector Murison visited this school in January of 1928. At that time, he reported in part as follows: \"The parents are indifferent and do not appear to appreciate or take an active interest in the school. The attendance has been better under Mr. Reynolds. I look for further improvement as his influence becomes greater.\" It is, unfortunately, true that since that time the attendance has dropped off. The Department does not believe that Mr. Reynolds is\n\n- largely\n\nRight Rev. W. T. Hallam, D. D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nBishopsthorpe,\nPrince Albert,\nSask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6291, file 618-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nlargely responsible for this situation, but there is no doubt but what he could do a great deal towards securing a better attendance.\n\nWhen Canon McKim, early in 1927, urged the Department to keep this school open, he wrote in part as follows: \"We are anxious to see what can be done to build up the work there, and Mr. Ahenakew believes that with the right staff good results may be obtained.\"\n\nThe Department feels that this school has been given a good trial and that the time has now come when we should seriously consider closing it and recruiting the pupils for the residential schools. Mr. Public School Inspector Veazey wrote in part, in June, 1930: \"Success: only fair, as conditions have not been conducive to the best results. . . . The boarding schools are the best solution. The living conditions on this reserve are not such as will stimulate education. If the children could be separated from their parents while the latter roamed about, something might be accomplished.\"\n\nThe Department is today writing Mr. Indian Agent Macdonald, asking him to notify the teacher and the Indians interested that the school will be on trial during the month of May. Mr. Macdonald will make a special report on or about the first of June. If Your Lordship can add anything to the information before the Department, or if you wish to make a recommendation concerning this school, please do so about the date of the agent's report, so that, at that time, the question of re-opening the school in September can be considered.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, April 25, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 929-302 of the 24th ultimo, with reference to the Red Pheasant Indian Day School. The Department is writing to the Lord Bishop of Saskatchewan in this connection. You may infer the teacher and the Indians of the two Bands that the Department is seriously considering closing the school at the end of June and that you have been asked to make a special report about the first of June. If you believe this warning will have a salutary effect on the attendance and on the general interest of the parents, the Department, after hearing from the church authorities, might reopen the school next fall for further trial period.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford,\nSask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6291, file 618-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr. Dennis,\n\nThank you for your letter of April 25th re Red Frog Indian Day School.\n\nOur missionary Payne visited there early in May and I have asked him to write to you about it.\n\nMy enquiries have elicited the following information pertinent to the matter:\n\n- There was considerable infectious disease among the children last winter.\n- The snow was very deep last winter and this had two results:\n  - The carriers of the virus drove only to underground in some cases.\n  - Some of the children who had not sufficient clothing or footwear were unable to ward off the verminous. (The great interest of the east in Western Relief has limited the clothing available for Indians quite very much.)\n- During May there have been 29 children in attendance on several occasions.\n\nIn view of these things the Executive Committee of our mission at the quarterly meeting next...\nwe will pass a resolution strongly urging\nthe Department to continue its school.\n\nIt is evident from its attendance this\nmorning that there are many children to be\nlooked after and that the parents appreciate\nits school when its close was threatened.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.T. Saskatchewan\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6291, file 618-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nI have heard that the Department have been contemplating closing the Indian Day School at Red Pheasant in the Battleford Agency. Last winter, owing to sickness amongst the children, an unusually severe winter, the attendance was low, but it improved as soon as the children recovered. Spring opened up. I was at the school on May 9th, 29 children were in attendance. I hope therefore that the Department will do its way clear to keep this school open, as I am sure it is for the benefit of the Indians on both Red Pheasant and Stony Reserves to have the school running. Mr. Reynolds, the Teacher, has been doing all he can to secure a good attendance, and his efforts appear to have been successful. Provided that there is no epidemic amongst the children I do not think the attendance will fall off so much next winter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.J. Paul.\nOttawa, June 20, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to my letter of this file, of April 25th, last, concerning the Red Pheasant Indian Day School. The Department will be glad to have your report, so that a final decision can be made with reference to the future of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford,\nSask.\nSir:\n\nI have Department letter 105-6-1, June 20th, re the Red Pheasant Day School.\n\nThe attendance has been good right up to date and the average for the month will run about 20 would have been better but there was some Flu on reserves that kept some of the children home.\n\nThe Indians do not want the school closed and I feel confident, that the attendance will now be kept up better and as soon as there is any sign of a drop, they will be warned and the Department notified.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 5, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, concerning the Red Pheasant Indian Day School. It is noted that the attendance has been regular, also that the Indians do not want the school closed. The Department will approve of the continuing of the school for a further period. It is hoped that the Indians will see that their children attend regularly.\n\nWe are informing His Lordship Bishop Hallam that the work at this school is to be continued.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nOttawa, July 5, 1932.\n\nDear Bishop Hallam:\n\nReferring to my letter dated April 25th, last, regarding the Red Pheasant Indian Day School, I have now to inform Your Lordship that, after further correspondence with the local Indian Agent, it has been decided to continue this school in operation. In reviewing the last return received, it is noted that an improvement in attendance is shown. The Indians do not want this school closed, and they have promised a more regular attendance of their children. The local Indian Agent is being informed that the school is to continue in operation.\n\nI may add that a communication was received from Archdeacon W. E. J. Paul regarding the matter, and recommending that the school be continued.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRight Rev. W. T. Hallam, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nBishopsthorpe,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nDear Mr. McKenzie:\n\nRe: Red Pheasant Indian School,\nYour Number 105 - 6 - 1\n\nI had the opportunity of a conversation with Mr. H. Reynolds, teacher at the Red Pheasant Indian Day School recently and in telling him of your decision to continue the school I noticed a statement in your letter of April 28th on this subject that \"this school has been kept open during the past four years at an average cost for current expenses of $2,400.00 with an additional $250.00 per annum expended on the place\". Mr. Reynolds makes this statement in a letter subsequent to my interview \"For the last five years this school has been conducted as economically as it has been possible to do so regarding repairs and renewals. The residence has only been examined once at the expense of the Department, in 1930. No paint except one gallon for stairs and hall has been supplied. For three years, no seed potatoes have been supplied, and this year no seed of any description has been received.\n\nSince June of this year the following have been requisitioned:- one bag cement to repair foundation of school and chimney of residence; one spool of barb wire and 10 lbs. staples to repair pasture fence; $3.00 to moving toilets, last moved in 1928; $3.00 to cleaning all chimneys and the stove pipes in the school and children's dining room; $5.00 and 10 lbs. nails to putting up an old shed erected by my predecessor out of second hand lumber. This shed was blown down during a terrific windstorm on June 29th. Luckily the stable was not damaged in any way.\n\nMy wife and I frequently try to impress upon the Indians how the Department are practising the strictest economy in every way, particularly since our receiving the circular from the Department emphasizing economy.\"\n\nI should be glad if you would have this checked up from the requisition sheets and the account of grants which have been made. This seems to me economy which is commendable so long as the places are kept in repair. Another matter on Mr. Reynolds behalf I should like to draw your attention to the fact that his salary is $85.00 per month\nless 10% which works out to $765.00 per annum. Mr. Reynolds has the same experience as some teachers who are receiving a larger remuneration.\n\nWill you be able to allow any part payment for Mrs. Reynolds for field-matron work? Since April 1st, dinners have been cooked for the school children each school day, medicines dispensed and dressings done.\n\nMr. Reynolds tells me that since the school opened this fall the attendance is encouraging.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBp/MF\n\nA. F. McKenzie, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 22nd, 1932.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, with further reference to the Red Pheasant Indian Day School. As you were informed in official letter of July 5th, last, it has been decided to continue this school in operation. Owing to regulations recently issued, it will not be possible for the Department to increase the salary of the teacher. I also regret that no payment can be allowed for field matron work.\n\nThe information given in official letter of April 25th with reference to the cost of operating the Red Pheasant Indian Day School was taken from the annual reports of the Auditor General.\n\nIn commenting on the expenditures incurred at this school in the last five years, Mr. Reynolds apparently overlooked the fact that the Department expended approximately $500 in August, 1930, in painting the buildings. With reference to the shed which was blown down during the wind storm in June, the Indian Agent estimated the cost of repairs at $85.00.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,-\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRt.

Under these circumstances, the Department considers that it would be in the best interests of the work at the Red Pheasant School to dispense with the services of Mr. Reynolds from June 30th, 1937.\n\nThe Department has always allowed Your Lordship to nominate a teacher for this school, and I would appreciate if you would arrange to select two or three teachers whom you consider might be able to handle the Red Pheasant School. They should be requested to interview Mr. S. L. Macdonald, Indian Agent, Battleford, Sask. He is fully conversant with local conditions on the reserve, and we would like to have him select, from your nominees, the teacher whom he considers most suitable.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRight Rev. W. T. Hallam, M.A., D.D.,\n628 University Drive,\nSaskatoon, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith Inspector Innes' report on the Red Pheasant and Stoney Indian Day School in the Battleford Agency.\n\nThis report shows that no improvement has been made during the past year. A year ago the question of either transferring or dispensing with the services of this teacher was under consideration, see your No. 105-6-6, dated the 16th January, 1936. My recommendation is to dispense with the services of the teacher.\n\nI am not in favor of transferring a teacher who has fallen down in one school to another. In my opinion there has been too much of this done in the past. If a teacher is a 'square peg in a round hole' in one school, he will be the same in another. It is not as though we were transferring him to another occupation.\n\nI think the time has come when the Department should have some say in the selection of our school teachers. In my opinion, the Department should require that the teacher receive the approval of the Indian Agent before being appointed.\n\nMany of our teachers take no interest in the children outside the school. There are a few who do and the improvement in such districts is remarkable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThos. Robertson, D.D.S.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nBattleford, Sask.,\nOctober 5th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith my monthly report for the Battleford Agency for the month ending Sept. 30th, 1936.\n\nNo.7 Generali\n\nThe schools are all going with a fair attendance, and the health of the children generally has been good to date. The attendance is very good as usual at the Little Pine Day School, and is holding up well at the Red Pheasant Day School, and will improve there as soon as the hay camps are broken up, and the Indians come back to their regular homes. I can also report an improvement in the attendance at the Thunderchild Day School, and it is hoped there will still be a few more when the Indians settle down for the winter.\n\nAll the schools in the agency were visited during the month with the exception of Beauval, and it is my intention to visit that school shortly, and will report conditions there in my next report.\n\nS. L. Macdonald,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 24th, 1933.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the Red Pheasant Indian Day School.\n\nAs you are, no doubt, aware, our appropriation this year has been considerably reduced and it has been found necessary to curtail expenses as far as possible. The driving of the children amounts to a considerable sum each year and, in a report received from the Indian Agent, he states that, on the Red Pheasant Reserve, there are about five families, all of whom are within a mile and a half from the school. The Agent considered that the ten or twelve children belonging to these families could easily walk to the school and he was, therefore, instructed to discontinue the driving of these children from March 31st, last.\n\nIt was further decided to continue the driving of the children from the Stony Reserve until the end of the present school year in June, next. Before the school reopens after the holidays, the Department will decide if funds can be found to continue driving these children for the next academic year.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6291, file 618-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMy dear Mr. MacKenzie:\n\nThe Indians on the Red Pheasant Reserve are very disturbed over the rumors which have reached them regarding the Department's reported reluctance to continue the school at Red Pheasant. The withdrawing of one of the drivers who collect the children for the day School will make it very difficult for some of the children to reach the school. The Indians fear that it will put down the average of their attendance and they are most anxious to retain the school. You, no doubt, have been advised from other sources that the average attendance for the term October to December was 25.28 out of 27 on the roll (percentage 93.2), from January to March 10th the average is 19.56 out of 27 on the roll (percentage 72.4). Considering the weather for the months involved since the New Year, the attendance has been very good. There was also an outbreak of flu during January and February. The Archdeacon who knows the situation very well writes: \"I do not think the Stony Indians could be expected to send their children to school from their new farms across the railway, some of which are seven miles from the school. It is considerably cheaper for the Department to provide transportation for these children than to give them a school of their own.\" You will notice that some of the Indians in their anxiety to retain the school privileges had thought of moving in nearer the school but this would hamper very much the Department's encouragement of farming among the Indians, because they must scatter where there is suitable land.\" The Archdeacon is of the opinion that it would be advisable to continue both drivers for the school and that the Stony driver at least should not be discontinued.\n\nI am sending you herewith a petition which has come in from the Indian Bands.\n\nI hope the Department will be able to retain this school which the Indians value so much.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.T. Saskatoon\n\nEp/MF\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nTo the Right Rev. Bishop Hallam,\nLord Bishop of Saskatoon.\n\nA mass meeting of the above bands of Indians was held on March 16th to discuss the future of the School.\n\nWe are much concerned about its threatened closure and earnestly appeal to your Lordship to approach the authorities at Ottawa on our behalf. The discontinuance of the School vans will have a marked effect on the attendance and this may influence the Dept. to close the School.\n\nSome of the parents are so far away from the School (3 to 7 miles) that it would be an impossibility for them to send their children.\n\nSeveral of the parents thought at first to build small houses near the school, but after careful consideration it was felt that such a plan would seriously interfere with farm operations.\n\nHowever, if the Dept. are still determined to discontinue the School Drivers we earnestly appeal to your Lordship to use your influence in favour of our school. We want our children.\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nchildren may help at home or the farm.\n\nWe apologize for encroaching on your valuable time but feel sure you will help in this matter.\n\nWe are\nYour Lordship's obedient servant,\n\nPeter Brettennee\nChas Soonias\n+ Thomas Moosomin\nx Peter Star chief\nMarch 16, 1933.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nRED PHEASANT INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nThis school is located in the diocese of Saskatoon and conducted under the auspices of the Right Reverend W.

In making this selection, you should consider not only professional qualifications but also the importance of a teacher taking a continued interest in the children outside of classroom hours.\n\nWhen you have definitely decided on one of the Bishop's nominees, you should advise the Department, giving name and full information.\n\nAbout May first you should advise Mr. Reynolds that his services will not be required after the end of June.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nR.

I might add, that a Miss Harriet McDonald also applied but being single does not qualify as well as a married couple.\n\nMr Plunket reported here a week ago, but some reports I had received were not to his advantage and he did not seem aggressive enough for this particular school.\n\nMr Morgan called on this date, he holds a first Class Certificate, is well qualified for Manual work and appeared to me to have all the qualifications for a good Indian Teacher, he has never taught any Indian school before, but this might be more to the advantage of all, than otherwise, he has a wife and two children and Mrs Morgan who came with him, has had experience in Nursing and is fully qualified for first Aid work, is a bright cheery woman and would be a good addition to any Community.\n\nI view of the above, I would recommend, that Mr Morgan be appointed Teacher to fill the Red Pheasant vacancy and as he has the offer of another school I would ask the Department to wire Mr Morgan, so that he can notify his other school and move his furniture, as the time of opening the school is now short. I have informed him that in the event of his appointment, that he will receive full instructions from the Superintendent of Schools.\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to Right Rev W.T. Hallam, D.D. Bishop of Saskatoon, for his advice.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

L. Macdonald,\nIndian Agent.\nThe schools all reopened again at the first of the month, with good attendances that are well over last year's attendance and they have all been visited and everything in this respect is going in good order.\n\nThe same teachers are at Little Pine and Thunderchild Bay schools, but a new teacher, Mr. Morgan has taken over the Red Pheasant school and already a big improvement is noticeable in every respect, it is his first experience at an Indian school and I believe this will be to the benefit of both the school and the Indians.\n\nS.L. Macdonald,\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the Battleford Agency.\n\nRed Pheasant School\n\nThis school is a good demonstration of what can be done by a man and woman who consider their duties extend beyond teaching the children to read and write.\n\nMr. Morgan, in addition to teaching the regular classes, instructs the boys in gardening, etc. Mrs. Morgan teaches sewing, knitting, etc. In addition to this, Mrs. Morgan, assisted by Mrs. Lockhart, the Farming Instructor's wife, has organized the women into a Homemakers' Club. They have 32 paid-up members at the present time. This club meets regularly and instructions are given in sewing, knitting, craft work, kitchen science, etc. At one time they set aside certain meetings for social entertaining, but the women of the reserve asked that these social meetings be discontinued and all given to lessons and study.\n\nAverage attendance 1936-37, 15. For 1937-38, 22.5. At the present time the average is 32.\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nSaskatchewan.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the exceptionally good showing both in attendance and progress at the Red Pheasant Day school, I would strongly recommend that the Teacher Mr E.A. Morgan be given an increase in salary. Teachers of this class are hard to get and when we get one, it is only proper that they should receive encouragement. We give all possible here and you have backed his efforts to the limit, but the results he is showing merit an increase; he has made this into a real school, something that it never was before and both he and Mrs Morgan are doing great work at these reserves, not only in the school but in the family life of the Indians and after only one year, their efforts are reflected in nearly all the homes and the whole attitude of the Indians to the school has made a right about face and outside of the teaching, it is looked on as a social headquarters for the Indians.\n\nBesides the regular sewing and knitting classes by Mrs Morgan, she has regular meetings of the women where sewing, housekeeping, care of children etc., even home gardening is taken up as the Homemakers club and they are getting results.\n\nMr Morgan might be classed as a handyman, fair Carpenter and can turn his hand to any odd jobs and helps and advises the Indians on home building and has model plans for Indian homes, that he is trying to get them to follow as new homes are built, so it can be seen, that they are spreading their activities to cover all home life and work and results of this description are of great value to both the Indians and the Department, and I trust, that this will be given consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nDr Thos Robertson,\nInspector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., Aug. 30, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of the attached letter from Mr. Macdonald, Battleford, recommending an increase in salary for Mr. E. A. Morgan, teacher, Red Pheasant Reserve.\n\nI can only endorse all Mr. Macdonald states in his letter. Mr. and Mrs. Morgan have made a real effort. They have not only increased the attendance, but have inspired the children and the members of the Band with a desire to learn and to improve their home conditions. Neither hours nor holidays count with them. They are on the job 24 hours a day if necessary. In their efforts they have been well supported by the Farming Instructor and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Lockhart. Mrs. Lockhart has devoted a great deal of time, together with Mrs. Morgan, in carrying the educational work into the homes. In this instance I can truthfully state we are receiving the services of four people while only paying for two.\n\nI have no hesitation in recommending Mr. Morgan's salary be increased to $1200.00 a year, not only in recognition of the work he is carrying on, but also because it would be a tragedy if we were to lose the services of these two people.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept' of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nTR/Flc\nOttawa,\nSeptember 7, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo with reference to Mr. Morgan, teacher of the Red Pheasant Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department appreciates that some financial recompense should be given to Mr. and Mrs. Morgan for the work that is being done outside of the school but present regulations do not permit our making any payment to a teacher other than for the work that such teacher is actually doing in the class room. I have discussed your recommendation with Doctor Stone and I understand that the Justice Department is being requested for a ruling with reference to our authority to make payments for what might be called social service work. You might bring this case to our attention again about the end of December at which time your recommendation will be further considered.\n\nIn the meantime you may advise Mr. Morgan that it has been decided to increase his salary as teacher of the Red Pheasant School from $950.00 to $950.00 a year effective from September 1, 1938.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

The teacher's wife and the Farming Instructor's wife are carrying on a Homemakers' Club among the women, getting splendid results. They meet every two weeks, when an address is given by the Medical Officer or some outsider on health, care of children, baking, cooking, canning, or other matters pertaining to the home. In addition to this address they are taught actual dressmaking mending, repairing, cooking, baking, canning fruit and vegetables, etc. Some of these Indian women have as high as 84 quarts of fruit, vegetables, etc., canned and put away for winter use. This is something that was practically unknown on this reserve previously.\n\nThos.

Miss Cunningham at Little Pine has her school right up to standard as usual, but the day school at Thunderchild is lagging, the teacher has every qualification, but is not up to the mark and a change should be made there at the end of this year and a married couple taken on so that some welfare work can be started.\n\nS.L.

Will you kindly advise if anything can be now done in this matter.\n\nI might say that Mr. Morgan started a Night School the first of November for the older members of his Reserve. He advises the response has not been as great as he expected, but that he has an enrollment of 11 and an average attendance of 6.4.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

The Red Pheasant school was closed for awhile on account of Scarlet Fever, but is going again.\n\nS. L. Macdonald,\nAgent.\nTo Dr. McGill\n\nReport on Red Pheasant Indian Day School\n\nI visited the above mentioned school on October 9th. At the time of my inspection the teacher was absent but I met him on his way to town, where he was attending a teacher's convention.\n\nThe school is a frame building and quite old. I was informed by the Agent that he had word from the Branch last year that a new school was to be erected here, only on a different site. The building, although old, appeared to be in a fair state of repair. I also visited the home of Mr. Morgan, the teacher, and had a conversation with Mrs. Morgan. She informed me that the house was still quite comfortable.\n\nThis institution serves both the Stoney and Red Pheasant Reserves and I am afraid the Indian children do not attend very regularly, as some of them live quite a distance from the school and it is too cold for them to walk long distances in Winter. However, as I pointed out in my general report, some of the Stoney Indians move to a village during the Winter time, where the houses are very unsanitary. There is a mid-day meal given at the school and it is cooked by Mrs. Morgan in her home.\n\nI expect to receive a Provincial Inspector's report on this school shortly and I will then take up the matter of the attendance with the Indian Agent, as from my observation there might have been more children attending this Institution than there were.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Agencies.\nBattleford Agency\nBattleford, Sask.\n3rd April, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit my report for the month of March, 1941, as follows:\n\nAttendance at the Red Pheasant Day School has fallen away badly this winter. This is partly due to the fact that transportation of the children, at the expense of the Department, was reduced this term, partly due to the fact that the Indians are very poor and unable to purchase suitable clothing for the long walk for the children in the cold. In addition, there is a resentment of the Indians towards the teacher, whose heart is very much in the war, ever since it started, but not very much in the school. This man, (Mr. C.E. Morgan) had a good school until the war started, but ever since the beginning of last term, he has been trying to get into the army. I have a feeling now that, the sooner he gets into the army, the better it will be for the school. I believe, also, that for next winter, the transportation facilities will have to be restored to this school.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\n\nJ.P.B.

She has a second-class permanent teacher's certificate and has had five years' experience in teaching in white schools, and two years' experience in Indian work.

However, I met Mrs. Ross who has been teaching on the Red Pheasant Reserve and Mr. and Mrs. C.W. Foan who have been teaching on the Little Pine Reserve.\n\nWhile I was at the school on the Little Pine Reserve Mr. Foan pointed out to me that some paint and kalsomine was necessary for the interior of the school and I advised him to send a requisition for this to Agent Ostrander. He did so while I was there and I hope this kalsomine and paint will be allowed.\n\nWhen I last visited the school at Little Pine one and one half years ago I was not greatly impressed with Mr. Foan. However, he and his wife impressed me much better on this trip and I believe they are capable of doing good work. Mrs. Foan especially impressed me as being a very capable young woman and in the future we will have to depend on her to handle the homemakers' work on this reserve.\n\nOn the Thunderchild Reserve Mrs. Palmer has left and I understand she is not returning to the reserve, therefore we are losing one of the most efficient women who has ever been in the Indian work. This is saying a lot but I know it is true. Mr. Ostrander suggested that when the school re-opens in the Fall Mrs. Ross who was teaching at Red Pheasant, be transferred to Thunderchild where the Palmers were, as he is of the opinion that she will work well with the farming instructor and his wife on that reserve. One evening while I was at Battleford Mr. Ostrander brought Mrs. Ross in to see me at the hotel and I had quite a chat with her. I was well impressed with her.....\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nwell impressed with her attitude and she seemed to appreciate having this work as she and her husband lived on a dried out farm.\n\nI believe Mr. Ostrander's suggestion is a good one and I hope it will be considered by the Branch when the matter comes up for discussion.\n\nI also mentioned this to Mr. Doucet when he was here.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

Then, with a view to saving fuel and transportation difficulties, closing again for the months of January and February.\n\nI discussed this with the Indians of the Red Pheasant Reserve last week and they said that they were quite favourable towards the change if the Department could make such arrangement. I have not discussed it with the Indians of the Little Pine and Thunderchild Reserves, where we also have day schools, but would do so if the Department favours the change, and I believe that the Indians of these bands, also, would agree.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMarch 24, 1943.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander, Indian Agent, Battleford, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, suggesting a change in the opening and closing dates of the Indian day schools in your Agency.\n\nFor your information I may say that provision is being made in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1943-44 for a ten-month term at all Indian day schools and consequently these schools will re-open on September 1. This means that there will only be the usual two-month holiday period in July and August this year.\n\nThere are a great many reasons, both from an academic viewpoint and from the health standpoint, that make it undesirable to operate schools during the months of July and August. The interruption that would occur in the continuity of the academic work if your suggestion were followed is considered too great to permit our considering it.\n\nR.A. Hosy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA\n\nI wish to inform you I am in receipt of a letter from Mr. Ostreider in connection with Mr. Gilmour, father of Mrs. Macdonald, teacher at the Day School on the Red Pheasant Reserve.\n\nHe states Mr. Gilmour often goes to the reserve and stays with his daughter. Mr. Mackie, the farming instructor for that reserve was trying to get a resolution of the band in connection with the sale of wood and Mr. Gilmour happened to be there. These are the remarks he made: \"Why should they sign Timber Regulation petition?\" ; \"The Indians are treated as slaves by the Department?\" ; \"Also I was looking into this business and had written to Piapot to enquire how their resolution was written. It happened to be the same as written out for the Red Pheasant Indians to sign. I think the Indians in signing this, they were signing away their rights.\"; \"In my opinion Community Farming was following the same system as Stalin is\".\n\nNaturally the Indians refused to sign the resolution.\n\nM.

If she\nis not disposed to do this and you feel definitely\ncertain that Mr. Gilmour has acted in the way it\nhas been reported to you, he should be treated as\na trespasser on the reserve.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDepartment of Mines & Resources, Indian Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nMrs. T.E. McDonald has tendered her resignation as teacher of the Red Pheasant Indian Day School, to take effect June 30th, 1944.\n\nAs the attendance for a number of years at this school and progress made has been far from satisfactory which does not warrant the expense of operating this school, I would be very much in favour not re-opening after summer vacation.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJune 7, 1944.\n\nMr. M. Christianson, Gen. Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg., Searth & Victoria, Regina, Sask.\n\nIndian Agent Ostrander has forwarded the resignation of Mrs. T.E. McDonald as teacher of the Red Pheasant Indian Day School, effective June 30, 1944. He writes as follows:\n\n\"As the attendance for a number of years at this school and progress made has been far from satisfactory which does not warrant the expense of operating this school, I would be very much in favour not re-opening after summer vacation.\"\n\nOur records show that for the four quarters ending March 31, 1944, the enrolment varied from 16 to 21 and the average from 8 to 14. As you know, this school has been in operation for many years and, in view of the enrolment and average attendance figures just stated, I do not exactly see why the Agent considers it should be closed. It would be appreciated if you would consult him in the matter and advise what action you think should be taken.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nJune 7, 1944.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander, Indian Agent, Battleford, Sask.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 30th ultimo, you may advise Mrs. T.E. McDonald that the Department accepts her resignation as teacher of the Red Pheasant Indian Day School, effective June 30, 1944.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nJune 8, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Red Pheasant Indian Day School No. 618.\n\nPlease note that the Department has accepted the resignation of the teacher, Mrs. T.E. McDonald, effective July 1, 1944, and no further payment of salary should be made to her after that date.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nAttention of Mr. Phelan.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 105-6-1 of the 7th instant. Upon receipt of it I immediately took the matter up with Mr. Ostrander and I am now in receipt of a communication from him.\n\nProbably one reason for the number of children present on the list of the Red Pheasant Indian Day School is that some of the children who were attending Onion Lake School have been going there since it burnt down and have not as yet gone to Prince Albert to attend the school there but Mr. Ostrander has the following to say:\n\n\"I would feel inclined to re-open this school for the next term if we had the right kind of a teacher, and the decision in this regard should rest with the Church authorities and the responsibility be theirs to get the right kind or we should not re-open the school. If there was a man and wife at this school, and transportation provided, it would be worth while continuing.\"\n\nI more or less agree with the Agent that a man and his wife are necessary at this point.\n\nEvidently the building was condemned by the late Dr. Robertson in 1938. In all due respect to the late Dr. Robertson I wonder whether he was a qualified person to state whether a building was habitable or not. However, apparently the school building is very cold when the weather outside is down to forty degrees below zero.\n\nIn winding up his letter to me Mr. Ostrander has the following to say:\n\n\"My recommendation in this...........\"\n\"My recommendation in this connection would be that if the Church Authorities have the right kind of a teacher in sight, preferably a man with a wife to live with him and assist him, I would be in favour of the appointment being made now, and they could be getting their feet while waiting the building of a new school after the war. If their selection is a young girl with the choice of living alone at the school or boarding with the Farming Instructor and his wife, or the cast-off from some other Indian school, I am definitely against re-opening at this time and it seems that, at the present time, their only choice is either one of this description.\"\n\nIn conclusion I would say that I think it would be a mistake to close down this school at the present time. Let us do the best we can while the war is on and the Church should be able to get a couple that might be fit to carry this institution on for a year or so. I have been at the school in question and know what it is like, and I am going to be there again this Summer. My recommendation would be to ask the Church to endeavour to take over this school for the present time. I am sure if the school is cold we could do something to fix it up a little warmer probably than it is and I shall go into this matter when I visit Battleford Agency during the Summer.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, July 3, 1944.\n\nMr. M. Christianson, General Superintendent of Indian Agencies, Regina, Saskatchewan.\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the Red Pheasant Day School. I know that you will agree that it is going to be extremely difficult to realize Indian Ostrander's wishes at the present time, due to a shortage of teachers both male and female. However, I am writing to Bishop Hallam with regard to this matter. For your information I am inclosing a copy of our letter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, July 3, 1944.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nThe teacher at the Red Pheasant Indian Day School, Mrs. T.E. McDonald has given up duties at the end of June. Consequently, it is necessary to secure another teacher at the Red Pheasant School for the academic year 1944-45.\n\nIndian Agent Ostrander feels that it would be preferable to have a married man as teacher of this school. He feels that it would be a mistake to engage a young female teacher.\n\nI realize the difficulty of securing a qualified male teacher at the present time, but I thought that it would be advisable to bring your attention the Agent's opinion in this matter.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would give this suggestion your usual kind consideration and let me know if there is any prospect of meeting Indian Agent Ostrander's wish.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

MacDonald's resignation from Red Pheasant Indian School. This is to assure you that I am doing my best to secure a teacher for the ensuing year. I note what you say regarding Mr. Ostrander's desire to have a married man at the school. I hope this may be possible. One of the difficulties of the school residence (and also the school) is to find a convenient and adequate water supply.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBp./HD.\n\nR. A.

B. Hives, of Battleford, Sask., whom I have appointed as my Commissary for Indian Affairs of this Diocese. Advertisements have appeared in several of our local papers. As yet we have received no applications.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6291, file 618-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nR.A. Hoey Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 105-6-1.\n\nIn the matter of the Red Pheasant Day School Teacher vacancy I have received an application that seems very desirable from the point of view of the qualifications of the applicant.\n\nFor the work on Red Pheasant Reserve I find myself in complete agreement with Indian Agent Ostrander that a qualified, married, male teacher could best serve the interests of the school there.\n\nThe difficulties however at the reserve which the teacher would have to face and overcome are such that it seems extremely inadequate to offer a qualified man a salary of $900.00.\n\nThe attendance of the school will have to be built up considerably from the low attendance of the past year to the better average that has prevailed there of about 30 children. As no transportation is provided, the children from Stoney are not able to attend. The school building is heated only with great difficulty and the children from Red Pheasant find the excuse of a cold school during the winter a reasonable excuse for non-attendance. The teacher is required to attend to janitor duties and to prepare and serve the mid-day meal.\n\nThe applicant for the position of teacher is a married man with one 9-year old son. He holds a 1st class Sask. certificate and has 1\u00bd year experience on Indian Reserve out of a total of 13\u00bd years of teaching.\n\nI should very much like to secure the services of this man but feel very doubtful that this can be done when so many other vacancies are offering salaries from $1000.00 to $1500.00.\n\nI shall endeavor to retain the interest of the applicant in this school in the hope that the Department will consider the matter of adequate salary and send a favorable reply.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6291, file 618-1, part 2)\nDear Canon Hives:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to a teacher for the Red Pheasant School. The Department is prepared to allow a salary of $100 a teaching month, plus bonus. As the man you have in mind is married with one child, he will receive the maximum bonus of $18.48 a teaching month. In other words, his total monthly salary will be $118.48 from which, of course, there will be some deduction for income tax and also the deduction of 5% from the basic salary which is deposited in the retirement fund and returned to him with interest when he leaves our employ. I trust that you will be able to secure a qualified teacher. I should appreciate hearing from you at an early date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend Canon H.E.

Hoey Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 105-6-1\n\nWith reference to the vacancy for the position of teacher for the Red Pheasant I.R. school, I have received an application from Mr. J. N. Ross of Saskatoon. Having regard to his qualifications I recommend him for the position.\n\nMr. Ross is a married man, thirty eight years of age, with one son. He holds a first class teaching certificate for the Province and has had 13\u00bd years teaching experience. I have notified him of the date of the beginning of the term and asked that he enter upon his duties immediately. I trust that his work will give satisfaction to the Department and that the children will benefit from his instruction.\n\nIt is a matter of satisfaction to me that we have been able at this late date to secure the services of a male teacher having such qualifications. This was possible, no doubt, through the assurance given in your letter of August 23rd that the salary would be $100.00 per teaching month plus bonus amounting in this case to $18.42. I should like to take this opportunity of thanking you for your co-operation in this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

They have come to the conclusion that it would be an impossible task for them to remain.\n\nThere are several repairs needed which would have to be attended to in any case before another teacher could occupy the house or use the school. If the house had been clean and refurbished after the previous occupant had left there might have been a different result in the visit of the Ross's.\n\nI have no other name to submit for the present.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6291, file 618-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, September 7th, 1944.\n\nDear Canon Hives:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 2nd instant, in which you intimate that Mr. Ross has decided against accepting the position of teacher at the Red Pheasant Indian Day School. It is unnecessary to state that this information was very disturbing to the officials of this Branch and to myself.\n\nI may state, by way of explanation, that both the late Dr. Robertson and the General Superintendent of Indian Agencies, Mr. Christianson, have on more than one occasion recommended the construction of a new school on the Red Pheasant Reserve. However, in view of war conditions, the scarcity of labour, the scarcity of materials and the limited funds at our disposal, it was not possible to build this school. As a matter of actual fact, we have not been able to rebuild a dozen or more schools throughout the Dominion that have been destroyed by fire within the last two or three years, and we naturally feel that these schools should have a prior claim upon the Department. Just how soon funds will be placed at our disposal for the repair and construction of school buildings, I am not of course in a position to state. I do know, however, that it is the intention of the Government to proceed with a comprehensive building program in the immediate post-war period. In the meantime, I am communicating with the Indian Agent at Battleford, expressing the hope that he may be able to undertake the repairs necessary to justify the re-opening and operation of the Red Pheasant School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.

G. Kehler of Kleefield, Man.\n\nMr. Kehler is a married man of 34 years of age with teaching experience in the Province of Manitoba. He holds a teaching certificate First Class B permanent # 177-43, and in addition has certain practical qualifications which would be most useful in teaching Indian children.\n\nHaving regard to these qualifications and to his personal references I recommend him for this position and trust that the appointment may be made in due course.\n\nI am pleased that this application will again make possible the re-opening of the school on Red Pheasant Reserve. It is quite difficult at this time to secure the teachers needed for the work in sight as there appears to be considerable shortage.\n\nThe house and school will need the attention of which I wrote you last September. I have already spoken to Acting Indian Agent J.S. Bell and he will be forwarding the necessary requisition in due course. May I ask that this work be done immediately so that the house and school will present a pleasant outlook when Mr. Kehler arrives to take up his work.\n\nWith regard to Little Pine School I have been unable to date to secure names for recommendation for the second teacher at Little Pine.\n\nThanking you for your attention and interest in the above matters,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(W.E.

Kehler as teacher of the Red Pheasant Indian Day School.\n\nI have reviewed your letter of September 2, 1944, and also Mr. Hoey's reply of September 7.\n\nIn addition, we have on file a letter dated September 11, 1944, from the then Indian Agent, in which he wrote in part as follows:-\n\n\"Only six children are now available for attendance at this school unless we are prepared to put on two teams to transport the children to school. In the event that two teams are taking them to school regularly, the attendance would be about fifteen.\"\n\nIn addition, the Agent commented in his letter on the fact that it would take a considerable amount of money to put both the school and residence in proper condition.\n\nIf the same condition prevails this year as last year, namely, that only 6 children are available without transiting children a considerable distance, I doubt the advisability of re-opening the school at the present time. However, I am communicating with the Indian Agent, with a view to ascertaining if conditions have changed. Possibly more children would be available this year than were there last year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. Canon H.E.

Hives, Box 61, Battleford, Sask., nominating Mr.\nP. G. Kehler as teacher of the Red Pheasant Indian Day\nSchool.\n\nAs you are possibly aware, this school was\nclosed at the end of June, 1944, and we have on file a\nletter dated September 11, 1944, from the previous Agent,\nMr. Ostrander. In this letter Mr. Ostrander mentions\nthat only 6 children were available in September, 1944,\nunless we engaged two teams to transport children to\nschool. Even in that event, Mr. Ostrander stated that\nthe attendance would be only 15. Have conditions changed\nthis year? If so, let me know the approximate number of\nchildren who, you consider, would attend regularly if the\nschool was re-opened for the academic year 1945-46.\n\nA review of Mr. Ostrander's letter also shows\nthat both the school and the residence are in bad condi-\ntion and that it would involve a considerable amount of\nfunds to make them comfortable. In the event of your\nconsidering that the re-opening of the school is advisable,\nyou should let me have an estimate of what expenditure would\nbe incurred in making improvements to both the school and\nthe teacher's residence.\n\nYou will, no doubt, have on file a copy of Mr.\nHoey's letter to Mr. Ostrander dated September 18, 1944.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, August 18, 1945.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Canon Hives:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant and my reply of the 7th instant, I understand that before the Red Pheasant School can be re-opened considerable work will be required to repair it.

I believe this is a good suggestion and I trust that Mr. Kohler will be able to get in touch with Acting Agent C. S.

Before any work is done repairing this school, I would suggest that Cannon Hives have Mr. P.G. Kehler go out to Red Pheasant Reserve and size up the situation to see if he would be satisfied with conditions there. Canon Hives is absent from Battleford on holidays, and will be away for two weeks. About a year ago a teacher who was interested went out, when he saw the layout he would not consider staying.\n\nThere are thirteen children of Red Pheasant Reserve, living 3-6 miles, and fifteen children from the Stoney Reserve living 3-6 miles away from the school who should attend.\n\nXX XX XX\n\nC.S.

G. Kehler to the vacancy of teacher on the Red Pheasant Indian Reserve.\n\nIn my letter to Mr. Kehler in answer to his application I had advised him that in due course he would be notified that the nomination forwarded to your office had been accepted and his appointment to the position verified. I understand from your letter that the Department expects that Mr. Kehler will undertake the duties of teacher in due course but this is not explicitly stated. Mr. Bell notifies me that he has had no definite word as to the appointment of Mr. Kehler.\n\nMay I ask that Mr. Kehler be notified of the acceptance of his appointment so that he may make his plans to occupy the position.\n\nIt seems a little unreasonable to ask Mr. Kehler to make a journey from Kleefeld in Manitoba merely to look over the situation before beginning his work. Mr. Kehler has been told of the type of work and the difficulties that are peculiar to work among the Indians.\n\nThe previous applicant for the position of teacher refused to remain at the school having seen the buildings in a most deplorably dirty condition. The house and school have recently been swept and cleaned so that the need for inspection for this reason has been eliminated. There are 12 or 13 children from Red Pheasant Reserve awaiting the reopening of school. It is hoped that children from the Stony Reserve will increase this attendance.\n\nI trust that the school will be reopened forthwith and that the appointment of Mr. Kehler be made. I am writing to Mr. Kehler again advising him that the nomination is apparently acceptable to the department but leaving it to him to decide what action he\nwill take to make the journey until definite word has been given as to his appointment. I had hoped that his appointment would have been approved so that school work could have been resumed at the beginning of September.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.E.

Most of the old staff are still there which is a big help to him. I have not yet been able to get a man to paint the school windows and fire escapes and doubt if I will be able to do so this fall. Battleship linoleum has been purchased for the dining room which will improve the floor there when laid. It is hard to get recruits into the school, as the Indians are clamouring for day schools on the Reserves, and I am very reluctant to use force, though I am afraid this will have to be done.\n\nA.G. Smith\nIndian Agent.\nGeneral Administration\n\nIn addition to the staff shortages mentioned there are three Indian Day Schools in this province closed because of inability to find teachers, namely the Red Pheasant Indian Day School in the Battleford Agency, the Day Star Indian Day School in the Touchwood Agency, and the New Reserve (Little Red River) Indian Day School in the Carlton Agency.\n\nJ.P.B.

I have noticed that no further communication comes whenever the amount of the salary has been mentioned.\n\nThe minimum salary offered in provincial schools is $1200.00 per annum. The teacherage, with fuel, cost of living bonus together with the isolation on these reserves seems to lack somewhat in attracting teachers to these positions.\n\nHowever I am continuing the search for suitable teachers and am hopeful that nominations will be sent forward in due course.\n\nWith regard to the Little Pine School because of the promise of an experienced teacher who is not free at present to take over the school but who will definitely do so next year, the Rev. A. Spence has signified his willingness to continue his teaching for the present year. Therefore I send his nomination forward to the Department for reappointment as teacher.\n\nI have assured him that a second teacher will be nominated to assist him when a suitable applicant comes forward. This is of course in agreement with the Department's policy of which we have\nnot heretofore been able to take advantage.\n\nI am at present in communication with Miss M C Stephen of Prince Albert, and with Miss Lillian Johnstone of St Walburg, and with Miss Beatrice Gilling of Humboldt.\n\nIf at any time there is the possibility of an increase in the salary to be offered to prospective teachers, I should be grateful to have the information.\n\nThanking you,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This will make the salary for the 10 month period approximately $1,240.00. I trust that you will be able to secure qualified teachers.

Lindberg, I have been unsuccessful in securing a successor to Mrs. Lindberg.\n\nThree very favorable applicants were interviewed but for reasons beyond the scope of the department's influence made the appointment impossible.\n\nI have therefore made further contact with Mrs. Lindberg, who has been living near the reserve and operating with her husband a small country store, to see if she would consider returning to the school for a period of one year that is until next June 30th. This course was taken after representations were made by several of the Indian parents of children attending school who were pleased with the progress of their children under Mrs. Lindberg, and an apparent desire to have the school re-opened for the current term. Furthermore Canon Sheasby has spoken in high praise of the general influence for good that Mrs. Lindberg has been among the people of the Reserve. Bishop Hallam is most desirous that the school shall be opened without any break if at all possible. It is with these circumstances before me that I make the nomination of Mrs. Lindberg for the position of teacher at Red Pheasant.\n\nMrs. Lindberg's application is already on file in your office so that it is not renewed at this time. Not having the salary schedule with me at the time, I assured Mrs. Lindberg that her salary would be the same as last year $125.00 per teaching month. I believe that the salary scale would grant her a higher rate of salary than that for a second class certificate and 10 years experience. Mrs. Lindberg if appointed will live in residence.\nat the teacherage and will serve for the full term until June 30th 1948.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. Telegraph Communication with Mrs. Lindberg could best be secured by communicating with either myself or the Indian Office in Battleford and by telephone therefrom.\n\nMrs. Lindberg's mail address is c/o Red Pheasant P.O. and is served only by a tri-weekly mail service.\nAIRMAL\n\nOttawa, September 18, 1947.\n\nDear Canon Hives:\n\nWe have your letter of the 16th instant, in which you recommend the re-employment of Mrs. Lindberg as teacher of the Red Pheasant Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department approves your suggestion and I enclose one of our regular application forms which she should complete and return. We will allow her at least the same salary as last year, and if the information regarding her qualifications justifies increased salary according to our new schedule, it will be paid to her.\n\nEnc.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend Canon H.

Bell, Indian Agent,\nBattleford, Saskatchewan.\n\nWith reference to the teaching services at the Red Pheasant School, the Bishop of Saskatoon nominated a teacher to succeed Mrs. Lindberg. However, she did not accept the appointment and today we received a letter from Canon Hives in which he recommends the re-engagement of Mrs. Lindberg. For your information I enclose a copy of our reply.\n\nEncl.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed herewith please find the application form from Mrs. Lindberg for the school at Red Pheasant.\n\nI discussed with Mrs. Lindberg the possibility of her encouraging the Indian women with their cooking, dress-making, home furnishing &c. Mrs. Lindberg is quite willing to do anything in her power along this line provided the women will meet with her at the school or teacherage. I agreed with her that it would be too much for her to try to visit the homes on the reserve, scattered as they are, after a day's teaching.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoey,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have had an enquiry, regarding the Red Pheasant Reserve, North Battleford, Saskatchewan.\n\nThe Indians would like to know whether, or not, there is any lease, covering the property on which the Anglican Mission is situated. They would further like to know whether better provision could be made for the establishment of schools on the reserve, so that the children can properly attend. There are some forty-seven children on this reserve, between the ages of five and sixteen, but only about ten attending school, because of the long distance, which they have to travel. Apparently there are a number of children on the Stoney Reserve also. The Family Allowance cheques are payable to the parents for the children, only if they attend school, and the school facilities are so far from the homes that in winter time it is almost impossible for the children to attend with any regularity.\n\nI would like to know what can be done to remedy the situation, as apparently some of these children have over six miles to travel with no roads and no proper facilities and, in many cases, the families are too poor to provide even horses for transportation.\n\nApparently some resolution, with regard to the building of a school, and the moving of the present one to a more convenient location, has been sent to the Agent.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nG. H. Castleman,\nM. P. for Yorkton.\n\nGHG/13\nMay 12, 1948.\n\nMr. C.S. Bell, Indian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\n\nI attach copy of a letter which has been received by the Director.

The Family Allowance is not cut off for irregular attendance if the child or children live a distance from school.

Possibly the Red Pheasant people figure that transportation should have been provided for their children as well.\n\nThe question of the families being too poor to provide horses for their children to ride to school or drive is I think stretching the truth a little.

Box 61,\nBattleford, Sask.\n\nDear Canon Hives:\n\nIn regard to the suggestions made in your letter of September 18th regarding schools in the Battleford area, may I say that a school with teacherage has been authorized for Sweetgrass Reserve and a site selected. When a contractor can be found to build the school, the children who formerly attended at Delmas will be accommodated in a day school conducted with a view to their religious affiliation. It appears that about two-thirds of the population of the Sweetgrass Reserve are adherents of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nThe eligible Mosquito Reserve children are for the time being to be served by the Red Pheasant school where, if necessary, a second classroom will be operated along the lines adopted at Little Pine School.\n\nFor the schooling of some Moosomin Reserve children Mr. Superintendent Bell has made arrangements with the public school authorities in nearby white communities. It is our understanding that the population of this reserve is very largely Roman Catholic.\n\nIt is hoped that we may be able soon to send our Educational Survey Officer into the Battleford area and that he will have an opportunity to confer with you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\nExtract from telegram from C.A.F.

But Mr. Assistant Birch reports considerable improvement, and certainly I could not see any evidence of bad behaviour. The children are getting accustomed to the teacher.

The necessary forms, of course, would have to be completed in this case, that is:-\n\nEmployer's Report of Accident\nSurgeon's First Report\nEmployer's Subsequent Statement.\n\nFive copies of each of these forms are required,- two copies of each form to be submitted to the Workmen's Compensation Board, Sask., and three copies to be forwarded to this office. Accounts for medical services and hospitalization must also be submitted and these are required in quintuplicate, and must be certified to the effect that the services have been rendered.\n\nIn the case of a non-exempt Civil Servant an application for sick leave on C. S. Form 263 is required, although the sick leave granted under Section 68 of the Civil Service Regulations, is not made a charge against the employee's sick leave credit.\nIf, on submission of the forms above referred to, the claim is approved by the Workmen's Compensation Board, either the Department will pay her salary for the time she is laid off, or the Board will pay her a percentage, which in Saskatchewan would appear to be 75% of earnings. The Personnel Section in the past has not dealt with leave and Workmen's Compensation Claims for teachers. No doubt there have been Workmen's Compensation cases and you will have a precedent.\n\nW. J. F. Pratt\nGeneral Executive Assistant.\nBattleford, Sask.\nJanuary 10, 1949.\n\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter No. 618-1(E1) of the 5th inst., which was sent to Gleichen, Alta., with reference to accident suffered by Mrs. Sears, teacher of the Red Pheasant Day School.\n\nI interviewed Mrs. Sears in hospital and she has no idea just how accident happened. She had stepped on the small platform on which her desk is situated to call the children to attention to sing O Canada. From that point she has no recollection of what happened, and on regaining consciousness the children were endeavouring to get her to a seat, at the time Adam Mosquito happened to come in and he managed to get her to the school residence. Word was sent to Mr. Burch, Assistant, Red Pheasant, who came with his wife. At the time they thought it was only a sprain, and it was not until when there was no improvement on Saturday December 18th, it was decided to move her into North Battle River Dene Hospital.\n\nIf I can find a substitute teacher I will immediately inform you.\n\nC.S. Ball\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nAIR MAIL\n\n31st January, 1949.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nI wish to confirm the following army message sent to you today:\n\n\"Canon Hives Battleford Saskatchewan has recommended appointment of Nickoli Jacob Kroeker as teacher Red Pheasant School to replace Mrs. Sears whom it is stated will be employed in a Residential School when she recovers from her accident -stop- Check with Saskatchewan Department of Education with a view to ascertaining Inspector's reports on Mr. Kroeker who mentions in his application that he has taught fifteen and a half years in Saskatchewan and British Columbia -stop- He further states that he has a permanent first class Saskatchewan certificate -stop- Advise as soon as possible -stop-\"\n\nThis applicant appears highly qualified, but we find it difficult to understand why he does not happen to be employed at the present time, in view of the fact that teachers are urgently required in various parts of the country.

Dr. Head has informed me that it will be a matter of 3 months before she would be out of hospital. I have therefore taken steps to secure the services of another teacher.\n\nAn application has been received with references attached from N.J.Kroeker and I feel satisfied that his qualifications are suitable for the position of teacher on Red Pheasant Reserve. It has been my wish to secure the services of a married male teacher at that school and I hope that this man will prove acceptable. He has informed me that he would not be able to move his family at once, even delaying to the beginning of the next term, but that he is prepared to take over at once. I believe he is wise in taking this step. His teaching experience and qualifications would indicate that he would be in the $1860.00 bracket for First Class (third grade) Teacher.\n\nAs it is desirable to have the school re-opened as soon as possible would you notify him of his appointment by wire if you are satisfied as to the nomination being a desirable one. Mr. Bell, Indian Agent, has informed me that there has been no communication from your office regarding the vacancy, but I feel that you will concur in the attempt to have the school in operation as soon as possible. I do not think that Mrs. Sears could return to the reserve after such a spell in hospital. I have ascertained from her that she will accept a position in a residential school when she is again able to return to work. That would be better than having her alone at the teacherage on Red Pheasant.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neary Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. N. J. Kroeker has commenced his duties as teacher on the Red Pheasant Reserve. Due to weather conditions in the west he was unable to make train connections but we were able to take him to the Reserve by team on Thursday. He is staying for the present with Mr. Burrah, but will move into the house as soon as the renovation work which Mr. Bell contemplates is completed.\n\nMr. Kroeker appears to be an earnest, sincere man of quiet disposition. In his approach to his work, which is new to him as far as Indian Work is concerned, he was very thoughtful and enquiring. Knowing something of the difficulties before him and of the run-down appearance of the school property he is prepared to take on the work with the sense of obtaining a satisfying vocation and career. I was attracted to him and if his work is as satisfactory as we have been led to expect I am sure that we have a good man. His wife and two children will join him, probably after the present school term.\n\nThe school has been very satisfactorily repaired for use. The house has some minor repair work to be done and the interior is to be redecorated. For all of this I am grateful for it will be an encouragement to these people to create a home. I should like to urge that some considerable work be done on the grounds about the school and teachorage. The garden has been very much neglected and requires good working in order that proper use can be made of the grounds. Mr. Kroeker is able to teach gardening and I believe his gnomonite background will serve him here in good stead. The fence has all but disappeared. This should be restored since a well kept fence about an isolated property does much to create the atmosphere of respectability and prosperity. The barn at the teachorage also needs some repair work done and since Mr. Kroeker will need a cow I would recommend that this repair be done.\nI should like to express by appreciation of the assistance given and of the forbearance of the Department in the treatment of the teachers we have had on the reserve during the past few years. It has been difficult to secure teachers during the time of teacher shortage and those whom we did secure have not always shown the real interest in the problem we have continually to face. It is to be sincerely hoped that the present incumbent will prove as satisfactory as my remarks above would lead one to expect.\n\nThanking you, and with kindest regards,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nAttention: Mr. Neary.\n\nI have received Department letter of No. 18th 618-1(E) regarding education facilities on the Red Pheasant and Mosquito Reserves of the Battleford Agency.\n\nI have written to Mr. Bell asking him to complete and return the Statistical Forms as soon as possible. I shall make a definite recommendation with regard thereto as soon as I hear from Mr. Bell.\n\nI am forwarding under separate cover a Quonset School plan on which the J.R. Paisley Steel Buildings Limited of Regina have made an estimate of approximately $9,000. Perhaps you have already received a similar plan, but I thought it advisable to forward this for your perusal. I believe the price is quite attractive and I see little to criticize in this building. If we are to have combined classroom and teacherage buildings erected at approximately $9,000, we may be able to have more Schools erected this year than we originally planned.\n\nI would be glad if you would return the Quonset Folder with Plan to me when it has served its purpose.\n\nJ.P.B.

The school was opened at the beginning of the term with an unsatisfactory teacher who eventually fractured her hip, resulting in the school being closed for a time. It has recently re-opened with a new teacher, whose services are promising for the future. The water supply as the Red Pheasant Day School is still unsatisfactory, and I do not know when the problem will be solved. Certainly I am not in favour of large further expenditures on the building at the present site unless we can find a satisfactory water supply.\n\n(Sgd) J. P. B.

F. Neary Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith regard to the vacancy of the position of the teacher for Red Pheasant School, I have been endeavoring ever since I was acquainted with the fact of the vacancy, to secure a teacher for the school. I have today received a letter from Mr. Silversides of Regina indicating that he is not at present interested in the school at Red Pheasant.\n\nAt your suggestion I will place another advertisement in the papers. There are several schools in this immediate vicinity without teachers and I am given to understand from the school superintendent that the teacher shortage is a matter of concern throughout the Province.\n\nAt the present moment I am commissioned only to act in this matter in accordance with the established procedure by which the Church authority nominates the teacher to the Department. If as your letter suggests that this method should be abrogated it should be done by the Department in communication with the Bishop. Personally, I should be sorry to see the discontinuance of this practice since I have been looking forward to the possibility of a closer co-operation between Department and Church.\n\nI regret that the Department has discontinued the practice of sending the School Bulletins and Salary Revision Schedules as these were always a help to me in discussing teaching matters with prospective teachers &c. However I have found the regional Indian Office most co-operative and understanding in our common difficulties.\n\nI shall inform you immediately when a satisfactory application has been received. There have been only two rejected applicants, one on account of illiteracy and the other for unsatisfactory training and also adverse comment from the Agency in which previous teaching had been carried on.\n\nThanking you for your interest,\n\nyours faithfully,\n\nH.E. [Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Naturally, the applicants are discussed jointly with you before any decision is reached.\n\nI am sorry to learn that you have not been receiving the school bulletins. On checking we find that we had not been advised of your change of address from Saskatoon and the bulletins have been going there. I am sending you attached hereto a copy of the September 1949 issue with details of the new salary schedule.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nCanon H.E.

Blackwell as Indian day school teacher at the Red Pheasant Reserve, of the Battleford Agency, I regret to advise that Mr. Blackwell declined to accept the appointment when informed that his salary would be $228.00 per teaching month.\n\nI have asked Indian Superintendent C.S. Bell to contact Reverend Canon Hives, asking him to submit a recommendation covering one of the other teachers who has applied for the position. I may say there have been many applications, and I have no doubt that we will be able to secure the services of a suitable teacher from one of these.\n\nWith reference to the advertisement which was placed in several papers asking for applications for this appointment it is my opinion that the advertisement was well thought out and I see nothing wrong with it, but apparently a number of the teachers who have applied assume from the wording of the advertisement that if they have sufficient years of experience in any school, and high qualifications, they should expect to start at the maximum salary of $3120.00. I may say that in telephone conversation with Reverend Canon Hives he seemed to be labouring under the same misapprehension. I believe it would expedite matters considerably if I was informed of the exact process by which the starting salary of a teacher applicant is decided. I regret to say that I am not at all clear on this myself, and I am, therefore, not in a very good position to advise others. I was confused, for instance, over the application of Miss Virginia Bettschen who applied for a position at the File Hills School and who has about fifteen years teaching experience, with a B.A. and B.Ed. By what process of calculation was it decided that the very maximum which could be paid to Miss Bettschen for a starting salary was $2,640.00 per annum? Compared to this Mrs. Sprague, the teacher at the Little Pine Indian Day School, of the Battleford Agency, is being paid $3,000.00 a year,\nwith one degree, a B.A.\n\nI am not criticising Department officials in any way in asking for this information, but I would like to be in a better position to tell an applicant, with some degree of accuracy, what salary he or she could hope to receive if appointed. By not being able to give this information immediately we might sometimes miss the opportunity of getting a very excellent teacher into our service.\n\nJ.P.B.

After all, we must be fair to\nthese teachers who remained on in Indian schools; many of them\ndoing a good job, during the days when our salaries were very\nlow. It is standard practice to grant so many years of credit\nfor outside experience and we have set a rather generous maximum\nat five years.\n\nI can best illustrate this situation by the following\nexamples:\n\n(a) Miss B. Bettschen\n\nCredit for provincial experience ........ 5 years\nCredit for Armed Forces experience ....... 2 \"\nTotal ...... 7 \"\n\nThis means that Miss Bettschen placed on the 8th year as\na Grade 3 teacher or at a salary of $2,520.00 a year\nplus university degree credit of $120.00\nor a total of $2,640.00\n(b) Mrs. Surage -\n\nYears of provincial experience ........... 2 years\n\nIndian school experience (13 years but did not attend sufficient summer schools and credit only for 9 years ............. 9 \"\n\nTotal ........................................ 11 \"\n\nThis would place her at the eleventh year on the scale at $2,880.00 a year but she also has a Bachelor of Arts Degree which entitles her to a bonus of $120.00 per annum. Her salary therefore is ......................... $2,880.00 plus ......................... 120.00 = $3,000.00\n\nThe main point of misunderstanding normally arises with regard to credit for provincial experience and I know you will appreciate why we give more credit for Indian school experience than for provincial experience.\n\nThe average teacher coming in to our service would get $228.00 a month as a commencing salary with credit for five years of experience and a First Class Certificate. This would entitle them to start at the sixth year as a Grade Three teacher. This five years of credit for provincial experience would be given to a teacher with 12 years of experience or one with 17 years of experience, etc. If a teacher has only 2 years of provincial experience, then she is given credit only for these two years.\n\nI hope this clarifies the situation for you.\n\nBernard F.

Bird engaged as teacher at salary of $600.00 per an. and began duties September 1, 1920. During the school year 1920-21 the following payments were made to him:\n\n- September qr. 1920 ............... $63.00\n- December 1920 .................... 150.00\n- March 1921 ....................... 150.00\n- June 1921 ......................... 150.00\n\nTotal ................................ $513.00\n\nAs Mr. Bird taught the required number of days during the academic year 1920-21 he was entitled to receive the full yearly salary of $600.00 for that year. As only $513.00 was paid to him, the above balance is therefore due.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY THAT THIS STATEMENT IS CORRECT.\n\n1, 4, 24.\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6291, file 618-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nOttawa, April 1, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, in which you claim salary as teacher of the Red Pheasant Indian Day School for the period July 1st to August 17, 1923.\n\nIn reply I would point out that, in the payment of the salaries of teachers in Indian day schools, the summer holidays are not taken into account and, therefore, no salary is paid for them.\n\nThe academic year begins September 1st and ends June 30th, and, while you were in charge of the Red Pheasant school, your salary was paid quarterly. We find, however, on reviewing the payments made to you from the date you began duties, namely, September 1, 1920, to June 30, 1923, there is a balance of salary due you for the academic year 1920-21 amounting to $87.00. To explain this fully to you, the following statement shows the payments made to you during three academic years:\n\n**ACADEMIC YEAR 1920-21.**\n\n| Month       | Year | Amount |\n|-------------|------|--------|\n| September   | 1920 | $63.00 |\n| December    | 1920 | $150.00|\n| March       | 1921 | $150.00|\n| June        | 1921 | $150.00|\n\n**ACADEMIC YEAR 1921-22.**\n\n| Month       | Year | Amount |\n|-------------|------|--------|\n| September   | 1921 | $150.00|\n| December    | 1921 | $150.00|\n| March       | 1922 | $150.00|\n| June        | 1922 | $150.00|\n\n**ACADEMIC YEAR 1922-23.**\n\n| Month       | Year | Amount |\n|-------------|------|--------|\n| September   | 1922 | $150.00|\n| December    | 1922 | $150.00|\n| March       | 1923 | $150.00|\n| June        | 1923 | $150.00|\n\nTotal .................. $1713.00\n\nThe total amount you should have received for the three academic years was $1800.00 and, as shown by the above, you only received $1713.00.

Howland\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nReference your letter 117054-5-5, December 27th, 1916.\n\nI beg to advise you that I have looked into the matter of the heating of the Red Pheasant and Stoney and Littlepine Schools.\n\nThe Red Pheasant and Stoney School has four hot air registers in the school room and one in the lobby. There are two cold air registers, one in the school room and one in the lobby. I have marked these on the plan. There is a foul air register which is marked on the plan but which does not work. Instead of carrying off the foul air, the draught comes down the flue and cold air is projected into the room.\n\nThe height of the furnace top to basement ceiling is two feet four inches. The location of the furnace is marked on the plan. The distance from the earth to the joists is three feet. This building is on a stone foundation and a portion can easily be removed if excavating is required.\n\nA stove was put up in the school room this winter and on my last visit, which was a very cold day being 30 degrees below zero with a strong wind, the room was quite comfortable. They informed me that since the stove has been in use they are able to warm the room in the morning in one hour.\nIn the Littlepine School there are two hot air registers which are situated in the partition between the school room and lobby. These are seven and a half feet from the floor, behind and on either side of the teacher's desk. There are two cold air registers in the school room. In the lobby there is one hot air register behind the door leading into the school room. There is also one cold air register in the lobby. The hot air register in the lobby is in the wall next to the floor. The location of the furnace as marked on the plan is correct.\n\nThe distance from the furnace top to the ceiling of the basement is two feet two inches. The height from the earth to the joists in the unexcavated portion of the basement is two feet six inches.\n\nThis building has a cement foundation and will be more expensive to remove if excavating is done.\n\nThe stove in the school room has been put up since my last visit and regards this Mr. English wrote me on the 9th inst as follows, \"I wish to inform you that the stove in the school room is now in use and is a splendid success. I light the fire about 8:45 and in a few minutes the room is quite warm. I now very seldom use the furnace in the basement. The consumption of fuel is now cut down by at least 50%, so that the stove is a success in a double sense.\"\n\nI have no suggestions to offer excepting that I agree with Inspector Crombie that the furnaces should be placed more central.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ. D. McLean Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6291, file 618-5, part 1)\nOttawa, March 7, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated 14th ultimo in reference to the Red Pheasant, Little Pine and Stony Schools, and in reply to inform you that as the stoves supplied are evidently heating the building to the satisfaction of the teachers as shown by your letter and no funds available for the extension of the basement of the buildings, consideration of this will be deferred until a more opportune time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAest.

My letter of Feb 14th had recommended keeping the driver on steadily at the Stony reserve, as all the families lived too far from school to be able to attend otherwise.\n\nI regret overlooking the Department's instructions and would ask that the continuation of driving be allowed on the Stony reserve, the attendance has been good at the Red Pheasant school, with about 25 children attending last month and as long as it keeps up this way the children and school will be doing good work.\n\nThe driving from the Red Pheasant reserve will not be required, as the families with children live within reach of it.\n\nWith regard to the driving at Little Pines, I would ask the driver be used again from the 1st of December to the 15th of April as there are many small children attending who could not possibly go otherwise during winter the months and the attendance is very good at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 25, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to continuing the employment of a driver in transporting the children from the Stony Reserve to the Red Pheasant Indian Day School and also with regard to continuing the services in driving the children on the Little Pines Reserve.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, in view of your recommendation and also in view of the reasons given in your letter dated February 16th, last, the Department will approve of the continuing of a driver's service in transporting the children to and from their homes on the Stony Reserve while attending the Red Pheasant Day School. Payment for this service will be made at the same rate as previously allowed, viz.: $2.00 per day for each day the driving is done, less 10% during the current fiscal year.\n\nWith regard to the driving of the children at the Little Pines Day School, the Department will approve of this service being continued as from the first of December, next, to the 15th of April, 1934. The amount allowed will be at the same rate as previously paid for this service, viz.: $2.00 per day, less 10% for each day the work is performed.\n\nAt the end of each month, you should forward separate accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, for the amount due the drivers who perform these services.\n\nThe account which you submitted, in favour of Thomas Moosomin, for driving the Stony Band school children to the Red Pheasant Day School during the month of September, last, will be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Mr Henry Reynolds is in charge.\n\nThe buildings of this school are a duplicate of the Little Pine school, but the attendance and progress is not in the same class. The teacher makes a fair effort but is not the type for Indian teaching and would never make a success of an Indian School. The Indians on these reserves are also backward and it would be a hard proposition for any teacher. One of the chief drawbacks is denominational, about 50 percent of these reserves are Catholic and there is a natural opposition to an Anglican school.\n\nOne driver is now employed from the Stony reserve which is too far from the school through bush country for children to walk.\n\nThe noon meal has been discontinued and the pupils now bring their lunches.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\nTo: Mr. Jackson Chinn\n\nc/o Miss A.

There were 12 girls and 8 boys present, out of an enrollment of 26 (13 boys and 13 girls). I was quite pleased with conditions as I found them in the classroom at this school. The children appeared bright and spoke up better than I have ever heard them on previous visits. They presented a clean and well nourished appearance. They were warmly clad, although their clothing in some instances was considerably patched.\n\nThe children are given a mid-day lunch, consisting of a bowl of vegetable soup with meat in it. At times this is varied by giving them oatmeal porridge. It is interesting to note that the pupils raised money by giving a concert, the proceeds of which were applied towards providing the ingredients for the mid-day meal. The Indian Agent gave them a quarter of beef which was of material assistance.\n\nI am taking this opportunity of again voicing my opinion regarding the importance of providing the children at our day schools with a bowl of nourishing soup at mid-day. Many of the children who come from poor homes, arrive at the school after having very little, if any, breakfast. The mid-day meal they receive there is in many cases the only real nourishing meal they get during the day. It has been reported to me by the teachers that during the forenoon many of the children are in a phlegmatic condition, but -\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\ncondition, but after they have had their mid-day meal they are bright and take an interest in their lessons as well as in their play. The ingredients for the mid-day meal are inexpensive and I feel that the expense entailed in providing same is justified in view of the effect it has on the condition and health of the children. It is also an incentive to encourage attendance.\n\nThe school building is a frame structure with a cement basement. A furnace is provided in the basement, which has not been in use as the pipes are out of order, and a large heating stove is provided which adequately heats the building. The day was not warm when I visited the school, but I found the room quite comfortable. We had a meeting of the Band in the school room which lasted for several hours in the evening and the room was comfortably warm.\n\nAs the Stony Reserve is situated at some distance from the school, a driver is provided to bring the children. Until recently a driver was also provided for the Red Pheasant Reserve. This has been discontinued.\n\nThe teacher, Mr. Reynolds, appears to be giving very satisfactory service at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

The material on this Outside of Pencils, would cost approximately $16.00 locally.\n\nWith regard to repairs for tank requested by the teacher, I might say, that a new bottom was put on this about ten years ago and the tank now is not worth repairing and is so badly warn after over 20 years that any attempt at repairs would be awaste. A new tank, 6ft x 6ft, of 24 guage Galv Iron, installed complete, would cost $50.00. This school is 25 miles out of town and the tank would have to be set up and soldered in the basement.\n\nThe teacher is an a bad way for water supply as will be seen from his remarks and if funds are in any way available, I would ask that a new tank be installed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nEXTRACT FROM REQUISITION FOR SCHOOL MATERIAL, dated January 14, 1935, for RED PHEASANT INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on 105-6-4.\n\n| No. Required |\n|--------------|\n| New Empire Single Desks, No. 3 - 4 |\n| \" \" \" Fronts \" 4 - 2 |\n| \" \" \" Rear \" 4 - 1 |\n| \" \" \" 3 - 1 |\n| Teacher's Chair - - 1 |\n\nE.

If these biscuits have not arrived, you will, no doubt, receive them in the near future. Do you consider it necessary to serve a hot drink, consisting of cocoa and milk, or hot soup, in addition to the biscuits? If so, let me know what would be the probable cost per month. In the event of your recommending such an expenditure, you should keep in mind that the Department would only allow this hot drink to be served during the period November first to March 31st.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.

During the period mentioned by the Department, Beef is on hand for winter Nations, at 6 and 7 Cents, and would be about $3.50 per Month. Other ingredients, Rice, Pot Barley and Rolled Oats or Beans, would be about $7.00 making a total of $10.50 per Month or $31.50 per quarter as it would be supplied, this is based on Little Pine school, where the attendance is large and would not likely exceed $25.00 per quarter at Red Heasant and Thunderchild.\n\nThe Supplies would have to be Purchased at Battleford for Red Heasant, from Wilson & Magee, Little Pine Layton and from Craig Bros Ltd., Turtleford for the Thunderchild School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 14, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your 280-306 of the 17th ultimo, which was inadvertently overlooked, I have to say that our Appropriation will not permit allowing the amount requested in your letter for midday meal purposes at the three schools in your agency.\n\nHowever, you may expend an amount of $8.00 a month at the Little Pines School for the period November first, 1935, to March 31st, 1936.

Macdonald,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford.\n\nre Red Pheasant School Driver.\n\nDear Mr. Macdonald,\n\nI wish to call your attention to the following facts and to the request attached.\n\nThe number of children attending the above School from the Red Pheasant Band has increased during the last year. Most of these increases are young pupils and many of them live at a distance from the School. The trails that they have to travel are through rather bushy country and are not safe for young children in winter. Would it be possible to get a driver for these children? I understand that there used to be a driver, but the number of pupils decreased and this was discontinued. A route of about six and one half miles would serve 13 children.\n\nA. Peyachew. 1 age 7\nL.

Morgan\nTeacher.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am attaching a letter from Mr. Morgan, Teacher, Red Pheasant Indian Day School, addressed to Agent Macdonald, asking that a driver be allowed from December 1st to April 1st for the school children.\n\nIn Mr. Macdonald's letter he states that as Mr. Morgan's letter gives all the details, he does not need to repeat them, except that a driver would make it possible for about four more children than he mentions to attend the school.\n\nHe states that this matter was brought up at the Band Meeting which I recently attended, and that he agrees with the Indians that a three-mile trip through the bush trails is not safe for the children, as most of them are seven and eight years of age and Winter travel is often tough for adults.\n\nMr. Macdonald recommends that a driver be employed for the period mentioned, at the rate of $2.00 per day for school days driven.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

The last account submitted for this service was voucher 325 dated October 6 covering the payment for the month of September, 1938.\n\nIn view of the payment already being made it is difficult to understand to what children Mr. Morgan refers in his letter. Possibly he means a different part of the Reserve from that covered by the present driver. Please let me have further particulars in this connection but it is extremely doubtful if our funds will permit allowing more for driving children than is at present provided.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., November 18, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRef.: Your #105-6-5 of November 10th,\nDriver, Red Pheasant School.\n\nI find that the driver at present employed at this school\nis engaged in driving children from the Stony Reserve to the school,\nas there are no children on the Stony Reserve within two miles of the\nschool.\n\nThere is no driver for children living on the Red Pheasant\nReserve. There was one up to about three years ago, but owing to the\npoor attendance, it was discontinued on the recommendation of Agent\nMacdonald. Attendance now has greatly increased, and the number of\nchildren attending the school, together with the distance they have to\ntravel, warrants the employment of a driver. A distance of two\nthree miles, in cold stormy weather, across a Reserve, is too much for\nany child. In view of the splendid work being done at this school,\nI think a special effort should be made to assist the children to get\nthere.\n\nWe are facing on this Reserve the same as we face on all\nothers\u2014Indians scattered from one end of the Reserve to the other.\nApparently no effort has been made to centralize the settlement. Our\nmedical officers have to travel all over the Reserve to see two or three\npatients. Our Farming Instructors travel 50 miles where they would be\nable to see all the farmers by driving a distance of 5 or 10 miles if\nthe farmers were centralized. It has cost the Department thousands of\ndollars through breaks in machinery due to having to haul a binder or\nmower five or ten miles to cut a few acres of grain or hay for an in-\ndividual Indian. We have to employ drivers to haul the children to school\nfor no reason whatever except that the Indian decides to go and build and\nsettle four or five or six miles from the school.\n\nI have been pressing upon our Agents the necessity of getting\nour farmers located centrally; of making a plan of the Reserve, laying\nout a road, say, east and west and one north and south, and requiring\nall beginners to settle along those roads before they could get any\nassistance from the Department. There is not any question that if a\npolicy of this kind could be adopted and followed, our Farming In-\nstructors would have no ground to ask for gasoline and oil. They could\neasily cover their territory and visit the Indians three or four times\nmore often than they do now, with less mileage. We would also make a\nsaving of thousands of dollars in machinery repairs, and reduce our\nmedical expenses greatly.\n\nI would recommend that the Department give serious consideration\nto the matter of having all Agents draw up such a plan for all their Re-\nserves, requiring all beginners to build their homes in accordance with\nthat plan, and forbidding assistance to anyone who did not comply with it.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept' of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nTR/FMG\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoey.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: $900.00 Appropriation for Basement & Repairs,\nLittle Pine Day School, Battleford Agency.\n\nWe have the same problem at both Little Pine and Red Pheasant Day School\u2014lack of space for properly carrying on the work. We have outstanding teachers in both schools, and I think the problem at Red Pheasant is more acute than at Little Pine. We are, however, faced at Red Pheasant with the problem of water. There is at present no water supply and where the school is located, it would be very difficult to secure it.\n\nI have discussed with the teacher and Mr. Macdonald the possibility of securing a water supply, and they inform me that it could be secured about half a mile from the present location, and the suggestion has been made that the present school be moved to a location one-half mile away. The ground is very rolling at its present location and it is practically impossible to get a playground. We are also faced with the problem of either increasing the school in size or erecting another building for a second room and an additional teacher if all the children of the Reserve are to be accommodated.\n\nI have asked Mr. Macdonald for a report on the cost of moving the school and putting in a full basement. Pending the receipt of this report, I have asked them to take no further action with regard to the basement of the Little Pine School, and immediately upon receipt of this report I will submit it. I trust the Department will approve of my action in this matter.\n\nI might add that the Little Pine School was enlarged some years ago, and the school and the children's dining room are both 16 feet longer than at Red Pheasant School, while the attendance at Red Pheasant is now larger than at Little Pine, and it will open next Fall with 45 or 50 children. An addition of at least 10 feet should be added to the Red Pheasant School to accommodate the children, as well as a full basement.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDep't of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nThos.

If the present site is unsuitable, I hesitate to proceed with repairs until the condition is remedied. I have been wondering if it would not be advisable to proceed with the repairs at the Little Pine School this year, on the understanding that a fully modern school with full basement accommodation would be built to take the place of the Red Pheasant School next year. If the new school were built during the holiday season, a certain amount of the lumber at the present school could no doubt be utilized. However, if you consider the present site is reasonably suitable, I can see no serious objection to the expenditure of money on the Red Pheasant rather than the Little Pine School. I shall be glad to have an expression of opinion from you, with respect to this matter, just as soon as you can conveniently send it forward.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

I am also attaching a rough sketch of the proposed basement, which will give a clear floor space, by running the cold air intakes under the floor and making a regular hot air furnace act as a pipeless, this would be necessary to heat the basement, as the regular pipeless throws off no heat.\n\nMuch the cheapest way to do this would be by contract as by day labour it might run to anything, as the whole building would have to be jacked up on timbers, while the excavation was done and the new cement walls run in, if after the building was jacked, the Indians might be paid to do the excavating also if the contract was let for the whole job, with a stipulation that all common labor be by Indians, it would cover the same purpose.\n\nThe only way to get an exact figure would be to call for tenders, as no contractor will go out there and make a bid unless there is a chance of getting the job, and as regulations are, you cannot do this as we used to do.\n\nAt best it will be after my time when this work is done, as from tomorrow I will be away paying almost every day till June 17th and completing my final reports, which will leave this to the next man.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) S. L. Macdonald,\nIndian Agent.\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson, etc.\nRegina, May 29, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRef: Your 105-2-5 of April 26th,\nMy 302-11A of May 23rd,\nRepairs, Red Pheasant School.\n\nWith further reference to my 302-11A of May 23rd, I am now in receipt of a letter from Mr. Macdonald, together with estimates on the proposed work, which I am attaching.\n\nIt will be noted by Mr. Macdonald's letter that he now considers that much the cheapest way to do this work would be by contract, as the whole building will have to be jacked up on timbers while the excavation is done and the new cement walls run in. He states that the only way to get an exact figure would be to call for tenders.\n\nIt will be noted that, according to this plan, it is proposed to place a heavy duty furnace at one end of the building, the cold air to be taken in through pipes laid under the floor. This would allow practically the whole basement for community work, carpentry, etc.\n\nAs stated in my previous letter, improvements on this school are much more necessary than on Little Pine. At the same time, to expend any money on this school without enlarging it would be simply a waste. I would therefore suggest that if funds are available to proceed with this work this season, Mr. Macdonald be instructed to proceed with the repairs to the Little Pine and Thunderchild Schools and to place in next year's estimates an amount that would permit the necessary extension and repairs to Red Pheasant School.\n\nI would appreciate your instructions in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

We have, however, a fairly good teacher's residence that cannot be moved, consequently the building of a school on another location would mean also the building of a new teacher's residence. The playground situation could be remedied at not much expense by levelling off the ground, and, as stated in a previous letter, a well was dug to a depth of 30 feet when they struck a large rock and had to discontinue. There is, however, a certain amount of water in the present well. It is not a sufficient supply, but is, I think, a fairly good indication that water could be obtained at a little greater depth.\n\nAs pointed out in a previous letter, there will be at least 50\u2014probably 55\u2014children wanting to attend this school at the opening of the next session. The extending of the school 20 feet, with a full basement, would accommodate these, but when it was done, we would have a very poor school. I would therefore recommend that your suggestion be adopted, that is, that the school be left as it is this season, and a modern school erected next summer.\n\nWith regard to using some of the lumber of the old school for the new, there is no doubt a certain amount of it could be used. I would, however, suggest that the old building be left standing and used as a community hall and workshop. We have an outstanding teacher on this Reserve, who........\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nReserve, who takes a very active interest in both the children and the young men of the Reserve. His wife also takes an interest in women's work and has one of our outstanding Homemakers' clubs going on the Reserve. The teacher himself is good in carpentry work and if he had a building or place for the purpose, I am satisfied he would organize a young men's club and get them making chairs, benches, etc., for their homes, and teach them the use of tools.\n\nThe old school could also be used for the Homemakers' club and I believe in this way the Department would receive much greater value than they would from what lumber they could salvage.\n\nIf you agree with my suggestions, will you please authorize us to proceed with the work on the Little Pine school and at the same time authorize me to expend any unused portion of the appropriation in digging a new well at the Red Pheasant School, as I am of the opinion that we could get both done from that appropriation, and if so, we could then ascertain whether a supply of water could be obtained before going any further with the work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTR/FMc\n\nThos.

Should you have sufficient funds you are also authorized to proceed with the work necessary to deepen the well at the Red Pheasant school.\n\nIt is my intention to include in the estimates of next year the amount necessary to build an up-to-date school to take the place of the present Red Pheasant school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

(RG 10, Volume 6292, file 618-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, July 14th., 1939\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFor some time past you have been forwarding vouchers for an amount of $6.00 a month, in favour of Peter Wuttunee and Lennox Wuttunee, for hauling water at the Red Pheasant School.\n\nThe amount authorized for this service was $5.00 a month, and when your vouchers have been received we changed them to read $5.00. However, in the case of Peter Wuttunee we overlooked changing your voucher No. 42, and as a result he was paid $6.00 for the month of April, 1939. We are now in receipt of your voucher No. 188 covering the month of June and we have reduced this to $5.00, and also deduct for over-payment of $1.00. He will therefore be forwarded a check for $4.00.\n\nIn the case of Lennox Wuttunee, he was paid $6.00 for October 1938, and also $6.00 for March 1939. We do not appear to have received any voucher for his services since that time. When forwarding the next voucher for him, it should be issued for the amount of $5.00, and you should show on the face of the voucher the over-payment just mentioned, in order that they may be deducted from the amount due him.\n\nPlease note in future that the vouchers in favour of these men should be issued for the amount of $5.00 a month each.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 14th inst., no file number, re overpayment of $2.00 to Lennox Wuttunee, hauling water to Red Pheasant Indian Day School, during months of October 1938 and March 1939. When next submitting a voucher in his favour I will deduct this amount from same as instructed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nMines and Resources,\nIndian Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nJune 22, 1939.\n\nDr. Robertson,\n\nSince writing the foregoing, Dr. Lewis has told me that nothing is being done to this school this year. This will be a great disappointment to those who expected to start their young ones this year.\n\nMay I suggest that an assistant teacher be provided and the children's dining room be used as a Primary Room for this coming year.\n\nIn general more interest is being taken in the school, and it seems a great pity to have to refuse children now owing to lack of space.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina.\n\nRe School Situation on Red Pheasant\nand Stoney Reserves.\n\nDr. Robertson,\n\nI should like to outline in more or less detail the school situation on these two reserves.\n\nWith the arrival of the new Agent and the opening of the 1938-40 school year, I should like to be able to enforce the rule, that all children of school age, unless physically unfit, attend school regularly, either here or at a residential school, as stated in the Indian Act.\n\nUp to the beginning of this year I was able to keep up a fair average attendance by personal contact and by explaining the requirements of the Indian Act. Then one family, Catholics, whose girl had been in poor attendance, withdrew their child and refused to send her. The school at Delmas would not take her. I reported this to the Office, and in January the father was threatened with court action unless the child attended here. I have reported that this child has not yet attended but no action has yet been taken.\n\nSince this has taken place, another family whose attendance was poor has grown worse; the driver very frequently reports that they are asleep when he leaves the village. These are both Stoney families.\n\nI feel that these two cases should be cleared up in order to correct the attitude of indifference to the school, which has not entirely disappeared and which was evidently very prevalent on these reserves two or three years ago.\n\nWhen I took over here there was no information at all as the number of children of school age on the reserves. I have made a survey of this point and now think I have fairly good information on this point.\nIt appears that some of the children have not attended school upon reaching school age, seven years. They have waited until nine or ten, with the result that I have pupils of twelve and thirteen in grades one and two.\n\nAt present there are 17 Stoneys on the roll. These are picked up from the Stoney village by a driver throughout the year. About 3 miles west of the Stoney village there is a group of Stoneys as shown in the accompanying sketch. Last year I advised that those of school age in this group be sent to residential school. They, however, do not wish to send them to residential school and they have not the horse power to bring them to this school and to carry on their other work. Would it be possible to provide a driver for this group? He would serve 16 children (as per sketch). A driver would certainly be more economical than residential school grants. This driver might be paid $2 per day, and the driver from the village $1 per day. (Up to now the driver from the village has always received $2 per day, but an extra driver would shorten his route). This is advising an extra expense of $200 per annum to serve 16 children.\n\nOn the Red Pheasant Reserve, I have 25 on the roll. These attended fairly well while the driver was on during the winter months, December to April inclusive. Two of these, fairly bright little girls of about 8, have missed five months schooling this year because they live about 4 1/2 miles from the school. These people are Catholics, fairly good workers and farmers. They are willing to send their children here, but we cannot make them, because the children are under 12 and they live more than 2 1/2 miles from the school. Next year there will be two more in the same situation. Would it not be more economical to retain the driver for the whole year at a cost of $200, than to send these four to residential school at a cost of about $600?\n\nMay I point out that I am suggesting these extra driving facilities for those children whom we cannot force to attend here, and as being more economical than sending them to residential school.\n\nMr. Macdonald has told me that he has recommended that an assistant teacher be provided for this school. With an assistant and the proposed 20 ft addition, together with a full basement, I think we shall be able to get along nicely.\n\nThere are now 42 on the roll. If my suggestions regarding drivers are carried out, I estimate next year's enrolment as 58.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6292, file 618-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nBattleford, Sask.\nJuly 10th, 1939.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI reply to your letter No. 302-11 of the 4th inst. regarding the situation at Red Pheasant Day School, falls to me as Mr. Morgan has gone on a well deserved holiday.\n\nIt is noted that an adequate Day School building is to be erected on Red Pheasant Reserve to serve both the reserves next year. The school population of which is, at present 55 not counting those now attending Residential Schools at Union Lake and Delmas. It is essential that this new building be such as to provide for two teachers doing vocational training as well as the ordinary Saskatchewan school work. For the accommodation of those now presenting themselves for the fall term it would be necessary to use the dining room as a school room with an additional teacher. If this is not done it will mean refusing admission to about 15 pupils and make the reserves an excellent recruiting field for the Press Gangs from the Residential Schools. We all feel and think you agree, that the Day School reserves should not be sending any pupils away for tuition.\n\nIt can be pointed out that the provision of a second teacher at the minimum salary would be less of a financial burden than providing for these pupils in a residential school. There is no need to stress the value of the reserve of a school under Mr. Morgan as compared with the alternate.\n\nRegarding the school vans for Stoney pupils this is well covered in Mr. Morgan's letter of late and it is my opinion that this plan be followed, that is that two vans be allowed, one man receiving $1.00 per school day, and the other with the longer trips being paid $2.00 per day. It is the only method by which regular attendance of the students can be maintained and the parents are constant in their request for this plan. The added cost of $1.00 per day over the plan now operating is more than justified.\n\nIt is therefore requested please that these suggestions be strongly presented to Mr. Hoey at an early date.\n\nShould not the estimates now being prepared include an amount for the new school? What amount would you suggest?\n\nDr. T. Robertson,\nYours truly,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Red Pheasant School, Battleford Agency.\n\nOn my recent visit to Battleford I discussed with Mr. Macdonald (at that time Agent); Mr. Morgan, the teacher; and Dr. Lewis, our Medical Officer, conditions on that Reserve. As you are aware, consideration was given to enlarging the present school this season, but the plan was abandoned on your suggestion that a modern school be erected there next season.\n\nThe situation confronting us on this Reserve at the present time is that, aside from the children now attending residential schools from that Reserve, there will be 55 children who will want to attend day school this coming session. Our present school will accommodate 40 at the outside, thus 15 will either have to be left without a school or will have to be sent to a residential school.\n\nMr. Morgan suggested that an additional teacher be engaged and the room now used as a dining room be used this winter as an additional classroom. He also suggested that in that case, an additional driver be secured at cost of $200.00.\n\nAs Mr. Ostrander has taken over the Agency, I referred the matter to him for a report and am now in receipt of his report, in which he recommends the suggestions made by the teacher, Mr. Morgan, that an additional teacher be provided and that a two-room school be erected next season. I do not know whether funds will allow this additional expense this season, but if so, I would recommend that the additional teacher be provided, as well as the $200.00 for an extra driver.\n\nIn support of this recommendation I would point out that in Mr. Morgan we have an outstanding teacher, not only in classroom work but....\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nwork but also in manual training and work of that kind. He does not spare himself in his work. In addition to carrying on school work and manual training he also has, during the winter months, a night school for the older people. Mrs. Morgan is also deeply interested in the work and is very active in carrying on the work among the women.\n\nI would therefore like to see a two-room school established on this Reserve under the management of Mr. Morgan, as I believe it would be in the best interests of both the Indians themselves and the Department.\n\nI am attaching Mr. Morgan's and Mr. Ostrander's letters on this matter. I might further add that the Indians' homes on this Reserve are scattered all over the Reserve. I have drawn the attention of Mr. Ostrander and Mr. Morgan and our Farming Instructor to the necessity of carrying on among these Indians similar propaganda & that we are carrying on on other Reserves, pointing out to them the necessity of the Indians building more centrally in order that they may receive better medical attention and better supervision on the part of the Farming Instructor and reduce the cost of their implements by shorter hauls. We are also further introducing this idea by refusing to assist young Indians who are just establishing themselves in agriculture unless they build within a reasonable distance of the Farming Instructor and the school.\n\nI might also add that I am sure the prospects are that the school population will continue to increase rather than decline.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos.

I have very carefully considered the contents of your letter but I regret that as no funds were provided in the current year's appropriation for the expenditure that would be required if a second class room were opened it is not possible to favourably consider your suggestion.\n\nAs I intimated to you in a previous communication I am prepared to recommend that a two-roomed school be erected on the Red Pheasant Reserve next year and provision will be made for this in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1940-41.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

At present it is costing the Department $5.00 per month.\n\nIt appears to me that there is now no chance of having a new School Building erected on the Red Pheasant for a number of years; would it be possible to have another well sunk at a cost of $2.50 per foot including labour and material?\n\nThere is a well close to the school showing a little water in at thirty-five, though on account of a very large stone it is impossible to go any further. I would suggest that a new well be sunk close to the well showing water, though I would not guarantee obtaining a good supply at thirty-five feet. However, if we did get a good flow it would be cheaper in the long run than paying out $5.00 per month indefinitely. There are quite a number of dry holes around the school grounds.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.P.B.

The depth at which water will be found varies from place to place and cannot be foretold. Though water may be obtained at a depth of 38 feet or less one should be prepared to sink to a depth of 80 feet or more.\n\n(sgd.) G.A.

(RG 10, Volume 6292, file 618-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nBattleford Agency\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 4th instant, No. 105-6-5, in connection with vouchers for attempting to procure a water supply at the Red Pheasant Day School, I am returning vouchers herewith and would ask that they be paid as submitted. I have not forwarded a receipt from Mr. Annear, to the effect that he and his man were given meals by Mr. Morgan for the period stated, but will be able to do so with some considerable expense and trouble, if the Department can not accept the word of myself and Mr. Morgan that the meals were supplied. I might say that the men were fed for more than 18 days, as shown in the voucher, and that Mr. Annear's team of horses, necessary for the job, were also fed from Mr. Morgan's own feed supply, there being no other feed available. However, as I could not keep the amount due Mr. Annear lower than $64.00, Mr. Morgan agreed to accept $36.00 for his payment, having been instructed by me, before the work started, that he must not allow the cost to exceed $100.00.\n\nIt is true that the price for digging is altogether different from that mentioned in my letter of the 24th August, but I did not explain this fact as I thought the reason for the change would be obvious. I was quoting on a finished well, with a supply of water and cribbed. It is obvious that we would not want to waste cribbing on a dry hole. The other reason for the difference is in the fact that, to protect the Department's interests, I arranged with this man that he would be paid only 50\u00a2 a foot for a dry hole. It was then necessary to furnish board, otherwise he would have been working for practically nothing. He was certainly underpaid at $64.00, having been on the job a month with a man, a team of horses and a well-machine, for $64.00 and board.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.B. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nWe, the undersigned, Chief and Councillors of the Mosquito Band of Indians owning the Reserve situated at Red Pheasant, in the Battleford Indian Agency, in the Province of Saskatchewan,\n\nat a council summoned for the purpose, according to the rules of the Band, and held on the said Reserve, this 18th day of November, A.D. 1940, in the presence of the Indian Agent for the said Reserve, representing thereat the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs for the Dominion of Canada;\n\nDo hereby, for ourselves, and on behalf of the Indian owners of the said Reserve, request that a sum not exceeding $800.00, Dollars, be paid out of money standing to the credit of this Band, for the purpose of pay $2.00 per school day for the whole school term, for transportation of children of our Band to the Day School at Red Pheasant Res., totalling $360.00 per annum. Also $440.00 to be used to sink wells at necessary places on our reserve.\n\nSigned and sealed in the presence of:\n\nIndian Agent\n\nForm No. 514\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing, herewith, resolution signed by the Chief and Council of the Stoney Band for an amount of $800.00 to be expended from their Band funds, for the purpose of paying for transportation of their children to the Red Pheasant Day School and for sinking wells at the necessary points on their reserve.\n\nIn explanation I have to say that the homes on the Stoney Reserve are mostly poor, but there are some good homes built on the reserve at the farthest point from the Red Pheasant Day School. The result of this has been that the Indians who wish to have their children attend the day school, live in hovels in an Indian village near the school in the winter. Conditions in these hovels are very bad and the sanitation about the village, in the winter, is terrible, consequently I have discouraged the Indians collecting in the village. To improve matters, I have had the Indians vote money from their funds for the necessary transportation for their children, in order that they may remain in their homes during the winter, mostly a distance of about six miles from the school. They decided that they should pay two dollars per school day, for this transportation and one of their men will take care of it.\n\nThe wells are necessary at a number of the homes, where we are trying to encourage the living conditions improved, and that the cattle be increased. This can only be done by permanent water supplies at the homes. The cost of the wells will be about $2.00 per foot, including cribbing and the amount of $440.00 which they have voted should be sufficient for four or five wells. We need this many at the least.\n\nI would be glad to have authority for the expenditures indicated, as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.F.B. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6292, file 618-5, part 5)\nOttawa, January 3rd, 1941\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Your File 128\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of December 31st, enclosing a resolution of the Chief and Councillors of Mosquito Band, requesting the expenditure of $600.00; $360.00 being for payment for transportation of school children to Red Pheasant School and $440.00 for sinking wells on Mosquito Reserve. In reply I have to advise you that the expenditure of $440.00 for wells is approved.\n\nThe request for the expenditure of $360.00 for transportation for school children is not understood in view of the Department's letter of September 5th, 1940, in which you were advised that transportation would be provided by the Department for the children of Mosquito Band who attend Red Pheasant School at the rate of $2.00 per teaching day, from December 1st, 1940 to March 31st, 1941. Please advise if the amount now requested from Band funds is to supplement the transportation above referred to.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeorge Patrick,\nChief, Trusts & Annuities Division.\n\nJ. P. B.

Most of these Indians live in very poor houses. A number also move in for the winter months leaving very good homes, this habit I am discouraging as much as possible. These Indians live from two to four miles away from the Village; as already informed the Band is willing that $360.00 be charged to their Band Funds, though not for the amount authorized in your letter of September 5th. Knowing home conditions in what is known as the Village, if we can hold the Indians in their good homes it will be money well spent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.P.B.

This stove is without protection of any kind.\n\nDuring cold weather it is difficult to keep the school warm, as it is too hot near the stove and cold near the walls. I think that if we could procure a galvanized tin guard for this stove, about 3' x 5' and 30\" high, raised off the floor about six inches, it would tend to cause a current of air, drawing the cold air off the floor, which at all times is very cold, and so bringing about a better distribution of heat in the building.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.A.

Ostrander, Indian Agent, Battleford, Sask.\n\nThe Bishop of Saskatoon requested Reverend Canon H.E. Hives to communicate with us regarding the nomination of a teacher for the Red Pheasant School. I am just in receipt of his letter and he has a qualified teacher in view. As soon as a definite nomination is received you will be further advised.\n\nI am writing to you at this time in connection with the following statement made in Reverend Canon Hives' letter:\n\n\"The school building is heated only with great difficulty and the children from Red Pheasant find the excuse of a cold school during the winter a reasonable excuse for non-attendance.\"\n\nWe do not appear to have received any report from you in this connection and it would be appreciated if you would let me know if the facts are as stated by Canon Hives and, if so, what action can be taken to overcome this difficulty.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n43-302.\nBattleford, Saskatchewan, June 19th, 1944.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq., General Superintendent of Indian Agencies, Regina.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th inst., I would like to discuss in connection with the question of the continuation of the Red Pheasant Day School. I should point out that the attendance at this school is not as favourable as the figures on the returns would indicate. A large part of the attendance in the last quarter was made up of children of the Union Lake Anglican Residential School who were simply in the day school \"marking time\" until the residential school should be reopened after the fire. There are, at the present time, six children attending fairly regularly; the number would be about ten if we supplied transportation for some who are living too far away to be able to walk.\n\nI would feel inclined to re-open this school for the next term if we had the right kind of a teacher, and the decision in this regard should rest with the church authorities and the responsibility be theirs to get the right kind or we should not re-open the school. If there was a man and wife at this school, and transportation provided, it would be worth while continuing, in the event of course that the church authorities realize the kind of man and wife needed and appoint no other kind. The last teacher was hopeless and her last term at that school was, in my opinion, so much wasted money. If the church authorities can do no better than that at the present time I certainly think the school should remain closed until something better is available.\n\nThe department should be reminded that this class-room building is not fit for use in cold weather and was to have been replaced, but replacement fell through as the result of the war and the matter is in abeyance until the war is over. Doctor Robertson condemned the building in 1938 and arrangements were made to build one in 1939 but the war intervened and I was told that nothing further was done until after the war. The result was that most of the children who were available for a day school were sent away to residential schools and there are now very few available. This should be one of the projects for immediately after the war and, coupled with the building of the school, there should be adequate transportation facilities because some of the families who will have children over.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd instant, 105-6-5, in connection with the proposed appointment of a new teacher at the Red Pheasant Day School, and in particular to that part which refers to the question of the heating facilities in the classroom, I have to say that nothing has been reported in recent years about this heating difficulty, for the reason that the building was condemned by the late Doctor Robertson in 1938 and arrangements made, at that time, for the erection of a new school to replace this one.\n\nHaving been informed that, as the result of the war and the resulting cancellation of all the Department's building programs, no school could be built at this point until after the war, I have not troubled the Department further with complaining about a situation which could not be remedied, and the teachers have been told, when taking over this school, that the heating of the classroom is a problem in the cold weather. I had asked Canon Hives to keep this in mind when talking to a new prospective teacher because I did not want a new one to go there and then start complaining about the heating of the classroom when nothing could be done about it.\n\nI may say that, following my recommendation, in my letter of the 30th May, last, that the school be closed, the Department referred the matter to Mr. Christianson, and he took it up with me again; in reply to his letter, and in order to make the picture more clear to him, I mentioned the matter of the heating of the classroom building. I am enclosing a copy of this letter.\n\nJ.F.B.Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 7, 1944.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander, Indian Agent, Battleford, Sask.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of August 28, in which you submit additional information with respect to the condition of the Red Pheasant Day School.\n\nIn this connection I am sending forward herewith copy of a letter received by this Branch from Canon Hives. It is unnecessary to state that the information that Mr. Ross was not prepared to accept the position of teacher at this school was very disturbing to the officials here and to myself.\n\nIn view of the fact that we have no definite information with respect to the date on which the Government is likely to undertake a building program, would it be possible to have certain repairs undertaken at this particular school that would enable us to keep it open and in operation for a year or two? It would be appreciated if you would express an opinion on the desirability of banking up the school on the outside and repairing the windows and doors in such a way that heat might be conserved and draughts avoided. You might also express an opinion with respect to the size of the stove now at the school. If, however, you feel that this particular school is beyond repair, you should state so in your letter. In sending forward your recommendations, would it be possible to state, approximately, the total cost?\n\nEncl.\n\nR. A. Hosy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, 105-6-5, in connection with the Red Pheasant Day School. I have noted, also, the contents of the letter which the Department received from Canon Hives in this regard.\n\nMrs. McDonald, the last teacher, made no effort to keep the dwelling house and grounds in shape and, when she left, I did not spend any money on the grounds or house because I expected that they would not be used any more and such an expenditure would then have been wasted. There is no water supply at the present school site and many wells have been sunk without getting water, consequently the water for the use of the school has been hauled in barrels and it was my intention to make sure of a water supply before deciding upon the site of the proposed new school.\n\nOnly six children are now available for attendance at this school unless we are prepared to put on two teams to transport the children to school; in the event that two teams are taking them to school regularly, the attendance would be about fifteen. The additional children would be collected, for the most part, on the Stoney Reserve.\n\nIt should be mentioned that Mr. Ross' reason for not accepting the Red Pheasant School, was chiefly the result of his wife's attitude towards it. He had been teacher at the Sandy Lake Indian Day School and, according to his wife's statement, made in my presence, they left that school because it was too quiet and hard on her \"nerves\". I understand that this school is well equipped and in good condition. It is certainly quiet around the Red Pheasant School and when I heard Mrs. Ross' remarks I made no effort to persuade them to stay as I do not like dealing with \"nervy\" women. There is the mid-day meal, sewing, etc., for the teacher's wife to help with, and steady nerves would be needed.\n\nWith regard to repairing the class-room building, and making it fit for use in cold weather, I strongly recommend (that nothing -\nthat nothing be done in this connection at the present time. I have not made full enquiry as to the cost because there are no workmen, either carpenters or plumbers, available to give me an estimate and there is little possibility of being able to purchase the necessary materials if we did get the workmen. These matters were not obstacles when the late Doctor Robertson made the decision that it was unwise to spend any money on this old building, but they are obstacles now. The cost of transportation will be considerably higher, if resumed at this time. It was being done for $2.00 a day for each man and team. Present wages are about $8.00 to $9.00 a day for a man and team. There is no water at the school and this would have to be hauled, which would cost at least $10.00 a month; considerably more than this if the teacher was not very careful in using the water.\n\nIn addition to all the reasons mentioned, I do not like to think that the expenditure of a large sum of money, at this time, to repair a building for which we may not be able to get a teacher suitable, would mean that we would have to continue the use of a patched-up building, with no water supply, for years to come, instead of having a good building where there is a good supply of water and I know that the Department would not consider the erection of a new building shortly after having spent a considerable sum on the old one.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 18, 1944.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander, Indian Agent, Battleford, Sask.\n\nRe: Red Pheasant Day School.\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th instant and to thank you for the information contained therein.\n\nIn view of all the circumstances, I am disposed to think that this school should remain closed, for the time being at least, but that a new school for the Red Pheasant Reserve should be included in the Government's immediate post-war building program and should be one of the first schools erected. In the meantime and until the new school is established, you might make an investigation with respect to the best site that might be selected, keeping in mind central location, adequate water supply and such matters.\n\nR.

In the event that two teams are taking them to school regularly, the attendance would be about fifteen.\"\n\nIn addition, the Agent commented in his letter on the fact that it would take a considerable amount of money to put both the school and residence in proper condition.\n\nIf the same condition prevails this year as last year, namely, that only 6 children are available without translocating children a considerable distance, I doubt the advisability of re-opening the school at the present time. However, I am communicating with the Indian Agent, with a view to ascertaining if conditions have changed. Possibly more children would be available this year than were there last year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. Canon H.E.

Before any work is done repairing this school, I would suggest that Canon Hives have Mr. P.G. Kehler go out to Red Pheasant Reserve and size up the situation to see if he would be satisfied with conditions there. Canon Hives is absent from Battleford on holidays, and will be away for two weeks. About a year ago a teacher who was interested went out, when he saw the layout he would not consider staying.\n\nThere are thirteen children of Red Pheasant Reserve, living 3-6 miles, and fifteen children from the Stoney Reserve living 3-6 miles away from the school who should attend.\n\nIf school was reopened transportation would have to be provided for children coming from the Stoney Reserve, two outfits would have to be provided at a cost of $3.00 per day, as on account of the location of the homes to the school, it would be out of the question for one outfit to handle all pupils. Indians of the Stoney Reserve would not consider doing the work for less.\n\nWater is quite a question for school and residence, which has to be hauled a considerable distance.\n\nEnclosed requisition for material and labour will cover requirements to put buildings in fair shape until such time funds are available to erect a new school in a more central location.\n\nUnless the church authorities can obtain the services of a first class teacher, I would not be in favour of reopening school.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Agent feels that it will be advisable to have Mr. Kahler visit Red Pheasant Reserve and size up the situation before incurring any heavy expenditure. I believe this is a good suggestion and I trust that Mr. Kahler will be able to get in touch with Acting Agent C. S. Bell, in order that he can arrange for his visit to the Red Pheasant School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. Canon H. E.

(RG 10, Volume 6292, file 618-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nDepartment of Mines & Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Canada\n\nRecently, I had an occasion to visit the Red Pheasant Day School which was re-opened this past month with Mr. Adam Cuthand in charge. I found nineteen Red Pheasant children and one child from the Stoney Reserve in attendance.\n\nThere are about twelve children from the Stoney Reserve who would like to attend this school but on account of the distance it is out of the question for them to do so without transportation being furnished.\n\nTo pick up these children, it would mean a trip of ten miles one way and the cost would be, for a man and team, $3.00 per school day, which I consider is reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nI would recommend that this expenditure be approved and the Band is quite in favour of charging same to their Band Account No. 332.\n\nThere are six more children of school age living about six miles from the Red Pheasant School but on account of the distance I would not be in favour of providing transportation for these children.\n\nC.

Bell, Indian Agent,\nBattleford, Saskatchewan.\n\nConstruction of One-room Day School and Attached Teacherage - Red Pheasant.\n\nWe have now a stock of blueprints, specifications and bills of materials for our standard one-room day school and attached teacher's residence.\n\nThe Auditor General has insisted that, in future, the clauses of the Public Works Act with regard to advertising for tenders be adhered to. During the emergency war years, some variations from these regulations were permitted, but we are now required to advertise for tenders on construction of public buildings in excess of $5,000.00. Attached hereto please find a sample advertisement. It is our intention to advertise for tenders for the construction of the Red Pheasant Day School in the near future. Therefore, we would request you to advise us:\n\n(a) The names of the newspapers in or near your agency in which you would recommend that we advertise;\n\n(b) Post offices and other government buildings in which we should display drawings, specifications, etc.\n\nNaturally, your own office will be one in which we will display drawings, etc. If no tenders are received after advertising, you will be advised so that other means can be considered whereby the construction of this school can be carried out during the fiscal year 1948-49. These other means\n\n...... involve\ninvolve:\n\n1. Direct approach to contractors when advertising has failed to produce tenders.\n\n2. Construction on a day labour basis.\n\n3. The erection of a prefabricated school.\n\nWith regard to (2) above, the Department, as previously stated, has a complete bill of materials for the construction of this standard school. Other agents have successfully had this school constructed this year by employing a foreman-carpenter and Indian helpers. The drawings and specifications are very clear and the Department buys all the necessary materials. I give you this information so that you can consider such a mode of construction if advertising fails.\n\nWe would appreciate receiving from you the information required in paras (a) and (b) above. We should also be advised as to the availability of hydro and water facilities and their distance from the school building.\n\nBernard V.

When I receive this information from Mrs. Lindberg I will immediately communicate with you.\n\nC.S. Bell\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 30, 1948.\n\nMr. J.F.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nYou will recall that when you visited Ottawa we were advised that Mr. Max Campbell, M.P., had recommended Mr. Fred C. Santon, 1541 - 99th Street, North Battleford, as a good small contractor and builder, who would probably be ready to undertake contracts for the coming season. On checking your school construction program for 1948-49, I find that there are two schools projected for the Battleford Agency, namely Sweetgrass and Red Pheasant. It is presumed that you have plans in mind and that you might be interested in interviewing Mr. Santon. It is possible that he would consider one or the other of these schools on a day labour basis.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Can.\n\nFurther to my letter of February 16th with reference to the securing of a good water supply for the new Red Pheasant School. I have been able to interest Mr. Garfield Weum in giving me an estimate on the cost of digging. It will cost $2.00 per foot for a 30\" hole plus $1.50 for cribbing. At this rate a hundred foot well will cost approximately $430.00. It is quite possible that we may have to go that depth to secure an adequate supply.\n\nMr. Weum advised me that the cost would be the same for a dry hole less the cost of cribbing. He is the only man available who has a machine.\n\nThere is only one other well digger in the district and he has a boring machine. He has left for another part of the province and I cannot secure any definite information as to when he will likely return. I understand he usually charges about two thousand dollars and guarantees water. I think the other machine would be able to secure for us an adequate supply.\n\nC.S.

It must be distinctly\nunderstood by you that the total expenditure must\nnot exceed $430.00. It is hoped that you will\nstrike water at less than one hundred feet and con-\nsequently the cost would be less.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\n\nIndian Affairs.

Bell,\nSuperintendent, Battleford Agency\n\nenclosure.\nRed Pheasant School:\n\nMr. Capt. Bell took me to this school this afternoon.\n\nReplacement of this school is not in my opinion\u2014and Mr. Bell and Canon Harris concur\u2014an immediate necessity.\n\nAdmittedly the school building needs some repairs, but as it stands, it is in better condition than Thunderchild School.\n\nIf a new school is to be erected in this area it might rather be on the neighbouring Mosquito (Stone) Reserve from which children have for part of the year been transported to Red Pheasant School.\n\nThe chief factor in re-siting the school seems to be the desire to get a good well. But on the Red Pheasant Reserve a bountious well is difficult to assure.\n\nIt is worthwhile trying to find water near the existing school. And so, with the advice of Mr. Wm. Cockburn (Mr. Bell's assistant) who was in the party, I have suggested that a shallow trial hole be dug at a spot about 70 yards south-east of the school. The tree growth and contours of the land suggest that the chances of finding water here are as good as in most places. The shallow hole is to be dug...\nto discover whether a certain type of clay is present near the surface. If such clay is found up, it would indicate that a shallow well would be useless, and actual boring operations would be tried elsewhere. You are aware that a limit has been placed upon the depth and cost of well-boring operations.\n\nA decision as to the site for boring (or not boring at the spot suggested) is expected by the end of this week.\n\nI think the Department should repair this school, make a determined search for water, and transport the Stony children throughout the coming school year. Meanwhile the future needs of the Stony reserve are being studied.\n\nCosts involved:\n- Transportation $600\n- Well $430\n- Repairs $470 (?)\n\nRepairs:\n1. Block up basement windows and holes between wood and top of foundation. \"Hear is cold!\"\u2014no wonder!\n2. Remove some siding from outer wall, insulate, and re-nail siding which was taken off.\n3. Trade stove for the one in lunch-room which is in better condition.\n4. Possibly tar roof.\n\nCAT Clark\n\nCopies to: Regional Supervisor\nMr. Sept. Bell.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I would suggest that Major Clark visit Meadow Lake, discuss this matter with Father Allard and consider the establishment of a day school there.\n\nIn view of your statement re the St. Francis Day School on the White Bear's Reserve, would you consider recommending the transfer of funds from Keshewins to this point?\n\nIt would be appreciated if we could hear from you concerning the above two suggested transfers of funds.\n\nBernard F.

If either Church declines to conduct a qualified school, then the whole sum should go to the one willing to do so under, of course, the Conscience Clauses. We of the Church of England have our own school at Pine Bluff and Pelican Narrows.\nOttawa, November 11, 1924.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nYour Lordship will remember that you discussed, upon the occasion of your recent visit at Ottawa, the advisability of commencing summer day school activity at Pelican Narrows. Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham, of Regina, has discouraged a day school at this point; but, as you were promised by the Superintendent of Indian Education some months ago, the Department will allow a per diem rate for the summer months for teaching services at Pelican Narrows. I regret that no capital expense can be authorized at the present time.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRt. Rev. G. H. Lloyd, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nDear Mr. [Name],\n\nI have a very good man available at the end of this month highly qualified as a teacher, single and of good spirit and presence, with Saskatchewan certificate, if an arrangement can be made with the Department to give the major part of the year to school work at Pine Bluff and the minor part to Pelican Narrows.\n\nOf course I know that the Roman Catholics have the school at Pine Bluff at present but as I have already pointed out to you the injustice of that arrangement when the Church of England has the majority of the pupils.\n\nI have already suggested that in that case, so as to be fair to the Roman Catholics we should be given a pro rata stipend and maintenance and keep the school open only for that part of the year when the Indians are there, i.e., from 7 to 8 months.\n\nThe school at Pelican Narrows you have already sanctioned and as it only possible to work it during the months the Pine Bluff school would be closed, the two could be worked together very well indeed by a single man.\n\nWe have this man Mr. Parry available at the present time in Prince Albert and I am holding him back from a White school until your decision is received.\n\nWith kind regards Believe me to be\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 19, 1925.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 10th instant, with reference to the proposed day schools under Church of England auspices at Pelican Narrows and Pine Bluff. I note that you have a teacher in mind and that you believe the two activities could be handled by the same worker. I regret that I cannot authorise any salary or other expense in connection with the proposed Pine Bluff School at the present writing. I am corresponding with Mr. Indian Agent Waddy for his recommendation.\n\nIf Your Lordship is prepared to conduct a summer day school at Pelican Narrows, the Department will allow a salary for the teacher on a per diem rate - the rate to be determined by the qualifications of the incumbent. No capital expense can be authorized at the present time.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRt. Rev. G. E. Lloyd, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOttawa, March 19, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan has asked the Department to assist financially a day school under Church of England auspices at Pine Bluff. His Lordship has been informed that we are asking you for a recommendation. In this connection, please see your 1617-116 of April 1, 1922, my 128-17-1 of April 10, 1922, and the correspondence which grew out of these letters.\n\nYou might let me have a full report as to the number of children of each religious faith at Pine Bluff at the present time. You should indicate if there is sufficient interest on the part of the parents and a large enough number of children to warrant two day schools on this reserve. You might also give me any other information you can, which will assist the Department in making a decision. Please comment on the movement of the Cumberland Band Indians to this new reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. W.

We shall be glad to advise you when Mr. Dey begins his work.\n\nAs you are aware, there is no school at Pellican Narrows but the church will be used in the meantime. There are no supplies of any kind and we shall be glad if you will please forward the customary supplies such as: Plasticine, Letter Cards, Readers, Scribblers, Slates, Lead and Slate Pencils, and Coloured Sticks. For the Blackboard it will be necessary to use either Hyloplate or the pliable material that is easily rolled up.\n\nYou will probably know what is needed in this regard but we thought it wise to make some suggestions in order to be sure that the School will be equipped as well as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChairman of the Bishop's Commission.\n\nMr. Duncan Scott\nIndian Department\nOttawa, Ontario.\nPelican Narrows,\nNia Stel Pass,\nSask.\n20th July '25\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI officially opened the school on the 19th of June and up to the present have been teaching on Saturdays. The term being so short I thought it best I make use of every working day. I wonder if you will be so good as to notify the Indian Dept. when I begin and whether they are agreeable for me to teach Saturdays. I opened with 23 pupils and now have 41! Good progress is being made and the attendance are good.\n\nI did not meet you in Prince Albert. Best Wishes,\n\nFrank b. Del.\nDear Sir:\n\nWriting for the Bishop of Saskatchewan may I state that Mr. Frank C. Dey began his teaching duties at Pelican Narrows on the 19th of June.\n\nI am enclosing a letter from him in which he asks permission to carry on the school for six days each week owing to the shortness of time during which the school is open. Will you kindly advise whether that is satisfactory to you.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nCharles W.

Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, enclosing a communication from Mr. Frank C. Dey, teacher of the summer day school at Pelican Narrows, requesting permission to keep the school in operation on Saturdays.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will have no objection to Mr. Dey teaching each Saturday during the period the school is in operation, and we will allow him salary at the rate of $5, the same as for the other teaching days in the week. We note that he commenced duties on the 19th of June last, and that there has been a good and regular attendance.\n\nWhen Mr. Dey closes the school, he should prepare returns on the forms for that purpose, showing the names of the children in attendance, the standards or grades, the number of days attended by each pupil, and the total number of days taught by him. When this return is received, payment of the amount of salary due for his services will be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRt. Rev. G. B. Lloyd, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have today forwarded to you my returns for the Summer School that I opened in June.\n\nDr. Lloyd, Bishop of Saskatchewan, paid me on your sanction. I continued Saturday teaching for which I thank you.\n\nAs I knew the school time would be short, I taught school on Saturdays from the outset.\n\nWith regard to the returns you will see that I have sent in three.\n\nAs the returns show there were actually ten pupils residing in Pelican Narrows during the whole time the school was in operation. The other pupils came at all different times and left before I closed the school.\n\nAs you will see, I have only given their actual absent days while in Pelican Narrows and not for the whole\nSession.\n\nThe ten pupils that actually resided in Pelican Narrows for the whole period I have also given on another form.\n\nBefore receiving your communication I had sent to Mr. Taylor, Indian Agent at Regina, the attendance for the few days in June.\n\nI am sorry I have caused this bother, but am now following your instructions and I'm doing the grand totals for the time the school was open.\n\nI enclose a copy, which one of the councilors of the Band gave me before leaving.\n\nI remain\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nFrank B. Day\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nWe, the Indians of Pelican Narrows wish to recommend Mr. Day, who opened and taught the first school in this district, as being exceptionally capable in handling and teaching our children, none whom ever attended school before.\n\nWe would like very much to have Mr. Day continue next season as he is familiar with all pupils. If possible that Mr. Day may return here we will be only too willing to build at our own expense a school house which would be more suitable than the present building in use, the barrel of Baylaid Mission.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nGeorge Butten,\nCouncillor Pelican Narrows Band.\nOttawa, September 30, 1925.\n\nSIR,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, enclosing returns for the period you taught the Summer School at Pelican Narrows.\n\nIt is noted that you had the school open for 71 days, and, at the rate promised, namely, $5.00 a day, there is $355.00 due you, cheques for which amount will be forwarded under separate cover.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I met them after the general meeting was over and they broached the question of a day school for them at Sandy Narrows. There are 40 Anglican children of school age who would attend. It is for these children that the day school is kept open during the summer months. They also asked for some provisions for their children who are attending the day school. I am not greatly in favor of day schools, but taking the number of children into consideration, it would warrant the Department keeping the school on and supplying a building. The building now in use is a small chapel in which religious services are held. This Band is of the Swampy Cree Tribe and number 437 souls, the same as last year. Health conditions amongst these people were fair. The doctor attended to many minor ailments, but nothing serious. He also vaccinated quite a number of children as well as some adults. Thirteen children were sent down from this Band.\n\nW. R. Taylor,\nIndian Agent.\nCommissioner's Office,\nRegina, Sask., Oct. 22, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nThe Protestant portion of Peter Ballendine's Band are asking for an improved day school, to be built at their reserve at Sandy Harrows, on Pelican Lake. The average attendance for the time this school was open this summer was 19. I leave this for the Department to decide. The plow, harrow, and two more wheelbarrows as well as the food for day school, have been included in the estimates.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, November 18, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to refer to that portion of your letter of the 22nd ultimo, enclosing Mr. Indian Agent Taylor's report, which is relative to the proposed school to take the place of the summer school now conducted at Pelican Narrows.

The children are Anglicans who belong to Peter Ballendine's Band and the school is open for the summer months only.\n\nThere were 12 girls and 10 boys in attendance at the time of my visit; the school has been open since June 26th last.\n\nThe pupils were learning their alphabet, figures, and how to read and write; they naturally did not know very much, but the teacher had done as well as possible during his stay here.\n\nThere is no school building here; they use the church for a classroom. No seats have been provided for the pupils and if the school is to be continued a supply of 24 single desks should be sent to Pelican Narrows, Ross Navigation Co., The Pas, Man.\n\nJ. W. Waddy,\nPaying Agent.\nPRINCE ALBERT.\n\nmatter of the location of the school with the Indians in August last, and I inspected a site they suggested at Sandy Grasses. They said they would prefer to have the school there rather than at Pelican Grasses, because there is good soil there, and they can grow potatoes and vegetables, and the fishing is better than at Pelican Grasses. They would therefore find it easier to provide food for their families at that point. Accordingly I beg to apply for the building of a school by the Indian Department at Sandy Grasses, if possible next spring. The material would have to be sent in by team during the winter, when a freight trail is kept open over the ice. A room for the use of the Teacher could be attached to the school. Our Indian Agent Waddy, Rev. Pat. Man., will bear out all that I have said. Mr. D. Wickenden taught the school last summer, and he would be willing to go there again next year.\n\nHoping that this project will meet with your approval,\n\nI am\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. S. J. Paul (Archdeacon)\nDear Sir,\n\nI would like to bring to your notice the following matter. The summer school for the Pelican Narrows Indians was held last summer at a point called Sandy Narrows, six miles South of Pelican Narrows, where many of the Indians have homes, and large potato and vegetable gardens. A log house belonging to one of the Indians was used for this purpose. For three years previously our Church building at Pelican Narrows was used for a school, owing to the lack of a school building. This arrangement was inconvenient, and the Indians themselves do not like it. The log building used last summer was too small and low, and it is hardly fair to keep the owner out of his house. I talked over the\nMonday Nov 26th 1928.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe letter enclosed from Archdeacon Paul (who is now in charge of all our Indian Missions in this diocese) speaks for itself. I have known for some time past that the Indians have been asking for this change and the last time I was at Pelican Narrows they seemed quite united on the question of the need for change owing to the food question, but they were not decided as to whether it would be better to move to some point nearer the provincial boundary line and the new railway line.\n\nEven then the majority were in favour of moving to this place of Sandy Narrows 6 or 7 miles from Pelican Narrows. I asked the Rev Mr Fraser of The Pas to investigate the matter thoroughly and he is decidedly in favour of the change.\n\nI understand that the Indian Agent at the Pas is also in favour of the change.\n\nWhen Archdeacon Paul made the round this summer I asked him to go fully into the question and his judgement is given in the letter enclosed.\n\nWhat is wanted at Sandy Narrows is not an expensive Improved school but a good sized log building with a lean-to for the teacher to live in.\n\nAlready a good many of the Indians have houses built there because of the fishing being so much better and the only question for some time past has been whether all the rest of our people should follow their example.\n\nI think it would be decidedly better if they did do this but that of course must depend on whether the Department will aid them by putting up this log building for a school and teachers residence.\n\nBelieve me to be\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nG.E. Saskatchewan\nOttawa, December 5, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nIn 1927, Mr. Indian Agent Taylor urged the Department to provide a school building and teacher's residence for the summer school, which is conducted for the Pelican Narrows Indians. He recommended that it be placed on the Sandy Narrows reserve, which is a few miles south of Pelican Narrows. The Department is in receipt of communications from Bishop Lloyd and Archdeacon Paul, urging that a log building be erected early in the spring and that the material be sent in this winter by team. It is suggested that a small teacher's residence be attached to the classroom. You might let me have a recommendation and estimate of the cost in this connection. You should also indicate if you would be in a position to make the necessary arrangements for the freighting and for the erection of the school in the spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

My personal view is that if we build any more day schools in this district we may have to close up the Mackay School.

However, if there is any likelihood that the Indians will remain on the reserve (Sandy Narrows) for the entire year, it is possible that the establishment of a regular day school should be considered. I should be grateful if you would discuss this with His Lordship and with others who are familiar with the situation and let me have a recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ.

Unfortunately the Rev. A. Fraser of The Pas who knows the district and people well, was prevented from attending. However, as he will be visiting Pelican Narrows immediately after Christmas, he has been asked to look into the matter thoroughly and report on it. We shall let you know later the result of his investigation.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6292, file 619-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF ARCHDEACON W. E. J. PAUL,\nPRINCE ALBERT, SASK., DATED NOVEMBER 14, 1930.\n\nWith reference to establishing ten months' schools at Stanley and Pelican Narrows, Saskatchewan, we understand that the Department's Agents have decided that the three months' schools are not a success.\n\nRe \"Pelican Narrows\" School, the Indians have decided that Sandy Narrows would be a better site for the school than Pelican Narrows. They would leave their children there during the Winter and provide fish and wild meat as at Stanley. They were disappointed at not having a school last summer, but are pleased now at the thought of having a ten months' school.\n\nThere is no school building or teacher's residence at either Pelican or Sandy Narrows. When the summer school was held, the Church building was used for a school and the teacher lived either in a tent or in an Indian house. New buildings would therefore be needed at Sandy Narrows and all school equipment and supplies. The Indians at this point have had very little chance of getting their children educated and we strongly urge that this new effort be undertaken. Rev. E. Ahenakew talked over this matter with Mr. Russell Ferrier in Ottawa in September and I believe he will give a favourable report on the matter. Another reason why Sandy Narrows seems to be the better site is that there is good soil there and the Indians have quite large potato gardens at that point, and the fishing is better than at Pelican Narrows.\nOttawa, November 20, 1930.\n\nVenerable Sir:\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of the 14th instant, regarding the establishment of a school for a ten months' period each year at Sandy Narrows instead of at Pelican Narrows, I have to say it is thought, from reports received from our officers, that a school at this point would meet with a fair amount of success. We are making a note to include an item in our Estimates for the next fiscal year to provide the funds required in the erection of a school and teacher's living quarters. If funds for the purpose are provided, the building could be erected next summer, and the school work begun early in the fall of 1931.\n\nThe reasons stated by you for having the school at Sandy Narrows instead of at Pelican Narrows have been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

(no. 132-5-1) re proposed ten-months school at Sandy Narrows, I should like to suggest that it might be advantageous to have the two months holiday either during the winter trapping season, or the Spring muskrat season (March - May). During July and August would be home with their parents in any case and might as well be going to school, but in the winter months special arrangements would have to be made. Your officers who know these parts would know what is best.\n\nIf you adopt this plan, perhaps the school at Sandy Narrows could be opened in the summer instead of the early Fall of 1931. The children have had no teaching since Sept. 1929.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I cannot get a teacher to say he would be willing to go there till he knows what the salary will be. As you know provisions are expensive at the Northern Posts and therefore a teacher's board would cost a good deal more than at a school near the railway.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. L. J. Paul.\nOttawa, March 9, 1931.\n\nVenerable Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to the salary that will be allowed at the Sandy Narrows Indian Day School. The Department grant for this purpose would depend on the type of worker that you nominate. If he is for teaching services only, we would naturally have to pay a higher stipend than if he were combined missionary and teacher. Further, the Department grant depends partly on the qualifications and experience of a teacher. Our scale at the other Indian day schools in your Diocese will be a guide to you. We might allow an extra five or ten dollars a month because of the situation of this particular school.\n\nI may say that it is not at all sure that Parliament will provide funds for new buildings this year, and it may be necessary to postpone the establishment of this work for the time being.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

In reply I have to say that, as our appropriation for the current fiscal year was considerably reduced, the item to provide funds for new buildings at this point was struck out.

Please advise to whom the biscuits were forwarded and why they were supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJohn Weir, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLest, Sask.\n18th Feb. 1937.\n\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been in correspondence with the Hudson Bay Company, in regard to the buildings at Pelican Narrows in Saskatchewan used until recently by the Revillon Freres Company. These buildings are offered for sale at a small figure or for rent at the nominal rental of $1.00 per year provided that the tenant keeps them in repair.\n\nThis matter was discussed at the recent meeting of the Executive Committee of this Diocese, and I have already written to Mr. Indian Agent Lovell of The Pas asking if he thought it would be possible to start a school at this point, and to make use of these buildings. He has replied that he is willing to recommend this proposal and advised me to write you on the subject.\n\nYou will remember that some years ago a seasonal school was operated at this point, but the work was handicapped through having no suitable building. The Church was used temporarily as a school. Just before the depression began, the Department had decided to erect a building; but owing to lack of funds after the commencement of the depression, the project was abandoned.\n\nNow the opportunity has arisen of obtaining buildings almost without cost. The store building could easily be adapted as a classroom and the residence is all ready for occupation by a teacher. Therefore if the Department can see its way to operate a school once more at this point, we shall be very pleased to find a teacher.\n\nAccording to the report of the Department by the last Census, there are 154 children in this Band between the ages of seven and sixteen, about half of whom are Roman Catholics. It would seem important that so large a number of children should have educational facilities on their own Reserve.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. E. J.

He is being informed that, as no provision has been made in our Appropriation for a school at this point, it is not possible to favourably consider his suggestion at the present time.\n\nA summer school was conducted on this Reserve under the auspices of the Church of England from 1926 to 1929.\n\nOn the occasion of your next visit to Pelican Narrows, you should make a survey of the number of children of school age. You should ascertain the number of children of school age who are members of the Church of England and the number who are Roman Catholic. Do they reside sufficiently close to some central point to permit successful operation of one or two day schools? Do you consider that the operation of a seasonal school, for a period of three or four months each year, would be sufficient? Would a year-round school be feasible? Any other information that you can obtain should also be forwarded, in order that we will be in a position to decide what is the best educational policy to adopt at this point.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

I would suggest that this matter should be taken up with Indian Agent Lovell, Le Pas, Manitoba as I have no jurisdiction over Pelican Narrows and I understand Mr. Lovell has.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nMines and Resources,\nIndian Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 15, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed is a copy of letter just received from Venerable Archdeacon W. E. J. Paul. He is being informed that, as no provision has been made in our Appropriation for a school at this point, it is not possible to favourably consider his suggestion at the present time.\n\nA summer school was conducted on this reserve under the auspices of the Church of England from 1926 to 1929.\n\nOn the occasion of your next visit to Pelican Narrows, you should make a survey of the number of children of school age. You should ascertain the number of children of school age who are members of the Church of England and the number who are Roman Catholic. Do they reside sufficiently close to some central point to permit successful operation of one or two day schools? Do you consider that the operation of a seasonal school, for a period of three or four months each year, would be sufficient? Would a year-round school be feasible? Any other information that you can obtain should also be forwarded, in order that we will be in a position to decide what is the best educational policy to adopt at this point.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.M.\n\nEnc. 1.\n\nSamuel Lowell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter 132-5-1, dated March 15th, 1937. I beg to advise that I investigated the matter regarding establishing a day School at Pelican Narrows under the auspices of the Church of England.\n\nThere are about 24 children of school age residing near Pelican Narrows, who belong to the Anglican Church. They all reside close together and could attend a school if one were established close to the settlement.\n\nI do not think a year-round school would be feasible as most of these Indians are away on their trap lines from some time in October till May and take their children with them. A seasonal school could be established from the beginning of June until the end of September and would be beneficial.\n\nThe building the Rev. Archdeacon W.E.J. Paul spoke about is suitable but it would need some repairs, which would cost approximately $100.00. There is no equipment there at all and this would have to be supplied.\n\nWith regard to the Roman Catholic children. There are no children there of school age as they are all sent to the Guy Indian Residential School. I would be pleased if the Department would let me know as soon as possible if it is their intention to establish a school at Pelican Narrows. I could then ask for the necessary expenditure to establish the school in the estimates.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 25, 1937\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgement your letter of the 19th instant in which you state: \"There are 24 children of school age residing near Pelican Narrows who belong to the Anglican Church. They all reside close together and could attend a school, if one were established close to the settlement.\"\n\nIn view of the recommendation contained in your communication, you are authorized to include in your estimates of next year the sum necessary to provide accommodation for these pupils.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nSamuel Lovell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOctober 21, 1938.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: Pelican Narrows\n\nAt our Indian Executive Meeting yesterday a report was presented by Archdeacon Paul and Canon Ahenakew on their recent visit to Pelican Narrows as follows:\n\n\"Need for Day School.\n\nThis matter was brought up at the meeting for men on August 26. Thirteen fathers of families were present and all voted in favour of a school. They represented 23 children, but there were other parents not present so that more children than the above 23 would be likely to attend. The people at Pelican Narrows would do the same as the people at Stanley to help to carry on a Day School on their Reserve, i.e., they would lend two houses for the accommodation of boys and girls during the winter. Two women would be willing to keep house for the children, and the men would help to provide food by giving meat and fish, and they would also put up wood for the use of the school. Only three pupils from Pelican Narrows attend Lac la Ronge Residential School. Two more children have been attending Lac la Ronge School but their fathers did not take them back this year.\n\nAccordingly, only a very small proportion of the Anglican children at Pelican Narrows are receiving any education at all, and it is therefore very necessary that a Day School should be started for them.\"\n\nYou will see from this report that these children\nare growing up with no education. I hope that it will be possible to arrange for the building of a Day School similar to the one at Stanley.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBp/A\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey, Secretary,\nWelfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nThe Pas, Man.,\nOct. 24, 1938.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to advise that I have just received a letter from the Right Rev. W. Bird, Bishop of Saskatchewan with regard to establishing a Church of England Day School at Pelican Narrows.\n\nThere are quite a number of families who are adherants of the Anglican Church resident at Pelican Narrows whose children are getting no education, and it would be a great advantage to these people if a school were established there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSamuel Lovell\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nOctober 31, 1938.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 21st instant enclosing report presented by Archdeacon Paul and Canon Ahenakew in connection with the proposed establishment of a school at Pelican Narrows. I am communicating with the Indian Agent and will advise you later regarding what action this Branch can take.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRt. Rev. W. Burd, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa,\nOctober 31, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 24th instant in which you refer to a recent letter you received from Rt. Rev. W. Burd in connection with establishing a day school at Pelican Narrows. I enclose a copy of a letter which we have just received from Bishop Burd. Possibly it is the same as the one you have.\n\nI presume that a seasonal school only is desired at this point. Please let me know whether you recommend the school be operated in the winter or the summer. I might add that we do not wish to establish any school which would encourage the Indians to stay at home and not pursue their useful avocations.\n\nDo you consider that the Indians would be prepared to get out logs for a school and, if so, you should estimate the additional amount that would be necessary to provide a suitable building. An early reply to this letter would be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nS. Lovell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter 132-5-1, dated the 31st ultimo, in connection with previous correspondence from myself and the Rt. Rev. W. Burd, in connection with establishing a school at Pelican Narrows.\n\nThe letter I received from the Rt. Rev. W. Burd was something similar to the one directed to the Department.\n\nIt is not quite clear to me just what Bishop Burd has in mind. I take it that he wants a school established at Pelican Narrows to be open the whole year around, also he wants accommodation provided for the children so that they can be boarded while the parents are away on the trapping grounds. He states the Indians would lend two houses for the accommodation of the boys and girls and two women would keep house, also that the men would help provide food by supplying meat and fish and also put up wood. I presume that he is looking to the Department to provide the other food that would be necessary and also pay the other expenses of upkeep. In fact what he is asking for is a kind of Boarding School.\n\nI do not think his idea would be practicable. The Indians no doubt have promised to supply fish, meat and wood, but getting them to keep that promise so that the children would be well supplied with these articles mentioned would indeed be a difficult matter. It would ultimately mean that the Department would have to provide for the entire upkeep of the school and children, including food, clothing, upkeep of building and payment of staff. Then again I would not think it would be wise to leave school children in charge of Indian women who were not their parents.\n\nThis matter of opening a school at Pelican Narrows has been taken up before. I would refer you to my letter dated Aug. 19th, 1937, which was in answer to your letter 132-5-1, dated March 15th, 1937. I am inclined to stick to the recommendations made in that letter.\nThe building I referred to in my letter of Aug. 19th, 1937, can, I believe, still be got. Of course we can build a new log school and the Indians could get out the logs. It would be best to figure on paying for the work, otherwise it would be difficult to get it done. The necessary lumber and other building materials would have to be taken in from Flinflon and it could only be done during the winter months. The freight rate from Flinflon to Pelican Narrows is $3.00 per cwt.\n\nIf you intend taking any action with regard to providing a school at Pelican Narrows, it should be taken right away, as it is impossible to get material into Pelican Narrows after December or early in January, as the transportation companies make their trips about that time. I do not think they would make a special trip and if they did it would be at a much greater price than that I have quoted. I believe a suitable building would cost the Department $1500.00\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 16, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 8th instant with reference to the request of Rt. Rev. W. Burd for the establishment of a school at Pelican Narrows.\n\nThe contents of your letter have been carefully noted and I have also reviewed your letter of August 19, 1937.\n\nYou may arrange for the repairs to the building mentioned in your letter of August 19, 1937 and it is noted that the cost of these repairs will not exceed $100.00. You should also report what other equipment is required and give full shipping directions. The Department is prepared to favourably consider opening this school about June 1 next on the understanding that it will be conducted during the summer months only. I am so advising Bishop Burd.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nS. Lovell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOttawa,\nNovember 16, 1938.\n\nEX'D.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of October 21 and my reply of October 31 with reference to the proposed establishment of a school at Pelican Narrows.\n\nI am in receipt of a very complete report from Indian Agent Lovell. He is of the opinion that a seasonal school only should be established at this point. He points out that while the Indians may promise to provide food and wood at the same time if they neglected to do so the cost would have to be borne by the Department. He also doubts the advisability of leaving children of school age in charge of Indian women who are not their parents. I understand from Mr. Lovell that there is a building at Pelican Narrows that might be used for school purposes provided approximately $100.00 were spent on repairs. I am authorizing him to make repairs to this extent and advising him that we are prepared to conduct a seasonal school at Pelican Narrows during the summer of 1939. It is understood that this school will open by June 1. You might nominate a teacher to take charge of this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRt. Rev. W. Burd, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMarch 8, 1939.\n\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe_proposed_Day_School_at_Pelican_Narrows,\n_Saskatchewan_\n\nI know that a short time ago you were in correspondence\nwith the Bishop of Saskatchewan with regard to above school.\nOwing to continued ill-health, the Bishop has had to resign,\nand I am, therefore, writing instead of him.\n\nDo you wish us to nominate a teacher for this school,\nand has it been decided by the Department to operate the\nschool for the summer months only? I believe that was the\nplan which Mr. Lovell, Indian Agent at The Pas, favored.\nIt was found at Stanley that a ten months' school was more\neffective than a seasonal school, but perhaps you would\nlike the school at Pelican Narrows to be operated for the\nsummer to begin with, and a decision could be made later\nwith regard to keeping it open for the winter.\n\nIf it is to be operated as a summer school, I beg to\nnominate Mr. Walter Buxton, who is a student at Emmanuel\nCollege, Saskatoon, and at the Saskatchewan University. He\nhas not taken Normal, but he was working under the Department\nat Elkhorn Residential School for a time, and occasionally\nsubstituted in the school room there. He is keen to take\nup Indian work, and had experience with Indians at Elkhorn.\nThe Bishop of Saskatchewan interviewed him last Fall, and was pleased with him in every way and arranged for his entry into Emmanuel College. I saw him, myself, last week, and I believe that he would make a suitable teacher for the above school. If this meets with your approval, and you wish for further information with regard to Mr. Buxton, would you kindly send to him direct at Emmanuel College, Saskatoon, the usual form for him to fill out, as I shall be out of reach of mail for the next two weeks.\n\nIt is rather an expensive journey to Pelican Narrows, and you have usually either allowed travelling expenses or given some extra salary out of which the teacher could pay his own travelling expenses. Will you kindly let me know what arrangements the Department would make about this?\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nArchdeacon of Saskatchewan.\nOttawa, March 14, 1939.\n\nVenerable Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to the proposed establishment of a day school at Pelican Narrows.\n\nIn view of your recommendation the Department approves the appointment of Mr. Walter Buxton as teacher for the summer season of 1939. He will be allowed salary at the rate of $95.00 a teaching month.\n\nA report received last fall from Indian Agent Lovell intimated that the school should open about June first, but the Indian agent did not state at that time the number of months he considered it should be kept in operation. I am therefore writing to him today and on receipt of his reply you will be further advised.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hosy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nVenerable Archdeacon W.E.J. Paul, M.A., LL.B.,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Saskatchewan.\nOttawa, March 14, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer you to my letter of November 16, last, with reference to the establishment of a day school at Pelican Narrows.\n\nOn the nomination of Venerable W. E. J. Paul, the Department is approving the appointment of Mr. Walter Burton as teacher of this school for the summer season of 1939. He will be allowed salary at the rate of $95.00 a teaching month.\n\nIn your letter of August 19, 1937, you suggested that the school be operated from June first to September 30th. Please let me know if these dates meet with your approval so that I can inform Venerable Archdeacon Paul.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nS. Lovell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Manitoba.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter 132-5-1, dated the 14th instant, in connection with the opening of Pelican Narrows Day School.\n\nThe dates mentioned in my letter of Aug. 19th, 1937, for the school to be open, that is from June 1st to Sept. 30th is recommended. Archdeacon Paul has written to me suggesting the school should be open the entire winter. I think however, the dates should stand as recommended. If conditions warrant the school being open any longer period, I will report upon it later.\n\nI have also been asked if the Department will purchase a stove for the residence the teacher is going to occupy. A stove could be purchased for about $60.00. The transportation, part of which would have to be by aeroplane would be about $20.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMarch 24, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 20th instant in which you recommend that the Pelican Narrows Indian day school be kept in operation from June 1 to September 30, 1939.\n\nYou should obtain the necessary returns from the teacher showing the names of pupils, days taught, etc., and forward these to the Department at regular intervals. If the teacher desires payment monthly a return should be forwarded at the end of each month.\n\nWith regard to the stove please let me have full particulars regarding the type required in order that purchase may be made by our Purchasing Agent. You should also supply explicit shipping directions.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nS. Lovell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOttawa,\nMarch 24, 1939.\n\nVenerable Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 8th instant and my reply of the 14th instant regarding the proposed establishment of a day school at Pelican Narrows, Indian Agent Lovell advises me that he considers the school should be open from June 1 to September 30, 1939.\n\nYou should, therefore, arrange to have Mr. Walter Burton at Pelican Narrows in time to open the school on June 1.\n\nMr. Burton should, of course, notify Mr. S. Lovell regarding the exact date on which he arrives at Pelican Narrows.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nVen. W. J. Paul, B.A., LL.B.,\nArchdeacon of Saskatchewan,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nMarch 20, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to nominate for the seasonal school at Pelican Narrows for the summer of 1940 Mr. W.W. Buxton of Emmanuel College, Saskatoon. Mr. Buxton taught this school last summer and from everything we hear he was a splendid success at this work.\n\nI have had an interview with Mr. Buxton and he is quite keen about Indian work and most anxious to devote his life to their welfare.\n\nMay I trouble you for your reply at your earliest convenience so that we may make the necessary arrangements both with Mr. Buxton and the people at Pelican Narrows.\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBp/A\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nMarch 27, 1940.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th instant the appointment of Mr. W.W.

Mr. Cuthand has had considerable experience in teaching and has had normal training. For the last two summers he has been teaching the Indian children at Loon Lake and is very highly spoken of by the people there. I feel sure he will help the Indians at Pelican Narrows as he understands their language and also their mode of thought.\n\nMr. Cuthand himself is a native hailing from the Little Pines Reserve here.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBp/A\n\nMr. R.A.

The Right Reverend D.T. Owen was to have been present and departmental officials were to be invited.

You will be pleased to know that as far as I am able to ascertain everything is flourishing at this school. I was there two Sundays ago, and the children seemed very happy and contented, and well fed and clothed.\n\nWhile writing I wonder if this is the time to ask if the Department has any plans regarding buildings at Pelican Narrows. Our school teacher last summer worked under many and great difficulties, both with regards to the school building and also the teacher's residence. I am quite sure that your representative, Mr. Bowman of The Pas, will be able to tell you just what conditions are at this point. I know personally that many visitors, who were there this summer have been very outspoken about the lack of accommodation. I do not wish to bother you about conditions in Northern Saskatchewan, but in view of the report sent to me by our teacher, I thought I should inquire from you as to whether any building programme was contemplated.\n\nI was sorry not to be able to be present when the deputation from our Church met with the Minister and yourself and others some two weeks ago, but it was impossible for me to get away at that time. With kindest personal regards,\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nHenry Saskatchewan\n\nIndian Affairs.

Please let me know if this school was in operation for the four months mentioned and if not, you should advise the number of months it was opened during the summer of 1947.\n\nWith regard to his reference to cost of living bonus, I may say that the bonus previously paid was amalgamated with the salary effective September 1st, 1946.

Halkett, at the Pelican Narrows Summer School.\n\nAs stated in my letter of the 23rd January, file 108, this school opened on the 1st June 1947 and closed 29th August, 1947. Due to the late spring and ice blockage it could not open on the 1st of June. Also due to the cold weather and the delapidated Anglican Church Building where school was being held, the teacher was forced to close the school the end of August.\n\nFrom the above information, it is evident that Mr. Halkett should receive a salary cheque for his teaching duties during June. He received two cheques, believed to be for the months July and August. Please address this cheque and any correspondence to Mr. Halkett, c/o Indian Agent, The Pas, Manitoba, as he is no longer at Pelican Narrows.

One of these is the Pelican Narrows School, where Mr. Halkett taught last year. You will recall that last November you enquired concerning improvements at this seasonal school, and I wish to advise you that the following action has been taken:\n\n(a) Thirty students' desks, one teacher's desk and one teacher's chair have all been ordered and are now on their way in to Chief Simon Linklater at Pelican Narrows by tractor train. These desks cost $560.00 F.O.B. Flin Flon, Manitoba.\n\n(b) In addition, we have authorized Inspector Hamilton to purchase 20 sacks of lime, 7 double sash windows, 6 rolls of heavy kraft building paper and nails, to be sent in to Chief Linklater.\n\n(c) We have authorized Mr. Agent Bowman to expend $30.00 for the necessary labour in making these repairs.\n\n(d) We are ordering a stock of standard school supplies for forwarding to Mr. Bowman, so that these can be sent in when the teacher is ready.\n\nWe would appreciate it, therefore, if you would consider the nomination of a teacher for this school. It is hoped that we can obtain a university student who either has had some experience in teaching or who is now studying Education at university. However, I am aware of your keen interest in the education of these northern Indians and\nrealise that you will have someone in mind to carry out this important work.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

I have also advised him of the ordering of the desks, the materials for repairs, etc.\n\nAs previously stated, we are also forwarding you a stock of standard supplies for this school. I will expect to hear from Bishop Martin in the near future and will advise you then regarding plans for the coming summer. It is presumed that you will make arrangements to have the necessary repairs carried out at the school as outlined in your letter of December 30, 1947.\n\nBernard F.

Halkett as teacher of the Pelican Narrows School during the summer of 1947. It is noted that the teacher states he only received two cheques and in your letter of February 9th, you stated that these cheques received covered the months of July and August.\n\nWe find that a cheque was sent for the month of June. It was cashed at the Hudson Bay Co., and passed through the Bank of Montreal, Winnipeg, Manitoba on July 22nd, 1947. It was endorsed \"A. Halkett\".\n\nIt is, therefore, evident that Mr. Halkett received cheques for the three months which he taught in 1947.\n\nBernard F.

I have today written him an air mail letter asking that he visit you in Prince Albert with regard to our plans for Lac la Ronge. At the present time we have several proposals before us but no decision has as yet been reached.\n\nWith regard to seasonal schools, while we can not pay travelling expenses of students into these places, we can offer seasonal salaries that are high enough to help defray at least part of the travelling expenses. We could offer $150.00 a month for University students at Stanley and Pelican Narrows.\n\nWe have been getting students to go in to Northern Ontario from the University of Toronto and the University of Eastern Ontario.\n\nI am leaving tonight for an inspection trip in Eastern Ontario but will expect to hear further from you with regard to these schools shortly after my return on May 15.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

The present Indian Act states quite clearly (Section 9) that Day Schools can be established on Indian reserves only. I understand that 13 children from this area are now enrolled at the Lac la Ronge Residential School in Prince Albert.\n\nAt Pelican Narrows we of course have been operating a seasonal school. Our records show that in 1947 the attendance was as follows:\n\n| Quarterly Report | Enrolment | Average Attendance |\n|------------------|-----------|--------------------|\n| June 1947        | 26        | 7                  |\n| September 1947   | 27        | 10                 |\n\nWe have not the complete figures for the 1948 summer's attendance as yet. However, I think you will agree with me that the 1947 average attendance was certainly very low, considering the\nnumber of children who were enrolled at this school. At several other points across Canada we have converted seasonal schools into full-time day schools when the Indian pupils attended regularly. At Pelican Narrows the school attendance, particularly in 1947, seems to have been unsatisfactory.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard T. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMarch 21, 1949.\n\nDear Archdeacon Paul:\n\nPelican Narrows Indian Day School.\n\nThis is another school for which we will be requiring a teacher this summer.\n\nYou will recall that Mr. Heathcote taught there last year and I presume he will be interested again this summer.\n\nI would be glad to hear from you as to your plans for this school.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard E.

Martin, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Saskatchewan.\n\nStanley Indian Day School.\nPelican Narrows Indian Day School.\n\nDear Bishop Martin:\n\nI regret the delay in answering your letter of April 4 but I have been in correspondence with our field officials concerning these two schools. If Mr. Heathcote is not prepared to go to Pelican Narrows this year, it is suggested that Mr. Humphreys be sent there. The attendance at Stanley last year was as follows:\n\nJune: School open 17 days - average 17.8\nJuly: School open 6 days - average 6.8\n\nTherefore there is some doubt as to the benefit of this school to the children of that area. It is felt that every effort should be made to have these children sent to the Lac la Ronge Residential School, now situated at Prince Albert.\n\nHowever, I will await a reply from you as to whether Mr. Heathcote is available for Pelican Narrows or as to whether you have been able to obtain another teacher for that school.\n\nWe will carefully watch the attendance of the Indians at these seasonal schools this year. It is unfortunate\nthat we have not sufficient school supervisory personnel to visit these seasonal schools and to examine carefully the results obtained therein. We are doing such a survey in Northern Quebec and Ontario this year, in order to examine carefully the results which are obtained from the operation of these schools.\n\nIt is quite possible that you will have had an opportunity of visiting these seasonal schools in action and will be able to assist us in assessing their value.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard J. Murray,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMay 4, 1949.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostreander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nStanley Indian Day School.\nPelican Narrows Indian Day School.\n\nA letter has been sent to Bishop Martin concerning the operation of both these schools. I have indicated, if Mr. Heathcote is not available for Pelican Narrows this year, that Mr. Impherville be sent there. I agree with the comments made by both Mr. Jones and yourself concerning the dubious value of some of these seasonal schools. Unfortunately, we do not have the supervisory personnel to properly inspect them during the summer time operations. To my knowledge, the Department will this summer carry out the first thorough survey of a group of these schools. This will take place in Northern Ontario and Quebec and we are all anxious to read the results of this educational survey. There will be three School Inspectors on this trip, two from the Department and one from the Province of Quebec.\n\nUnfortunately, the departmental letter of March 21 to Archdeacon Paul indicated that we were prepared to open the Stanley School this summer. It is therefore difficult to reverse our policy within a period of two months. However, I have made it very clear to Bishop Martin that if these schools are operated this summer, we will examine carefully the attendance figures and other reports received in order to assess the results obtained from the expenditure of public funds in their operation.\n\nAs it is very likely that Mr. Jones will be visiting both these schools, if conducted this summer, I have attached an extra copy of this letter for him. I would like to have a report from him if he does visit them this year.\n\nYours,\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMay 11, 1949.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nStanley Indian Day School.\nPelican Narrows Indian Day School.\n\nI wrote to Bishop Martin concerning the closing of both these schools, as I indicated to you in my letter of May 4. I have now received a reply from him reading as follows:\n\n\"Thank you for your letter of May 4th, regarding Stanley Indian Day School and Pelican Narrows Indian Day School.\n\n\"I was greatly disturbed to read your suggestion of not opening the school at Stanley this year and I do hope that this suggestion will not be carried into effect. Stanley is one of the oldest Christianized areas in Northern Saskatchewan and the people there have been very loyal both to their country and to their church; and they are among the clearest and happiest Indians I know. I fully agree that last year's records are most discouraging, but there is, I suggest, a definite reason for this poor showing. Before I left for England last May a Mr. H. Smith was appointed teacher at Stanley. Unfortunately, Mr. Smith suffered a nervous relapse and left Stanley rather hurriedly. Mr. Smith is a veteran of the last war and, I understand, he went through very nerve racking experiences. But I am fully persuaded that with a good teacher there this summer these children will receive some elements of education whereas now many of them are...\"\nreceiving none at all. We have had a day school here for many years even when the Residential School was situated at Lac la Ronge, and as a matter of fact some ten years ago the school was not a seasonal school but was open all the year round. The church has gone to considerable trouble and expense to keep this school open even to the extent of begging the loan of buildings to house the teacher, and I do hope that this school may be kept open.\n\n\"Regarding Pelican Narrows, again our need here is very urgent and I have often wondered why your local officials have not taken steps to meet the situation here. I am still in communication with Mr. Heathcote and I wrote to him a few days ago. He is willing to go to Pelican Narrows if we can arrange some assistance towards his travelling expenses. I hope we may be able to secure the services of this young man because he is definitely interested in the Indians. It seems very difficult to secure help from our Western young men simply because they say they can earn much more money working in other fields.\n\n\"I have visited the North frequently and I have seen both these schools in action and I would say most definitely and emphatically that they are both fulfilling a very important function in the life of these wards of the Canadian Government. I am planning to visit both Stanley and Pelican Narrows at the end of next month and I do hope I shall not be compelled to face the disappointment of these loyal Indians in not having teachers for their children. I do hope I may have another opportunity of discussing this matter with Major MacKay and you because I believe I have facts regarding this situation which would persuade you to see the necessity and importance of doing everything possible to further Day Schools at both Stanley and Pelican Narrows.\"\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM THE RT. REV. HENRY MARTIN, BISHOP OF SASKATCHEWAN, DATED 23-5-49\n\n(Original on file 621-1)\n\n\"This afternoon I received a letter from Mr. Heathcote in which he greatly regrets his inability to come to us this summer for the school at Pelican Narrows. His two reasons are:\n1. Financial. 2. The fact that he is to write a very important examination about the middle of June.\nHis inability to come this year is somewhat relieved by the fact that he has already applied to me to take over this school in 1950. His heart is with these Northern Indians but circumstances for this year prevent him being with them.\n\nP.S. I will continue to seek for a teacher for Pelican Narrows.\"\n\n28-5-49\nCopied: AM\nMay 31, 1949.\n\nThe Rt. Rev. Henry D.

I was very sorry to hear about Mr. Heathcote but note that he will be able to take over the school in 1950.\n\nI also have Mr. Guthand's application for the school at Chitek. We have checked over the previous inspector's reports, and I do think he should be a very satisfactory teacher at this new school. With his background of teaching experience and army experience, he should be able to do a great deal with the Indians at Chitek.\n\nI note that you are still endeavouring to secure a teacher for Pelican Narrows.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

The present Indian Act states quite clearly (Section 9 (a)) that Day Schools can be established on Indian reserves only. I understand that 13 children from this area are now enrolled at the Lac la Ronge Residential School in Prince Albert.\n\nAt Pelican Narrows we of course have been operating a seasonal school. Our records show that in 1947 the attendance was as follows:\n\n| Quarterly Report | Enrollment | Average Attendance |\n|------------------|------------|--------------------|\n| June 1947        | 26         | 7                  |\n| September 1947   | 27         | 10                 |\n\nWe have not the complete figures for the 1946 summer's attendance as yet. However, I think you will agree with me that the 1947 average attendance was certainly very low, considering the number of children who were enrolled at this school. At several other points across Canada we have converted seasonal schools into full-time day schools when the Indian pupils attended regularly.

Lovell,\nIndian Agent.\n\nSL/FH\nMr. Chelan\n\nPelican Narrows School Supplies\n\nOn July 12, the teacher A. Hallett wrote to Bishop Martin to say that supplies had not arrived. The Bishop's letters to The Pas received no answer as the Agent was in hospital and the clerk absent on treaty money trips. The Bishop didn't know the circumstances.

McDonald,\nCity.\n\nDear Mr. McDonald:\n\nAs suggested by you I am submitting herewith a list of the minimum requirements of school equipment and supplies for the Indian children on the Round Plain Reserve.\n\n1. Seats: Our Department requires that only single-adjustable desks and seats be purchased. I would strongly recommend that the Moulthrop or chair desk be purchased. The new Normal School at Saskatoon is equipped throughout with these, carried by the E.N. Moyer Co. They will be found to be most satisfactory in cases where the building is to be used for purposes other than school on occasion. 7 of the small is needed and 7 of the medium size.\n\n2. Blackboard: 120 sq. ft. of Hyloplate blackboard is required. This must be 4 feet wide.\n\n3. Books: Our Department supply free Readers. These will probably be all the texts that the Indian children will require this year.\n\n4. Dictionary, globe, and maps. If the Indian Department will purchase the first two mentioned, the trustees of the adjoining district should supply the maps, which I believe they will do. A suspended globe is the most satisfactory, 12 inches in diameter is the minimum size.\n\n5. I would suggest likewise, that the expense of the teacher's chair and desk and the cupboard be shared by the Indian Department and the local trustees.\n\n6. The Indian children will require 2 washbasins, individual cups and towels, and soap.\n\n7. In the modern school the pupils make considerable use of the blackboard so that a supply of white and colored chalk is needed.\n\n8. I should think that about 8 dozen scribblers and 6 dozen lead pencils would be sufficient for this year.\n\n9. Hand work and seat work material will be required. This will be necessarily forwarded as a supplementary list by the teacher, as the amount and nature of this material can be determined only as the teacher sees the need.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nsigned\u2014 J.T. Tomlinson.\nSt. Paul's Manse,\nPrince Albert, Sask.,\nMay 5, 1922.\n\nRev. J.H. Edmison, D.D.,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Edmison:\n\nI have asked the School Inspector to furnish specifications for desks, blackboards and supplies required for the Indian children at the Round Plain School and he sends me list as per his enclosed letter.\n\nThe Indian Agent, local Presbytery's Committee and trustees of White School district, are conferring next week and I hope the work may proceed speedily.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nSigned\u2014 R.J. McDonald.\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nEnclosed please find a copy of a letter I have received today from Rev. R.J. McDonald, containing copy of a letter from Mr. Tomlinson. This will give you the information you desire re the school supplies required for the Indian children at Round Plain.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/HG\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6292, file 620-5, part 1)\nOTTAWA, May 11th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has received through the Rev. J. H. Eadie, General Secretary, Board of Home Missions of the Presbyterian Church, Toronto, a list of the school equipment and supplies for the use of the Indian children who will attend the combined school which it is proposed to establish on the Round Plain Reserve. This list of equipment was prepared by Mr. J. T. Tomlinson, one of the Provincial Inspectors of Schools for the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nRegarding the desks, the Inspector recommends that the Moulthrop or chair desk be purchased, and requests that 14 of these be supplied for the Indian children, I may say that we have never supplied these desks to any of our Indian schools. They are a very expensive type of desk and are hardly required for Indian children. The type of desk we usually supply is the single school desk, and consider that this type would be more suitable for this school. However, I will be pleased if you will ascertain the type of desk that is to be supplied for the white children, as it will be necessary, in order to have uniformity in the classroom, that we supply the same type of desk. You should also state the number of Indian children who will likely attend, as we are responsible for the supplying of the desks for the Indian children only. You should furnish full shipping directions, also the name of the person and the address to which the desks should be shipped. We will place the order here as soon as full information is received. Kindly reply, giving the information asked for as soon as possible.\n\nThe Inspector has suggested that the cost of a teacher's desk, chair and cupboard be shared between the Department and the local trustees. We will be prepared to pay half the cost of these furnishings upon receipt of certified vouchers from you for the amount of the Department's share. You can ascertain the cost of these supplies from the white trustees and advise the Department.\n\nAs soon as we hear from you, we will place the order for the desks.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJohn Weir, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs.

McDonald, and also a copy of a communication from Mr. J. T. Tomlinson, Inspector of Schools, regarding the desks and other equipment for the Indian children at the combined school on the Round Plain Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we are taking up the matter of this equipment with our local Agent, Mr. John Weir, and we will supply the equipment required for the Indian children who will attend this school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.
