F. Alex. L.A. & Josie Talkin', on the Sixth Branch about two miles from here, was startled by fire. The house, containing a large number of tools, Casaum and Mr.\u82de, took several sweeps of his wet lobes; they lost everything but six wall clocks, estimated at $15 to $30. This clock hit quickly from a defective stove pipe. Mr. Lankamoto was an Englishman who has been living on Mansfield for the past year or so.

With regard to the relative position of individuals with respect to what concerns themselves, there can be little doubt that in estimating the aggregate of our common community, we have no concern in our public capacity, nor may briefly refer to some local matters. The chief excitement of the district has been the visit of M. Reil, but that has died a natural death. On the whole, as we have already said, things might have been much worse, and we must put up with a stout heart and wait for the turn of the tide, remembering that there has been an advance in lots of places besides ours. The ground on which we may stand is the future, and the future with reasonable confidence will witness a long occupancy of attention.\n\nTHURSDAY, JANUARY 2, 1885.\n\nDOMINION REPRESENTATION\n\nWe can do very little in this our first issue for the new year to no better subject than Dominion representation. We are convinced that the bringing of it within proper limits to the people of the Territories, we have over and over again stated to be in our opinion the grievance of grievances\u2014upon the redress of which will follow the gain of every other object, serious or important, we sell alone. We may remind the people of the east, as represented by the Government, that we are in the habit of exercising extreme caution with regard to the expression of public opinion, abstaining from harassing them by any vexatious-ventilation of what may be regarded as sentimental grievances or the encouragement of demoralizing views, which may be viewed as premature, while we have used our influence very distinctly to discourage all attempts made to disturb the feelings of the people by pressuring against having their own wishes ends in view. In consideration of this, we can with confidence require the Government to give unqualified credence to the statement made when we tell them that their most warm supporters, as well as all the best men of other political shades in this district are perfectly in accord with their brethren in other parts of the Territories in the determination that the matters which arise, to enforce this claim at any cost. It is an open secret that circumstances, perhaps in the nature of things unavoidable, have combined to render it impossible for us in the Territories of a subdivision to express discontent, which should it find a vent, will have terribly serious consequences, perhaps more markedly so in this district than in any other. That this slumbering fire has not hitherto burst out into a conflagration is simply due to the fact that the countenance of such men as are most respected by the people has been so persistent in maintaining the status quo, that no attempt has been made to bring matters to a head. The attitude of those calculated to influence the masses has not in any way resulted from apathy regarding the restless striving evils, but from a sympathy with the necessity existing under the circumstances of keeping pace with the requirements of such an enormous and rapid increase of settlement over such vast areas. When therefor, that men who have shown exceptional spirit and energy, so means encouraging circumstances unite with those hitherto held back with difficulty, in a plan scheme more comprehensive than any Government thus far has been able to lay before the nation, the result will be nothing less than a great victory of constitutional right, we do not hesitate to say that a Government rising with the slightest humanity and justice would be unable to resist the wishes of the people, and would be willing to meet their views, and assuredly in any case dare not refuse to do so. The feeling that with the abundance of such men as we possess, and the resources which ought to be gathered by peace, at least at a distance, from us as to know little or nothing of our circumstances and requirements, has been for long particularly galling. To prove at length, that the demand for such as much entitled to a state of representation as exists in other parts of the Dominion would involve a nauseating reiterated of facts and principles preferably patient to the average intelligence of a schoolboy. We ask for nothing more than a clear and distinct statement of showing cause on those who may wish to withhold it, and unless we have been doing the Government more than justice in believing their professions regarding the desirability of legislative action for our benefit, they will gladly adopt the simplest and most satisfactory plan of allowing the people of the east to speak for themselves through their representatives on the floor of the Dominion House of Parliament. Should, as is asserted, the intervention of imperial legislation be required, let what is necessary be done for us at once; for alleged delay from that quarter will not be excepted here in excuse. It is self-evident that no adverse influence can be brought to bear upon the Imperial government from the present territorial government; nor is there any possible motive of their own to induce them to unjust and vexatious-thwarting of the just and lawfully expressed demands of so large and progressive a population as already occupies these Territories. Such action would certainly savour of treachery and of a great deal worse on the part of a Government which, fortunately brought Great Britain into the service of civilization on account of a disastrous defeat, due in extending the franchise to a petition of the population of a country not one foot of which is governed by any form of self-governing constitutional representation. We are convinced that the Government will be compelled to yield special pressure to induce them to perform a simple act of justice and common honesty. We do not mean by this to inflame the bombast, but calmly and deliberately state that as a people we are, should the time come to the worst, ready to sacrifice all we possess, even to our lives, as our forefathers did, in defense of our constitutional rights and liberties.\n\nWith regard to accident to life and property we have been singularly exempt, while the extreme healthiness of our district has given marked prominence to the few removals by death, which we all so much regret. Amongst others, we may mention that during the past year we may recall the passing of Lieut. Gov. Dewdney, Mr. White, comptroller, and Col. Irvine commissioner, both of the N.W.M. Police and the late Captains of Caribou's Company, amongst whom we fondly remember Mr. Maclean. There has of course, owing to what we have alluded to, been a good deal of law business, but yet the assignment of our house alone, while we have occasioned similarly to several of our friends. A serious battle, the chief excitement of the district has been the visit of M. Reil, but that has died a natural death. On the whole, as we have already said, things might have been much worse, and we must put up with a stout heart and wait for the turn of the tide, remembering that there has been an advance in lots of places besides ours. The ground on which we may stand is the future, and the future with reasonable confidence will witness a long occupancy of attention.\n\nPRICES TO SUIT THE TIMES.\n\nJ. M.

We believe there was a good attendance at the previous meeting was not very encouraging. We would again point out that there are several advantages of getting such an opportunity, as may not occur again, although some hands by reason of sickness or otherwise. A very slight movement has already been made for a start toward which in time will become a most valuable and beneficial institution. We therefore respectfully urge us for payment of teacher's salaries, not for a second building. It will be strange if we do not hear of a second rate raising enough to meet the other slight expenses connected with the school, and therefore the loss of one of our best institutions in the higher branches of education without wasting them out of the place. It was intimated at the previous meeting that the Rev. Mr. Smith, with his usual generosity to everything which is a benefit to the place, was willing to contribute $250.00 and in starting the school.\n\nCURLANA.\n\nChristmas Day the last match of the season was played on the Saskatchewan Curling Club grounds.

LOUIS, MISSOURI, U.S.A.\nENTERTAINMENT.\n\nA most successful entertainment was given in the Presbyterian Church on Wednesday evening to the children of the Sabbath School. We do not mention her name, but she appeared in a dress beautifully decorated than on this occasion, it was adorned with fastenings of every kind, the effect being very striking. The children admired with illuminated texts and motions and bright with flags and torches. The interior of the church and the Xmas tree covered all over with an immense collection of bright and valuable gifts, which were hung up with small lamps and Christmas lights. Very great credit is due to all concerned in giving us the entertainment. After an opening prayer and prayer by Spratt was called to the chair, which he occupied with his usual gracefulness and dignity. The children's names were admirably rendered by the choir and also by the children. Then from a reverent silence came the happy strains of the organ. Spratt turned to the children by her fellow worshippers for her faithful and valuable services in connection with the church. We believe the festival was to take the form of a valuable gold necklace; the children were feeling so oppressed. We could not help but see that some of the young bachelors in the congregation were forgetting in the excitement of the gifts, and some amusement was exacted when they gallantly came forward to receive tokens of attention. The children were very charming lady friends; one happy scene was furnished with a handsome puppy who was now given away, we fear too dissimilary to valuable persons. One owner can exhibit his horseback exercise, another can exhibit his horseback exercise, and a third speed his horse in the race. In doing so, he must use a baby bottle to reach the finish line home with affecting solicitude and care, either singly or together, and appropriate gifts were exchanged. The children pleased except one, the jolliest of our bachelors was particularly complimented by Santa Claus, who kindly handed him a gift, and was only confused by the reflection that he had not at any time \"got his own back.\"\n\nMr. T. Swanson arrived back home from the east, where he had been for a short visit, on the evening of New Year's Day.\n\nA party of boys on a ring, with A. R. Brown's name on a club attacked, was hung up by the neck and shaken like water outside of the same.
