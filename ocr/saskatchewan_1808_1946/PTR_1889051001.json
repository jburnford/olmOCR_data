We have now every reason for believing that next year, if not this, will see a great railway into Prince Albert and the work will be commenced at once. While we have no doubt that this road will be built we would advise people to keep cool and not get excited over the prospect of a boom or the chance of their expectations being realized for a short time. The opening up of a railroad will improve the condition of everyone in the district, but we do not think it will cause a great rise in real estate prices nor will it bring a rush of immigration until a large immigration takes place, they will not increase much.\n\nWe wish to call the attention of our local representative organizations, such as the Town Council, Board of Trade and Agricultural Societies to the necessity existing for laying the foundations and rearing the structures of this district before the eyes of Canada and other countries. If the railway comes to Prince Albert we want a large immigration and the only way to get a good class of settlers is to make known the advantages which the district offers as a field of settlement. Hitherto such literature has not been brought in many places, but now it has become a necessity. We think some of the societies should be called to task and employ some good man to set out, outside the world in pamphlet form the vast superiority of Saskatchewan as a home for emigrants from other places. We have in our midst men well qualified for the task and we have no doubt that some of them could be induced to write such a pamphlet if the cost of publication were guaranteed.\n\nOur city fathers are to be congratulated on the establishment of a ferry over the river within the town limits, more especially as it has not cost the town one cent. A more valuable arrangement cannot possibly be made. Messrs. Macdonald & Davis, who own the ferry, are also deserving of the thanks of the town for the enterprise they have shown. They have the exclusive privilege of carrying passengers across the river for three years, and we trust that they will find it a paying investment. The ferry will prove a great boon to our citizens, as there are some beautiful drives north of the town. We hope that a road to the Snake Plain settlement will bring a good deal of trade to the town.\n\nA rumor, which we trust will prove to be true, is that the Hon. Mr. Dewdney will visit Prince Albert towards the end of the present month. The late Mr. White was here in 1886, when the first cabinet minister had been in this district. Mr. White's visit has been most beneficial to us in many ways, and we believe that Mr. Dewdney's object in coming up now is to learn by personal contact with the people whether any grievances exist and to what extent. Mr. Dewdney, since becoming Minister of the Interior, has reformed some of the abuses which existed in the Northwest, and seems determined to administer the affairs of his Department in the way which will be most to our advantage. If he visits this place, as we trust he will, we consider it the duty of our citizens to give him the fitting public reception that his position and merits deserve at their hands.\n\nComplaints are being made by our firemen that the citizens do not take the interest in their organization that they should. We entirely agree with them, and say that the citizens of No. 2 fire company are young men who have nothing or very little to lose by a fire, and as they give their services for nothing and keep up their organization, those citizens who do not belong to the company and who might be losing a lot by the loss of fire could do less than give the boys some encouragement, even to the extent of attending their meetings. That would not be much to do, but it would be appreciated by the firemen that the citizens took an interest in their welfare and appreciated their efforts. These fire companies should be kept in a thorough state of efficiency, for although we have been fairly free from fire accidents by fire in the past, there is no telling how soon some old frame building may take fire, and with a favorable wind at the time, the result might be very disastrous. The Town Council should also secure a lot of land in connection, before the price of land goes up, and build a rough shed in which to store the fire apparatus, so as to protect it against the weather and prevent the property being stolen or lost.\n\nA rumor, which we trust will prove to be true, is that the Hon.
