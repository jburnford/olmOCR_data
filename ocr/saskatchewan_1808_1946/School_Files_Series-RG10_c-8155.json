McNeill, M.D., Indian Agent, Eskasoni, N.S.\n\nEducation.\u2014There is a school-house situated about the centre of this reserve. A new school-house, however, is badly needed, as the present one is old, having been built about thirty-five years ago. It is small, cold and poorly ventilated, and generally most uncomfortable to both teacher and pupils. School has been conducted here during the past term. At present there are eighteen pupils enrolled. As a rule the attendance is poor, the average daily attendance during the past quarter being only six. This can be accounted for in a measure by the fact that the parents do not take the interest in the school that they should. On the whole, good progress has been made during the past year.\nOttawa, April 8th, 1906.\n\n1. Referring. Please file and direct to schools.\n\n2. Schools. Suppose some action has been taken or will be taken about this school house, and so there can be no harm in publishing this in the annual report.\n\nH. C. Ross\nOttawa, May 1, 1908.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nDr. McNeil, Indian Agent at Eskasoni, in his annual report for the year ended March 31, last, under the heading of \"Education\" calls attention to the necessity for a new school-house, the present one being old and unsuitable. It was built about thirty-five years ago.\n\nThey have an enrolment of 18, with an average attendance of about 7. If the Department decides to put up a new school-house, provision would have to be made in the estimates for next year and our Architect would have to prepare plans and specifications, so that an estimate of the cost might be made. The attendance would, no doubt, be improved with a better building and, if a warm mid-day meal could be supplied, it would awaken the interest of the pupils, as the Indians in this locality are poor and their children often kept from school for want of a lunch to take with them.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nMr. Remmey, ye may be\nmade of Shantai Reserve\nwill make for extra\nwas very extensive\nletter on D.C.\nGrand Narrows C.B.\nMay 23rd 1908.\n\nJ.McLean Esq\n\nKindly let me know if any steps are being taken towards the creation of a new school house for the reserve.\n\nSgd A.J.

The following tender was received:\n\nChappell Bros. & Co., Limited, of Sydney, N.S.,\nfor $1975.00\n\nThe tender is submitted herewith, as required by Sub-Section 3 of Section 36 of the Public Works Act; and the undersigned would recommend that the same be accepted by Your Excellency in Council.\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nIndian Agent McNeill reported in March, 1909, that the old school is old, having been built about 35 years ago, that it is small, cold and poorly ventilated & generally most uncomfortable for both teacher & pupils.

It bears Big Bend Centre & Sydney post marks of 8th. It reached Ottawa post office on the 11th (Sunday) and the Dept. on 12th. It appears on referring to the railway time tables that in order to reach Ottawa on the 10th it should have left Sydney on the 7th, or not later than 7.40 A.M., of the 8th. Big Bend Centre is somewhere off the railway line and evidently had to start from Sydney by rail. Chappell Bros' tender was posted at Sydney on the 7th and just reached here on time.\n\nIt is presumed that, although Mr. McLellan thought his tender would reach here on time, and his is the lower tender by nearly $300, it should not, in fairness to the other tenderer who took the precaution of submitting his in time, be considered.\n\nD.I.A. 22 Apr., '09.\nChappell Bros. & Company, Limited.\n\nArchitects, Wood-Workers, Builders\n\nHead Office,\nFactory and Lumber Yard,\nSydney, C.

It is beside the old building, a somewhat low place on the very edge of the road. There is scarcely any cleared land and it all appears too uneven ever to be made into suitable grounds. On the opposite side of the road a few yards further west is a little field which, I think, would be a suitable site.\"\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nPlan and specifications for this building were only sent on the 18th inst., but it may be too late to do anything with reference to changing site.\n\nI note that on March 18, last the late Agent, Mr. Monseil was asked to report fully on the site in all details, and on the 23rd of that month he wrote saying he would do so but I find no further reference to the matter.\n\nA.F.M.\nOttawa, July 30, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nProvision has to be made to supply drinking water at the new Eskasoni Indian school, and the Department would like to have a recommendation from you as to the best means of meeting the need and the probable cost.\n\nKindly give this matter your early attention.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJohn J.

I forgot to tell you that they had given me the keys, and as the weather is getting bad now, it is time to get the building ready for the teacher to move in.\nBut before he can do so, some one must get to move in the desks, stove, etc. Three or four links of stove pipe must be bought before the stove is put up. Again, there must be some grading done around the foundation as the stuff taken out of the excavation for the walls has not been enough to fill around the walls to the right height. Some gravel should be put around the walls and at the doors for the sake of cleanliness, etc.\n\nThen again, there is eight or nine miles of forest back of the school house\u2014the trees coming to within 8 feet of the building, and that forest is full of the tops and limbs, trees cut for...\npit timber, and if a fire should start in the vicinity the new school house would be very apt to burn up, and there is no water within a quarter of a mile around. I would strongly recommend the clearing away of trees, stumps or any other inflammable material within 150 ft of the building and that it be done as soon as possible. I have thought it my duty to bring these matters to your notice, trusting that you will attend to them. If you should deem it proper I would attend to these matters and do it cheaply too.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nIn re:\nR. H. McKinnon\nDr.,\nOct. 1st,\nCastle Bay, N.S.\n\nTo service as Inspector\non work of building school\nhouse on the Indian Reserve,\nEskasoni, $50.00\n\n382297\nEskasoni, N.S., Oct 1st 1909\n\nJ. McLean Esq.,\nSoc'y Dept Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclose return for quarter ended Sept. 30th.\n\nWhen I came here to open the school on the 23rd of last August, I found the schoolroom filled up with material which Messrs Chapell Bros were using in building the new schoolhouse. They begged for the use of the room for another two weeks, and they told me that the Chief had given his consent to this. I told them that I was going to write to the Agent about the matter, and I did so after my returning home. I notified the Agent that I went to Eskasoni to open the school, but was prevented from doing so because the schoolroom was used as a storehouse and cooking-room by the contractors, and I notified him further that I would demand salary for every day I should be idle because on account of being prevented from getting into the schoolroom. I lost ten teaching days, and I now respectfully ask the Department to pay me for the same. I had the consent of the Department to open the school on the day I came here to open it.\nIt is time now that steps be taken to move into the new school house, but before this can be done, the service of some handy person must be secured to move in the furniture, stove, etc., and put them properly into their places. Three or four links of stove pipe must be bought, and when the winter sets in the storm windows shall have to be put up. I would recommend that R. H. McKinnon of Castle Bay be appointed to attend to these matters.\n\nI am sorry to see that no steps are taken to furnish a well. We have no drinking water here except what we get out of an open well near the house of an Indian, and sometimes the notion will strike him to forbid us taking any out it, as he did several times last year when I had to take a flask of water with me every day for six months. His well is the only good water in this vicinity, but it is not safe for us to be drinking it because of the impurities liable to get into it. If the Department would fix up this well and put a pump into it, it would not cost much.\nA new school house is a gem, but its surroundings are far from being attractive. There is no play ground except the public highway, and the forest primed extends to within a few feet from the walls of the school. If this condition be allowed to exist for much time, the building may go up in smoke.\n\nAgain, a janitor should be appointed to kindle the fire, sweep and wash the floor. Mrs. Christopher Morris who lives alongside the school would be a good person to look after this work; but the supplying of the fuel should be left with Joseph Denny the man who has had the job for years back.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nA.J. McKenzie\nOttawa, October 6th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant, and in reply beg to say that Mr. J. J. McKinnon, Indian Agent, Christmas Island, has been instructed to take the necessary action in regard to the matters referred to in your letter above quoted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Secretary.\n\nA. J. McKenzie, Esq.,\nEskasoni, No. 8.\nOttawa, October 6th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is informed that the new school house at Eskasoni is now ready for occupation, but before it can be used certain work will have to be done, such as putting the desks in place, putting up the stove and providing storm windows before the cold weather sets in.\n\nThere is some question about obtaining the water supply and if you can arrange with the Indian who has a well within a convenient distance to allow the school to use the water the Department will put in a pump and platform for him. If not a well will have to be sunk, but before this is done the Department would like to know whether the Indian will accept this offer.\n\nThe Department understands that the school is surrounded by forest. This should be cleared away to a distance of not less than 100 feet all round, and you may obtain an offer from Mr. R. H. McKinnon, who is acting in the capacity of inspector for the building, for carrying out the work as outlined above.\n\nThe teacher has asked for a caretaker. You may find out how much this work can be done for and submit the name of a suitable person.\n\nThe Department would like Indians employed in making the clearance around the school and Mr. McKinnon\n\nJ. J. McKinnon, Esq.,\nChristmas Island, N. S.\nshould make his offer on this basis, and the trees felled should be cut into stove lengths and piled for next season's use. In the mean time you should get an offer for the necessary supply of fuel.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. STEWART\nAsst. Secretary.\nOttawa, October 6th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 1st instant I beg to say the Mr. J. J. McKinnon, Christmas Island, has been written to in regard to the work remaining to be done in connection with the new school at Makasoni, and if you are anxious to do this work you should submit an offer to him for transmission to the Department.

In reference to the tenders for the care-taking I have to ask you whether the sum of $7.50, quoted in Mr. Denny's letter, is meant to be his charge for the lighting of the fires, sweeping and scrubbing during the whole year. If so his would appear to be the more reasonable offer, but the Department cannot accept it until this point is made clear.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. J.

McDonald,\nIndian Agent,\nChristmas Island, C.B.\nSir,\n\nI think it my duty to inform the Department of the necessity existing for a supply of wholesome drinking water for the use of the Indian Day school at Eskasoni, N.S., which may be furnished at a cost of about $40.00 by sinking a metal pipe through which the water could be raised by means of a suction pump. The pipe may be sunk in one of the anterooms of the school house, and thus protected from being utilized, and perhaps damaged, by any one not having a right to use it.\n\nThe installation of this simple water system should be accomplished before the school reopens after vacation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMr. Ogilvie,\n\nI have been informed by Mr. Smith that the cost of the new building will be approximately $15,000. However, I am not sure whether you consider this figure reasonable or not. Whether you consider the cost reasonable should be done and the figures mentioned in the proposal. Whether you consider the cost reasonable should be quoted reasonably.\n\n14/8/16\n\nR.B. Benson\nOttawa, August 15, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 7th instant I beg to say that the Department approves of the water system outlined therein being installed in the Eskasoni school and the cost should not exceed your estimate of $40.00. This work should be done before the school re-opens after the holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nSir,-\n\nThe enclosed Voucher recently to hand is for an expenditure authorized by the Department August 15th. last year on my recommendation.\n\nIt will be seen that my estimate for installing a water system in the Eskasoni school was exceeded by $21.03. The fact is largely due to the sharp advance in price of the various items of manufactured metals used in the work, between the time I made my estimate and the date on which these materials were purchased. Besides, a more expensive pump had to be obtained than the kind I thought would suit the purpose.\n\nThe extra expenditure was made with my knowledge and approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

S.,\nOctober 25th., 1920.\n\nSir,-\n\nI think it my duty to direct the Department's attention to the fact that there is no closet in connection with the Indian day school at Eskason reserve, N. S., which makes the situation very awkward, as may be readily understood. There never was one, so far as I am aware, but its absence did not come under my notice until quite recently.\n\nA properly constructed and suitable building for the purpose - one with two compartments - would cost about sixty five dollars ($65.00), and I recommend that the Department authorize its construction as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 30, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th instant, in which direct the attention of the Department to the fact that there is no closet in connection with the Indian day school at Eskasoni and recommend that a suitable building for the purpose, with separate compartments for the boys and girls, should be erected as soon as possible.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may obtain prices from a number of carpenters or other persons in the neighbourhood competent to do the work, for the erection of a suitable building for the purpose and you may engage the services of the one quoting the lowest price and have this work performed, provided the cost of the same does not exceed the estimate furnished by you of approximately $65.00. In the erection of the building a screen should be provided separating the entrances to the boys' and girls' toilets. The Department will be pleased to hear from you as to whether you have been able to arrange for the erection of these closets and, if so, the cost of the same. The building, while suitable for the purpose, should be erected as cheaply as possible. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to have a suitable building erected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. S. Williams\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. J.

Immediate attention should be paid to this matter. I suggest that a new privy be constructed.\nOttawa,\nDecember 28, 1942.\n\nMemorandum for file:\n\nCorrespondence regarding the proposed classroom building at Eskasoni will be found on file 51-1-5. Particular attention should be given to memorandum to the Director of the Surveys & Engineering Branch dated December 28, 1942.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, August 11, 1943.\n\nMr. J. A. MacLean, Indian Agent, Eskasoni Chapel, N. S.\n\nTenders received by the Surveys and Engineering Branch for the construction of an Indian day school, a teacher's residence, a residence for a principal and an office Building at the Eskasoni Reserve indicate that the cost of these buildings - should we proceed with their construction at this time - would be approximately three times greater than the amount provided for this work in the 1943-44 estimates. In view of this fact, it will not be possible to proceed with our building program on your reserve at any time during the present fiscal year.\n\nWe are naturally anxious to do everything humanly possible to encourage Indian families, particularly families the members of which are not gainfully employed, to establish themselves at Eskasoni. It is just possible that our failure to establish a school this year may retard to some extent the movement of Indian families to the reserve. We are anxious, therefore, that you should undertake a complete survey of the educational facilities available, with the object of utilizing these to the fullest possible advantage.\n\nWould it be possible to make an inexpensive addition to the day school on the reserve, or could the teacher's residence be used as a classroom? It is just possible that there might be accommodation for a few Indian pupils at the Castle Bay Public School. Should such accommodation be available, it might be necessary to provide transportation. In any event, we want you to make a thorough survey of existing educational facilities and report in due course.\n\nWe deeply regret our inability to proceed with the regular program of centralization, particularly the building program. It is our hope that our failure to do so will not add unduly to your burdens as agent. Is it\n\np.t.o.\nyour opinion that a temporary, inexpensive office building should be constructed? If you deem it necessary, we might send Mr. A. J. Doucet down to assist you in the survey. Mr. Doucet, however, has been absent from the office for several weeks, and we are not at all anxious to send him to Eskasoni unless his presence there is absolutely necessary.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nActing Director.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nReference your letter 50-1-5, dated August 11, informing us that construction of the school and office, also staff building would not be carried out this year, has been received.\n\nAs suggested in your letter, we interviewed the school authorities at Castle Bay regarding admitting some of the Indian children but they would not agree to this arrangement. However, we can make temporary arrangement for the school children in the near future.\n\nAn office building will not be required at present as we can manage with conditions as we now have them.\n\nThank you for your offer of Mr. Doucett's assistance but as we are able to avail ourselves of rather limited facilities, we can manage the affair with temporary arrangements for the present.\n\nJ.A. MacLean, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, February 25, 1944.\n\nMemorandum;\n\nDr. McGill\n\nEX'D.\n\nAt Eskasoni Reserve, until our programme for the erection of the Agency buildings can be proceeded with, it would appear that the only forward step we can make to speed up our centralization is to erect an additional room to the present school and thereby enable us to transfer a number of families with children from other reserves.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, July 14, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSURVEYS & ENGINEERING BRANCH.\n\nThe officials of this Branch yesterday discussed with Mr. Buck the building program on the Eskasoni Reserve.\n\nIt is felt that tenders should be obtained for the school and teacher's residence for this reserve. If prices anything like those obtained at Shubenacadie can be secured, there will be plenty of funds available in the current year's appropriation. There is no doubt that the amalgamation of the Indians on this reserve is proceeding satisfactorily, and the new accommodation should be available at the earliest possible date.\n\nWhile no decision has been made regarding the large expenditure that might be necessary to provide an adequate water system, it is believed that both the school and the teacher's residence should be piped and electric wiring installed in the residence, so that whenever water and electricity are available, the necessary connections can be made.\n\nDirector.\nSeptember 9, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: Proposed new buildings, Eskasoni Indian Agency.\n\nYour memoranda of the 6th and 7th instants, with attached tenders for the above from J.

W. Stephens Ltd., shows a price for the school similar to their tender of July, 1943, for the same building. Analyses of items in their tenders for the residences indicates that the tender is based completely on the same unit cost schedule as for their 1943 tender, which was considered excessive.\n\n(c) The tender submitted by the Curry Construction Co. shows no reasonable ratio in costs between the school and residences.\n\n(d) In connection with tenders submitted for the school, it is pointed out that an identical school is now in course of erection at Shubenacadie, N. S., for which a contract was awarded at $17,000.\n\n(e) Plans for the Agent's residence furnished to tenderers were identical with those used for tendering on a similar residence at Lennex Island, P.E.I. In the latter instance the only tender received amounted to $8,700.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys & Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nThe erection of the residences can only be justified by construction of the school, the cost of which is the governing factor. It is the opinion of this Service that the tenders submitted for either a school with teachers' residence only, or for the three building group are far in excess of reasonable costs.\n\nWe therefore do not recommend the acceptance of either tender.\n\nT.S. Miller\nChief Engineer\nSeptember 18th, 1944.\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Proposed buildings, Eskasoni Indian Agency, N.S.\n\nIn reference to our discussion last week on the high amounts that had been tendered by contractors for the above building program, I am forwarding herewith a copy of a memorandum from Mr. Mills, dated September 9th, outlining the situation and in which the recommendation is made that neither of the tenders received be accepted.\n\nOur Architectural Division estimates a fair price for the buildings at this time would range between $30,000 and $35,000. The lowest tender received for the three buildings, namely, day school, teachers' residence, and Agent's residence was $46,564. The other tender received was for $70,350. In each case the tender for the main building; namely, the day school, was out of line, the lowest tender being $34,084 for a building that should be constructed for not more than $17,000 to $19,000. These tenders indicate that building construction conditions are most unfavourable at this time and that there has been no improvement in man power or material shortages.\n\nThe contractor erecting the day school at Shubenacadie, N.S. at his tendered price of $17,000 is making very poor progress and our Engineers are taking steps to try and expedite the work and delivery of materials.\n\nUnder the circumstances I concur in the recommendation of Mr. Mills that the erection of the Eskasoni Indian Agency buildings be deferred until conditions are improved.\n\nDirector.\nSeptember 18th, 1944.\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Proposed buildings, Eskasoni Indian Agency, N.S.\n\nIn reference to our discussion last week on the high amounts that had been tendered by contractors for the above building program, I am forwarding herewith a copy of a memorandum from Mr. Mills, dated September 9th, outlining the situation and in which the recommendation is made that neither of the tenders received be accepted.\n\nOur Architectural Division estimates a fair price for the buildings at this time would range between $30,000 and $35,000.

The Deputy Minister agreed with this suggestion.\n\nI may say that there are over 100 pupils who should be attending school on the Eskimo Reserve. There is accommodation in the present school for 25 pupils only. Our program of centralization is, therefore, at a standstill until school accommodation can be provided, and the present school lacks not only sufficient accommodation but is a very poor building. We are forced, therefore, to keep in operation three day schools at various other locations which could be closed if we had a school on the Eskimo Reserve.\n\nWill you kindly get in touch with the contractors who tendered on the three buildings at the earliest possible date and advise them that we intend to have the buildings constructed but that it is thought advisable to defer the program until May 1st, 1945 approximately, when weather conditions will be more favourable, and ask them whether there would be any reduction in their tenders for construction of the buildings to commence not later than May 1st?\n\nAs the money voted for the construction of these buildings is not likely to be used during the present fiscal year, it is desired to know whether it would be practical and feasible to proceed at once with the water supply systems and power plants for both Eskimo and Sinibosadie Reserves, or with the purchase of materials if the actual work of installation cannot be carried out.\n\nN.W.\n\nDirector.\nMOTHER HOUSE OF THE SISTERS OF ST. MARTHA,\nANTICONISH, NOVA SCOTIA.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1. Hot air furnace to be substituted for hot water. Reasons: Very difficult to get proper temperature - either too hot or too cold. In living quarters a hot air furnace is not healthy as the air is too dry and usually pans of water must be placed in the rooms in order to get the necessary moisture.\n\n2. Entrance for fuel should be placed in rear or side of house instead of front as shown on plan.\n\n3. Small sacristy needed for chapel - just large enough for vestment press and sufficient room for priest to vest. Small space could be taken from verandah - see marked with lead pencil. Small basin in sacristy, without water or taps with pipe line to ground.\n\n4. Cupboard space needed in dining room for dishes and linen.\n\n5. There should be small wash basin and toilet on first floor and also a closet for teachers' cloaks, rubbers, etc. Would it be possible to have vestibule space enlarged and have toilet and basin on left side and small closet for teachers' cloaks, rubbers, etc., on right. This added convenience would save many steps.\n\n6. There should be at least a toilet and basin on third floor and if possible a bath tub. If the staff will increase after a year or two this would be a necessity. Put a third basin in bathroom on second floor.\n\n7. Two more windows in basement in order to give sufficient light. If furnace was put at one side near fuel room much space could be saved which might be used for other purposes.\n\n8. Space around kitchen sink should be closed in for cupboard space and for appearance. Extra table space should be provided as marked in red. Closed cupboards above.\n\n(over)\n9. Do not approve of entrance to oratory from living room. There should be a separate entrance from the hall. Size of oratory should be enlarged to size of living room, which may be reduced by that much.\n\n10. What about a combination gym, assembly room and hall for dramatics and other activities by the children.\n\nAsk for a copy of specifications.\nOttawa, February 13, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSURVEYS and ENGINEERING BRANCH.\n\nRes: Agency Development, Eskasoni, Nova Scotia.\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of February 8, with regard to the request of Father Ross for changes in the proposed new buildings at the Eskasoni Reserve.\n\nAfter carefully considering the contents of your memorandum, it has been decided to request that you arrange for a fireplace in the Principal's residence. It is noted that this will involve an additional cost of approximately $500.00.\n\nWe do not consider it necessary to take any action on the other requests of Father Ross.\n\nActing Director.\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1. People don't enter Church from rear, and children don't come to school from rear of building. Hence change proposed service road.\n\n2. Chemical toilets, outside, not modern as regards school.\n\n3. Warm air is not satisfactory for heating. Atmosphere will be always dry - pan of water difficult to handle. Hot water heating system would be excellent.\n\n4. Climatic conditions in Eastern Canada make a fireplace in living room of Principal's residence almost a necessity for decent living.\n\n5. When three persons are living in house, there will be no spare room for guests. Can two rooms be put on third floor?\nOttawa, February 2, 1945.\n\nRe: Buildings for Agency Development,\nEskasoni Indian Agency, Nova Scotia.\n\nWith further reference to suggestions advanced by Father Ross in connection with the above, and our memorandum of January 25, 1945, additional comment, from an architectural aspect, on the various points raised is supplied for your use as requested, in the order they appear in Lists \"A\" and \"B\".\n\nList A Day School and Principal's Residence.\n\nItem 1. The service road necessary to service the site must be built on a fairly steep hill. It has been planned to follow contours which will allow reasonable gradients with a minimum amount of fill and excavation. The road is to be provided by the Indian Affairs branch and will not be included in the contract. It can best serve the site in the position shown on the block plan.\n\n2. Neither flushing type or chemical toilets have been considered for the school. Outside toilets with receptacles removable for frequent emptying and cleaning, were considered satisfactory, and have been provided for in the specifications. Under efficient operation a disinfectant would be used. The additional cost for acceptable chemical toilets would be in excess of $500, and for flush-type toilets with an additional septic tank approximately $1000.\n\n3. Hot air heating was considered the most satisfactory installation for the school and principal's residence, where plumbers and steamfitters would not be readily available. It would be the less expensive installation and eliminates the possibility of mechanical trouble. Hot air is still an acceptable type of heating for high standard buildings. While hot water permits better distribution of heat, it does not provide additional moisture to the heated rooms, unless air conditioning humidifiers are installed. The change from hot air to hot water installation would add about $1200 to the cost of the School, and approximately $500 to the cost of the Principal's Residence.\n\n4. A fireplace for the Principal's Residence would add approximately $500 to the cost.\n\n5. No additional accommodation can be provided in the Principal's Residence unless it is re-designed. The additional cost would depend on the changes involved, but would not be less than $1000.\n\nList B Teachers' Residence\n\nItem 1. This item is confused in its wording. The intended\nrequest is for the installation of hot water heating in place of hot air. Hot air heating was approved for the building as for all others. To install the hot water would cost an approximate additional amount of $300.\n\nItem 2 to 9. These are items which demand re-study of allotted space if they are considered necessary. Changed positions of doors and windows, additions of small rooms, cupboards, toilet fixtures, etc., with consequent adjustments to heating ducts, cold air returns, water piping, etc., will, of course, increase the size of the building and services. Their effect on the cost cannot be definitely estimated without revised drawings, but at least a $1400 increase would be involved. In Items 3 and 9, references to \"Chapel\" and \"Oratory\" concern the same space.\n\n10. We understand future buildings on the site will include a recreational building, but no provision is being made for such accommodation at this time.\n\nThe rough estimates embodied herein total an additional cost for the project of $3200, or $1800 more than the figure given in our memorandum of January 25 last. The difference is the amount involved if hot water heating were installed in the School, to which possibility our Architect had given no consideration.\n\nThe effect that incorporation of these items would have on working drawings and specifications to be used in obtaining tenders for the work next spring was described in our memorandum of January 25, but it is not proposed to initiate any changes to drawings or specifications unless we are instructed to do so.\n\n(Sgd.) T.S. Mills,\nChief Engineer.\nRe: Agency Development, Eskasoni Agency, Nova Scotia.\n\nSeveral weeks ago at the request of Mr. Phelan, our Architect held a discussion on the proposed new School, Principal's Residence and Teachers' Residence at the above project with Father Ross whom it appears will be the Principal when the school is opened. Father Ross submitted two lists of suggested changes to the plans and specifications for the buildings mentioned, which he had prepared in collaboration with the Mother Superior of the Sisters of St. Martha at Antigonish, duplicate copies of which are attached for your information.\n\nApparently the Church Officers had been furnished by the Indian Affairs Branch with copies of our drawings for examination, following which the attached lists dealing with (\"A\") the School and Principal's Residence and (\"B\") the Teachers' residence were prepared. The points raised were discussed and upon conclusion of the interview Mr. Buck advised Mr. Phelan by telephone that adoption of the suggestions would not only result in considerably increased erection cost but would also involve re-drawing the plans and re-writing the specifications. It was understood that if further action on our part was required it would be requested by the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nWhen discussing other work recently with officers of the Indian Affairs Branch, Mr. Buck enquired regarding the status of the matter and was informed by Mr. Hoey that no decision had been reached. We were requested to furnish a memorandum with comments and accordingly the following is presented for your consideration:\n\n1. After extensive study and discussion regarding the type of construction, amount of accommodation, the extent and character of mechanical services (light, heat, plumbing, water supply and sewage disposal) plans and specifications for the proposed building at Eskasoni were prepared, submitted to the Indian Affairs Branch and approved by both that branch and the Department.\n\n2. Tenders for work at Eskasoni were invited in 1943 and again in 1944 but owing to excessive costs, construction operations were deferred. As you are aware it is our intention to re-advertise this work on or about March 15th, 1945, when it is hoped more satisfactory tenders may be obtained.\n\n3. Since the adoption of the suggested changes would necessitate extensive additional work on the plans and specifications before tenders could be invited, a decision regarding our further action will be required.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys & Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n4. The advantage of providing a fireplace in the living room of the Principal's Residence has been stressed by both Father Ross and Indian Affairs Officers. The necessary changes in the drawings and specifications for that item could be effected without excessive delay but would probably add $500. to the cost of the house.\n\n5. Other suggested changes would increase the cost of the project by an approximate total of $5000.\n\nInstructions on the matter would be appreciated so that if necessary, architectural staff may be assigned to the work.\n\nT.S. Mills,\nChief Engineer.\n\n2 Enclos.\nOttawa, February 8th, 1945.\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nRe: Agency Development, Eskasoni Agency, Nova Scotia\n\nEnclosed for your information are copies of memoranda from the Chief Engineer, Mr. Mills, dated January 25th and February 2nd, which are self-explanatory, together with copies of certain notes \"A\" and \"B\" left by Father Ross.\n\nWith regard to the suggestion that the staff of the school might increase after a year or two and that consequently increased bathroom fixtures should be installed in the teachers' residence, it will be recalled that the school is a four-room school. We have understood that in addition to the principal there would possibly be five teachers employed. The teachers' residence was designed to provide for a maximum of eight or ten persons.\n\nWhile this Branch is always prepared to furnish information regarding the design of various types of buildings and the cost etcetera thereof, it is felt that decisions as to the standard of accommodation that will be provided for various purposes are matters for your Branch and for the Department.\n\nIt will of course be realized that after certain standards have been decided upon and plans and specifications prepared in accordance therewith, there should be as few changes\n\n(over) ...\nas possible afterwards, with a view to reducing both technical and clerical work to a minimum.\n\nSince the plans and specifications already prepared have been approved by Indian Affairs Branch and by the Department changes in them will be made only on your request. If any such changes are to be made, we would ask to be advised of them as soon as possible so that they can be made with a minimum of delay.\n\nJ.M.

S.,\nApril 17, 1945\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSirs:-\n\nNo doubt you have received my telegram of the 16th, informing you of the Sisters' unwillingness to occupy their residence unless the recommendations they made last Fall are carried out.\n\nI can easily understand their action. They are few in number, and generous offers are being made to them from other localities. To my mind their recommendations are reasonable, and should be carried out. These Sisters are persons of experience who know the value of what they want, and every effort should be made to look after their needs. It is impossible to estimate, in terms of dollars and cents, the good work the Sisters will accomplish in Eskasoni.\n\nI have been looking over the plans for the new buildings. I made three recommendations last Fall about the plan of the Principal's residence. I see that these recommendations were not accepted.\n\nThe recommendations are:-\n\n1. That hot water be used in heating the house instead of hot air. There are several reasons why this change should be made.\n\n2. There are only three bedrooms; one for the priest, one for the housekeeper and one for the girl or boy servant. On some occasions it will be necessary for the Bishop of the Diocese to visit here, and on other occasions it will be necessary to have another clergyman to help me, such, for instance, as during the Forty Hours' Devotion, Confirmations, Missions, etc., and there should be at least one other bedroom, as otherwise either the help or the visiting assistant or assistants would have no place to sleep. In any case it is very undesirable to have the help sleeping on the same floor, and it is particularly objectionable in the case of a small house such as this. All that is necessary is to raise the roof three or four feet higher and finish a couple of rooms on the top floor for the help.\n\n3. It is desirable to have a modest fireplace in the living room. Apart from giving a cheerful atmosphere to the room, it will take the place of the fire in the furnace in the early Fall and late Spring. To economize in this way will justify the expense of a fireplace.\n\nI sincerely trust that you will give effect to these recommendations. If you wish to get the Sisters there, it is extremely important that you co-operate with them.\n\nAs for my own quarters, I think my suggestions are very modest and it does seem to me that you will have some difficulty in getting clergymen to stay there unless these recommendations are carried out.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nA. A. Ross.\nOttawa, May 3, 1945.\n\nDear Father Ross:\n\nWith reference to your letter of April 17 and your subsequent visit to Ottawa, the Surveys and Engineering Branch is being instructed to make the following changes:\n\n1. Hot water heating instead of hot air heating in the Principal's residence and in the Sisters' Residence.\n\n2. An addition to the Principal's residence, in order to provide an extra bedroom.\n\nI understand that the Surveys and Engineering Branch intend to install a fireplace in the living room of the Sisters' residence and in the Principal's residence.\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter being forwarded to the Sisters of St. Martha.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend A. A. Ross,\nPrincipal,\nEskasoni Indian Day School,\nEskasoni Chapel, N.S.\nOttawa, May 8, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSURVEYS and ENGINEERING BRANCH.\n\nI desire to refer to your memorandum of February 8 and previous correspondence, regarding the principal's residence and teachers' residence at the Eskasoni Indian Agency. Reverend Father Ross, Principal of this school, visited Ottawa last week and again urged the changes that have previously been brought to your attention.\n\nHis proposals were very carefully considered, and, subsequent to his interview with me, Father Ross and Mr. Phelan discussed the situation with Mr. Jackson. Later, Father Ross and Mr. Phelan also interviewed Mr. Buck.\n\nIt was mutually agreed that the method of heating the Sisters' residence would be changed from hot air heating to hot water heating.\n\nIt was also agreed with Mr. Buck that a small addition would be made at the back of the kitchen of the Principal's residence, in order to provide an extra bedroom. Mr. Buck expressed the opinion that this addition could be made at a reasonable cost, that it would not involve any structural changes to the building and would not necessitate any changes in the plans and specifications. This solution of the question was accepted by Father Ross.\n\nActing Director.\nOttawa, May 3, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER.\n\nRe: Eskasoni Indian Day School.\n\nWith reference to the above, Reverend Father Ross, Principal of the School, was sent to Ottawa last week by His Lordship the Bishop of Antigonish, with a long list of changes that it was felt should be made in the Principal's residence and in the Sisters' residence.\n\nBishop Morrison has been very co-operative with the Department in our program at Eskasoni, and I felt that the changes requested should be very carefully considered.\n\nIn company with Mr. Phelan, I carefully considered the representations made by Father Ross, and it was pointed out to him that if we made all the changes suggested it would involve an extra expenditure of approximately $6,000.00, and besides, would necessitate radical changes in the plans and specifications, which would necessarily delay the erection of the buildings. As a result of our discussion, it was finally agreed with Father Ross that he would be satisfied if the method of heating was changed from hot air to hot water and some provision was made for an extra bedroom in the Principal's residence.\n\nFollowing this interview, I arranged to have Father Ross and Mr. Phelan interview Mr. Jackson and discuss the matter with him. Later, Father Ross and Mr. Phelan spent some time with our Architect, Mr. Buck. For your information, I enclose a copy of a memorandum which I am forwarding today to the Surveys & Engineering Branch.\n\nEncl.\n\nPP\n\nActing Director.\nMay 9th, 1945.\n\nThe Acting Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nRe: Changes to Plans, Principal's Residence and Teachers' Residence, Eskasoni Agency\n\nI have noted from your memorandum of the 3rd instant that the following changes are to be made in the above buildings:\n\nHeating of teachers' residence to be by a hot water system instead of hot air.\n\nAn addition of a room to be made at the back of the kitchen of the Principal's residence so that an extra bedroom will be provided.\n\nIt is unfortunate that these changes are approved just at the time when tenders are being opened for this project since contact with those submitting tenders will be necessary in order to get prices on the alterations. At the same time the addition of a room at the back of the kitchen of the Principal's residence has a prejudicial effect on the general appearance of this building and the addition will be regarded as either an oversight or an afterthought on the part of those concerned with the design and construction of the building.\n\nWhile not stated in your memorandum, it is my understanding, after discussion with Mr. Buck, that hot water heating is also to be substituted for hot air in the Principal's residence. We will act on this basis unless we hear from you to the contrary.\n\nIt is also our understanding that the changes referred to above apply to the buildings at Eskasoni only and not to similar buildings at Shubenacadie.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, May 11, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSURVEYS and ENGINEERING BRANCH.\n\nI have your memorandum of the 8th instant, with reference to changes as to plans in the Principal's and Teachers' Residences at the Eskasoni Agency.\n\nAs stated in the second last paragraph of your memorandum, hot water heating should also be substituted for hot air in the Principal's Residence. It is regretted that this information was not contained in my memorandum of May 3.\n\nActing Director.\nEskasoni Chapel, C.B., N.S.\nMay 25, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to ask for authority for the local purchase of the following articles for the School Principal's residence (Rev.

As the Archbishop is very anxious to get this information immediately, I sent you a telegram on Friday the 15th. To date, no reply has been received. It is difficult to understand this delay in view of the fact that you told me on the telephone that you would let me know as soon as you would check about the matter that afternoon with Mr. Hoey.\n\nThe Archbishop has permitted my being being appointed Principal, and he appointed me Parish Priest, on the understanding that suitable living quarters would be erected by the Department this year. If you are not going to erect a house, it will not be built at the expense of the diocese, and the Indians cannot afford this expense. Then, you will likely have to dispense with my services here, for I will not under any condition spend another winter in the house I was in last year. To this, I may add that, in years to come, you will find it next to impossible to obtain the services of another priest for Eskasoni from the Bishop of Antigonish.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA. A. Ross,\nPrincipal.\n\nEncl.\nOttawa, June 22, 1945.\n\nDear Father Ross:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant and also received your telegram of the 15th instant, in connection with your telephone conversation of June 11.\n\nPlease understand that the decision regarding the erection of the buildings is handled by the highest officials in the Department. The quotation received for the Principal's residence was in the vicinity of $13,000.00, which, in view of our Architect's estimate of approximately $9,000.00, was considered altogether too high. Consequently, the decision was made not to proceed with the erection of the Principal's residence this year.\n\nIt is intended to proceed with the erection of the Agency residence and the warehouse and agent's office, owing to the fact that the tenders obtained for these were reasonably close to our Architect's estimate. Mr. Armstrong, of the Welfare Division, is proceeding to Eskasoni at the end of this week and will have an opportunity of meeting you. He has discussed the situation regarding your residence with both Mr. Hoey and myself and will have one or two proposals to make.\n\nIn addition, arrangements have been completed this afternoon to have our Surveys and Engineering Branch approach the firm who were successful in obtaining the erection of the two agency buildings, with a view to\n\nRev. A. A. Ross,\nPrincipal,\nEskasoni Indian Day School,\nEskasoni Chapel, N.S.\n\n...... ascertaining\nascertaining if they will reduce their quotation for the Principal's residence. If we are successful in this regard and the new tender is considered reasonable, we will proceed with the erection of the residence. However, this is contingent upon the new tender received.\n\nLet me assure you that we are extremely anxious to have the buildings erected, but when the prices are so much above our Architect's estimate, you can easily understand that it is impossible to secure the necessary approval.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, June 23, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSURVEYS and ENGINEERING BRANCH.\n\nRe: Eskasoni Indian Reserve.\n\nI understand that it is intended to award a contract for the erection of the agent's residence and also the building required for a warehouse and agency purposes at this reserve.\n\nAs you know, when we considered the tenders that were obtained for the buildings required for school purposes, it was decided that the prices were too high.\n\nIt has occurred to me that it would be advisable to again approach the firm who were successful in obtaining the erection of the two agency buildings, with a view to ascertaining if they will reduce their quotation for the principal's residence. I understand that Mr. Jackson phoned you to this effect yesterday and I feel certain that you will take immediate action and advise me of the result.\n\nI may add that unless we obtain a suitable residence for the principal at the earliest possible date, there is a very great likelihood that he will find it necessary to give up duties. In the short time that Father Ross has been on the reserve, he has proved very useful and has co-operated very completely with our agent in carrying out the amalgamation plan.\n\nActing Director.\nJune 29th, 1945\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nActing Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nReferring to your memorandum of June 23rd on the building program at Eskasoni, a telegram was sent to Mr. Chappell, Contractor of Sydney, N.S. on June 22nd, asking him if he would construct the Principal's Residence as originally planned at our estimated cost of $10,500, and how much additional he would require for the further work on this building that was decided upon, namely, the addition of a room and the change of the hot-air heating to hot-water heating. Our estimate for all the work, including the changes, is $12,500.\n\nAs Mr. Chappell had returned all plans and specifications it was necessary to supply him with new ones, and these have gone forward by air mail.\n\nDirector.\nJuly 17th, 1945.\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nIn further reference to my memorandum of June 29th regarding a price from M.R. Chappell, contractor, for the erection of the Principal's residence on the basis of the proposed additions and alterations, a tender has now been received from him totalling $12,240 and which includes hot water heating. This tender is considered to be satisfactory under the circumstances and this Branch will prepare a draft Memorandum to Council for the Minister's approval and signature.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, July 19, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER.\n\nRe: Eskasoni Indian Day School.\n\nI desire to refer to my memorandum of May 3, last, with reference to the erection of a residence for the Principal of this school.\n\nI have just received a memorandum from the Director of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, dated July 17, in which he states that Mr. M. R. Chappell, Contractor, has submitted a new tender, which the Surveys and Engineering Branch considers satisfactory under the circumstances. I am further informed that the draft Memorandum to Council for the Minister's approval is being submitted by the Surveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nSince his appointment, Father Ross has given every possible assistance, not only in educational matters, but in the general program of the new reserve. Mr. Armstrong, of the Welfare Division, who recently visited Eskasoni, verbally commented on the assistance that Father Ross is giving.\n\nI therefore trust that the necessary Order-in-Council will be secured as soon as possible, in order that the construction of the building may commence in the near future.\n\nDirector.\nEskasoni Chapel, C.B., N.S. July 17, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't. of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nThis will advise you that the firm of M. R. Chappell of Sydney who secured the contract to build two Agency blggs. have arrived on the reserve today, July 17th, 1945 and commenced to work immediately. It is hoped that a favourable decision will be reached immediately re the construction of the Principal's residence so that the excavating equipment will not away from the reserve.\n\nThis firm have promised to take as many Indian laborers & carpenters as possible which will be a great help to the writer. Their pay for labor starts at forty five cents per hour whereas ours is thirty seven and one half cents per hour. I trust this difference will not cause dissatisfaction among our Indian help.\n\nF. B. McKinnon\n\nF. B. McKinnon, Agt.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWhen Mrs. M. MacLean Northen resigned as teacher of the Eskasoni Indian Day School and returned to her home, she took with her the articles of bedding and household utensils she brought there, leaving the residence, which is occupied by Rev. A.A. Ross, School Principal, without these requirements.\n\nAs such articles will be required in the new home to be built for Father Ross, I recommend that an amount of approximately $65.00 be authorized to supply him with necessary household utensils and that he be allowed to purchase the articles himself as he has arrangements with different merchants whereby he is allowed a discount of from 10 to 20 per cent.\n\nF.B. McKinnon,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 20, 1945.\n\nMr. F. B. McKinnon, Indian Agent,\nEskasoni Chapel, C.B., N.S.\n\nI have your letters of the 17th instant, with reference to the Eskasoni School.\n\nYou may authorize Father Ross to expend an amount of approximately $65.00 in purchasing household utensils for his residence.\n\nWe have just received another tender from Mr. M. R. Chappell for the Principal's residence and I am hopeful that this will be accepted. This statement is made for your personal information as the final decision remains with the Minister's office. As soon as there is anything definite I will let you know.\n\nI was speaking to Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Arneil with regard to the difference in pay allowed labourers by the Chappell Company and the amount allowed in building the Indian houses by this Department. I understand from them that it is not our intention to increase the pay that we are allowing, namely, 37\u00a2 an hour. If any Indians wish to be employed by Mr. Chappell at the increased rate of 45\u00a2 you should permit them to do so.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, August 1st, 1945.\n\nMr. F.B. McKinnon, Indian Agent, Eskasoni Chapel, C.B. N.S.\n\nWith reference to my letter of the 20th ultimo, I am now able to advise you that Mr. M.R. Chappell has been authorized to proceed at once with the erection of the Principal's residence at Eskasoni.\n\nYou may so inform Reverend Father Ross.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAugust 4th, 1945.\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nRe:Erection of Principal's Residence, Eskasoni, N.S.\n\nYou will be interested to know that as authorized by P.C.5274, July 26th, 1945, copy of which was forwarded you, Mr. M.R. Chappell of Sydney, N.S. has been awarded the above contract and has advised by wire, dated August 4th, that he will be commencing construction at once.\n\nDirector.\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on the 20 June 1945.\n\nPrivy Council Canada\n\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 29th May, 1945, from the Minister of Mines and Resources, representing:\n\nThat under Votes 165 and 170 of the 1945-46 estimates of the Department of Mines and Resources, funds have been provided to erect buildings at the Eskasoni Indian Agency, in the Province of Nova Scotia, as follows:\n\n(a) Four-room Indian Day school with outside toilets\n(b) Residence for School Teachers\n(c) Residence for School Principal\n(d) Residence for Indian Agent\n(e) Office-warehouse Building\n\nThat tenders were invited by public advertisement in Nova Scotia newspapers,\n\nThat the names of contractors who tendered, and detailed and total amounts of their tenders are as follows:\n\n| Description                  | Tenderer                        | Total |\n|------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------|\n| Four-room Day School         | J.W.

Chappell of Sydney, Nova Scotia, that it is in accordance with the drawings and specifications prepared by the Department of Mines and Resources and was accompanied by the required security deposit;\n\nThe Honorable\nThe Minister of Mines and Resources\nThat subsequent to the receipt of tenders for the construction of five buildings, it was decided to restrict building operations to two buildings included in the tenders namely;\n\n(a) Residence for Indian Agent\n(b) Office-warehouse Building\n\nThat the approximate total expenditure involved in carrying out work on the two buildings under contract with Mr. Chappell would be as follows:\n\nBuildings at tendered price,..................$16,986.00\nContingencies, extra work and supervision...... 1,700.00\nTotal...........................................$18,686.00\n\nThe Committee, therefore, on the recommendation of the Minister of Mines and Resources, advise that authority be granted to accept the tender of M.R. Chappell, Contractor, of Sydney Nova Scotia, which was the second lowest received, and enter into a contract with him for carrying out the construction of an Indian Agent's Residence and an Office-warehouse building, both at the Eskasoni Indian Agency in the Province of Nova Scotia, in accordance with drawings and specifications prepared by the Department of Mines and Resources, at the Contractor's tendered price of $16,986 entailing with contingencies and supervision a total expenditure of $18,686.\n\n(Sgd.) A.D.P. Heeney,\nClerk of the Privy Council\nHereewith is Mr. Morris' report on the Eskasoni Agency, Oct. 15- Oct. 26.\n\nPRINCIPAL'S HOUSE -\n\nunder construction, and will be completed this fall. The workmanship is good and the material being used appears to be the very best. The building is located on a very prominent rise alongside the Church. In my opinion, had it been lined up with the hill and the main road rather than with the service road it would have made a more attractive appearance.\n\nThe construction of these three buildings is being done by contract by the firm of Chappells Limited, of Sydney. The department's engineer, Mr. Roberts, is supervising the work, and there appears to be the fullest cooperation from the firm.\n\nUnder the supervision of Engineer Roberts a water system is being constructed. The work may be held up because of the delay in obtaining pipes. It is sincerely hoped that the pipes will arrive in time to have the work completed and the water services available for the winter. If the work is not completed stoves will have to be installed in the Principal's house as the water heating unit there cannot be used. The agent's house and office are heated by hot air and can be occupied. Recommend that the office and residence be occupied this winter.\n\nFOUR-ROOM SCHOOL -\n\nExcerpt made and action being taken\n\nThe location of this building should be given further consideration. The site selected, as shown on the plan, does not provide playground space. Further, it is not centrally...\ncentrally located being a mile and one-tenth from the eastern end of the reserve, and three miles and six-tenths from the western end of the reserve.\n\nIn looking at the plan you will note that the only available playground space is an area of about 160 feet from the front of the building to the service road with a drop of 25 feet. This area is not suitable, keeping in mind the necessity of organizing and supervising children's sports and athletics which are necessary to develop healthy children, and to assist in the control of juvenile delinquency. Adequate playground space must be given full consideration. Agent McKinnon, and myself, gave a great deal of thought to the selection of a new site. An area with about eight acres of level ground, well drained, two miles from the eastern boundary and two and seven-tenths miles from the western boundary\u2014approximate location as shown on the attached sketch\u2014would appear to be most suitable. Large playgrounds could easily be prepared at little cost. I also wish to draw attention to the location of the cloak-rooms, as shown in the plan, which seems that the children with their wet, muddy clothing, will have to track completely through each classroom.\n\nNote, it is very important that this four-room school be constructed at the earliest possible date.\n\nSee my recommendation regarding the employment of Mr. Dan Lewis MacDonald, now presently employed as foreman with Chappell's Construction Company, as foreman on the reserve. If his employment is approved then consideration should be given to constructing this school next year on the new site by day labour under his supervision. He is a competent carpenter and an experienced builder. If this suggestion does not meet with the approval of the Engineering Branch then I would recommend that tenders be called for immediately, for the construction of the school so that the successful tenderer might arrange for materials and supplies to be delivered first thing next spring. Construction could then commence as soon as the frost is out of the ground.\n\nPRESENT EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES \u2014 At present the educational facilities consist of one old school building in a poor condition at the east end of the reserve. Thirty-eight children were in attendance\u2014crowded. The children appeared to be in a healthy condition, well dressed, and well fed. Miss Margaret Maclean is the teacher in charge. She is fully qualified but not experienced.\n\nAt the west end of the reserve a one-roomed welfare house was made available. It is not suitable. However, it is absolutely necessary as a number of children have lost three years and had not been to schools since moved to Shubenacadie until this term. There were forty-two children crowded into this small room. There were only the first three grades...\nbeing taught. This is the result of the lack of educational facilities during the past three years. The children appeared to be in good health, well dressed, and well fed. The teacher is Miss Catherine MacNeill. She appeared to be competent and commented on the respect of the children as they were well disciplined.\n\nTEACHER'S RESIDENCE\n\nYou will note that according to the plan the site selected for this building is immediately east of the principal's house. I wish to point out that with the four-room school in operation, there will be at least five Sisters housed in this building, with the possibility of a Nursing Sister also being housed there. The cleared space at this location is very small and, as you know, there should be sufficient land available for a small garden consisting of vegetables, fruits, and flowers, as well as area sufficient to provide outdoor exercise. If my recommendation regarding another site for this school is approved, then consideration should be given to selecting a new location for the teacher's residence in the vicinity of the agency headquarters.\nOttawa, November 22, 1945.\n\nF.

December 19, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't. of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nThe location of proposed day school on Eskasoni reserve.\n\nI have your letter of November 22nd re the above for acknowledgement.\n\nI have looked over the Christmas plot referred to and find that it too has quite an elevation which would require a great amount of levelling and grade work before a playground could be made of it. I feel that the work required would be justified only as a last resort. In that location it would have the advantage of being away from the office and residences, allowing more room for other buildings like a detachment house, teacher's residence, medical residence or nursing station which will, I imagine, have to be reasonably close to the water supply and sewerage facilities. Should the school be located there, there would be ample room for the children to romp around and the grounds could be well supplied with swings, tilts, etc lacking however ball diamond facilities.\n\nWith the exception of this plot no other locale would be suitable. I thought first of the level field across the highway but on investigation I found that occasionally, in spring floods, the water covers enough of this field to make it unsatisfactory.\n\nIf the site we selected was not considered too far a walk for the children at the extreme ends of the reserve what would be wrong with erecting a school there with six classrooms which, I believe, would accommodate all the children we will ever have here. I understand that there will be classrooms in the basement for domestic science and manual training instruction which should give ample room space for almost any eventuality.\n\nWhile on the subject of school I would ask that the plans be amended to include wiring for electricity. The basement rooms would be an ideal meeting place for homemakers club meetings etc and besides there are many days when students need the assistance of artificial lighting at their desks.\n\nI would also ask for the inclusion of an indoor toilet and running water for the teachers, who, I understand, will be members of a religious order. This could be quite easily done by installing a septic tank, digging a small well of domestic size, and using a small electric pressure tank and pump. These outfits are common around here and are quite economical to install and maintain. This would be all the more necessary if the school is located some distance from the immediate vicinity of their residence.\n\nF. B.

McKinnon, Indian Agent for Eskasoni,\nMr. J. E. Morris and Mr. Phelan interviewed Mr. Buck\nthis morning, with reference to the following changes\nwhich we would like to have made, if possible, in the\nplans of the above building:\n\n1. The height of the basement should be increased\nand the posts removed. This would permit our\nusing the basement as a community centre until\nsuch time as we are in a position to erect a\nbuilding for the latter purpose only. This would\nalso involve the provision of another exit, so\nthat it will be easy to leave the building in\ncase of any trouble.\n\n2. The school should be wired for electricity.\n\n3. If at all possible, a toilet should be provided\nin the school for the use of the staff members.\n\n4. Hot water heating should be supplied instead of\nhot air heating in the teacher's residence. The\ncoal used in Nova Scotia is soft and with hot air\nheating the interior of the building would have\nto be redecorated much oftner than if hot water\nis used.\n\nIt is extremely important that both the school\nand the teacher's residence should be ready for occupancy\nby September 1, 1946, if at all possible. The lack of adequate educational facilities is delaying the completion of our program at Eskasoni; consequently it would be appreciated if arrangements could be made to have the construction of the new building commenced as soon as weather conditions permit.\n\nDirector.\nMay 6, 1946.\n\nThe Chief Treasury Officer,\n\nRe: Eskasoni Water Supply and Electric Power.\n\nThe sum of $19,000.00 has been provided in the Indian Education Vote for this year to provide for the completion of the above work.\n\nIn order that the Surveys and Engineering Branch may have on hand funds with which to continue this work, will you kindly arrange to transfer to that branch the sum of $4,000.00.\n\nM.W.\n\nDirector\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRe: Tenders for New Buildings,\nEskasoni Indian Agency, Nova Scotia.\n\nYour memorandum dated June 11th, 1946, with attached tender for the proposed new Day School and Teachers' Residence at the above agency, are acknowledged.\n\nWe note that the only tender received was submitted by Mr. R. Chappell, who forwarded a security deposit cheque in the correct amount, but which was not certified.\n\nWe have analyzed the tender and have compared the costs submitted, with those furnished by the same contractor in the spring of 1945. The comparison is as follows:\n\n| BUILDING               | CONTRACTOR'S 1945 TENDER | CONTRACTOR'S 1946 TENDER | INCREASE |\n|------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|----------|\n| 4 room Day School      | $33,800.00               | $36,750.68              | $2950.68 |\n| Teachers' Residence    | $14,505.00               | $16,757.20              | $2242.20 |\n| Total for Two Buildings| $48,305.00               | $53,507.88              | $5199.88 |\n\nFrom the above it is reasonable to assume that the contractor has based his recent tender on his 1945 quantities, and that he has made additions to his costs to include the changes embodied in the drawings at the request of Indian Affairs.\n\nMaking allowances for the upward trend in prices and the changes insisted upon by Indian Affairs, it is felt that costs for these buildings, with allowances for contingencies and supervision, should not exceed the following:\n\n- Four-room Day School .................. $25,000.00\n- Teachers' Residence .................... $14,000.00\n\nTotal cost ................................ $39,000.00\n\nPlus allowance (10%) for Contingencies and Supervision ........... $4,000.00\n\nTotal cost ................................ $43,000.00\n\nIt is felt that the total of the contractor's tender, namely, $53,000.00, is considerably in excess of the value of the buildings covered by our drawings and specifications.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ.

This 7% covers all Sydney office work and overhead, unforeseen and contingent costs which cannot be definitely figured, such as weather conditions, delays for material, etc. and a small margin of profit.\n\nWould further say that the costs as compiled on these two buildings, are based largely on the experience of last summer construction work there, with the exception that no additional amount has been added for additional costs of material and construction. The reason being that we estimate these added costs can be offset by added facilities on the ground, particularly having electric power there for use in connection with skilsaws and other power tools.\n\nIn reply to section (b) - your query: What fixed fee would be considered on these two buildings: Would say that I feel seven percent would be a fair fee from all angles. This would mean a lump sum fixed fee figure of $3500.00 on these two buildings.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.) M. R.

M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nJuly 2nd, 1946.\n\nRe: Construction of Buildings at Eskasoni Indian Agency\n\nAs referred to in my memorandum to you of the 15th ultimo, the Engineering and Construction Service contacted Mr. M.R. Chappell, Contractor, Sydney, Nova Scotia, in regard to erecting the 4-roomed Day School and Teachers' Residence on a cost plus fixed fee basis. This arrangement would relieve the contractor of any possibility of loss that might result from present shortages in building supplies and labour, and there was a possibility that the work could be done at a lower price than his lump sum tender of $53,000.\n\nAttached herewith is a copy of a memorandum from Mr. Mills, dated June 22nd, with which is forwarded a copy of Mr. Chappell's offer dated June 20th. You will note that his estimated costs are about the same in either case. In the case of the work being done by a lump sum contract, the total cost to the Department would be $53,000. Any extra work that would be found necessary might not exceed $1,000.\n\nUnder a cost plus fixed fee contract we would pay the contractor the actual cost of the work plus a fixed fee of $3,500. If there are no great delays due to lack of labour and building materials, I think that the buildings could be built for less than $50,000, exclusive of the fixed fee. However, under present building conditions,\nand in view of the fact that the contractor could not lose money, we could pay more than the contractor's tender of $53,000.\n\nI have discussed to some extent with our officers, the possibilities of doing the work by day labour, but this was regarded as impracticable due to the following disadvantages:\n\n(a) Difficulty in obtaining a first-class building Superintendent, as such men can get employment in any city.\n\n(b) Difficulty in getting carpenters and assistants at other than very high wages, due to the demand for this class of labour in the Halifax area.\n\n(c) Difficulty of obtaining equipment to make foundation excavations in isolated areas.\n\n(d) Necessity of establishing a camp and headquarters for the men on the project.\n\n(e) Certain delays in obtaining building materials which would run the project into the next fiscal year.\n\nUnder all the circumstances it is the opinion that if these buildings must be erected in 1946-47, the Chappell lump sum tender of $53,000 will have to be accepted.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\nNote: This means no cost \"plus fixed fee\" basis.\nOttawa, July 10, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, SURVEYS & ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nConstruction of Buildings at Eskasoni Indian Agency.\n\nYour letter of July 2 has been received.\n\nAfter a thorough consideration of all the facts as presented, it has been decided to proceed with the erection of the four-room day school and teacher's residence on a cost plus fixed fee basis.

Chappell, Contractor, was advised over a week ago that a recommendation was being made for the award to him of a cost plus fixed fee contract, covering the construction of the four-roomed day school and teacher's residence at Eskasoni. A draft Memorandum to Council has already been forwarded to the Acting Deputy Minister, for the Minister's approval and signature.\n\nOn the 19th instant Mr. Chappell telephoned the Engineering and Construction Service that there was a great shortage of cement, and none was available in the Maritime Provinces. This shortage extends pretty well across Canada. At the same time there is a shortage of asphalt shingles, although this would not interfere with construction operations at this time.\n\nIt is suggested that your Branch make another effort to obtain some form of priority covering cement, of which it is estimated two carloads will be required for the above buildings. In a month or two priorities will also be necessary for plumbing supplies.\n\nCircumstances have required the erection of new buildings at Shubenacadie and Eskasoni at a time when building conditions generally, and shortage of materials, are the worst ever experienced in Canada. It is desirable, therefore, that as much help as possible be given the contractor towards obtaining necessary materials. This Branch will also take whatever action it can in this connection.\n\n(Sgd) Director.\nOttawa, July 31, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nACTING DEPUTY MINISTER.\n\nRe: School Buildings at Eskasoni,\nNova Scotia.\n\nThe attached memorandum from the Director of Surveys and Engineering Branch is self-explanatory.\n\nAs you are well aware, I am most anxious to proceed with the construction of this school.

Henry,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nCharge: Indian Affairs.\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on the 23 July 1946.\n\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report dated 18th July, 1946, from the Minister of Mines and Resources, representing:\n\nThat under Vote 182 of the 1946-47 estimates of the Department of Mines and Resources, funds have been provided to erect two new buildings at the Eskasoni Indian Agency in the province of Nova Scotia, namely:\n\n(a) four-room Indian Day School with outside toilets.\n(b) School Teachers' Residence.\n\nThat lump sum tenders were invited on the basis of drawings and specifications prepared by the Department, through public advertisement in Nova Scotia newspapers;\n\nThat the only tender received was submitted by M.R. Chappell of Sydney, Nova Scotia, whose tender for the two buildings was $53,000.00, which with provision for contingencies and supervision would involve a total expenditure of approximately $58,300.00;\n\nThat while the tender was submitted by a contractor who had previously executed satisfactory construction work for the Department, and who is considered to be in a more favourable position to furnish materials, equipment and labour than other contractors in the province who did not tender, the tender submitted was higher than the Department's estimate, and it was felt that the tender might have anticipated rising costs for materials, labour and equipment to a higher degree than might occur;\n\nThat it was, therefore, decided to request from Mr. Chappell, a revised tender based on payment to the contractor of the actual cost of construction plus a fixed fee, which would permit the department to exercise control over the contractor's quantities and purchasing, reducing vital expenditures to the minimum;\n\nThat Mr. Chappell submitted a revised tender on that basis in which he estimated the cost as follows:\n\nEstimated construction costs for the Indian Day School and Teachers' Residence........................................$50,147.00\nPlus a fixed fee of approximately 1%..................................................3,500.00\n\nTotal..............$53,647.00\n\nThe Honourable\nthe Minister of Mines and Resources\nWith provision for contingencies and supervision, a contract awarded on this basis would involve an estimated total expenditure of approximately $59,000.00; and\n\nThat while the revised estimate shows a slight increase over the lump sum tender, the contractor's bills of quantities, invoices and pay rolls are subject to approval by the Department, by which means the actual cost may be lower than the contractor's estimated cost.\n\nThe Committee, therefore, on the recommendation of the Minister of Mines and Resources, advise that authority be granted to enter into a cost plus fixed fee contract with Mr. Chappell of Sydney, N.S., for the erection of the said four-room Indian Bay School and the said Peabody Residence at the Nakasen Indian Agency in the Province of Nova Scotia, in accordance with drawings and specifications prepared by the Department of Mines and Resources at an estimated cost of Fifty-three Thousand Six Hundred and Forty-seven Dollars ($53,647.00), including the Contractor's fixed fee of Three Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($3,500) and entailing with provisions for contingencies and supervision an estimated total expenditure of Fifty-nine Thousand Dollars ($59,000), the said expenditure to be met from the appropriate Votes of the Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nA.M. Hill\nAsst. Clerk of the Privy Council.\nThe Department of Mines & Resources,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttention: Mr. T. S. Mills, Chief Engineer.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. Roberts has been checking with me regarding material supplies for the School and Teachers' Residence, Eskasoni, N.S.\n\nRegarding the cement situation, I was able to borrow from a party in Sydney, 350 bags which I sent out and was sufficient to install the footings for both buildings. And I am expecting to receive a carload delivered to Eskasoni for the walls, and this car should arrive before the end of the month.\n\nRegarding wall and roof shingles: First, would say the Canadian Johns-Manville have informed me they expect to have a car of wall shingles come to the Sydney area sometime in September, out of which car they plan to supply me with sufficient for the walls of these two buildings. In connection with the roof, I was under the impression, in fact had been informed that Schurman and Company in Summerside, Prince Edward Island, had red shingles sufficient to do the roofs. I happened to have in stock sufficient to do the school. Upon receipt of further information from Schurman and Company, they have green only, and in accordance with your communication in this regard, I have ordered these and expect them in shortly.\n\nRegarding Rockwool: I have been promised a shipment of car leaving the plant August 16th, of the granulated wool which is to take the place of the batt.\n\nRegarding Gyproc: I have been able to secure small quantities from different sources and I expect to have sufficient to do the job at time the work is ready for installation of this material.\n\nRegarding Structural Steel: This is being fabricated and delivery is expected next week.\n\nRegarding Lath: - for Teachers' Residence. This material is expected to arrive sometime during the month of September.\n\nRegarding Hardware: This item has been promised for delivery during September.\n\nRe: Plumbing, Heating and Electrical, my sub-contractors inform me that they anticipate no tie-up, although it may be difficult to get some of the finish items.\n\nRegarding Hardwood Flooring: This item is one item which I have been unable to secure or even receive a promise of delivery. If there is anything your Department can possibly do regarding this item, it would be of great assistance as I am unable to secure this material from any source known.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) M. R.

This would prevent rainwater infiltration and eliminate snow and ice congestion on the steps. Such enclosure should be lighted in accordance with window styling prevailing in main building.\n\nI have taken this matter up with your General Superintendent and in confirmation I would ask you to design such an enclosure and submit a sketch plan to the Departmental Engineer, S.O.

January 11, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't. of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI have to apologise for the delay in acknowledging your letter of December 11, 1946 re the installation of an electric bell and drinking fountain for the new day school at Eskasoni.\n\nPlease be advised that the quotations were received from M. R. Chappell, the contractor who is erecting all the buildings here. The apparently excessive cost of the drinking fountain is due to the fact that the matter was not given consideration earlier when the work could have been done with less work and expense involved. The existing waste lines must be cut and the waste pipe from the fountain tied into it. In this case a small square of concrete must be broken open. The fountain is of the wall hanging type with a spring handle. The water supply must also be cut into and a lead taken from it to the fountain. This also takes a certain amount of floor and plaster cutting.\n\nThe electric bell quoted on is the standard type used on schools. It is placed on the outside of the building with a push button located usually in the principal's room. It is loud enough to be heard for two hundred yards or more.\n\nIn view of the fact that we have a school enrollment of about one hundred pupils now I would recommend the acceptance of these quotations, especially so on the water fountain. The cost would have been considerably less had the matter been taken up earlier but I presumed that with water supply brought to the building provision would have been made to give the children access to it.\n\nF.

There is also some work to be done on the road which could not be undertaken until the construction of the buildings was finished which means ditching, grading, etc.\n\nYou will recall that I criticized the location of the school as there was no provision for a playground. During my several inspection trips to Eskasoni I have been giving considerable thought to the playground problem and would recommend that the area at the foot of the hill, immediately behind the school, be filled in and levelled off. This area is sufficiently large to provide space for swings, teeter-totters, volley ball courts, as well as making it possible to provide two outdoor basketball courts. There is a small ditch down through the center of this area which drains from a spring. About 200 feet of ten-inch cement tile will have to be purchased through which this water will be drained. This area could be conveniently and economically filled during the time the work is being done to level off the area around the buildings as well as the ditching as there will be a large quantity of fill available. As the cost of this project should be borne by both the schools and administration votes I would suggest that schools provide $500.00 and $750.00 be provided from Administration vote. I have discussed this work with Miss M. Walton and Mr. P. Phelan and they have both indicated that the money would be available.\n\nIt is not intended, at the present, to undertake a costly landscaping project. I have discussed this work with Mr. McKinnon and after the grounds are levelled off it is suggested that the\narea in front of the building be harrowed and disked and then grass seed be broadcast over the area. In this way a very nice lawn could be started at little cost. A few trees can be placed along the road and then a small sum be allotted each year to put in shrubs and perennials. This can be best developed when the Agency buildings are fully staffed and occupied.\n\nThis work, as set out above has been discussed with Mr. McKinnon and, if money is made available and he is advised, he will undertake to do the work after the frost is out of the ground.\n\nJ.E. Morris,\nActing Inspector,\nQuebec and the Maritimes.\nSchool Bus Requirements\n\nThere are two schools for which we will require busses to provide transportation for Indian children for September 1, 1947. These two schools are:\n\n1. Eskasoni Day School\n2. Mount Elgin Day School.\n\n1. Eskasoni Day School\n\nThis is a four-room school now being completed on the Eskasoni Reserve, Cape Breton, N.S. The Indians from the scattered reserves throughout this province are being concentrated on this big reservation where adequate medical care, educational facilities and other social services can be made available.\n\nIn line with consolidated school policies of provincial departments of education, a four-room school was erected rather than having four small one-room school houses scattered over the reserve. In this way we will also be able to offer vocational training for both boys and girls\u2014a thing that is impossible in a one-room school.\n\nA 30 passenger bus will be required to transport these children living at a distance greater than 3 miles from the\nschool. It is estimated there will be some forty odd children so located and that two trips will be necessary.\n\n2. Mt. Elgin Day School\n\nHere we converted an old residential school into a day school. Actually this is a high school, drawing the older pupils from the smaller schools on the reserve. In November, 1946, a Ford 1\u00bd ton ex-Army Ambulance was purchased as a school bus. This bus has been over-crowded all winter and we have been highly gratified at the pupils' response to the higher education that we are offering.\n\nActually it has proven very much cheaper to run this as a day school rather than a residential school. However, there will be some 65 pupils in attendance at this school in September and further transportation will have to be provided. At the present time the former ambulance is making 2 trips each morning and each afternoon. The school is being conducted from 8:30 until 5:00 in order to accommodate those children who arrive early and those who arrive later.\n\nThis reserve is a very large one and the school is in the centre. With the larger number of students who will pass their entrance in June it will be absolutely essential to provide another bus for them. The former ambulance can then do the loop to the east of the school and the new bus can do the loop to the west of the school.\n\nIn both instances, War Assets Corporation have been written concerning the provision of these busses and they have reported no results in their endeavours to locate suitable vehicles. These letters are attached.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, June 3rd, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, SURVEYS & ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nRe: Teacher's Residence, Eskasoni Indian Reserve\n\nMr. Emmett Morris, Acting Inspector of Indian Agencies, recommends that the plan used for the covering over the front door of the teacher's residence at Shubenacadie be forwarded to Mr. F.B.

The outdoor toilets which are now in the middle of the playgrounds, should be moved to a new site. A drain should be dug between the mountain and the playgrounds, which would carry away the surface water which gravitates after every rainstorm. Mr. Morris will supply details of local topography.\n\nTo do this work I would estimate that an additional $800. should be procured from some source, chiefly, I believe, from the Training Division.\nOttawa, July 26th, 1947.\n\nMr. F.B. McKinnon, Indian Agent,\nEskasoni, N.S.\n\nWith reference to that section of your letter of the 11th instant in which you request an additional $800. for fixing the grounds at the Eskasoni School, we are forwarding cheque for this amount.\n\nThis will make a total payment of $1,300. and our funds will not permit any further expenditure for this particular purpose during the current fiscal year.\n\nI trust that the amount mentioned will complete the work which is required.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/EGD\nApril 17, 1947\n\nF. B. McKinnon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEskasoni Chapel, N. S.\n\nI have your letter of April 12th in which you inquire as to the amount of money provided for work on the Eskasoni Reserve.\n\nIn reply I would say that the sum of $2,000.00 is provided in the road appropriation. No special amount has been provided for the road through the Reserve as it was thought that $2,000.00 would be sufficient to take care of all road work, that is, the road around the agency buildings and the road through the Reserve.\n\nMr. Morris, Acting Inspector, has just brought to my attention that there is a lot of work to be done in the vicinity of the agency buildings and that there is some work to be done on the road which could not be undertaken until the buildings were completed. He has also pointed out the need of a playground immediately behind the school and wishes to have this portion of the property filled in and levelled off. There will be a quantity of fill available when the Agency grounds are levelled off and the ditching undertaken.\n\nFor your information, I enclose herewith a copy of Mr. Morris' memorandum. It will be noted that he suggests that $1,250.00 be provided for the work outlined in this memorandum. Seven hundred and fifty dollars of this amount will have to be provided from the sum of $2,000.00 voted for the road work, and it is the intention that the Education Vote provide $500.00 as their contribution towards providing the playground. This will leave $1,250.00 for\nother road work and this $1,250.00 can be applied to improve the road through the Reserve.\n\nI am today encumbering the $2,000.00 provided in the road appropriation and advancing this sum to you. It would probably be advisable for you to do the work outlined by Mr. Morris before spending any of the money on the road through the Reserve. However, we will leave this angle of it to your own good judgement as you may want to advise the Department of Highways how much money this Department intends to spend. I have in mind that the levelling of the grounds and the grading and ditching of the road around the agency buildings will exceed $750.00 in which case you will not have to spend $1,250.00 left over to spend on the Reserve road.\n\nWith reference to the amount of $500.00 to be provided by the Education Vote when you wish to have this money will you please make application for it. This letter deals only with the money provided in the road appropriation.\n\nMr. Morris has recommended the installation of about 200 feet of ten-inch cement tile. You may arrange to purchase these cement tile immediately and to place them in the ditch before any fill or levelling is done. In forwarding accounts for these tile, please indicate on the voucher that they are to be paid from the Indian Education Vote.\n\nSgd: R. A. Hoey,\nDirector.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter File No. 50-1-5 (WT1) of July 18, referring to my voucher No.761 covering the cost of tile pipe purchased for use at the Eskasoni school, in connection with playgrounds, and asking for a copy of your letter of April 17, 1947, which I quoted as my authority.\n\nThe requested copy is herewith attached.\n\nF.

How many buses does the Department expect to purchase for the purpose of transporting Indian children to and from school?\n\nA. This will depend upon the recommendations of the Parliamentary Committee into the Indian Act. At the present time indications are that they will favour the operation of day schools over residential schools. If this is the case then it will become the gradual policy of the Department to reduce the number of residential schools and to operate day schools in their places. These consolidated day schools will require buses to carry the children daily to school.\n\n(2) Q. Where will they be located?\n\nA. At the present time there are only four centres at which we feel these will be required. These are, Caradoc, Ontario, Eskasoni, Nova Scotia, Wikwemikong, Ontario and Six Nations, Ontario. At the first two places buses are definitely required at the present time. It is not anticipated that our building plans will have proceeded\nfar enough at the other two Reserves to necessitate the purchase of buses until next year.\n\n(3) Q. Approximately how many children will be carried at each centre?\n\nA. At Caradoc there are fifty children and at Eskasoni there are seventy children. At Six Nations and at Wikwemikong, the progress made in our building plans will decide the number who will have to be transported.\n\n(4) Q. How many round trips per day per vehicle?\n\nA. At Caradoc there will be two round trips per day as long as the old bus continues to function. In bad weather when we are unable to use the old bus, the new bus will have to do four round trips per day (See attached map).\n\nAt Eskasoni there will be two round trips per day.\n\n(5) Q. What is the minimum and maximum distances from homes to schools at each centre?\n\nA. Our policy in this regard is to follow the regulations usually followed by Provincial Departments of Education. This is to the effect that children under ten years of age can be expected to walk up to two miles to school and that children over ten years of age can be expected to walk up to three miles.\n\nThe maps attached hereto will show clearly the long distances involved in these two places.\n\n(6) Q. How do the children get to school presently at each centre?\n\nA. At Caradoc the residential school was closed on the understanding that a day school would be opened and that transportation for these children would be provided as prescribed in the Indian Act. We are unable to get tenders for the provision of a new bus, therefore, we obtained a former army ambulance. We are using this to do one circuit on the Caradoc Reserve and are using an open farm truck on the smaller circuit.\nIt is our intention to use the new bus on the larger circuit and to use the ambulance bus on the smaller circuit. At the present time we are running grave risks and are endangering the health and safety of these children by transporting them in an open farm truck.\n\nThe school block at the former residential school is one hundred years old and has been condemned but we have a new four room school now being rushed to completion. The school population on this Reserve has grown to such an extent that at the present time we are conducting classes in a church basement and in an agricultural hall as well as in the other school buildings previously provided. We can, undoubtedly, fill this new bus to capacity and within a short time have many standees. This new school will also operate as a consolidated high school.\n\nAt Eskasoni, the Indian Affairs Branch has been carrying out a large consolidation scheme by moving Indians from isolated Reserves of Nova Scotia to a centralized Reserve ideally located at Eskasoni. We have just completed a four room day school and have hired a staff of fully qualified teachers. The enrolment at this school is, at the present time one hundred and twenty and of these some sixty require transportation, (See attached map). We are using our farm truck to transport daily these sixty children back and forth to the school. This truck is an open panel model and we have stationed our Indian policemen on it daily to protect those carried. Here again, we are seriously endangering the health and safety of these children, until we provide them with a closed in vehicle as required by the school laws of every one of the nine provinces.\n\n(7) Q. Under what authority is transportation by Government vehicles provided?\n\nA. Section 9 (3) of the Indian Act reads as follows:\n\"The Superintendent General (Minister) may provide for the transporting of Indian children to and from a boarding or industrial school to which they are assigned.\n\nCould we please have returned the Caradoc map attached hereto, as this is an official document required by the Indian Agent concerned.\n\nEncl: BFN/HM.\n\nDirector.\nMOA59 39 NL=SUMMERSIVE PEI 2\nCOL B NEARY, INDIAN AFFAIRS=\n727 BOOTH BLDG OTTAWA=\nSEND ONE BLUEPRINT OF THE ELECTRIC WIRING AND ONE BLUEPRINT\nOF THE HOT WATER HEATING USED AT ESKASONI FOUR ROOM SCHOOL\nTO LEO DALY CHARLOTTETOWN WITH THIS INFORMATION HE CAN\nOBTAIN QUOTATIONS FOR THE TWO ROOM SCHOOL UNDER CONSTRUCTION=\nJ E MORRIS,\nESKASONI.\nMay 3, 1948.\n\nMr. L.J.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nMemorandum\n\nSUPERINTENDENT OF INDIAN EDUCATION\n\nRe: Eskasoni Indian Day School\n\nThe enrolment at this school has increased more rapidly than was expected. There is an actual enrolment of 154 pupils. This would occupy 40 seats in each room. An increase of 25 pupils is expected next year while only 11 are expected to leave. The Department will have to plan on some construction in order to alleviate the situation. Some attention will have to be devoted to the older boys.\n\nBesides crowding there arises the question of proper sanitation. Should the housing expansion continue there will be another influx of families which will make the situation quite critical. A definite statement of policy would be in order so that the Educational Division may plan for future education.\n\nTransportation has been provided although very few pupils exceed the three mile limit. The reserve in itself in only approximately four and a half miles across. 104 pupils take advantage of this transportation. This requires two trips morning and night. A number of those that are being transported are close enough to the school to walk, but as the bus is not sufficient to accommodate all in one trip this leaves sufficient space to accommodate those that could walk.\n\nThe pupils are transported at the noon hour in order that they may take advantage of having their lunch at home. This seems to be justified by the fact that no space for lunch in the school is available. To accommodate this number it would be necessary to use three of the classrooms and require three supervisors. The inconvenience that this would cause would be very difficult on the teachers. This extra transportation means approximately 15 miles a day and would entail an expenditure of less than $20.00 a month. The advantages for the teachers and the advantages for the pupils justify this further expenditure.\n\nThe basement of the school has been divided on the Domestic Science side into two apartments, and on the Manual Training side into three. In the Domestic Science room a stage has been built which occupies a depth of 15 feet and is the whole width of the room. I do not think that the advantages of this division justifies the curtailment of the space that could be used for Domestic Science. I therefore recommend that this partition be removed and that a good Domestic Science unit be provided. The provision of a Domestic Science unit will necessitate the construction of a storage space for the kitchen work. The unit should also have storage space for sewing material.\n\nThere are 59 girls following the Domestic Science course. At the time of my inspection there was a display of sewing which was being appraised by the Department of Education of N.S. The ladies who were carrying on this work expressed their satisfaction at the splendid work that was displayed.\nThe Domestic Science teacher is leaving us at the end of June, but before leaving she has agreed to submit a requisition and also suggestions for the improvement of this Department.\n\nThe Manual Training shop section of the school is divided into a handicraft room, a manual training department, and a music room. Very little manual training is being taught. Some leather work is being carried on in the handicrafts but in a very limited quantity and of a rather poor quality. The arts taught in this apartment is worth while.\n\nThe work for the boys need to be thoroughly re-organized. This brings to the fore the question of a manual training instructor. There are but 7 boys in the senior room which comprises grades 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. This number would not justify the employment of a manual training instructor. If a part-time man could be obtained it would answer the needs for some time. I understand the agency is endeavouring to obtain an employee to take charge of the woodwork shop that is being organized for adults. Should they succeed in obtaining the right type, the Educational Division might arrange to use the services of this man for part-time instruction in the school.\n\nThe teachers show a great deal of enthusiasm in their work which is a very good indication.\n\nThe school has adopted the school hours as suggested in an official letter of some time ago and this seems to work satisfactorily. They have not, however, discontinued transportation at the noon hour as they were waiting for this official visit. I let them understand that they will be notified of any changes officially from this office. There is no point in making any change this year but I suggest that early instructions be sent for next year's operation.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nA. J.

Maclean\nOttawa, December 1, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo in reference to the erection of residences for the teachers of the Indian schools at Eskasoni and Middle River.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department did not erect a separate building at Malagawatch, but simply made an addition to the school-house, and inquiries are being made as to the advisability of providing similar accommodation at Eskasoni and Middle River.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

On a reserve where there is a probability that the services of a married man will generally be available and it is not possible to rent a suitable house the Department would be disposed to consider the question of making this provision. I would ask you to deal with the matter at each of the schools in a separate letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.B.\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd Inst., No. 175397, I beg to say that the proposal to provide teachers' residences in connection with the schools at Middle River and Eskasoni has my unqualified approval. In fact, it was my intention to make such a proposition to the Department myself in the near future, not thinking that anyone else had the same thing in mind; but by reason of the necessities of the situation would be a little more comprehensive, and, therefore, I should include Bear River in the proposal.\n\nI think that the primary object in providing these residences should not be altogether for the convenience of teachers, but rather as part of the educational establishment. My idea would be to have at least 2 acres of ground attached to each residence to be operated by the teacher as a miniature model farm, and, therefore, to serve as an object lesson and educating agency for the Indians who, experience teaches me, know little or nothing about the intelligent cultivation of the land; and until taught correct methods of agriculture by practical illustration, and by actual operations in which they may participate, they will hardly ever become successful farmers.\n\nI beg to remark also that I do not approve of having the teachers' residences attached to the school house as an addition. I think the buildings should be altogether separate and apart from each other.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. H.

At each of two of these schools as you are aware the teacher is a married woman, Mrs. McNeil at Middle River and Mrs. Howe at Bear River. It is a question whether a married woman would be able to carry out the programme which is suggested in your letter, but it may be, if suitable accommodation were provided, the services of married male teachers would be available. The Department would like to have your views as to the probability of securing the services of such teachers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. J.

He has a wife and two children, who, as a matter of course, usually accompany him wherever he is occupied. He states that he cannot find a place within five miles of the Reserve in which to lodge his family, and thinks Eskasoni one of the places that should be provided with a teacher's residence. I must say that I think so too, and, if my memory serves me well, I have already expressed myself to you in favour of such a proposition.\n\nI beg to submit this matter now to the Department for consideration and shall await the result with interest.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.

Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nI beg to bring to your notice the need of a Teacher's Residence at the Eskasoni Reserve. The nearest place that is available at present for the teacher to secure accommodation is 4 miles distant from the School. The present teacher Mr. James MacNeil being a married man with a family finds it very inconvenient. And I also find it difficult to secure a suitable man to teach there under the present living conditions. As you can fully understand the white man is loath to take up his residence during a school term with an Indian family. So that the situation now is that he desires to have a teacher at Eskasoni. We must have some place for him to reside. I understand that there are funds provided in the estimates for such work as this and even if there were not I feel that the Department would be fully justified in going to work and building a Teacher's Residence there as the life of the School School depends upon it. To a very great extent you will readily see the work which can be done. As such I may be able to give a definite answer to your request.\n\nL.M. MacNeil\n\nRev. H.R. McDonald\nIndian Agent.\nMr. Pedley,\n\nIt has been reported to the Department that Mr. James McNeil, teacher of the Eskasoni School, N.S., cannot find a place to reside within five miles of the reserve. Mr. McNeil is a married man with a wife and two children and his services as teacher of this school are satisfactory. Both the Agent and Inspector recommend the erection of a residence for Mr. McNeil. Funds can be spared from the General School Vote for this year and a building after the plan of the one at Middle River would be satisfactory. This would cost about $1400.00. If you approve the necessary action will be taken.\n\n[Signature]\n\nArthur Benson\nOttawa, July 6, 1912.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nIn view of your approval of the suggestion to erect a teacher's residence at Eskasoni we will now call for tenders and I have to ask you to please indicate the papers in which the advertisement should appear.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Borden\nROYAL ARMS\n\nTENDERS.\n\nSealed tenders addressed to the undersigned and marked on the envelope \"Tender for teacher's residence, Eskasoni,\" will be received up to noon of August 13, 1912, for the erection of a teacher's residence on the Eskasoni Indian Reserve, C.B.\n\nPlans and specifications may be seen at the offices of the Indian Agents at Sydney, Baddeck and Christmas Island, the Post Office, Inverness, or may be had upon application to the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nEach tender must be accompanied by an accepted cheque on a chartered bank for ten per cent of the amount of the tender, made payable to the order of the undersigned, which will be forfeited if the person or persons tendering decline to enter into a contract when called upon to do so, or fail to complete the work contracted for.

Two came to hand, one from Mr. S. H. Stevenson, Sydney, for $1865.00 and one from Mr. A. L. Mury, of West Arichat, for $1716.00.\n\nThis building is similar to the one erected recently at Middle River in which the contract price was $1450.00. Mr. Gheme's estimate for the erection of this building was $2200.00. You will thus see that Mr. Mury's tender, while higher than that received for the building at Middle River, is still well within the estimate and I think it is reasonable when it is taken into consideration that Eskasoni is not nearly so conveniently situated for the transport of material, etc., as Middle River.\n\nThe cheque which accompanied Mr. Stevenson's tender is not a certified cheque and he states that he was unable owing to lack of time to obtain such. Mr. Mury does\ndoes not forward a cheque, but states that if his tender is accepted he will immediately forward one for 10% of the amount of his tender.\n\nIn view of the fact that this building should be erected this year I would recommend the acceptance of Mr. Mury's tender provided that his security cheque is forwarded at once.\n\n[Signature]\nNIGHT LETTER\n\nThe Great North Western Telegraph Company of Canada.\n\nExclusive connection with the WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH CO.\n\nH.

Sir,\n\nReferring to the plans and specifications for the teacher's residence on the Eskasoni Reserve I beg to say that the Department desires to provide an extra chimney on the lean-to kitchen. The brick work is to be carried three feet above the roof and there should be a galvanized iron pipe of sufficient height to insure a proper draft. The chimney flue should be eight inches square inside and the chimney should rest on a two inch plank frame about seven feet high well fixed in position and located as you and the contractor think best. This frame should be constructed so that it may be used as a cupboard and should be fitted with a door and shelves. Please obtain an estimate of the cost of this work from the contractor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Stewart\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nRev. A. H.

When completed you will have very comfortable quarters and in the meantime the Department would be willing to make you an allowance, if you could make reasonable arrangements for your conveyance to and from the school during inclement weather.

L. Murray, Esq.,\nContractor,\nWest Arichat, C.B.\nI consider that Mr. Murray is justified in the demand made for an increase for the reasons alleged.\n\nRev. A.R. Mudd\nIndian Agent,\nChristmas Island\nCape Breton,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Canada.\nChristmas Island Oct 29\n\nFrank Reddy Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRev. A. R.\n\nI visited the Reserve and selected site for the residence. I find upon examination that my \"binder\" is too low, and have obliged to ask for $500 additional for the following reasons:\n\nFirst, because it will cost much more to build the house so late in the season, then it would have been the custom been awarded after the closing up the binder, as I expected and figured upon.\n\nSecond, the best available site is on level ground with trees and shrubs, the removing of which will entail additional expense which I did not anticipate when I made my calculations. I figured to build on a site free from shrubs and trees.\n\nThirdly, I find the place to be most convenient to transport material to, the nearest...\nrailway station being 41.3661 miles distant and no shipping facilities to import materials. It will also be necessary to erect a temporary dwelling house, as the Indians, the sole inhabitants on the Reserve cannot furnish proper quarters for my men.\n\nTaking these unforeseen circumstances into consideration, you will hope see the justice of my demand. Should the Department refuse my request, I shall seriously consider the advisability of cancelling the Contract. Because it was not awarded to me last summer, where it would not be so expensive to perform the work. I have no plans the Contract up. This letter to your effect and you will find his statement enclosed. Your humble servant\n\nPlease bring this matter before A.L. Murray.\n\nDistrict Chief let me know at once. West Strickland, C.B.\nSir,\n\nYour's of Oct. 22 requesting me to select site for teacher's residence on the Indian Reserve at Escanoni was duly received. In company with the Contractor, A.L. Murray, visited the Reserve and selected the site for the house. A very suitable site was obtained. I was also asked to supervise the work. I have done providing the Department will pay me according to the regular scale of wages granted to Supervisors over Government works. The Department cannot expect me to perform this additional work as Indian Agent at the very low salary allowed me.\n\nYou will kindly inform me at once, what remuneration will the Department grant me for supervising this work? I do not consider it the Agent's work and unless paid sufficiently remunerated, I shall not act.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nS. Stewart, Esq.,\nAssistant Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 7, 1912.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nOn the 22nd ultimo Rev. A. R. McDonald, Indian Agent at Christmas Island, was instructed by wire to select the site for the teacher's residence at Eskasoni and supervise the work of construction. The site has been selected and Mr. McDonald wants to know what remuneration he is to receive for acting as inspector for the new building while under construction.\n\nThis work forms no part of his official duties as Indian Agent, but, as he is the most convenient man for the position and was recommended by Mr. John McCormick, he was asked to act as inspector. Mr. McDonald was appointed Indian Agent by Order in Council at the munificent sum of $100.00 per annum. Building operations are now under way and Mr. McDonald is quite competent to do the work and he could hardly be expected to do it for nothing. I think the department would be justified in paying him $10.00 for each visit in addition to actual travelling expenses. A weekly visit would be sufficient.\n\n[Signature]\n\nHarold Beaven\nOttawa, November 7, 1912.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nMr. Mury, contractor for the erection of the teacher's residence on the Eskasoni Reserve, writes the Department that he will require $500.00 more than his contract price if he is to go on with the building. He claims (1) that the delay in awarding the tender will put him to additional expense, (2) that the site selected is covered with trees and stuff that will have to be cleared; when making his tender he figured on a clear site, and (3) that he will have to put up a temporary house of the work people, as there is no accommodation in the neighbourhood of the school. His application for this increase is recommended by Rev. Mr. McDonald, Indian Agent at Christmas Island.\n\nTenders for this building were called for returnable on August 13th, last, and the memorandum to Council recommending the acceptance of Mr. Mury's tender was prepared on the 14th of that month. It was not until the 14th\n14th ultimo that Mr. Mury was advised of the acceptance of his tender, two months having elapsed since the date of its receipt. The Department holds an accepted cheque from Mr. Mury for ten per cent of his contract price, which was $1716.00, and he has signed an agreement for the due performance of the contract. I think the Department could hold him to his contract, although he might be entitled to something for clearing the school site, but he should have made himself better acquainted with the position of affairs before making his offer. Probably the lateness of the season and the delays occasioned by bad weather will add to the expense of getting in the material. No doubt when his tender was made it was with the expectation of going on with the work during the summer and not in the beginning of the winter. If the building is not gone on with this fall we will lose the teacher, who will not remain unless accommodation is provided for him.\n\n[Signature]\n\nArthur B. Cameron\nOttawa, November 8, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo in which you state that you will require $500.00 more than the contract price if you are to go on with the erection of the teacher's residence on the Eskasoni Reserve for reasons stated in your letter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will hold you to your contract, but, after the completion of the work, if you can show that you have any just claim for additional pay for the reasons stated in your letter above quoted, the same will receive due consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

All which could be built at an outlay of a few hundred dollars.\n\nI would suggest it would be better for Department to have the said house built, and save the cost of conveyance which would be at least $60. Before moving into the new house, I would require an out house as proposed. I could get said out house built in a few weeks, and could live in it temporarily until house would be ready, and then it would serve the above purpose. If you deign to trust me to build it, I can do so for at least one third less than by tender and it will enable me to get along more satisfactory, and save you the cost of conveyance which would be so much money thrown away. If you decide upon this matter, will, and I will get this out house built with the strictest regard to economy, and at the lowest possible cost.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJames Miller, Teacher\nJ.B.

When the new house is ready the said house can be used for the above purposes. I also built a place large enough to hold sufficient hay for the stock required. The total cost amounted to only $125, whereas, if let on contract it would cost over $200. I am better situated now, and I respectfully request you to advise your Agent to inspect and report upon these buildings and the new schoolhouse, will I hope consider the urgent need of the same in connection with the new house, and that I was able to have them erected at a considerable saving to the Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJames W.

Reed, teacher at Evergreen. One used as a temporary residence is 18' x 16' with 10 feet front. The other where he keeps his cow and feed for some is 15' x 12' with 10 feet front. Considered that these buildings are worth $125.00 and therefore submit a voucher in his favor for the sum.\n\nIt is necessary to dig a well near the new house, as there is no spring or water on the site. While the Dept. defray the expenses, I would get the Indians to do the work, advised the dept. permit me to perform the work.\n\nWill the Dept. pay any furniture in the new house, I would suggest that a stove for the kitchen, tables and chairs be purchased for one kept from the old house. These articles would be useful in the future, and as the teacher occupying teachers' quarters who is to supply\n\nApproved,\n\nD. W. Reed, Esq.,\nDirector.\n\nA. R. M.

McNeil, teacher at the Eskasoni School, for two buildings erected by him for temporary use, which it is now proposed to use as out-houses in connection with the teacher's residence and school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is prepared to pay the amount asked for these buildings, but, before doing so, desires to have receipted accounts showing that the material used in the construction has been paid for. It is understood that the teacher himself performed the labour. You will kindly obtain these receipts at your earliest convenience.\n\nWith regard to the digging of the well you may arrange to have this work done by some of the Indians by day labour under the supervision of the teacher, who will be expected to see that they work faithfully. Reasonable rates of wages will be allowed. When the well is completed you may purchase a suitable pump. In the case of the vouchers for the labour the number of hours of work with the rates of wages paid should be shown and the amount of excavation should also be indicated.\n\nRev. A. R.

They, however, to call your attention to two alterations that I ordered. I gave orders to the contractor for these changes, and the work was in such a shape that I had no time to receive the Dept's permission. The front house on the 2nd floor was open to plans in place of the building. I ordered a partition and also a small hall upstairs separating the first floor from the two back rooms. I also ordered a door to be placed between the dining room and the living room to prevent going through these two rooms from being to dining room.\n\nI have also ordered a closet in the kitchen for a closet. The plans which make a good storage place for kitchen utensils. All these were made improvements and I cannot be greatly impressed thereby. There must be enough as it was, and I got the contractor to agree for some extra, the reasonable sum of $50.00.

You may, however, submit them as extras, but accompanying the certificate will have to be a detailed statement of the work performed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

The Depot will have freight addressed to me.\n\nCommunicate to Mr. Murray, West Street, Cape Breton. Before commencing the work, I sent forth a claim of $500.00, additional which you promised to consider. My reasons for this claim were given at the time. Namely:\n\n1. The contract was not executed till about three months after closing the tenders. The season had got so late that the work proved more expensive than it would have been, had the contract been awarded to me, as I expected and figured upon when tenders were closed.\n\n2. The site selected was on a hill covered with shrubs and trees. The moving of which delayed the work and cost me money.\n\n3. The season late, the weather got bad, I cannot not import the materials by water and the building up said materials from the nearest railway station ten miles distant entailed much expense, which I could avoid, had the work begun when the tenders were closed.\n\n4. I had to keep fires on and pay a man to do so which expense cannot have been incurred also, had the contract been given at the closing of tenders. I trust therefore that these reasons will secure your careful and favorable consideration and that you will see the justice of my claim.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nA.L.

I am therefore enclosing my final certificate for the payment of the balance of contract, together with the extras. The extra of $742.50 has already been deducted by the Dept., in your letter of December 9th No. 11758/13. The extra of $52.50 is for alterations ordered by me while the house was being built.\n\nThe front room upstairs was partitioned along the stairs. A small hall made between the bed rooms on the second floor, which is a great improvement. A door was also placed between the sitting and dining rooms. The present living room is now used as a study. A door also was put in the kitchen for use as the main dining table utilizing the space under the stairs for a slave room for the kitchen. I consider this for all this work $82.50 is fair, and just.

Therefore I decided to proceed with the work and was authorised by Rev.A.R.McDonald to cut and clear a road leading to the site, cut down trees and also tear out stumps for an area of about 50 square feet. It was absolutely necessary to do this in order to proceed with the work and this alone entailed quite a lot of expense that I had not anticipated.\n\nMoreover a sewerage had to be extended a distance of 96 feet to insure a proper drainage outlet and this had to be furnished with proper drain pipe all of which was not specified but which was absolutely necessary and which I was authorized to do by the Inspector.\n\nThe claim I made for extras would pay for all this and leave me only a slim margin of profit. I thought the reasons advanced by me in a letter to you in January was sufficient to obtain my demand and that the Department would allow the same without any hesitation.\n\nI am herein enclosing a bill of the actual costs for the extras mentioned above and I would earnestly appeal to the Department to give the same serious consideration and remit the amount to me at an early date. I can refer you to the Indian Agent for that district as to the equity of this claim, Rev.A.R.McDonald of\nof Christmas Island.\n\nI am the more anxious to obtain the amount of this claim as I owe some bills in connection with this work which are not yet paid and which I have no hopes of being able to pay unless the Department sees fit to reimburse me for the extra work performed on request and which extra work no mention was made in the specifications.\n\nI am herewith enclosing bill of actual cost of this extra work and trust to receive payment thereof at an early date.\n\nI am, sir,\n\nYours truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nMurray\nOttawa March 10, 1913.\n\nRev.

Presumably this work was done under your instruction and if a price was agreed upon between you and the contractor you should state on the voucher that the charges are fair and just and according to agreement, either verbal or otherwise, between you and him. If, however, there was no agreement it will be necessary to furnish details as to the amount of clearing done, number of men employed and rates of wages paid, etc., and in connection with the drainage the amount of excavation, tile, labour, etc.\n\nYour remark on the voucher that \"I did not know that the Department considered this work as extra.\" If you will refer to the plans and specifications you will see that no provision was made either for the clearing of the site or for drainage and the work must, therefore, necessarily be an extra. The site was chosen by yourself and the contractor could not be reasonably expected to clear it at his own expense.

I can get the building from the Indians for $100 and $50 more with cement it into a splendid barn.\n\nThe water closet and wood shed for school house would cost about $500. The expenditure therefore of $200 or would solve the question of additional accommodation.\n\nThere are five acres of land connected with the school and we are planning it for a school garden.

But the soil is excellent, and apart from the inconvenience of the rough condition of the grounds, it is pitiable that something could not be done toward clearing a portion of the land and rendering it fit for cultivation.\n\nI bring this matter to your attention and urgently hope that you will assist in clearing the grounds.

Maclean Esq.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 27th ult.\n\nM117552-5, I beg leave to state that the lot of land on which the teacher's residence is situated contains between 6 and 6 acres, which is reserved exclusively for the benefit of the said teacher's residence and such other school purposes as the Department may direct. I am thankful to you for considering the urgency of clearing a sufficient portion of the said land so I was also very alarmed about the safety of the buildings in case a fire might break out near the grounds. Apart from this serious danger and inconvenience, the clearing of the land will enable me to beautify the grounds, and conduct such gardening operations, as will prove both instructive and useful to the Indian pupils, and also form an excellent experimental field for the Indian parents themselves to improve their lands and surroundings. It is a noted fact that the Micmacs of here settle are sadly deficient in their methods of...\nfarming and until they are educated along these lines, they will never become self-reliant and independent. Laboring among them, I consider it my bounden duty to elevate them all I can in the matter of taking a greater interest in farming, and thereby become more thrifty and industrious, and a less burden to the Department.\n\nTo assure the safety of the buildings etc., it is necessary to clear at least an area of two acres around the building. In regard to the cost per acre, I am unable to furnish you with an accurate estimate as there is a considerable amount of labor to remove the timber, stumps, stones and slumps. The stumps are thickly clustered over the ground, vary from 6 to 8 ft. and difficult to remove on account of the tough character of the surface. I would however suggest that you instruct the Agent to refer some party accustomed to the work who will furnish you with a consecutive estimate of the cost per acre.\n\nThanking you again for guiding this matter for serious consideration.\n\nI am \"your\"\n\nJames Macmillan\nOttawa, September 13, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant in further reference to the clearing of a portion of land around the teacher's residence at the Eskasoni School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Agent McDonald will be written to in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Macdonald\nEskasoni Chapel, Mar 29 1916\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg leave to state that acting under instructions from your Agent in July 1913 I erected a wire fence around the land belonging to teacher's residence. It was absolutely necessary at this time to protect the house and property. I paid for the said fence and work out of my own private money and duly forwarded receipt and papers to the Department. I would wish very much to get paid for the said fence now, as it would help in paying the expenses of plowing and cultivating the two acres cleared last fall. Part of an acre will be assigned for a school garden for the pupils, and special attention given to flowers and vegetables, also the transplantation of trees. The school garden and residence will require a neat panel fence, but residence will require a neat panel fence.\n\nI will build this fence at my own expense providing the wire fence around the entire property is paid, and also furnish me with some fertilizer which is greatly needed for the school garden and all the ground to insure a productive crop. To get the two acres properly seeded and cultivated will cost me over $100, but I must pay that myself, as I promised last fall, and shall feel thankful if you pay for the wire fence and some fertilizer.\n\nI trust you will give this matter your closest attention.\n\nI am yours,\nJames McNeil,\nIndian Teacher,\n\nEskasoni Chapel Rd.,\nEskasoni Indian Reserve,\nN.S.\nOttawa, April 6, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo stating that acting under instructions from the Agent in July, 1913, you erected a wire fence around the teacher's residence on the Eskasoni Reserve and paid for the fence and work out of your own pocket and forwarded receipts and papers to the Department.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department cannot find any record of these receipts and papers having been received and I have to ask you to forward duplicates through the Agent, Rev.

During a heavy snowstorm the place was thrown down, and nothing could be done properly at that season of the year; Mr. White, the teacher, consented to abandon the kitchen and move into the dining-room. The kitchen floor, the ice house, stove, have gone below water, and it seemed to be a miracle to rebuild it there. The proper place for it is outside the house, next adjacent to the end and running up to the porch of the teacher's house. The length of it is about 25 ft. This is where the teachers want it and I consider it the proper place. To rebuild it where it was before is my opinion, and we cannot do the work properly. This proper place would cost about $150.00. Something must be done at once to give Mr. White the use of the kitchen, and now as the weather is getting worse, this work can be done properly. Otherwise warmed the building to a place, attached to the end of house outside of running up to top. We are doing our part and will continue this important volume and endeavor to keep\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Office\n\nApril 16, 1917\nOttawa, April 26, 1917.\n\nReverend Sir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated 16th instant in reference to kitchen chimney on the Eskasoni Teacher's residence, and in reply to say that this should be repaired by again building up to about 3 feet above the roof and finished with one of the Standard Clay Products Limited, (No.3) chimney tops. This will give excellent draught for the chimney, and as it will be low and near the roof there will be no danger of it again blowing down. The cost of the chimney cowl is $5.50, and as the bricks of the old chimney are to be re-used the entire expense should not exceed $10. to $12. which is authorized.\n\nThe address of the manufacturers is New Glasgow, N.S. In ordering the cowl you should state the size of the base of chimney.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. A.R.McDonald,\nIndian Agent,\nChristmas Island, C.B., N.S.\nMy dear sir,\n\nI beg leave to report to you the urgent need of a barn at teacher's residence here. The old house on the premises is too small to be of any use for the purpose of accommodating the hay, crop, and stock belonging to the place. On account of the high cost of building which is almost intolerable, I am obliged to raise all I can of the land. The estimated value of hay, stock and food products this summer will be about $400, which with my salary will only provide for a very meager living during the year. And if deprived of what the land produces through lack of accommodation the yearly salary would have to be very materially increased. Moreover, I desire to state that as the land increases in value it forms a valuable asset as the property of the Department in regulating the teacher's salary in future, and is certainly worth the expenditure of a few hundred dollars in this regard. It also forms an important feature in the way of experiment in encouraging the Indians of the Reserve in taking a greater\ninterest in farming, and very good results can be already observed with many of them. In view of the foregoing facts, I earnestly appeal to you to make provision for a barn 30 x 60 feet. I learn of the said dimensions will meet all the requirements, and can be put up at a cost of $425. I am also agreed to pay back the $175, the Department paid for the out house here towards the expense of the proposed barn, making it a total expense to the Department of $300.\n\nI sincerely hope and pray you will give this matter your esteemed support, so enable me to make ends meet.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJames MacNeil\n\n[Signature]\n\nTeacher,\nEkakowin Chapel,\nIndian Reserve,\nH.S.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the application of Mr. Macneil, teacher of the Eskasoni Indian School, for the erection of a small barn in connection with his residence I beg to say that the Department provides a house for the teacher about half a mile from the school with six acres of land attached. A portion of this land has been cleared and is under cultivation and Mr. Macneil says that the barn is required for the storing of the produce of this lot, which he works for his own use, with the exception of about one-quarter of an acre, which is used for a school garden.\n\nMr. Macneil has been in charge of this school for five years and is in receipt of a salary of $450.00 per annum. He is a married man and had many years experience in white schools before taking charge of the school at Eskasoni. The Public School Inspector reports favourably on his work and I think that it would be in the interest of Mr. Macneil and the Department to comply with his request, if a barn can be put up for the amount of\nof $425.00, as he states. If he is allowed this barn he agrees to refund the $125.00 which the Department paid for the outhouse there, towards the expenses of the barn.\n\nMr. Macneil's salary is small and from his experience and faithful service he would be entitled to a larger amount than he receives. He makes no demand for a higher salary, if his request is complied with, and I would recommend that the matter be taken up with the Agent, who should be asked to give a detailed estimate of the cost. Mr. Ogilvie informs me that he can prepare drawings of a barn which would cost in the neighbourhood of Mr. Macneil's estimate.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Benson\nOttawa, May 30, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 14th instant in reference to the erection of a barn and stable on the Eskasoni Indian School Residence property, and in reply to request that you will send in to the Department a rough sketch showing the arrangement of the barn and stable which would be most suitable for your requirements, stating also the amount and kind of stock which will have to be accommodated as well as the room required for other produce.\n\nIt is noted that a barn 20 x 30 feet is considered large enough for your requirements and that the estimated cost is placed at $425.00. In your reply accompanying the sketch requested, you should inform me if you are prepared to erect the building yourself for this amount providing the Department authorizes the expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

D.

But on submitting the matter of building a barn the required size to builders, they claim it cannot be done for less than 7 or 800. I have however learned that the Chapel on the Reserve (which is replaced now by a larger one) is for sale. And upon examining it carefully I find it is 31 x 21 ft in dimensions. The soundings are heavy enough for a building double the size, of good sound timber also the rough boards. The walls and roof require to be re-shingled and the interior remodelled, according to plan enclosed. I will undertake to remove the said building to a proper location near residence. Purchase, Construct proper pillars of stone and cement or concrete under foundation; Re-shingle the walls and roof completely. Furnish the required doors and windows. Remodel the interior, with proper flooring of Plank. Stalls, Feeding alleys and loft overhead. Paint doors and window sashes. Grade the location for the sum of $425.

There will be ample space for five stalls, and a stable, also for ten or twelve cows hay.\nI have this summer three milk cows and two younger ones which is the least number that should be kept to provide milk, butter and meat as well as to furnish manure for the quantity of potatoes and vegetables required, and save the cost of fertilizer which every year is not reliable.\n\nI sincerely thank you for giving this matter your kind consideration, and if the above proposition meets your approval kindly report to the Agent, and under his authority and inspection I will buy the building at once and undertake to have it completed in accordance with the enclosed plan before the first of August.\n\nEver so grateful for your efforts in making this place more comfortable to myself and family,\n\nSincerely,\n\nJames McNeil\nOttawa, June 15, 1917.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nThe teacher of the Eskasoni School made application for a barn to be erected for his use, and estimated the cost at $425.00. He was written to, asking for a sketch of a suitable barn and was asked if he were prepared to erect the barn for $425.00. It might be stated that on consulting builders he found the cost would be $700 or $800. He suggests that he be allowed to purchase the unused chapel which is for sale and states that he can buy the building, move it and make the necessary alterations for $425.00.\n\nThe building is 21 x 31 feet.\n\nI would recommend that Inspector Boyd be instructed to look into the proposition and if found feasible and economical and within the estimated cost, to make arrangements for the carrying out of the proposed work.\n\n[Signature]\n\nP. V. [Signature]\nOttawa, June 14, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nThe teacher of the Eskasoni Day school has made application to the Department for the erection of a barn in connection with his farm. He suggests that he be allowed to purchase the unused chapel on the reserve, which is for sale, move it to his farm and make the necessary alterations which he states will give him the accommodation required.\n\nI have to request that you will look into the matter at as early a date as possible, and advise the Department as to the feasibility of the scheme, also send a detailed estimate of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois,\nN. S.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 14th ultimo, I beg to report, as a result of my visit recently to Eskasoni Reserve, that Mr. McNeil, teacher of the Indian day school there, was obliged by the necessities of the situation to purchase the building in question and move it to his farm, or, I would say, the Department's farm, on his own responsibility.\n\nThe prospect of bumper yields of hay and grain this season - rewards of his intelligent and persistent efforts during the past few years - made it imperative on him to provide store room promptly for his crops, especially for the hay which it will be necessary to cut and house very soon.\n\nTherefore, as a matter both of expediency and economy, he bought the unused chapel on the reserve and had it moved, as stated above, at a cost of $200.00, which I think may well be regarded as a merely nominal price. He has also had the roof, which was getting leaky, stripped and shingled anew at an outlay of $38.00. His action throughout has my approval.\n\nTo make the building suitable for the purpose intended a further expenditure of about $170.00 is required to effect necessary alterations and improvements.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 28, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated 20th ultimo in reference to the purchase of the unused chapel as a barn for use at the Eskasoni teacher's residence, and in reply to inform you that the Department approves of the purchase at the price paid and will also provide a further sum necessary for repairs to the building, such as stone or concrete foundation under and the necessary changes to the exterior and interior, including shingles, painting, doors, windows, etc.\n\nA cheque for $200.00 the purchase and moving building to school grounds will be sent to Mr. McNeil when satisfactory evidence of present and former ownership has been established to the department's satisfaction. The balance of the money necessary for repairs, viz., $203.00, will be sent him on receipt of certificate from you stating that the work has been satisfactorily completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

In this case it was necessary to supply these articles of furniture promptly, as Miss German cannot provide them herself, being poor and quite without means.\n\nIt is to be hoped that she will be on hand to re-open the school early next week. She was disappointed that she could not take charge of it on the 20th of January when she was ready to do so, and I think she should be allowed for lost time since that date without any fault of hers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.

A. R. Macdonald, Indian Agent for Eskasoni reserve, on Sunday last, and he informed me that influenza, which was epidemic recently among the Indians of Eskasoni, had quite subsided, and that regular communication with the place had been restored. You may, therefore, take charge of the Indian school at Eskasoni as soon as you possibly can, which I hope will be early next week.\n\nWith regard to the most expeditious way for you to reach Eskasoni, I would say: Make it a point to arrive by the Midland Railway at Truro in the evening, so as to enable you to take the night express from that point to Christmas Island, where you will arrive at 7 o'clock the following morning, barring unforeseen delays. This will give you at least ten hours of daylight to complete the remainder of your journey - a distance of about 12 miles from Christmas Island.\n\nFather Macdonald, the Indian Agent, lives quite near the Railway Station at Christmas Island, and he expects you to call on him promptly, which I advise you not to neglect doing. He will direct you where to get a conveyance to take you to Eskasoni. You will find him a very kind man, and ready to assist you in any way he can. I have instructed him to furnish the teacher's residence at Eskasoni with a Cook Stove, a Bedstead, a Mattress, and a few chairs. You will have to supply yourself, whatever other items of furniture you may require.\n\nI hope will be able to leave Berwick for Eskasoni early next week. All concerned are very anxious to have the Indian school there in operation again.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) A. J. Boyd,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nMiss Agnes E.

Boyd, Esq.,\nCommiss., C.B.\nSir,\n\nI have to report that the teacher's residence at Eskasoni Indian reserve is much in need of repairs. The building having been erected only a few years ago, I was surprised when its condition was brought to my notice, that the clapboards on it are loose and somewhat decayed in several places. I had no trouble to pull out the nail, enclosed herewith, which I do not think was the right size for the purpose intended. At any rate, the clapboards should be renailed, the nail heads puttied, and the outside walls should receive two coats of paint of a good quality. Two panes of glass are broken in one window, and these should be replaced. All the windows require more or less repairs by being painted, and puttied where necessary.\n\nA porch should be built to the north side of the house, as a shelter for the kitchen door which, as it is, makes the building cold in winter. The teacher would like to have the dining room papered, or painted, and I agree with her that some improvement in that direction is very necessary.\n\nMy estimate of the amount required to effect necessary repairs and improvements, as suggested, is $250.00; and I recommend that the expenditure be made as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.

J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois,\nN. S.\nOffice of the Indian Superintendent\n\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.,\nJanuary 30, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of September 3rd last, I am obliged to report that I have been unable to get the proposed repairs and improvements made to the teacher's residence at Eskasoni reserve, because the place was quarantined for smallpox in September and October, when I first sought to have the work done; and afterwards because I found that the materials required could not be procured in the neighbourhood of Eskasoni, and that the ultimate cost of them would be practically prohibitive, owing to the difficulties and consequent expense of transportation from outside.\n\nOn account of these repairs not having been made, and of the unusually severe weather, which is being experienced in Nova Scotia this winter, the teacher has to occupy very uncomfortable quarters, and she appeals through me to the Department to furnish her house with a stove for heating purposes to make the situation more endurable. I recommend that an expenditure of from $12.00 to $15.00 be made for her benefit in that respect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. Nelson, Esq.,\nActing Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 7, 1920\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, informing the Department that you have been unable to have the repairs and improvements made to the teacher's residence at Eskasoni.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is disappointed to learn that these repairs have not been completed. It will now, no doubt, be impossible to have this work done before the end of the present fiscal year and there is doubt as to whether there will be any funds for this purpose next year.\n\nIn order to make the present quarters more comfortable for the teacher you may purchase the stove and have it delivered, the cost of which should not exceed $15.00. You will be good enough to forward properly receipted vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the stove.\n\nBefore making the purchase you should obtain prices from several dealers and purchase from the one quoting the lowest price for a suitable stove.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois,\nN. S.\nOffice of the Indian Superintendent.\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.,\nJuly 25th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nBut the outside of the teacher's residence at Whycoomagh, and at Eskasoni, does need painting very badly, and for that purpose I recommend that an expenditure of $90.00 in each case be authorized by the Department. I would agree to give the work at both places my personal supervision, if possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. J. Boyd,\nIndian Superintendent.\nOTTAWA, July 29th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th instant regarding the painting of the school building at Whyocoomagh, also the painting of the outside of the teacher's residence at this point and at Eskasoni, and furnishing an estimate of the cost of having this work done.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the Department will approve of having the painting of the outside of the residence at both these points carried out, and the cost should not exceed your estimate of approximately $90.00 in each case.\n\nIt is noted that you can give the work at both places your personal supervision, and I would therefore request that you will make the necessary arrangements to have the work done as soon as possible. You should see that a good quality of paint is used, and if the work is done by day labour you should purchase the paint and oils required after first obtaining competitive prices, and the purchase should be made from the firm quoting you the lowest price.\n\nThe Department will leave this matter in your hands to make the best arrangements you can, and at the lowest possible cost, having in view the performing of good work.\n\nThe work should be undertaken at an early date, and completed, if possible, before the schools reopen after the holidays.\n\nWhen the painting has been completed, you should furnish properly receipted vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred for each residence, separately.\n\nRegarding the painting of the school building at Whyocoomagh, both inside and outside, I beg to say that, as the funds at the disposal of the Department this fiscal year are limited, this work may remain over until another season.\n\nI will be pleased if you will give the matter of the painting of the residences at the above named schools your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nOffice of the Indian Superintendent,\n\nRiver Bourgeois, N. S.,\nOctober 26th., 1921.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to say with reference to the last paragraph of your letter of the 19th. instant that I forwarded accounts to the Department on the 11th., amounting to nearly $100.00, for labour and materials used in painting the exterior of the teacher's residence at Whycoomagh. A cheque, No.1891, has been received in settlement of the account for labour, and I presume that the other for material has also been paid.\n\nThe exterior of the teacher's residence at Eskasoni has been painted, but I have not yet received accounts for the service. The interior also of this building requires attention - a fact which was brought to my notice, when I visited Eskasoni recently. Its last occupants - Miss Gorman, teacher, her father and two sisters - were evidently vandals, as besides the floors being in a filthy state; the walls are defaced; and the plaster knocked down in places, exposing the bare laths.\n\nThe present teacher, Miss Hattie Burke, will not occupy the house until the inside is cleaned, papered, painted where necessary, and the plaster repaired. The kitchen chimney also requires some alterations to prevent the rain from falling through it on the floor. Miss Burke is boarding at present with a white family about two and a half miles from her school, and says that she will resign as teacher at the end of this quarter, unless the interior of the building is put in proper condition, to accomplish which will require an outlay of $150.00, and I recommend making the expenditure.\n\nMiss Burke fits her present position admirably. She is well thought of and liked by the Agent, the Indians, and the children. I am disposed to do anything in reason to retain her services, and therefore hope that the Department will be able to authorize the sum above mentioned for the purposes specified.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA. F. McKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOTTAWA, November 3rd, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, regarding the inside of the teacher's residence at the Eskasoni Indian Day School, and recommending that, in order to put this building in proper condition, an expenditure of approximately $150.00 be authorized for the purpose.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in view of your report regarding the need for these repairs, the Department will approve of your having the inside of the teacher's residence cleaned, papered, painted where necessary, and the plaster repaired, also the necessary alterations made to the kitchen chimney.\n\nYou may take the necessary steps to have this work carried out as soon as possible, and the cost should be kept down to the lowest possible point. Any material required should be purchased after competitive prices are obtained, and proper time sheets should be forwarded covering the labour engaged, which should accompany your vouchers in payment of the expenditure for having the above work done. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to make the best arrangements you can to have this residence put in a comfortable condition for the teacher.\n\nAs soon as you have received accounts for the painting of the exterior of this building, you should forward them for payment.\n\nThe accounts for the labour and material in painting the exterior of the teacher's residence at Whyccoomagh have been received, and cheques in payment of same have been sent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Considering payments already made by the Department on account of the same service, the above amount exceeds that authorized by Departmental Letter dated November 3, 1921; but there was more work to be done than I anticipated when estimating the probable cost of the improvements required, and the item of truckage did not enter into my calculations.\n\nI enclose also Returns of Labour and Voucher No. 402 for expenditures incurred in painting the exterior of the Indian Day School at Eskasoni and the outbuilding connected with the School. This work was done without consulting the Department, but as it was absolutely necessary, I considered it advisable to get the buildings painted while a favourable opportunity offered.\n\nPlease forward cheques for the Indians through me, as I am responsible for advances made to them on account of the work in both cases referred to above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.

It was my intention however to wait until after the end of the fiscal year before recommending the purchase of a new bed. But it would appear that it became necessary and the Agent had same supplied. The payment of this account will be satisfactory after the end of the year.\n\nFurthermore, I might say that the amount of furniture in the Teacher's residence at Eskasoni Reserve is very limited and the only chairs at the disposal of the teacher and her sister are a few kitchen chairs. I do not think that it would be extravagant to have a couple of inexpensive rocking-chairs supplied for their use, and I am sure if these are furnished the accounts can be held over until next month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 14, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, enclosing a voucher to the amount of $27.95 covering the cost of a bed, mattress and spring for the use of the teacher's residence at the Eskasoni Indian Day School. In reply I have to say that a cheque in payment will be sent when our funds for the next fiscal year are available.\n\nRelative to the purchase of the above equipment, I have to say that, while this account will be paid, in future the local Indian Agent or yourself should obtain authority before incurring expenditures other than in cases of emergency. Mr. Agent McDonald has frequently made purchases without first receiving authority, and you should inform him that in future it is expected he will carry out the Department's requirements before incurring any expenditure.\n\nRegarding the supplying of two inexpensive rocking chairs, I have to say that the Department will approve of the purchase of this equipment; the rendering of accounts covering the cost to be deferred until after the 1st of April, next. It is not intended that any expensive equipment be supplied. Accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost should be forwarded in the usual manner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

I would request that you arrange for the purchase of the materials and for the labour in having all the above work performed. If possible, Indian labour should be employed.\n\nAfter the work has been completed to your satisfaction, please forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of all materials, and vouchers, in triplicate, for the labour employed.

We will endeavour to arrange payment of this account, but both Father Ross and yourself should understand that such purchases should not be made without receiving specific authority from this office. In future, expenditure that has not been authorized cannot be paid.\n\nAs a matter of fact, there are several items in the account which we do not usually supply to teachers' residences. I refer in this letter to linen. Such items have not been purchased by the Department for a teacher's residence during the past three years.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\n- The Director -\n\nI wish to submit the following report on my recent visit to the Indian Agencies in the Province of Nova Scotia.\n\nI also had an interview with the Medical Health Officer of Cape Breton County, re the health situation on the Eskasoni Reserve. He pointed out that we had considerably known active T.B. cases, and many suspected ones for which the province of Nova Scotia had no accommodation in their hospitals and sanatoriums. He stated that he received unfavourable criticism every time an Indian was admitted to a medical institution, because there was no accommodation available for the Whites and they resented Indians being cared for when they were denied admission.\n\nHe believes that the only solution for this problem is for the Branch to erect its own hospital or hospitals as the case may be.\n\nArrangements have been made to have all the Indians X-Rayed sometime during the late summer. This is going to be an expensive proposition since the Indians have to be transported to Sydney by bus. The best price the Agent could obtain from the bus company was $75.00 per trip and it may be necessary to make four or five trips to complete the job. Owing to the shortage of large x-ray film, small films will have to be used. Where trouble is noted, the Indians will have to return for a large plate.\n\nIt appears to me that Eskasoni would be the proper place for a small hospital and could very well give employment to a full time doctor. I was told that the Sisters of St. Martha are prepared to staff the hospital, and have suggested that when the teachers' residence is erected, it should be designed to accommodate the Nursing Sisters - all of whom should come from the same order.\n\nG.

Chappell of Sydney, Nova Scotia, that it is in accordance with the drawings and specifications prepared by the Department of Mines and Resources and was accompanied by the required security deposit;\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Minister of Mines and Resources\nThat subsequent to the receipt of tenders for the construction of five buildings, it was decided to restrict building operations to two buildings included in the tenders namely:\n\n(a) Residence for Indian Agent\n(b) Office-warehouse Building\n\nThat the approximate total expenditure involved in carrying out work on the two buildings under contract with Mr. Chappell would be as follows:\n\nBuildings at tendered price.................. $16,966.00\nContingencies, extra work and supervision...... 1,700.00\nTotal........................................... $18,666.00\n\nThe Committee, therefore, on the recommendation of the Minister of Mines and Resources, advise that authority be granted to accept the tender of Mr. Chappell, Contractor, of Sydney Nova Scotia, which was the second lowest received, and enter into a contract with him for carrying out the construction of an Indian Agent's Residence and an Office-warehouse building, both at the Eskasoni Indian Agency in the Province of Nova Scotia, in accordance with drawings and specifications prepared by the Department of Mines and Resources, at the Contractor's tendered price of $16,966 entailing with contingencies and supervision a total expenditure of $18,666.\n\n(Sgd.)

In this regard, while Father Ross is willing to have the teacher live in the house, he has very little furniture and in order to accommodate the teacher, such articles as a bed, mattress, bureau, sheets, pillows etc. will be required. I recommend that an expenditure of $100.00 be authorized for the purchase of these articles with the understanding that when they are no longer required by the teacher, they will become a part of the equipment to furnish Father Ross' residence. Father Ross, as a rule, purchases at a discount from dealers at Sydney.\n\nF.B. McKinnon\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 28, 1945.\n\nMr. F. B. McKinnon, Indian Agent,\nEskasoni Chapel, C.B., N.S.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd instant, the Department approves an expenditure of $100.00 for the purchase of furnishings for the second teacher at the Eskasoni School.\n\nI may point out that blankets, sheets and other linens are not supplied to teachers in Indian day schools.

November 5, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am attaching hereto two letters received from Reverend Father Ross, Principal of the schools on this reserve.\n\nOne deals with the possibility of securing a garage in connection with his residence being erected here. He, like myself, expects to have a car over winter and it is unfortunate that we may have no shelter for them, more especially during the weeks we expect to be snowbound here. When we secure the services of a first class foreman, and with departmental authorization, I feel it will be possible to erect garages at a minimum of cost.\n\nThe other letter deals with the installation of a few extras in his house, which are not called for in the plans and specifications. I am submitting them to your office for consideration and reply so that Rev. Father Ross may be advised accordingly. Mr. J. E. Morris of Welfare who visited this agency recently will recall this request. I might add that I believe it is Father Ross's intention to have around the house a young boy, possibly an Indian, who could be well and comfortably housed in the basement bedroom he suggests.\n\nI presume Major S.O. Roberts, Departmental Engineer, would be advised should any or all of these requests be granted.\n\nF. B. McKinnon, Indian Agent.\n\nP.S. Will you please return Fr. Ross's letters?\nF.B. MacKinnon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEskasoni Chapel,\nN.S.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThere are a few little things that I should like to have \"extra\" in the Principal's Residence that are not on the plans. I am writing you about these things in order that you might secure the financing of them by the Indian Affairs Branch. They are as follows:\n\n1. Installing of a small lavatory basin in bedroom on first floor, and a light bulb with chain above it.\n\n2. An outlet for a plug to be put in the wall behind the refrigerator in the kitchen.\n\n3. Finishing the basement directly under the bedroom on the first floor in cyproc or plaster, etc., with a light in the ceiling and a floor plug, and a small clothes closet. This will be used as an emergency bedroom.\n\nThanking you, I am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.A. Ross,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, 17th November, 1945.\n\nMr. F.B. McKinnon, Indian Agent, Eskasoni Chapel, C.B., N.S.\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant enclosing two letters received from Reverend Father Ross with reference to certain changes that he wishes made in the plans of the Principal's Residence at the Eskasoni School. I have discussed this requisition with the Director and it is not considered advisable to make any further changes in the plans as we have already made considerable changes in the plans of this building to meet Father Ross' wishes.\n\nRegarding the garage, I discussed this with Mr. Morris and further consideration will be given the matter when we are arranging to erect a garage for your own use.\n\nI am returning Father Ross' letters as requested.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nEskasoni Chapel, N.S.\nNovember 24, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nSirs:\n\nI am happy to say that the Principal's Residence will be completed shortly. I hope to occupy it sometime in December. D. L. MacDonald, Foreman for M. R. Chappell, Contractor, informed me that they expect to pass over the house to the Department by approximately December 10th.\n\nThere is every evidence to show that the proposed water system, being constructed by the Engineering Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, will not likely be of service this winter. In order to heat the Residence, however, water is necessary; and, of course, heat is a necessity in winter months, even if the building were not occupied, for the protection of the interior finish, such as plaster, floors, paint, etc., especially in the climate of the Maritimes. Therefore, I am making the following recommendation and petition:\n\nThat a House Pressure System somewhat of the type and capacity of the one shown in the illustration enclosed, be temporarily installed in the Principal's Residence, and that water be piped from a private well about 310 feet from the Residence. This well has a sufficient supply of water for one or two homes, and is of very good quality.\n\nThe above recommendation is very practical in the circumstances. I am anxious to occupy the new house this winter. The house I am in will soon be too cold for my staying in it. Already, it is becoming very uncomfortable.\n\nIf you agree to carry out my recommendation, I think it would be better to give the installation of the House Pressure System to M. R. Chappell, Contractor, who, I presume, can conveniently attend to it before leaving the grounds here.\n\nFor my personal information, I should like to hear from you about the above.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

Ross, Principal.\n\nEncl.\nOttawa, November 28, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nTHE DIRECTOR,\nSURVEYS & ENGINEERING BRANCH.\n\nRe: Principal's Residence,\nEskasoni Indian Reserve.\n\nI enclose for your information a copy of a letter just received from Reverend A.A. Ross, Principal of the Eskasoni Indian Day School.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would let me know if you consider the suggestion made by Father Ross practical.\n\nDirector.\n\nEnclosure:\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDecember 5, 1945.\n\nRe: Temporary Heating, Principal's Residence,\nEskasoni Indian Agency, Nova Scotia.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the last instant and attached copy of letter dated November 24th from the Rev. Father Ross in which he requests to have an automatic pumping system installed for a temporary water supply in the new Principal's Residence at Eskasoni Chapel, we would comment as follows:\n\nIt is assumed that the installation is required not only to supply water to the boiler but also for the domestic supply to all plumbing fixtures in the building.\n\nWe have no information in this office regarding the source of water supply to which Father Ross refers, and as the feasibility of the scheme, apart from the question of cost, depends upon the volume, constancy and elevation of the water supply at the source, as well as the provision of electric current, to the development area, we have already instructed Mr. Roberts, by wire, to investigate and report on the matter immediately.\n\nThe cost of the pumping unit ($104.10) shown on the clipping which Father Ross forwarded, would, of course, be only a part of the total cost of the installation. Costs for labour and material in trenching, piping, insulation etc., must also be considered. This temporary equipment would be of no use when the permanent water supply system is completed. We have no assurance, of course, that either the pumping unit or the necessary piping and fittings will be available.\n\nIn a previous discussion on the matter with officers of the Indian Affairs Branch, they indicated that they were willing to leave the buildings unoccupied during the winter and in a recent letter from Mr. Roberts he states:\n\n\"The Indian Agent realizes the problems we have been up against in securing materials for the water line, and agrees that the buildings should not be occupied until water is available.\"\n\nWe do not consider that any damage is likely to be caused to the new buildings through lack of heating if they are properly closed up during the coming winter.\n\nIn regard to the well to which Father Ross refers, Mr. Sparks, who is familiar with the development area, states that it is doubtless of surface water origin and therefore the Department should take no responsibility as regards its purity.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nWith reference to the last paragraph in your memorandum, you will recall that in our memorandum of the 9th ultimo, it was pointed out that the heating system is of a closed pressure tank type. It might have been better described as a system which is completely closed and that includes an appliance which provides a cushion tank for expansion. There would be no loss of water through evaporation after the system has once been filled. While we do not recommend such action, if use of the heating system this winter is insisted on, it could be filled by means of a few yards of rubber hose, some barrels and a small hand force pump at little expense. As previously stated, it is our opinion that the buildings should be left unoccupied until the general water service is installed next year.\n\nWhen we have heard from Mr. Roberts we will advise you further on the matter.\n\nT. S. Mills,\nChief Engineer.\nDecember 7th, 1945.\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nRe: Winter Occupation, Principal's Residence, Eskasoni Indian Reserve\n\nYour memorandum of November 28th with enclosure was referred to the Engineering and Construction Service and I am enclosing herewith, for your information, a copy of Mr. Mills' report to me of the 5th instant.\n\nYou will note from the last paragraph of Mr. Mills' memorandum that the heating system can be utilized by the method described but that our engineers feel it preferable to leave the building unoccupied until the general water service is available.\n\nIf Father Ross occupies the building and uses the heating system he would have to watch very closely the expansion tank to avoid excessive pressure when the water in the radiators is very hot and also check the upper water radiators from time to time to see that there is ample water in the system.\n\nUnder these circumstances it is the opinion that he would occupy the building and use the heating plant on his own responsibility.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, December 14, 1945.\n\nMr. F. B. McKinnon, Indian Agent,\nEskasoni Chapel, C.B., N.S.\n\nIn a letter dated November 24, Reverend Father Ross requested the installation of a house pressure system in the Principal's residence, so that he could reside in that building during the present winter.\n\nA reply to his letter has been somewhat delayed because it was necessary to submit it to the Surveys and Engineering Branch. I attach an extract from their report. You will note the Engineers feel it preferable to leave the building unoccupied until a general water service is available. Consequently the Department is not prepared to incur the expenditure suggested by Father Ross. If it were possible to heat a few of the rooms in the building, so that they could be occupied, the Department would have no objection, provided there was no fire hazard. Of course, such occupancy would be on Father Ross' own responsibility, in view of the report made by the Surveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\nDecember 11th, 1945.\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nRe: Temporary Water Supply, Principal's Residence, Eskasoni, Nova Scotia.\n\nWith your memorandum of November 28th you forwarded a copy of a letter dated November 24th from Reverend Father Ross, in which he strongly recommended the installation of a temporary house pressure system to give a water supply in the Principal's residence during the winter months. The water would be piped from a private well some 300 feet from the building.\n\nThis matter has been investigated by the Engineering and Construction Service, and I am forwarding herewith a copy of a memorandum from Mr. Mills, dated December 10th. You will note that the estimated cost of this installation is $690.00; also that electric current is required, and which will not be available before the middle of January next.\n\nThese and other disadvantages in addition to the cost make it undesirable to install any temporary water system this winter in the Principal's Residence. It is the further view that the additional expenditure involved is wholly unjustified.\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDecember 10, 1945.\n\nRe: Temporary Water Supply, Principal's Residence,\nEskacong Indian Agency, N.S.\n\nWith further reference to your memorandum of the 1st instant and the request from Rev. Father Ross for the above equipment, we have now received a wired report from Mr. Roberts furnishing data from which we are able to give further information on the subject as follows:\n\nThe well to which Father Ross refers is of surface water origin with a maximum (present) flow of 120 gallons per hour and an effective capacity of about 50 gallons. The well dries up in summer and there is no assurance that the flow will be constant or that it will not cease before the proposed general water service is installed next spring. A pipe line between the well and the pump in the basement of the residence would have a rise of about two feet and would require a trench excavation four feet deep to ensure against frost penetration. If rock were encountered at a lesser depth, the pipe would have to be boxed in and insulated.\n\nMr. Roberts estimates the cost of the installation as follows:\n\n- Excavation of pipe trench and backfill $300.00\n- 280 feet of 1\" pipe with fittings and connections $90.00\n- Wiring and installation, pump and tank $100.00\n- Trucking and pipe laying $90.00\n- Pump and pressure tank unit $110.00\n\nTotal estimated cost $690.00\n\nIt is hoped that electric current will be connected about the middle of January next, but there is no assurance of this.\n\nMr. Roberts states that the School Principal demands the use of all plumbing facilities by temporary water supply during the coming winter.\n\nIn consideration of the facts stated above and outlined in our previous memoranda on the subject, and also in view of the probability that a temporary water supply would only be of use for three or four months, we are of the opinion that the purchase and installation costs of the unit would not be justified or economical.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa, 15th December, 1945.\n\nMr. F.B. McKinnon, Indian Agent,\nEskasoni Chapel, C.B., N.S.\n\nWith reference to my letter of yesterday regarding Father Ross' request, I have just received this morning, another report from the Surveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nI am now advised that to install the system recommended by Father Ross would involve an expenditure of at least $690.00 and in addition electric current would be necessary. While it is hoped to have the electric current connected about the middle of January, there is not assurance of this. The Surveys and Engineering Branch again point out owing to many disadvantages, it is undesirable to install any temporary water system this winter in the Principal's Residence.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nEskasoni Chapel, C.N., N.S.\nDecember 19th, 1945.\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH,\nDep't. of Mines and Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nRE Occupation of New Residences - Eskasoni Chapel.\n\nI have for acknowledgement your letter of November 22nd suggesting ways and means to occupy the new residences this year. This matter is of paramount concern to us also and we have been debating ways and means to get into them as soon as possible after completion. Father Ross, Mr. MacDonald and myself are all very anxious for a change as none of us are at all satisfied living under the present circumstances.\n\nFor your information the builders (Chappells) have had Father Ross' hot water heating system in continuous operation over two weeks now. It uses very little water which can easily be filled as required. Heating his house need not cause any undue inconvenience. Since the Engineering Branch estimates it would cost almost seven hundred dollars to install a temporary water system Father Ross is resigned to the apparent necessity of getting along this winter without the use of bathroom and running water facilities. There is a spring very close to his house which he might clean out, case with tile and bring water into his house by a hand pump. This arrangement will be quite satisfactory to him if acceptable to your office.\n\nWith regard to my dwelling there is no problem re heating it and if I can secure water in a shallow well that I would like to sink at my own expense and bring it into the house I too will endeavour to get by without running water and bathroom facilities until spring. This will be an inconvenience with four small children, but if it is not too late when the water is found, I will attempt to move the family from Shubenacadie.\n\nWill you please advise if the suggested temporary arrangements are satisfactory to your office and if we may move into the new residences as soon as the builders have moved out.?\n\n(Sgd) F. B. McKinnon.\nINDIAN AGENT.\nOttawa, December 27th, 1945.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nF. B. McKinnon, Esq., Indian Agent, EKISAGAI CHAPEL, C.B., N.S.\n\nRE: Occupation of New Residences.\n\nI acknowledge your letter of December 19th. As soon as the Chappells firm turn the residences over to your control then you have authority to move into them. This office should be informed of the date they are to be made available as well as the date on which they will be occupied.\n\nRegarding the Principal's residence you have already received correspondence stating the views of the Officers of the Surveys and Engineering Branch. Father Ross should be advised that the greatest possible care must be exercised in keeping the water system of the hot water heating unit filled up all the time. He will be held responsible for any damage that is caused through neglect or carelessness. Regarding the water supply for his house, as it will be only a few months before the installed water system is in operation, the most economic arrangements should be made to obtain his immediate needs. It should be possible for him to obtain his water supply this winter from the same source as he obtained it last winter without additional cost. It does not appear wise to purchase and install a new pump. If the shallow well requires to be cleaned out and a tile put in then it will be left to your judgment if the work should be done.\n\nRegarding your dwelling and the possibility of obtaining water supply from a shallow well, which you indicate you would sink it at your own expense, the Officers here are of the opinion that at this season of the year it might be difficult for you to obtain water.\nas no doubt the frost has already gone into the ground two or three feet. However, conditions may be such that you can at little cost dig a shallow hole and obtain sufficient water for your winter needs; if so, the cost of the latter will be paid by this office. It is suggested that if water is not obtained after two days' digging that the attempt be abandoned. If a shallow well provides you with water then no doubt you can crib it with surplus lumber you have on hand at a minimum cost.\n\nRegarding the moving of your family from Shubenacadie I wish to advise that the cost of transportation for your wife and children, as well as the trucking of your furniture will be paid by the Branch. If the roads are open it is suggested that the departmental truck be used to move your furniture. The conditions, however, may be such that this suggestion is impractical. In that event, it will be left to you to make the most economical arrangements.\n\nIf Father Ross moves into the new residence then his present house should be made available for Alex. Macdonald and family. It will be more convenient for him to be living in the vicinity of the office and his work.\n\nDirector.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER - signed by Director - to\nF. B.

It is quite probable that it will be ready for occupation shortly and I would like to know just what arrangements are usually made in cases of this kind.\n\n(1) Will the furniture be purchased and shipped here?\n\n(2) Shall we buy it locally through competitive bids under direction of your office?\n\n(3) Or shall Rev. Fr. Ross be given an allowance to cover all purchases and be allowed to purchase it locally wherever he can make the most satisfactory arrangements?\n\nI prefer the last suggestion as there are no firms complete enough to furnish the entire amount of household goods required, and I think that difficulty would be encountered if it should be handled from Ottawa. He has a small and very unsatisfactory stove in his kitchen now, practically no dining room furniture and very little for his living rooms. He has two bedrooms almost complete which were purchased the past year. I estimate, without too much detail, that he requires a new stove, refrigerator, dining room suite, another bedroom outfit, some additional pieces for his living room, office furniture and the usual amount of blinds, carpets, curtains, silverware etc. How much of this the Department will supply I do not know and seek directions and information. Will you please advise?\n\nF.B. McKinnon\n\nF.B. McKinnon,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 9th January, 1946.\n\nMr. F.B. McKinnon, Indian Agent,\nEskasoni Chapel, C.B., N.S.\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant with reference to furnishings for the Principal's Residence at Eskasoni. Please forward a requisition for the articles you consider are essential. Purchase will be made through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nIf any of the local firms are able to supply any or all of the articles, you should so state on your requisition and give an estimate of the cost involved.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nEskasoni Chapel, N.S.\nJanuary 8, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDep't. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nSirs:\n\nOn November 24, 1945, I wrote you in reference to the installation of a temporary water system in the Principal's Residence. I have not received a reply to my letter that courtesy would demand. I have heard indirectly, however, that this water system would cost too much. If you had been around here during the past few months and witnessed the money that was being wasted in a vain attempt to construct a water system, you would not consider the installation of the system that I petitioned for too great an expense. It was a source of scandal to the whole countryside and all political parties to see your Engineer in a very inefficient manner attempting to construct a water system. Now, the whole thing is discontinued for the winter and the drains are filling in with earth and will have to be reopened next summer at considerable additional expense. I ask is this good economy? If the job had been given to M.R. Chappell, Contractor, it would have been completed in 1945; he had sufficient pipe available and above all would know how to do the work properly and efficiently.\n\nIn view of the fact that you do not agree to grant my request for a temporary water system this winter, I am arranging to have water installed at the expense of our church or diocese, even if they have less money in funds than the Government of Canada. I plan moving into the new house within a few weeks, in order to keep warm during the winter months, although I have very little furniture to take with me.\n\nSome time ago, I asked for a garage, through the local Indian Agent; and, as far as I am aware, nothing has been authorized yet. All I do know is that my car is out in the snow every day. Should it take all winter to erect a garage?\nIf I were working in a parish exclusively for the diocese and bishop, I would not experience as much difficulty in getting things as I have in working for the Indian Affairs Branch. You need not think that because you are erecting a house that you are doing more for me than is being done for the other clergy in the diocese.\n\nI understand you are planning on having sisters come to Eskasoni. When a community of sisters come into a parish to undertake some special kind of work, such as to teach in schools, carry on hospital work, etc., they require the approval and authorization of the parish priest and authorities in the diocese. I want to make it clear to you just now that no sisters will come to work in Eskasoni, while I am Parish Priest here and your co-operation with me is as unsatisfactory as it is at present. I have the support of the authorities of the diocese in this matter and I will continue to get their support. If you are turning a deaf ear to my petitions now, you will do the same to the sisters later.\n\nIf you are determined, however, on having the sisters come here, and you co-operate with me, it will be necessary for you to consult the Mother General of the Order, and myself as Parish Priest, regarding their place of residence and working facilities. The plans that were drawn up previously are not satisfactory. What the sisters need and want will have to be granted in advance to their coming; otherwise, they will not come to Eskasoni. The Mother General and I are taking a united stand on this because you are giving evidence, in my case, of being unsatisfactory co-operators.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. A. Ross,\nPrincipal.\n1. Mr. Henry to note\n2. Rao (signature)\nOttawa, January 17, 1946.\n\nDear Father Ross:\n\nI have hesitated to reply to your letter of January 8th until now in the hope that I would be in a position to reply helpfully and constructively.\n\nI would not be altogether frank with you if I did not state that the statements and general tone of your communication are somewhat unusual. Such letters invariably cause resentment on the part of overworked officials who are doing everything humanly possible to assist our field staff, despite the critical and exacting times in which we are living.\n\nYou state, \"On November 24, 1945, I wrote you in reference to the installation of a temporary water system in the Principal's Residence. I have not received a reply to my letter that courtesy would demand.\" The records before me indicate that your letter was received at this branch on November 26th and was sent forward to the Director of the Surveys and Engineering Branch on November 28th and by that branch referred to Mr. Roberts, the engineer of construction work at Eskasoni. An extract of his reply was sent forward to Mr. McKinnon, the senior administrative officer at Eskasoni on December 14th. A report dated December 10th was received by wire from Mr. Roberts of the Surveys and Engineering Branch and sent forward to us on December 11th, and Mr. McKinnon was advised of the decision reached by the department in a letter dated December 13th. An additional letter was sent forward to Indian Agent McKinnon dated December 27th, outlining departmental policy with respect to the occupancy and use of the recently constructed residences. It will thus be seen that despite the acute shortage of staff from which we are suffering, the representations made by you in your letter of January 8th were dealt with promptly and with despatch. The second paragraph of your letter, in fact,\nindicates that you were already aware of the decision reached by the department with respect to the installation of a temporary water system.\n\nI am anxious to outline in this letter as clearly as possible the exact position you occupy in the administration of Indian Affairs at Eskasoni. When the survey of conditions on Indian reserves in Nova Scotia was undertaken a few years ago by Mr. W. S. Arnell, certain representations were made to him by the Church authorities with respect to the creation of new agencies, the employment of full-time Indian Agents and particularly with respect to the operation of Indian day schools at Shubenacadie and Eskasoni. The Church authorities expressed the opinion that in view of all the circumstances the employment of a Priest as Principal at each school and the employment of nuns as teachers would expedite the policy of centralization and contribute to the material and spiritual advancement of the Indian population. These representations were re-submitted to the senior officials of the department by a group of Priests who had formerly acted as temporary Indian Agents, who had been invited to Ottawa to review the subject matter of Mr. Arnell's report, and particularly his recommendations with respect to the creation of two distinct and separate Indian Agencies in the Province. In this regard, it is only fair to state that in the operation of the residential school at Shubenacadie and in the selection of Priests to act as temporary Indian Agents, we have until now enjoyed the fullest measure of cooperation from the Church.\n\nYou were, as you know, nominated for the position you now occupy by the Bishop of the Diocese. Your position is that of Principal of the Indian day school on the reserve. You were classified as a temporary civil servant and employed on the understanding that you were subject at all times to departmental regulations. It has never been the policy or practice of the department to communicate with school principals or school teachers with respect to the administration of Indian Affairs on Indian reserves. The Indian Agent is the senior administrative officer and the official with whom we communicate on all matters relating to the welfare of Indians. To do otherwise would simply lead to endless confusion and misunderstandings. Your work as school principal will be inspected from time to time by the public school inspector, who will report to the department in due course. All matters relating to the welfare of the school should be submitted by you to the Indian Agent, who will in turn refer them, when he deems it advisable, to the department. The department at no time in its history has sought to interfere directly or indirectly with missionary work on Indian reserves.\nThis responsibility has always been borne by the Church and I can assure you in this letter that no official of the department, whether he be Indian Agent or engineer, will seek to dictate to you at any time with respect to the religious instruction you should provide at your Church or in the school, and, in this respect, you will be subject only to the wishes of your Bishop. As school principal, however, you will be subject at all times, as all civil servants are, to departmental regulations. You will not be permitted at any time as school principal to express opinions on engineering projects direct to the department, nor as school principal will you be permitted to express criticisms on the selection of contractors or on the adequacy or inadequacy of buildings. These matters are not your responsibility. It is only fair to you to state that you can only continue in our employment on this understanding. Your case in no sense differs from other Priests employed as part-time agents or as principals of day schools throughout the Dominion. All are alike - subject to the regulations now in force and seldom, if ever, fail to conform to established practice.\n\nWith respect to the construction of houses used as residences either for school teachers or school principals, the department, while always willing to receive helpful suggestions through the Indian agency, cannot and will not from time to time depart from its regular policy to meet the demands of any teacher or any particular group of teachers. The department has learned from experience that the stay of many of these teachers in these residences is comparatively brief and that their successors seldom agree with them with respect to accommodation, heating systems, water supply and other equipment.\n\nThe Government, therefore, in its wisdom has decided on standard residences, but it has never been our intention - nor is it our intention now - to compel any teacher or any group of teachers to dwell in the houses we establish. This is a matter for the teachers themselves to decide and I can assure you that no compulsion will be exercised by the Government with respect to the group of teachers on whose behalf you have written.\n\nMay I again emphasize that all matters relating to the operation of the school of which you are principal, including repairs or alterations to the school building and to the principal's residence, requisitions for supplies such as wood, coal, requisitions for textbooks, should be submitted by you to the Indian\n\n.....Agent\nAgent, who will, I feel sure, send forward promptly any representations or suggestions you may care to make to this department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. - I am sending forward copy of this letter to Bishop Morrison for his information.\n\nReverend A.

Ross has prepared a list of necessary household furniture on which I am securing net prices before I submit to your office for comparison.\n\nFor his office he will need a desk and chairs. In an interview with the Secretary of the Y.M.C.A. war services at Sydney I learned an unused office desk can be had for fifteen dollars. A chair to match for $6.00, two or three office chairs @ about $8.00. These prices are less than half of the prime retail prices and I believe it would be economy to purchase them. They are standard office equipment and some have never been used. A metal file cabinet can also be procured although I overlooked securing a price on it. The usual discount will prevail. If you concur that this would be an economical purchase will you please advise at your earliest convenience as it all will be sold on or before March 31st. I have tried to secure prices on a refrigerator and other household equp. but to no avail. Certified cheques or cash only are acceptable.

This building is practically devoid of household furniture and should be furnished. At my request he has prepared a list of necessary articles and in his company I toured all the furniture shops in Sydney. Only one store was in position to quote on practically all the items and they are anxious to have a decision as soon as possible. I secured these prices to inform you what they could be procured for locally and advise you that in practically all cases we took the cheapest prices. (I would also like to point out that it would be much easier and more convenient if the goods could be secured here having in mind the possibility of service of mechanical items like refrigerator, washer etc and the exchange of defective materials plus the desirability of selecting units to match painting etc.) Here are the desired items and the firm quoting:\n\nD.

Bonnell, Sydney\n\n| Item Description | Price |\n|------------------|-------|\n| Dining room set  | $250.00 |\n| Dinner set (dishes) 8 service | $24.50 |\n| Lamp & shade (trilight) | $25.75 |\n| End table | $16.75 |\n| Chesterfield suite | $165.00 |\n| 9x10\u00bd congoleum for office | $9.25 |\n| Hall tree | $7.25 |\n| Dressers $21.50 ea | $43.00 |\n| Dresser | $26.50 |\n| Mattresses 29.50 ea | $88.50 |\n| Springs 14.50 ea | $43.50 |\n| Bed | $21.50 |\n| \"s (singles) 29.75 ea | $59.50 |\n| Axminster rug 9 x 12 | $135.00 |\n\nTotal: $916.00\n\nLess 10%: $91.60\n\n$824.40\n\nRefrigerator (Philco) same firm-nodiscount- | $295.00 |\nWashing machine (Connor) \" \" \" \" | $169.00 |\nElectric toaster \" \" \" \" | $7.00 |\n\nN.B. The above three items can be secured from the firm of Thompson & Sutherland of Sydney at about the following prices:\nRefrigerator --- $250.00 (Westinghouse)\nElectric washing machine $137.50 (Beatty)\nElectric toaster $4-$6.00\n\nThese figures are only approximate but we can secure a very substantial discount and would be about those quoted.\n\nIn addition the following items should be procured for the protection of floors, stairs etc.\n\n| Item Description | Price | Supplier |\n|------------------|-------|----------|\n| Kitchen table | $7.00 | Chappell's Limited Sydney |\n| Stair treads | $4.50 | \" \" |\n| Radiator covers | $26.25 | \" \" |\n| Stove pipe | $1.60 | Thompson & Sutherland \" |\n| Fireplace grate | $9.00 | \" \" |\n| Fire-place screen | $14.50 | C.

Co., Ltd. | \" \" |\nAn additional ten or fifteen dollars would be needed to pick up and equip the kitchen, bathroom, etc., with small accessories such as towel racks, shower curtain, etc.\n\nThe list appears to be fairly complete with the exception of silverware. A service of eight-Community Plate can be had from Bezanson's Jewellery store for $55.44 (tax included).\n\nYou will note that curtains, living room drapes, blinds etc. are not included in this list. At present prices for these materials I do not think the house could be equipped for less than one hundred dollars. We spoke to the Secretary of the Y.M.C.A. war services in Sydney for some bargains in drapes (used) which may still be very serviceable. I cannot reliably quote prices on curtain materials but if a cash allowance was made we could secure advice and help and get it over with with a minimum of delay and inconvenience.\n\nBecause of the shortage of all these goods the merchant could not guarantee delivery unless word was received back as soon as possible. I am confident these are the best prices locally. At your earliest convenience would you advise of the Department's decision in this matter?\n\nF. S.

Bonnell, Sydney, N.S. for the residence of Rev.A.A.Ross, School Principal, Eskasoni, I regret to state that on account of a stenographical error in my letter of March 23, the price of $185.00 should have been $285.00.\n\nKindly bring this matter to the attention of the Purchasing Agent and forward authority for the balance of $100.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.B. McKinnon,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 3, 1946.\n\nMr. F. B. McKinnon, Indian Agent,\nEskasoni Chapel, C.B., N.S.\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to Purchase Order No. 9742.\n\nBefore referring the purchase of a refrigerator to the Purchasing Branch, I desire to direct your attention to the following:\n\n1. You stated that you had a firm quotation on a Philco refrigerator from D. J. Bonnell, at a price of $295.00 and that an approximate price of $250.00 for a refrigerator had been secured from Thompson & Sutherland. In this connection I would refer you to the second paragraph of my letter of March 15. In your letter of March 22 you stated that you could secure a smaller size refrigerator than the one previously requested, at a price of $185.00 (see second paragraph of your letter of March 22).\n\nAll the above information has been supplied to the Purchasing Branch and, as a result, Purchase Order No. 9742 was issued.\n\n2. You now state that the refrigerator is quoted at $285.00 and presumably it is the smaller sized one. You will note that there is considerable difference between this information and that previously supplied, and before submitting the matter to the Purchasing Agent, I will have to have very detailed information regarding size and make of the refrigerator to which you refer in your letter of April 29.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't. of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nYour letter May 3, file # 50-1-8.\n\nI regret very much that my preceding letters on the subject of a refrigerator for the principal's residence caused yourself and the purchasing agent unnecessary inconvenience.\n\nWhen I first approached these merchants for a quotation, Bonnell's Ltd. were able to both quote and supply refrigerators. The only model they had at the time was one with a 7.1 cu. ft. capacity @ $295.00. Thompson & Sutherland who handle General Electric could neither quote a price definitely nor supply one. He gave an approximate price of $250.00.\n\nOn March 22nd I advised that Bonnell's Ltd. had a smaller size unit which they would sell at $285.00. (Here I must acknowledge that the price, through a stenographic error was quoted at $185.00 which is an impossible one for that make of machine).\n\nIn brief the quotation now is $285.00 for a Philco refrigerator to be supplied by the firm of D. J. Bonnell's Ltd. of Sydney, N.S. The cubic capacity of this machine is in the vicinity of 6.8.\n\nThe firm of Thompson & Sutherland are unable to supply any machines at present and I would appreciate as early attention to this matter as possible because of the extreme shortage of any make.\n\nF. B. McKinnon,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 14, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT.\n\nRe: Purchase Order No. 9742.\n\nIn connection with the above, I attach, for your information, a letter from Indian Agent McKinnon, dated April 29, my reply dated May 3, and his last letter dated May 8. As refrigerators are difficult to obtain at the present time and it appears from the agent's letter that one can be secured at $285.00 from D. J. Bonnell, Limited, Sydney, N.S., it would be appreciated if you would amend the purchase order to permit the purchase of the refrigerator just mentioned.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\nOttawa, May 21st, 1946.\n\nMr. F.

R. Jones\nPlumbing & Heating,\nPrince St., SYDNEY, N.S.\n\nDear Mr. Jones:\n\nRe: Relocation of sewers,\nPrincipal's Residence,\nEskasoni Indian Reserve.\n\nYou will no doubt recall our several discussions of the sewage disposal method in the above noted residence, and the necessity of immediate alterations. These alterations consist of:\n\n(1) Relocation of drain pipe from wash basin in the first floor bedroom to the floor drain instead of the septic tank as at present,\n\n(2) Relocation of drain pipe from basement laundry tubs to floor drain instead of the septic tank as at present.\n\n(3) Relocation of stacks serving both bathrooms in such a manner that:\n\n(a) The first stack, serving the kitchen sink and bathroom over the kitchen, shall leave the basement wall at an elevation allowing sufficient slope towards the septic tank.\n\n(b) The second stack serving the other bathroom shall be broken at the elbow directly beneath the first floor joists and proceed to the wall at right angles, and, at highest elevation possible, tying into the first stack.\n\nYour quotation of one hundred dollars ($100.00) to do this work has been accepted and I will be pleased to have your account made out in triplicate to: The Indian Affairs Branch, Dep't. of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA, upon satisfactory completion of the work outlined above.\n\nIt is understood that all necessary breaking and replacing of floor and wall concrete, excavation and carpentry work, both inside and outside of the building, shall be the responsibility of The Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nH.S. McKinnon,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't. of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nAs you are probably aware the inlet of the septic tank serving the principal's residence was placed fifteen inches higher than the soil pipe leaving the building. This situation was unsatisfactory and had to be corrected.\n\nApparently the contractor was absolved of responsibility and Mr. Buck and Mr. Morris advised me to have the situation remedied. There were two ways of doing it.\n\n(1) Leave the stack go out the building the way it was installed, dig up the septic tank, the pipe to it and the disposal bed behind it, and lower them all at least fifteen inches. If the laundry drain was to go in the septic tank it would have to be done this way.\n\n(2) Take the laundry drain and the drain from a first floor wash basin, run them into the floor drain, and cut both stacks from the bathrooms and have them go out the wall at a proper height and change the line from the wall to the septic tank to correspond to the new elevation.\n\nFollowing a series of discussions with the plumbers, Mr. Morris, the Engineer, the Contractors etc we decided the latter course was the most economical and possibly the best. With Mr. Morris's consent I have authorized H. R. Jones, the plumber who did, and is doing, all the plumbing & hot-water heating here, to make the necessary alterations at a cost of $100.00. I am attaching a copy of my letter to him.\n\nI trust this action is satisfactory. As it stands now I will have to put a partition in the cellar, otherwise there would be a sewer pipe across his cellar at about head level. This will not be costly. Any further details could be had from Mr. Morris who is very familiar with the situation.\n\nF. B. McKinnon, Agt.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nFor The Information Of Mr. Morris\n\nI understand from Mr. Chappel that he has received written instructions from S. O. Roberts, Engineer to do nothing whatsoever re the opening of the wall under the Oratory and the enclosures of the school basement entrances, until advised by the Engineering Branch.\n\nMr. Chappel has a sketch prepared and I understand he is sending you a copy of the Engineer's letter.\n\nP.

S.\n\nRE: Teacher's Residence, Eskasoni\n\nDear Sir:\n\nTo the above noted Residence there is a 6' 6\" x 13' 2\u00bd\" projection on the north elevation, called on the plan, an oratory. This has a full basement beneath it and is shown on the plan as un-excavated. The main wall is carried through with a 15\" x 2\u00bd\" vent to the basement about the middle of the projection.\n\nWhile excavating in the main cellar your men uncovered a old well which necessitated the full excavation under the oratory. Because the main wall carries through there is now an area 6\u00bd' x 13' 2\u00bd\" and 7' high being lost to use. In my opinion this is an excellent place which could make into cold room for the storage of potatoes and vegetables.\n\nAs stated previously there is a opening 15\" in height and 2\u00bd' wide about the middle of the main wall as a vent to the basement with a compressor the concrete beneath could be cut down to floor level giving space for a 2' 4\" x 6' door. This room could be vented through the joist taking adequate protection against entry vermin. There should also be concrete floor put here according to existing floor specifications.\n\nWill you please consider this letter as your authorization to perform the work outlined above and charge for same either in the method now being used or by separate account forwarded to the Agent's Office.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

Bonnell Ltd. and my latest effort netted me the definite assurance that this order would be filled early in 1947, possibly this month.\n\nThis firm has had several deliveries on refrigerator but to take any of them which were 30 ins. wide would have necessitated some work remodelling the kitchen cabinet or finish as the space allotted for a refrigerator was only 28 ins. I was unwilling to do this unless absolutely necessary. However on their promise I expect to have the purchase order completed in the near future, definitely before March 31st.\n\nP. B.

Roberts, Engineer, concerning the above mentioned pipes which strike one in the face while descending the steps to the cellar and his promise to move at least one of the pipes.\n\nI have taken the matter up with him and could get no assurance that it would be done. The contractor now advises that they were instructed not to do it. I asked their General Superintendent if it could be done without impairing in any way the efficiency of the heating or interfering with present structure. His answer was that the offending pipe could and should be moved but that he would not recommend, or, at least could understand, why they would be unwilling to move the both of them. The second pipe, being further away, and a person descending would be correspondingly lower, would be alright unless one was over six feet tall but as you will recall, the first pipe is so low that an individual over five foot two or three inches will get a rap in the face. This seems very silly that an order would be given by an engineer not to have a small matter like this adjusted while the men and equipment were on the spot but it was done. This action is characteristic of his attitude ever since his arrival here.\n\nI believe if the matter was brought to the attention of Mr. Mills or Mr. Buck it would shortly be attended to.

January 11, 1947.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't. of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI wish to inquire what procedure will be followed in furnishing the teachers' residence which is nearing completion on the Eskasoni Indian Agency? Although it is more than probable that the building will not be occupied before September of this year I would like to make a start and get some of the groundwork done before it is too late. The building is now ready for the painters and when that is done it lacks only water, and of course, heat. I feel that now is the time to line up most of the furniture etc.\n\nWhen furnishing the Principal's residence I drew up a list of the articles necessary and was instructed to take delivery following your issuance of a purchase order. If this is the policy to be followed, and since it was accomplished to the satisfaction of all concerned, with a minimum of time, I will endeavour to prepare a list of essential household effects for this building. To do this I will likely have to see the Mother General again and before doing that I would like to be definite on the articles that the Department will not furnish in teachers' houses. If there is a ruling that the Department will not supply curtains, blankets, bed linens, etc to teachers, even a community such as is proposed for here, then I would like to know definitely one way or another so that I could advise the Mother General accordingly.\n\nP. B. McKinnon,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 14 January 1947.\n\nMr. F.B. McKinnon, Indian Agent,\nESKASONI CHAPEL, C.B., N.S.\n\nWe have your letter of the 11th instant with reference to furnishing the teachers' residence at the Eskasoni school. At the present time we are not certain if we will have funds available in the appropriation for the current fiscal year to purchase the furniture required and as a result it may be necessary to defer the purchasing until after Apr. 1.\n\nHowever, you may obtain a list of the furnishings which you consider are required. You should list each room separately. If you can secure prices locally, you may do so and submit same for our consideration. No firm should be promised the business as all quotations have to be considered by our Purchasing Branch.\n\nThe Department does not supply blankets, bed linen or table linen of any kind. While we want the teachers to be comfortable, it is not our intention to furnish the building in an extravagant manner.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, February 12th, 1947.\n\nMr. F.B.

These heaters, totalling 6,000 watts, will be connected to the meter at straight rates, and I firmly believe that they will cost the Department at least $80 or $90 dollars a month, which I consider excessive for the services obtained. Electric ranges are not practical out here as we have no way of communicating with the Power Co. when service is disrupted, and it is possible to be without current for long periods of time.\n\nIt is my opinion that neither of these buildings require the hot water capacity given them, but in any event, these tanks could be heated as well by jacket-heaters. As you know, these buildings both will be serviced by the janitor, and he could care for jacket-heaters as well as the furnaces.\n\nF. B.

We are extremely concerned with the statement made in the Agent's letter to the effect that the operating cost of the heaters that are being installed will be from $80. to $90. a month.\n\nWould it not be possible to make a change in the proposed water heating installation and follow the suggestion made by the Indian Agent in the last paragraph of his letter.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would give this matter your immediate consideration and advise me.\n\nPP/MGD\n\nDirector\nOttawa, April 30th, 1947.\n\nMr. F.B.

April 10th, 1947.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't. of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nRe Teachers' Residence and Day School, Eskasoni Agency.\n\nAt my request the Mother General of the teaching order (St. Martha's) who will be in Eskasoni has prepared a list of residence and Domestic Science classes requirements. They are enclosed herewith showing thereon, in some instances, pencilled notations which are mine. Will you please scan these requirements and if all are acceptable to your office, please advise, returning the lists, and I will go to work on securing prices of a competitive nature from local firms.\n\nHere I wish to say that when securing the furniture of the Principal's Residence I was allowed to get prices locally and upon your approval take delivery almost immediately. This resulted in a maximum of satisfaction and a minimum of trouble for all concerned. The purchasing authorities of the Dep't. of National Health & Welfare, Indian Health Services didn't allow this method when equipping the Nursing Station and are shipping direct. The result is that shipment is being made in dribs and drabs, the Agency truck is hauling stuff from the railway station 15 miles away that one could take in a wheel barrow. We are continually checking short shipments, part shipments, invoices, etc. and although the requisition was forwarded in November of 1946 and the nurse has occupied her quarters for two weeks she still hasn't a table to eat from. When they were unable to get several articles, I was authorized to procure same locally which I did almost immediately with the exception of a refrigerator which appears to be lost in transit. In view of the fact that we are very busy at all times and the truck as well, I trust it will be possible to follow the same method used when furnishing the Principal's Residence.\n\nF. B.

Eskasoni Indian Reserve in the Province of Nova Scotia. There will be a staff of four Sisters and there will be two housekeepers.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only. The expenditure required by this requisition is strictly unavoidable and the public interest will suffer if it is not made.\n\nSIGNED\n\nAPPROVED\n\nDirect...\nMr. Hoey\n\nFor your information, please.\n\nMr. Mills' views concurred in that no change should be made in the plan of heating domestic hot water by electricity.\n\nApril 28, 1947.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Eskasoni Teacher's Residence, and Day Schools.\n\nIn connection with Mr. Hoey's memorandum of April 22nd, 1947, and your notation thereon of the 26th instant, together with attached copy of Indian Agent McKinnon's letter, referring to the above, you are advised as follows:\n\nAn analysis of the hot water demand in the Teacher's Residence shows that the maximum demand should not exceed 75 gallons per day and that the normal requirement will be less.\n\nOn the basis of rates supplied to us by the Indian Affairs Branch, we have calculated that the maximum cost per month for the Teacher's Residence (assuming that 75 gallons of hot water per day is used) would amount to $18.68. A fair assumption of the average monthly cost would be about $15.00. Since the hot water demand in the School should be considerably less than the Teachers' Residence, we feel that an outside figure of $10.00 per month would cover the cost, or, an average of about $25.00 per month for both buildings.\n\nIt is pointed out that both tanks are equipped with aqua-statics, and the current is automatically cut-off when the tanks are heated to the correct temperature which, in addition to saving current, protects against overheated water, thereby preventing an undue formation of rust and scale in the tanks and distribution piping.\n\nJacket heaters could have been used at some saving in fuel, but it would be difficult to ensure that water temperature will be kept below the temperature required for protection against scale and rust. In any average period, it is felt that the saving effected by the use of coal would be of little importance.\n\nThe comments herein of course are based on the assumption that the school teachers will co-operate in keeping faucets closed when not being used in both buildings, and that hot water is not wasted.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nMAY 8, 1947\n\nJ.M.

Cost should be kept as low as possible.\n\nThe other items requested are being submitted to our Purchasing Branch.\n\nBernard F.

The furniture, therefore, would be required immediately. I should be pleased if you would communicate with the office of the Purchasing Agent and request that they have the furniture shipped immediately. If they are having difficulty in purchasing any of the furniture, then I would suggest that they be requested to give Mr. McKinnon authority to purchase it locally. Mr. McKinnon suggested in his letter of April 10 that he be authorized to purchase the furniture locally, and it is my opinion that the Purchasing Agent has had ample time to secure the furniture and have it delivered by this time. Action, therefore, should be taken immediately.\n\nJ. E. Morris,\nInspector.\nOttawa, August 2nd, 1947.\n\nMr. J.E. Morris,\nc/o F.B.

Mr. McKinnon wishes to substitute better quality beds with spring-filled mattresses costing $52.00 per unit.\n\nWhile this price is higher than we usually pay for bedding equipment for other teachers' residences, the Acting Deputy Minister has approved of the substitution, but he did not approve of Mr. McKinnon's purchase of the stove, refrigerator, and washing machine, which duplicate items 12, 13 and 18 of above order.\n\nVoucher #850 and invoice of the 17th ultimo from Fred Pierce Ltd., Sydney, N.S., are returned herewith.\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nWMV/HC\nOttawa, August 15th, 1947.\n\nMr. F.B.

I do not know whether it is the policy of the Department to furnish these curtains or not, but I wish to advise that there are 31 windows. To purchase curtains for these would cost in the vicinity of $175.00. Would you give me a ruling as to whether the supplying of these curtains is the responsibility of the Department, and if so, could I make local purchases of curtains or curtain material to the value of $175.00. I ask for local purchase because it is highly improbable that we will be able to secure all the material in any one store without serious delay.\n\nF. B.

Before a caretaker was appointed the principal, Rev. Fr. Ross, had considerable difficulty in keeping a fire in this type of heater with soft coal. (Hard coal is not available). It caused so much trouble that at his own expense he installed an electric hot water heater. This apparently is very hard on electricity and his light bill for the past several months has been quite unusual.\n\nIn my residence and in the clerk's as well our water is heated by hot water fronts in our kitchen ranges. This is the method employed in most houses and is entirely satisfactory. It is not possible at Fr. Ross' as his Domestic tank is located in the basement. As his hot water situation is still unsatisfactory and could be remedied by placing the Domestic tank behind the kitchen range and heating it by a coil in the oil range, Rev. Fr. Ross is quite prepared to pay for this change over himself, and I am asking your permission for him to go ahead.\n\nFr. B.

Fr. Ross, school Principal, to disconnect his Domestic boiler in the basement and place it behind the kitchen range heating it with a coil installed in the oil range. I would like to point out that in this case, at least, I think his request is justified. We have both tried to make the jacket heater work satisfactorily, but no luck. In addition we have the bother of kindling and coal which would be eliminated entirely if he were allowed to heat it from the kitchen range. Besides being more practical from his point of view, I believe it is also more economical from our point of view.\n\nAs stated before, he realizes that the excessive light bill is caused by the electric heater, and he is prepared to remove it and have the boiler change over done by a competent plumber at his own expense.\n\nI would recommend that permission be granted.\n\nF.

McKinnon, Indian Agent,\nEskasoni, N.S.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th ultimo, the Department approves placing the domestic water tanks in the principal's residence at the Eskasoni School behind the kitchen range and heating it by a coil in the oil range.\n\nIt is understood that necessary work will be done by a competent plumber at the expense of the principal.\n\nBernard F.

When I asked for armchairs I meant the type that usually go with a three-piece Chesterfield suite. (I did not want the Chesterfield,\u2014just the chairs). The quotation did not go through this office, so it was not until the articles were inspected and delivered that I saw that the armchairs quoted on were insignificant little pieces costing $5.00 each.\n\nConsequently, I would like your authorization to purchase the following:\n\n| Item                          | Quantity | Price   |\n|-------------------------------|----------|---------|\n| Large stuffed armchairs       | 2        | $55.00  |\n| Trilight lamp, complete       | 1        | $31.50  |\n| Rubber mats (large)           | 5        | $4.00   |\n| Hall Rug 4 x 7                | 1        | $20.00  |\n\nI might add that the teachers are exceptionally well pleased with their dwelling and all the equipment and are determined to see that their efforts at Eskasoni will more than repay the Department for its consideration. Although here only a little over a month, we have in formation a Men's Choir, Children's Choir, Glee Club and a Homemakers' Club. Other tangible results from their presence at Eskasoni, I am sure, will follow steadily.\n\n(All articles quoted on by Bonnelis, Ltd., of Sydney Mines, N.S., as mentioned in your letter).\n\nF. B.

Herefore, there was a 92 Imperial gallon boiler in the cellar, heated electrically by two immersion heaters, totalling 3000 watts. The bills, as you know, were excessive, and Mr. Morris, Inspector of Indian Agencies, advised that it be changed over to a more economical system. This was done by following the same procedure as used in all the other residences, that is; inserting a coil in the kitchen range. It is working satisfactorily, and the teachers now have hotter water and sufficient for their needs.\n\nThe second charge for repairs to the heating system in the R. C. M. P. residence was necessitated by the fact that one night during the past winter the Constable, on duty in Sydney, was unable to get home because of road conditions. A severe frost cracked two radiators in the cell room. The cell room is small and when the heat was on, it was found to be, if anything, too hot. I thought it better to replace the larger radiator only, which provides ample heat under all conditions. I trust that this is satisfactory.\n\nThe third charge was for repairs to the water line servicing the garage, which broke, for some unaccountable reason, underground.\n\nF. B. McKinnon,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nJune 17, 1948.\n\nMr. F.B. McKinnon, Supt. of Indian Agency,\nEskasoni, N.S.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant, we find it necessary to return your voucher No. 70+. This voucher includes charges for teacher's residence, R.C.M.P. residence and the garage. The Education Division is now situated in a separate building from the other divisions of the Department and it is simply impossible for us to handle accounts promptly and efficiently unless you only forward a voucher covering services to school buildings and teachers' residences. Consequently, you should forward us a separate voucher for $39.48, the amount required for altering the domestic hot water system in the teacher's residence. A separate voucher should be issued for the other expenditures.\n\nBernard F.

You may, however, spend an amount not exceeding $10.00 in the purchase of knitting and sewing material. With this amount of material the teacher should be able to give the girls some useful training.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. A. R.

You should have the account on the letterhead of the firm from whom the goods were purchased. Moreover the account should be receipted in order to permit our paying the amount due Miss MacMillan. If she has not paid the account the voucher should be issued in favour of the firm who supplied the goods.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hov,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. A. R.

Eaton Company for the Eskasoni Indian day school.\n\nYour voucher is issued in favour of the teacher, Miss Jessie MacMillan, but the account from the T. Eaton Company is not receipted and consequently the cheque covering the cost of the goods cannot be issued to the teacher. If she has not paid the account you should issue the voucher in favour of the T. Eaton Company. If she has paid the account you should have it receipted and attached to the voucher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. A. R. McDonald,\nIndian Agent,\nChristmas Island, N. S.\nDear Sir,\n\nBeing teaching sewing and knitting to pupils in the Indian Day School here I should like to know if the school is entitled to the grant which is paid by the Department of Education for work done in Household Science.\n\nI hold a Second Class High School Certificate (Licence) and a Trade Scholarship. I have taught knitting and sewing to the children for one hour every Friday afternoon since I began teaching in this school (September, 1937).\n\nAll the boys and girls over nine years of age have been taught to knit such articles as caps, scarves, gloves, mittens, and stockings. They have knit twenty-two dollars worth of yarn so far.\n\nThe girls have sewn ten dollars worth of material besides sewing materials which they have brought from their homes.\nThey have learned to do patching,\nand also to sew and cut articles such\nas aprons, sewing-bags, holders, blouses\nand slips.\n\nThe Local Indian Agent, the Inspector\nof Schools, and the Sewing Teacher of this\nProvince have seen all the work of\nthe children, and they approve of it.\nPlease let me know at your earliest\nconvenience if this grant shall be paid\nfor this extra work, so that I shall\ncontinue this work which the pupils\nfind very interesting and which is\nvery, very beneficial to their welfare\nin years to come as well as at present.\nI also serve a hot lunch to the pupils\nfor three months each winter.\n\nThanking you in anticipation\nof receiving an early and favorable\nreply,\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJessie MacMillan\nOttawa, February 7, 1939.\n\nDear Miss MacMillan:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the first instant and to state by way of comment that it is very gratifying to learn of the attempts you have made to promote vocational instruction at your school.\n\nThe Minister of the Department is particularly interested in this phase of educational effort and is constantly reminding us that the courses provided at Indian schools should be practical and vocational in character.\n\nI have no knowledge whatever of the grant to which you refer in your communication. If you have in mind a provincial grant, your school of course is not eligible. The cost of operating Indian day and residential schools is borne wholly by the Dominion Government.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A.

I have in mind children whose I.Q. is not very high and boys of 14, 15 and 16 who are doing grade five or six work. We have an average number of this type and I think they could well employ their time by doing Manual Training work.\n\nI would like to inquire if any action has been taken on my Manual Training requisition forwarded to your office on July 5th, 1947. Although we are not prepared right now for a full-time Manual Training teacher, yet our present teachers are capable of at least directing the energy of some of our students into that type of work. I would like to be advised when I may expect some of the equipment ordered so that a start might be made in a small way. I would also like to know if it is the intention of Mr. Doucet to come down this fall to look over the situation with regard to this type of teaching in the two large day schools in Nova Scotia.\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

I may say that I have these two schools on my list of new openings and have tried to secure men qualified for the positions. At present we are short four licensed shop teachers and will be obliged to close some of the existing shops at the beginning of the next school year.\n\nI shall contact the Indian Agents at Eskasoni and Shubenacadie and endeavour to recruit two prospective trainees and have them take the teacher training course so that these schools may get underway at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.

Please let me know the proportion that will be used by them as the cost of it will have to be paid from the Welfare Appropriation.\n\nAccording to the June enrolment at the Eskasoni school it appears that there are approximately 28 children from Grade V up.

November 1, 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't. of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI attach hereto a letter received from our Domestic Science teacher, Mrs. Margaret MacDougall, relative to her needs for that part of the school basement allotted for the teaching of household economics. I quite agree with Mrs. MacDougall in that the room is rather drab and uninspiring and should be equipped with some of the requisites for the successful teaching of household economics.\n\nI have asked Miss Ruth Binnie, who is the Supervisor of Home Economics for the province of Nova Scotia to come down and give me her recommendations. We were also favoured with an unexpected visit form Miss Sackville of the Department of National Health & Welfare, Nutrition Division, and the minimum recommendations of both ladies are embodied in Mrs. MacDougall's letter.\n\nMrs. MacDougall is doing an excellent job and is now engaged, along with her other work, in visiting the home environment of her pupils in order to better acquaint herself with the immediate needs of those of her pupils who will shortly be leaving formal instruction.\n\nIn order that you may have some idea of the cost involved I wish to advise that:\n\n- The floor covering will cost approx. $400.00\n- The tables approx. 75.00 ea\n- Painting room (paint & labor) 100.00\n- Refrigerator approx. 325.00\n- Sewing machine approx. 60.00\n\nA very rough sketch of the room was provided by Mrs. MacDougall but more accurate information could be gleaned from the blueprints of this building which must be\nmust be.....\n\navailable to you. You will notice that the sink is about fifteen feet from the stove and the hand basin is 28 ft. from the same. I am not prepared to recommend any structural changes but do feel that the minimum of equipment and furnishings as asked for in the attached letter, if provided, would bring our Home Economics Dept't. somewhat more in line with present Provincial standards.\n\nI am prepared to procure any authorized equipment or furnishings, for this classroom. Will you kindly advise of your decision in this matter?\n\nP. B. McKinnon,\nSup't. Indian Agency.\nEskasoni, N.S.\n26, October, 1948.\n\nMr. F. B. MacKinnon,\nSuperintendent, Indian Affairs,\nEskasoni, N.S.\n\nDear Mr. MacKinnon,\n\nHaving completed six weeks of teaching in the Home Economics department of your school, I feel that I am now in a position to make some recommendations to improve the classroom. This I feel is absolutely necessary in order to give a practical as well as satisfactory course to the students.\n\nFirst, we need covering for the floor. At present it is a drab grey concrete. May I suggest marboleum of pleasing design and colour.\n\nWe need six work tables to include drawer space for equipment. I should like to add here that built-in cupboards, with a working surface included in each unit, would be the ideal set-up. However, unfortunately, the walls are of concrete, and therefore, I believe that this plan would be very difficult, if not impossible to accomplish.\n\nAt present the walls are done in a brown and straw colour arrangement....very uninteresting. I feel that we should have a cheerful colour scheme that would be more in keeping with the home kitchen, which we aim to make our room represent.\n\nA frigidaire is also a necessity. It would eliminate spoilage of food which must be carried over from day to day.\n\nLastly, we need another sewing machine. Our classes average ten pupils, and I find that one machine is inadequate.\n\nI am enclosing a plan of our room as it appears at present. It is quite obvious that changes should be made with regard to location of sinks, etc. Accordingly, I should be glad to receive suggestions for same.\n\nRecently, I have had the pleasure of having Miss Helen Sackville, Nutritionist, Department of National Health and Welfare, visit me in my Department. This gave me an opportunity of discussing our set-up with her. I am pleased to say that Miss Sackville thoroughly agreed with the recommendations which I am presenting to you, and, she feels as I do, that satisfactory results can not be achieved without adequate equipment and cheerful environment. I have also had Miss Ruth Binnie, Supervisor of Home Economics, Department of Education, Halifax, spend some time with me, and in her opinion it is very necessary that we make the change as suggested, in order that the teaching of Home Economics be a success.\n\nYour advice on this matter would be greatly appreciated,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n(Mrs.) Margaret M. MacDougall.\nClasses held in this room average ten pupils.\n\nTEMPORARY STAGE FOR DRAMATICS\n\n28'0\"\nNovember 19, 1948.\n\nMr. F.B. McKinnon,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nEskasoni, N.S.,\n\nWe have your letter of the 1st instant with reference to teaching domestic science at the Eskasoni School.\n\nAt the present time, we are not prepared to authorize the expenditure mentioned in your letter but Mr. Phelan expects to visit your agency during the week of December 6 and he will discuss the matter with you at that time.\n\nAccording to the plan that we have in this office the hand basin is not in the position designated by the plan. It would appear that in constructing the school our plan was not followed.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nPP/HH.\nIn reply to your letter, 50-1-11 (E.1) of July 26th, 1948, having reference to my requisition for yarn, I wish to advise that the Garment Club referred to is in no way connected with the adult women of this agency. It is a Club sponsored by the Provincial Department of Agriculture for the encouragement of club work among girls of school age. Its chief purpose is to teach the art of making their own clothing and the yarn requisitioned for amounting to $59.40 was to enable the children to make their own mitts, scarves and sweaters, as was done last year.\n\nWith reference to my requisition amounting to $203.86, this was made chiefly for the purpose of weaving by the school children. I have asked Miss Moodie for more of her surplus looms and was desirous of having a large number of our school girls learn to weave. If Miss Moodie can find additional looms to send here, I believe the requisition is not too high. If she cannot, this requisition could be reduced by one-third.\n\nThe reference I made to the possibility of some adults using this yarn is conditional upon my ability to interest a few of the members of the Homemakers' Club in the art of weaving. I do not think that the amount they would use would be very great, and since there is only a possibility of their using any of it, I would prefer not to attempt any division. If the Homemakers' Club uses any of it, a record will be kept and I will ask Welfare or the Homemakers themselves to replace the amount used.\n\nWith reference to your last paragraph noting that there are only 28 children from Grade Five up, please be advised that every girl in Grade Three and upwards did knitting last year. It should be remembered that although their scholastic attainments are not high, the majority of\nof girls in grade three and four are older in years than the grades indicate.\n\nI might point out that three of our girls left Grade six to marry during the past term and one in Grade four had to leave school before Christmas because of being pregnant.\n\nF. B. McKinnon,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency.\nNovember 24, 1948.\n\nMr. F.B. McKinnon,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nEskasoni, N.S.\n\nI regret that your letter of August 11th has been mislaid and has only been brought to my attention recently.\n\nWhen I visit the school during the week of December 5th we will discuss the contents of your letter more fully.\n\nWe have no similar programme on any other reserve to the one you mention.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Education Division.\n\nPP/MGD\nTHE T.

S., I wish to advise as follows:\n\nIn discussing this request with Mr. Yeary I advised that the yarn cost $1.05 per pound. This price was for a coarse yarn which the Domestic Science Teacher found was not suitable for her particular project. Our girls belong to a Provincial Garment Club and their year's work will be entered in Provincial Competition. The project this year is a skirt, sweater and blouse, -- the yarn I quoted on was too heavy and too coarse for this work. Our girls are weaving their own skirt material from this yarn, making it into skirts, knitting their own sweaters and making their own blouses.\n\nWhen I realized the difference in the price of the yarn I reduced their requirements to an absolute minimum of 36 pounds, and at that, the total cost was $23.00 over the authority given. Under these circumstances I trust this will be paid as submitted.\n\nI would like to know if your office is interested in seeing some of the work, when completed, of this nature done by the girls and following the Provincial Exhibition.\n\nF.

One of our teaching sisters attempts considerable with them in all the time at her disposal which is not extensive. She must flit from the manual training room to her classroom and back again. We have several large boys in smaller grades and we have a fair number in our senior room. We attempt to use up all the hardwood salvaged from old school desks etc which of course is slow tedious work for fifteen year old boys. Could your office consider giving me authorization to purchase a \u00bd H.P. motor for $30.00 and a drum sander at a cost of $25.00. This would speed up the preparation of old wood and the dressing up of the finished article and allow us to really attempt something by way of volume. I realize it is not possibly what you have in mind but we have not the sincere type of student who wants to have things perfect. I would like to see our bigger boys make, a book-bench, a table and possibly a desk for his home, and we would like him to make these articles from old organs, desks, etc.\n\nI would also like to purchase a combination plane with which we could make mouldings, etc for our desks, tables etc. I believe this type of plane approx. $40.00 and know that they are difficult to obtain locally. If approval should be given I would be pleased to have your co-operation in ordering one from your usual supply house.\n\nP. B. [Signature]\nSup't. Indian Agency.\nMarch 21, 1949.\n\nMr. F.B.

These invoices arrived at the end of each month or two with all charges of every sort on them. I usually sent them back with a breakdown indicated as chargeable to a specified vote but I just didn't seem to get it done the last number of months.\n\nThey are all 1948-49 purchases and have been purchased over a period of 12 months. The purchase of cement for the rink was unauthorized. That is voucher No 559 amounting to $65.00. If there is no funds available to pay this please return and I will get the boys to put on a social as it was bought with that understanding. We were able to put up a very fine rink, 80 x 180, cedar and hemlock posts and light poles set in cement and the boys did a lot of work during a bad season with little financial help.\n\nThese, I believe, are practically all of 1948-49 vouchers from this agency, with one known O/S account from T.Eatons which was returned for correction. Henceforth all accounts from this merchant will be submitted at time of purchase, not at the month end.\n\nF.J. McKinnon\nR.S.

Of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nAttention: Education Division.\n\nFor the past two years the Domestic Science Department, has been using a few army type, folding tables. These were purchased from the War Assets Corporation, by Welfare, and because of their instability etc., were not satisfactory.\n\nOur Domestic Science Teacher would like to have a large work table, with drawers, and storage space for teaching equipment. This table should be large enough to accommodate ten pupils, with a working space two-feet-square for each child. She also would like to have, two long tables with drawers, for garment making, commonly called \"cutting tables\".\n\nWith our lumber and equipment, we are able to make these tables at Eskasoni. Although, our work-men are not skilled in cabinet making, I feel that they are quite capable, by proceeding slowly, in doing this work in a satisfactory manner. It would be very useful training for the Indians, and since we have the lumber and machinery, I think we should do it. Because of our inexperience in cabinet-making, and the necessity of proceeding slowly, I estimate that the total costs of three tables will be in the vicinity of $300.00. Will your office forward the Eskasoni Indian Agency Trust Account, an accountable advance of $300.00, (Three Hundred dollars), with which to pay labours, in the construction of the tables referred to.\nAlthough this might appear large, I would like to bring to your attention, that the making of drawers and doors, installing of pulis and hinges, in a manner suited for classroom, is rather tedious and exacting work.\n\nThe tables will be very well constructed, mortised and glued, and chiefly of hardwood. These tables should be covered with marboleum, at an estimated cost of $40.00.\n\nP. B. McKinnon,\nRegional Supervisor,\nIndian Agencies.\n\nFBM/rmd.\nNovember 2, 1949.\n\nMr. F.B.

The school house built by the Dept. over eighteen years ago is in fair condition. It has been kept in repair by the Indians using it for church purposes. It needs shingling, repairs about the windows and general renovation inside. It has no floor and no stove. Neither was it any school furniture such as seats and desks. It would require also a small shed under lock and key for wood & coal.\n\nThe amount required for the above repairs and furniture grows be somewhere in the vicinity of two hundred dollars.

McLEAN\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. S. McDonald,\nIndian Agent,\nPoveshell,\nNova Scotia.\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th Oct. No. 9099\u00bd. I learn that my letter in reference to an arrangement with Mr. Comely to take charge of the School for the Indians at Indian Cove was misunderstood. I did not state in that letter that the arrangement was final. The arrangement was understood to be conditional, namely, that if the Dept. should leave with me the choice of teacher, she would have the school. She holds a Provincial license to teach, and is considered very suitable for that school.\n\nWith your permission then I will install her into the said school without any delay. I will assure you of observance of the instructions contained in your letter above referred to.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRodrick Macdonald\nAgent\nPictou County\nExd.\n\nOttawa, 24th October, 1896.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, in regard to the engagement of Miss Connelly as teacher of the school at Indian Cove.\n\nI am glad to know that the arrangement was unconditional upon the approval of the Department. As you say she holds a Provincial license, Miss Connelly may be engaged to take charge of the school.\n\nKindly send the certificate to be noted in the Department, after which it will be returned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nG. D. McLean\nSecretary.\n\nRev. R. McDonald,\nIndian Agent,\nEureka, N. B.\nNew Glasgow\nOct. 18th 1905\n\nTo Rev. Patrick Mc Donald P.P.\n\nRespect Sir,\n\nI understand from you that I am required by the Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs to transmit a list of the materials required for the school at Indian Cove. The subjoined list is as close an estimate as I can now make. As you already know I have organized the school; but find myself greatly handicapped for want of proper requisites; depending solely on oral work to awaken the interest of the pupils. The children all seem bright and interested. The number to attend during the winter months will be in the vicinity of forty, with a sure increase for the summer term. With the exception of Sarah five there are all beginners; consequently the work done must be very gradual. Hence, you will see, that in order to make a successful showing there is the greatest need for\nimmediate attention in the matter of the delivery of the requisites, namely:\n\n1. register with ink, pens, eraser, blotter\n2. chalk and erasers for two small boards\n3. materials for fifty children, all of whom are beginners\n4. School-bell, or gong for table\n\nI have not itemized the school material for the children, as I presume the Secretary will know best what is needed.\n\nFurther application can be made for materials for the several more advanced pupils at a later period.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nNelly E. Connolly\nOct 26th 1898\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nSir: I enclose the requisition from the teacher as stated for in your letter of 13th Oct No 9099-1/2. In regard to the first supply sent as mentioned I have no copies from useful those marked in the list contained in your letter of 28th February 1898 No 103864. Hon.\n\nH.

In that letter you asked me to forward you a requisition for the kindergarten supplies I needed. I did so and also a second requisition for the regular school material. I received this latter a long time after I asked for it. Up to date I have heard nothing further about the kindergarten material. Now Mr. McLean, will you please attend to the matter immediately? There is only a short part of the term left and it is the busiest part. I counted on having the material to\nwork with during the winter months. But still I should like to give the children a start in it. We are doing very good work this year, but it might be a great deal better, and you are handicapping us very much by delaying the improvements we need. We need a cupboard in the worst way. It is very discouraging to come in on Monday morning and find the copy-books and drawing-books all upset and marked over. The Indians hold service in the school on Sunday and, of course, there is no control over them. The cupboard would cost from $8 to $9. Nor will you please authorize the agent to have one built right away. When can I hear about the repairs?\nIn letter 227073\u20144 March 1875, you asked for an estimate. That has been sent in some time since and I am patiently waiting for a reply. You see, I cannot keep up the Indians about making their place tidy when the school is out of repair. If I could feel that matters would be improved on for next year, I should like to teach for another year; but if the school and yard are in their present neglected condition I cannot. The three boys are attending the Manual Training School at Picton regularly. One had brought home a model today with a perfect mark. We are very grateful to the Department for this concession.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nWally Comstock\nOTTAWA, 28th April, 1902\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th instant relative to matters in connection with the Big Cove school.\n\nReferring to the kindergarten supplies which you state have not been received I beg to say that the same were ordered through the Government Stationery Office on the 6th March last and that office is being communicated with in regard to the delay.\n\nThe Agent has been authorized to proceed with the repairs which are required for the school building and has also been asked to have a cupboard for the care of supplies built and the yard cleaned.\n\nThe Department would be glad if in future you would be good enough to communicate with it, through the local Agent, Rev.

An increase of salary in the fall makes it cost her \u00a315 over \u00a320 than a term. She has not got much anyway and it will prevent her continuing unless provided. She was better and he says it would be making a precedent. Can you make arrangements to give her an increase? Hasable has been doing the work?\n\nKindly see if you can do so and advise me.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, Dec. 18th, 1906.\n\nDear Mr. MacDonald,\n\nI have your favour of the 17th instant, with enclosed letter re Miss Cassie McDonald, Teacher of the Indian School, Indian Cove, and in reply beg to say that I am now looking into this matter to see what can be done.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE. H. Macdonald, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 22, 1906.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nWith reference to Mr. Macdonald's application for an increase to Miss Cassie McDonald's salary sufficient to cover her railway fare to and from the Indian Cove school to Pictou, I beg to say that Miss McDonald has been teaching this school since August, 1902, and her present salary is $300 a year, being the amount paid the other teachers in the Province of Nova Scotia. It quite true that it is impossible to get suitable lodgings on the reserve and $300 is not a very princely salary from which to pay railway fares; in fact I doubt if we will be able to get any more teachers in the Province at that rate.\n\nIn January, 1904, the Department increased the salary of Miss Jessie Scott, teacher of the Indian school at Millbrook, to enable her to pay her transport from Truro to the reserve; her salary, however, previous to that date was only $250. At that time we communicated with the General Passenger Agent of the Intercolonial at Moncton, who informed the Department that season tickets at considerably reduced fares could be obtained. The Department might authorize Miss McDonald to purchase a six Months' ticket and refund her the cost. This would be better than giving her an increase, as all the other teachers would expect similar treatment if her salary were raised.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Blenner\nOttawa, December 22nd, 1906\n\nDear Miss McDonald,\n\nIt has been represented to me by Mr. E. H. Macdonald, M.P., that owing to the recent increase in rates on the Intercolonial Railway you have been affected detrimentally, from a financial standpoint.

D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Cassie McDonald,\nNew Glasgow,\nN.S.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have read your letter re Miss Macdonald's claim. I understand that Miss Macdonald was paid when she began to teach at the Indian School at Red River Landing. She was not paid for the quarter beginning in September, but the previous quarter was paid for. I am informed she was not reimbursed for it as you propose to pay the present incumbent. Miss Macdonald is now looking at the accounts and will find this to be a fact. Miss Macdonald began to teach in Sept. 1862. She is thus minus a quarter salary which in justice ought to be paid. Miss Macdonald wanted to send in her name for the quarter, but as a matter of equity I thought it best to get the balance paid. I don't want Miss Macdonald to be deprived of what seems to me belongs to her.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nOct. 16, 1907\nOttawa, November 5, 1907.\n\nRev. Sirs,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th ult., stating that Miss Cassie McDonald claims a balance of salary due her for the first quarter in which she had charge of the Indian Cove school, that is, September quarter, 1903.\n\nUpon referring to the record of payments, it is found that for the quarter in question $51.44 was withheld from Miss McDonald's salary, which should have been paid her at the end of the school year, June 30, 1903, but, as she made no claim for this balance at the time, the matter was overlooked.\n\nA cheque, therefore, covering the amount above quoted will be sent you.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D.

MacLeod\nOttawa, January 2, 1913.\n\nMadam,\n\nThe return from the Indian Cove School for the December quarter shows that the school was closed seven days owing to bad weather. The Department desires to have further information respecting the need for closing the school.\n\nIt is noted that this school was closed for a number of days almost every quarter for various reasons, some of which do not appear to be satisfactory. I would call attention to the school regulations, which call for 200 teaching days in the year, and you will be expected to keep the school open for this number of days, unless there are good and sufficient reasons for closing it at any time.\n\nBe good enough to let the Department have the explanation above asked for.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Sir,\n\nThe Department would like to have a report from you as to the irregularity of attendance of the teacher of the Indian Cove School, which, she states, is due to the fact that she has two miles to walk.\n\nThe Department would also like to know if this teacher could not arrange to live on the reserve, either by obtaining board and lodging, if there is a suitable place, or by obtaining lodging accommodation and boarding herself. The school is closed altogether too much for any progress to be made and the Department is anxious to make some other arrangement, if at all possible.

I have tried very hard to get what she needs and she seems satisfied. Thanks.\n\nThere is another matter more personal which I should like you to adjust, and that is my own salary. All the Indian agents in these parts or nearly all get the rate of two hundred dollars $200 per annum, or sixty-five dollars per quarter. I have been getting only one hundred and fifty dollars or thirty-three dollars and eighty cents per quarter. Even the larger amount is small enough. You remarked in your former letter you wanted to treat fairly and justly all the Indians towards myself and in considering the matter you might apply it in a retrospective sense.\n\nHope you will give the matter your favorable attention.\n\nI am to remain\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\nTo Secretary of Indian Affairs Dept., Ottawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs County Nurse I have been visiting the Indian School at Indian Cove, N.B. I find the children in fair condition. I think the children also get as much milk as they need, some of them have been given as little as little as possible. I suppose on the Reserve and in this case it is a long distance from the village, I wonder if something could be allowed to give the children milk in the school.\n\nI noticed in the new regulations the length of time in school was extended to six hours, which is longer than in the other schools, most of the children are young and some of them seem to be able to fall asleep as it is, it would not seem to me that longer hours were desirable.\n\nThere is one crippled child in school suffering from Infantile Paralysis, she is also deaf and her sight is very bad and is getting worse.\n\nThere is also a boy who has a bad wound of the skull, there is still a wound of the eye which obscures his vision, his sight is also affected in one eye, this boy has been under a doctor's care.\n\nThinking it would not be amiss to bring these things to your notice.\n\nOctober 21/12/23\n\nYours Very Sincerely,\n\nH.

Lissner\nquite respectfully\nOttawa, March 21st, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nIt is considered that certain instructions regarding the school at Indian Cove should be given you upon taking up duties as Indian Agent for Pictou County, N.S.\n\nYou should visit this school once each month, if possible, and assist the teacher in any way you can in encouraging a regular attendance of the Indian children of school age who are in good health. You should use your influence with the parents to see that their children attend regularly.\n\nYou should forward all requisitions of the teacher for classroom supplies to the Department. These requisitions should be made out on the forms for that purpose.\n\nThe quarterly returns of attendance should be prepared by the teacher at the end of each quarter, and certified by you, and forwarded to the Department, in order that payment of the teacher's salary can be made. For your information, I may say that Miss Gertrude McGirr, the present teacher, is in receipt of salary at the rate of $75 per month for the ten teaching months in the school year.\n\nA supply of forms used in connection with school activities will be sent you under separate cover, and these you should keep on hand and supply the teacher as she requires them.\n\nWhen, in your opinion, any repairs are required, you should forward a report to the Department, stating definitely the nature of the repairs and the approximate cost of same.\n\nYou should also make requests in due time for the fuel required.\n\nRev. R. C. MacGillivray,\nIndian Agent,\nPictou, N.S.\nNo expenditure in connection with the school, unless of an urgent nature, should be undertaken without first referring the matter to the Department, and receiving approval.\n\nIf there are any outstanding accounts in connection with school activities since the death of the late agent, I shall be pleased if you will obtain itemized accounts, in duplicate, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify and send to the Department, in order that payment can be made. In future all accounts for expenditure in connection with the school should be itemized, and in duplicate, and properly certified by you before being forwarded to the Department for payment.\n\nIt is hoped, as a result of the encouragement which you can give to the parents and the teacher, there will be much progress made in the educational work at the Indian Cove Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nConsiderable attention has been attracted by the work of the Indian School at Pictou Landing. The children, though naturally handicapped by their imperfect knowledge of English, are in a class by themselves where this disadvantage does not exist. This is particularly true of penmanship and drawing. At the recent Pictou County Exhibition and in the Grant Bros. Competition the awards made to this school were altogether out of proportion to its size. In the school competition at the exhibition they won 1st and 2nd place in grades 3 and 4 writing; 1st and 2nd in grades 2 and 3 drawing; 2nd in grades 4 and 5 drawing; 1st in grades 6 and 7 drawing; 1st and 2nd in freehand drawing, and 1st in landscape drawing. Of the four prizes offered by Grant Bros. for penmanship two went to this school. This is exceptionally good when it is considered that these prizes were competed for by the school children of Pictou, Antigonish and Guysboro Counties. The teacher, Miss MacGirl, and her charges are to be congratulated.\n\nThe above was forwarded with request dated Dec 30/18\nDear Sir:\n\nIn connection with your circular letter, File C-150-48, re. SCHOOL YEAR AND HOLIDAYS, I notice that the month of September is to be taken off as a school month.\n\nAt Fisher's Grant Reserve, January is the month where attendance at school is poor. In view of that I am asking permission to have the month of January taken off instead of the month of September. This change would probably reduce somewhat the consumption of fuel for the year and school children might avoid colds and other sickness by not attending school in January.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

We are also enclosing duplicate copies for the information of yourself and the teacher.\n\nIn the case of Miss McGirr, she is being allowed salary at the rate of $510.00 per annum. At the end of September, therefore, she was paid 1/10th of her yearly salary, or, $51.00. At the end of the December, March and June quarters, provided the school is open, Miss McGirr will receive $153.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. D. MacLeod,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Glasgow,\nN. S.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter dated Oct 15th, No. 58-1-34, reference to \"the teacher's salary,\" let me state that during the past year, I found Miss Miss McPhee began teaching in half 1907, she was only paid for the last month her predecessor, Miss Jessie A., got no other two months' salary. Miss McPhee is thus deprived of two months' in the year's salary which at the rate accounts to eighty-five dollars.\n\nAs the salary is small anyway, and as you will observe, she cannot be called to the above, and as it makes for efficiency to have all employees satisfied, I submit the above for your favorable attention.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSept. 1st - June 30th.\nIndian Affairs.\n\nBegin duties, April 1907\n\nSalary: $310\n\nPer annum from 1907-08:\n\nSep. yr. 1907 = $30.53\nOct. yr. 1907 = $77.50\nNov. yr. 1907 = $77.50\nDec. yr. 1907 = $77.50\n\nTotal: $263.03\n\nSalary: $310.03\nand pdl: $263.03\n\nBalance: $46.97\nProvince of Nova Scotia\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTEACHERS' SALARIES\n\nFor Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1923\n\nName of Teacher: [Handwritten]\nName of School: [Handwritten]\nAnnual Grant or Salary: $70.00\nAmount due: $153.00\n\nNo. of school days in quarter:\nNo. days school was open:\nNo. holidays:\nGrant asked for:\n\nRemarks:\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct.\n\n[Signature]\n\nNOTE\u2014The number of school days in the quarter and the number of days for which payment is asked should be stated; payment will only be made for days school was open and authorized holidays.\n\nForm 14.\nOttawa, October 24, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to the claim of Miss Gertrude McGirr, teacher of the Indian Cove Day School, for a balance of salary due her.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department considers that the school year begins on September 1st and ends June 30th. On checking our records we find that Miss McGirr began duties at this school on September 1, 1907, at a salary of $310.00 a year. For the school year, beginning September 1907 and ending June 30, 1908, she should have received, approximately, $46.00 more than she was paid. The matter, however, has stood for such a length of time that the Department regrets that it is impossible to pay this sum now.\n\nEach school year since September 1908, Miss McGirr has been paid her full yearly salary in quarterly instalments. However, the Department is desirous of dealing fairly with this teacher and in order to recompense her for the amount, as stated above, which she did not receive, it has been decided to increase her salary from $510.00 to $550.00 a year. This increase will date from January 1, 1924. It is hoped that this arrangement will prove satisfactory to Miss McGirr.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. J. D.

The repairs were more extensive than I anticipated. Of course it was only a rough estimate that I gave in representing the matter to the Dept. The School House was in the worst condition; the walls resting on the ground, the roof and walls in need of shingling, no porch to the front, nothing done to the inside, and the beams too low. We had the house raised about two feet and placed on a solid stone muck base which took about eight cubic feet of stone. The windows were removed and replaced by new ones and four windows more than before. The posts and floor were so uneven and irregular that it took more time and material than if the building were put up anew. The beams stood about eight feet from the floor, and we had them raised to eleven feet. The wall all around is raised to the height of four feet from the floor. The rest of the walls and ceiling is lathed and plastered. A floor had also to be built and some of the brick in old floor were made use of. A porch six feet square was erected. As I had already overstepped the limits of the amount granted I could not have any more painting done than priming coat & the windows and finishing boards to the roof and corners.\nAlthough it had been mentioned in my instructions contained in letter dated 5th July No. 9089\u00bd not to exceed the amount allowed I could not very well order the work stopped nor left in an unfinished state and liable thereby to loss from the weather. I may state that were it not for the assistance given by the Indians the job would be considerably larger. They furnished the stone and took the other building material from River in their boats free of charge, and also gave quite a fair share of work. The work has been faithfully attended to by the carpenters. I have been with them almost every day.\n\nWe are still without any furniture for the school except long forms or benches. Writing desks are needed.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRodrick McDonald\nAgent\nPictou Co\nMEMO.\n\nAccountant\n\nI have examined the accounts submitted by Agent McDonald for repairs of the school house at Indian Cove and find them satisfactory. The expenditure is $226.32 or $26.32 more than was authorized (and more than the appropriation). The extra expenditure apparently could not be avoided and as the teachers salary will likely have to be paid for three quarters I think the accounts might be paid.\n\nJ.W. Stone\nTo J. D. Maclean,\nSecretary of Indian Department,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th inst. (no. 90992) also the receipt of all forms for the quarterly returns which you kindly sent me.\n\nYour replies to my questions concerning the school term are all explicit with the exception of the last one. I can nowhere find either in the school returns or in the annual report of the department what date is considered the beginning of the present term.\n\nYou asked me to inform the department if their date at the opening of the school was correct. It is so. I am under charge on the 18th day of October. There is no other matter concerning my engagement which has not as yet been mentioned. There has been no written agreement as to what my salary shall be. I presume that will be arranged at the close of the quarter. I will speak of it now so that you can have leisure to give it attention.\nNow in reference to the school property, I spoke of window blinds. We should require seven. They might be the ordinary string-roller blinds of some dark shade. The probable cost would be thirty-five (35) each.\n\nOur school equipment is not nearly what we would like to have. When I opened the school, the seats were four rude benches with no backs. I succeeded in procuring seats and desks for 25 pupils! They are old desks which the school board here have discarded. The Indians treated them eight miles and cleaned and painted them. I undertook to buy screen-cloth at 50 cents and a can of paint at 50 cents for the desks. A third expenditure, I made was 30 cents for a firewood, making a total of 90 cents. I am well aware that these expenses were not authorized but I think you will see that they were a necessity. Quite so, no provision made for a teacher's desk. I have nothing but the rudest table and no seat. Another necessary article is a brown. And lastly I have to call your attention to the fact that there is immediate need for provision to build\nan outhouse. The probable cost of a rude building of the kind would be from $200 to $300. I take pleasure in writing you about these matters as I expected the Agent, Rev. Mr. Donald would inform you. He lives some distance from here and I have little opportunity of seeing him. I am extremely sorry to take up much of your time, but in this case it is unavoidable. So far the school has been very satisfactory. The children are bright and the attendance is good.\n\nThanking you for your kind attention,\n\nRemain\n\nYour respectfully,\nNellie A. Connolly\nSir: I beg to report that having visited the school at Indian Cove, I find they are still without the necessary building. The chief promised when the school house was completed that they would do that much themselves, but they have not yet fulfilled their promise. It is inconvenient to wait much longer. At the time of building the school house, a small building was attached to the rear where coal, kindling etc. are kept. The heating required need not be very large. I cannot say exactly what an out of money would be required for putting up said building. I think it could be erected for about $30 or\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Date]\nEureka, Ontario Co., N.Y.\n\nDec 5th 1898\n\nThe Secretary Dept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOnt.\n\nSir:\n\nThe teacher is anxious to ascertain\nthe number of school days she is supposed\nto teach in the year; when and how long\nare the holidays to be, and also will her\nsalary be paid every quarter. She began teaching\nabout the middle of October, and when making\napplication for her quarters' salary I will\nstate the exact date. I would be pleased\nto receive from the Dept. blanks for\nsaid application.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nFrederick W. Dana\nAgent\nOntario Co.\nOTTAWA, 9th December, 1898.\n\nThe Accountant:\n\nThe teacher of the new school at Indian Cove, Nova Scotia, reports the lack of equipment and asks that she be supplied with a desk and chair, the cost of which she does not state.\n\nWindow blinds are also reported to be needed; 7 spring roller blinds at 35 cents each would be $2.45.\n\nThe Agent, as well as the teacher, urges the building of outhouses for this school. The Agent's estimate of the cost is about $30.\n\nThe teacher has purchased screw nails, paint etc., to the amount of 90 cents, for which she should be repaid, and a broom is still necessary.\n\nCould all these things be paid for?\n\nReturn to H.C.R.\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.M. Graham\nOTTAWA, 16th December, 1898.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letters (2) of the 5th instant relative to matters in connection with the Indian Cove school. In reply to your enquiry as to the amount of salary to be paid the teacher for the current quarter, I beg to refer you to the letter addressed this day to Miss Connelly, a copy of which is enclosed herewith for your information.\n\nThe Department would like you to procure for this school at the least possible cost a teacher's desk and chair and a broom, as well as blinds for the windows, the dimensions of which can be given by the teacher.\n\nIn regard to the water closets which are required to be built for this school, the Department would like to be informed as to whether it is not too late in the season for this work to be done.\n\nIn compliance with your request I beg to enclose herewith 10 blank forms of requisition for teachers salaries.\n\nRev. P. McDonald,\nIndian Agent,\nBurek, Nova Scotia\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary\nOTTAWA, 16th December, 1898\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo relative to matters in connection with the Indian Cove school.\n\nIn reply to your first enquiry I beg to say that the school year begins on the 1st of July and is made up of four terms, beginning respectively on the 1st July, 1st October, 1st January, and 1st April, and known as the September, December, March and June quarters. The current term therefore began on the 1st of October and will end on the 31st instant. As you took charge of the school on the 18th October, you will be paid from that date till the 31st instant at the rate of $250 per annum immediately upon receipt of your quarterly return, which should be forwarded as soon after the expiration of the quarter as possible.\n\nIn regard to the blinds, teacher's desk and chair and the broom asked for, I beg to say that the Agent will be asked to procure suitable equipment. He is also being communicated with in regard to the erection of outbuildings.\n\nThe Department is very grateful for the Miss Nellie E. Connolly, trouble\n\nTeacher, Indian Cove school,\n\nNew Glasgow, N.S.\ntrouble taken by you to procure suitable desks and seats for the pupils, and if you will be good enough to send a voucher for the amount (90 cents) expended by you in the purchase of new nails, paint, &c., that sum will be refunded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary\nExtract from report of E. L. Armstrong, Inspector of Schools, on the Indian Cove School, dated October 22, 1912. Original on 9099\u00bd/6.\n\nThe school building is old and considerably battered. I understand the Department is contemplating the erection of a new building.\n\nThe grounds should be levelled and fenced.\n\nWould strongly recommend that walls of new building (interior) be furnished with hyloplate instead of the painted plaster walls or boards.\nOttawa, October 27, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to the proposed erection of the new school building at Indian Cove I have to ask you to confer with the Agent, Rev. J. D. McLeod, and report to the Department, giving information as to the style and size of the building you think would be suitable and whether any accommodation other than the class-room should be provided. You should also look into the matter of a site and report.\n\nAt this and the school at Bayfield it might be considered advisable to provide quarters for the teacher and the Department would like to have your views on the matter. Of course this accommodation will not be provided unless considered absolutely necessary. I shall be glad to hear from you in regard to the matter at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

MacLeod,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Glasgow, N.S.\nOttawa, September 8, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your progress certificates in connection with the Indian Cove School.\n\nI have to point out that these are still wrongly filled in, as you are asking in your first certificate for $35.00 and showing only $35.00 worth of labour and material in the building and in the second certificate you are asking for $310.00 and showing that there is only that amount of additional labour and material in the building. If you will look at the two letters of instruction sent you you will see that the amount of the certificate should not be more than 90 per cent each time of the amount of labour and material in the building. If from this you do not understand how to make out these certificates the Department would esteem it a favour if you would consult with somebody who would be able to assist you, as these certificates must be right to be presented to the Auditor General.\n\nIn the meantime, presuming that the amount of labour and material in the building at the first certificate was $35.00, the Department is paying $751.50 and, on the same presumption, it is paying $270.00, or 90 per cent of $310.00, on the second certificate. A cheque for the amount of these two certificates will be sent to the contractor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDaniel MacQueen, Esq.,\nKingshead,\nPictou Co., N.S.\n\nAct.

I am enclosing herewith the certificates and would ask you to be good enough to sign them and return them to the Department.\n\nI would also draw your attention to the fact that certificate No. 2 was for $270.00, not for $279.00.

The inspector Mr. McLean has under\n\nthe impression that I should have placed a water Board\n\nat the Base of walls, it may show indefinite details of\n\nsame on Plan. But its not specified whatever.\n\nHowever I have covered the whole of outside walls\n\nwith clapboard as specified in specification.\n\nIt as been approved by experience Micamhi\n\nand I also can testify by experience that a water\n\nBoard inserted at the Base of any Building\n\nwill cause the main rills to decay much faster than\n\notherwise moreover it does not depreciate the value\n\nnor the appearance of the Building. But adds to\n\npreserve the structure. However should the\n\ndrawing mean the suppose water Board\n\nI trust you will give the above statement due\n\nconsideration, and overlook my none consideration\n\nbefore hand or not to ask for information.\nto erect the above mention Board at Base it will require considerable amount of Labor an expense moreover to remove the new work it will do more or less harm whereas if left as it is at present it would be much better. Nevertheless if this Board is to be inserted I shall comply with your request. But I shall be very grateful if you will favor me and allow the work to stand as it now stands.\n\nI must say I am progressing nicely with the work and expect to have the work completed shortly. I also got the Building insured for one half the Bulk sum of the Contract in a reputable insurance company made payable to the Department.\n\nRemain your obediently,\n\nLawrence Murray & Son\nOttawa, September 27, 1913.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nIn reply to your letter dated September 22nd I beg to say that you should have asked the Department to furnish you with the necessary details or other information as advised to in the specifications whenever doubtful regarding any part of the drawings, etc.\n\nA water table should have been placed at the base of the clapboard sheathing, but, owing to the fact that the building is practically completed, the Department will not insist upon this part of the work, providing that all other items of the plans and specifications regarding this building have been satisfactorily carried through.\n\nKindly show this letter to the inspector.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Mury & Sons, the contractors for the Fisher's Grant School-house, I beg to say that the claim of Messrs. Reed & McGregor has been settled, and the contractors have been paid the balance due on the contract price. Enclosed herewith is the Finance Department's cheque for $230.95 in favor of the contractors in release of the amount of their security deposit, together with accrued interest thereon. Before you hand this cheque to Messrs. Mury & Sons, the Department wishes you to ascertain definitely whether Thomas Francis and his sons have been paid the $26.64 mentioned in your letter above quoted, which amount it appear should have been paid them by the contractors. In letter of the 27th November, copy of which is enclosed herewith, Messrs. Mury & Sons acknowledge their indebtedness in this matter, although the amount owed was not definitely stated therein.\n\nThe Department desires you to ascertain definitely whether Francis holds a cheque from the contractors covering this amount. The Department had correspondence with the Rev. J. D. McLeod in the matter, but his statements are conflicting. On the 23rd December he stated that Thomas Francis got a cheque \"and he has not been able to\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Supt.,\nRiver Bourgeois,\nN. S.\ncash it. The Department made further inquiry in the matter and was advised by Mr. McLeod in telegram of the 12th January that Francis did not receive a cheque. You should therefore ascertain all the facts in the matter.\n\nJohn Paul, an Indian, has a claim of $19.15 against Mr. A. L. Mury. He issued a cheque in his favor on the 10th September, but when he presented it at the bank, payment was refused. The cheque in question is enclosed herewith.\n\nWhen you obtain sufficient money from Messrs. Mury & Sons to satisfy Francis' claim and John Paul's claim (provided they are not yet settled) you may hand over to Messrs. Mury & Sons the Finance Department's cheque for $230.95 and cheque drawn in favor of John Paul for $19.15, but you should hold them until these claims are settled.

Mr. Boyd has not yet reported, but I have no doubt that if he has not already dealt with the matter he will do so at the earliest possible date.\n\nI regret the delay in settling this account.\n\nGeorge V.

J. D. McLeod, New Glasgow, N.S., has reported regarding the repairs required. These would include the reshingling of one side of the building and repairing the other side, also painting both inside and outside. The Agent estimates that the cost of the repairs would be between $450 and $500.\n\nThe Public School Inspector in his last report stated that the school house is a nice looking building, but cold in winter. He recommends that the walls, which are clapboarded, be stripped on the north and west sides and shingled over heavy paper.\n\nThere are 21 children enrolled, with an average attendance of 13. The building was erected in 1913.\n\nI would recommend that our Agent be given authority to have the repairs required carried out.

The clapboards should be stripped on the north and west sides and shingled over heavy building paper. The other sides of the building should be repaired where required, and the building should then be painted both inside and outside.\n\nThe work is to be performed by day labour, under the charge of a competent foreman. The regular scale of wages for the locality will be paid. Proper time sheets, in duplicate, for the labour employed should be kept by you. A supply of forms for the purpose are enclosed herewith.\n\nYou should make the purchase of all shingles, building paper, nails, paint, etc., and arrange to have these supplies delivered at the school. Before making the purchase, you should obtain competitive prices from a number of dealers, and the purchase should be made from the firm quoting you the lowest price. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the material used. A memo should accompany the vouchers showing the names of the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted. The time sheets for the labour should also be certified by you, and forwarded in duplicate.\n\nThe above repairs should be completed during the present summer holidays, in order that the school may be placed in a satisfactory condition before it re-opens in September next.\n\nWe note that you estimate the cost of this work to be approximately $500, which includes the material and labour, and this amount should not be exceeded.\n\nThe Department will leave this matter in your hands to make the best arrangements, and at the lowest possible cost.

He has not yet commenced the work but has some of the material on the ground. The building is clapboarded. The agent was instructed to strip these off. The agent was instructed to strip these off and have the walls on the north side sweat and shingled over heavy building siding. After completing the building I instructed him to remove both the north and south side siding. The agent is instructed to replace the old boards. The ends can be repaired with the old boards removed from the sides. The siding and ends removed from the sides will be painted with the former old siding.\n\nR\none coat paint.

B. Macleod\nOttawa, October 27th, 1923.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, enclosing time sheets for the labour employed in making repairs to the Indian Cove Day School and for the transportation of the men to and from the work each day.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a cheque for the balance due - $16.50 - will be sent you, which is the amount of the expenditure in excess of the cheque for $200 sent you on August 25th, last, to pay for the labour.\n\nI may say that while payment will be allowed for the transportation of the men employed, it was not expected that the Department would be called upon to pay an expenditure of this nature. The men have, no doubt, been paid the local prevailing rate of wages, and we should not have been called upon to pay their transportation charges.\n\nCopies of the accounts which you submitted for the material required for the repairs are returned herewith. As you are aware, it was necessary, before purchasing this material, that competitive prices be obtained, and I shall be pleased if you will attach a memo. to these accounts showing the names of the firms you asked to quote and the prices quoted by them. You should then return the accounts, when consideration will be given to the payment thereof.\n\nWe note that the work, with the exception of the painting and cleaning of the interior, has been completed. You may have the inside walls painted instead of murescod as at first instructed. The cost of having the work done should be kept down to the lowest possible point.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will state whether new closets have been built. These were badly needed, and new ones should be erected as instructed. The painting and any repairs remaining unfinished should be completed as soon as possible, and accounts for labour and material should be forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Sir:\n\nMiss MacDonald, travelling nurse for this Department for the Province of Nova Scotia, has strongly recommended the serving of a hot meal to the pupils of the Indian Cove Indian Day School each day. She states that such meals should consist of hot soup or broth with biscuits, milk, cheese, sugar and cocoa, and that the preparation and serving of same in the school would serve a very useful educational lesson. Besides, it would benefit the health of the children and encourage a more regular attendance.\n\nI have to request that you will take up this matter with the teacher and ascertain whether she would, with the help of the older girl pupils, prepare and serve a hot lunch to the pupils each day. If the teacher will consent to the serving of this lunch, it will be necessary to supply her with utensils for the purpose and also food supplies. You may purchase a number of graniteware cups, a large kettle, sauce pan, dish pan, a small quantity of dish towelling and a small table. You may also arrange for the purchase of a small quantity of biscuits, cocoa, sugar, condensed milk and cheese. This hot lunch is to be served to the pupils during the fall and winter months only. You should furnish properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering any expenditure incurred in the purchase of the utensils and supplies of food.\n\nThe Department will rely on you to see that no unnecessary expense is incurred and that no waste is occasioned by the teacher in the use of the food supplies mentioned above. We will expect an answer at an early date as to what arrangements have been made by the teacher for the serving of this hot lunch.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

The Department does not appear to have any information whatever about this account, possibly it is for some supplies secured by the late Indian Agent, Rev. J. D.

F. MacKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. A. J. MacIsaac,\nActing Indian Agent,\nNEW GLASGOW,\nNova Scotia\nOttawa, March 21st, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nIt is considered that certain instructions regarding the school at Indian Cove should be given you upon taking up duties as Indian Agent for Pictou County, N.S.\n\nYou should visit this school once each month, if possible, and assist the teacher in any way you can in encouraging a regular attendance of the Indian children of school age who are in good health. You should use your influence with the parents to see that their children attend regularly.\n\nYou should forward all requisitions of the teacher for classroom supplies to the Department. These requisitions should be made out on the forms for that purpose.\n\nThe quarterly returns of attendance should be prepared by the teacher at the end of each quarter, and certified by you, and forwarded to the Department, in order that payment of the teacher's salary can be made. For your information, I may say that Miss Gertrude McGirr, the present teacher, is in receipt of salary at the rate of $75 per month for the ten teaching months in the school year.\n\nA supply of forms used in connection with school activities will be sent you under separate cover, and these you should keep on hand and supply the teacher as she requires them.\n\nWhen, in your opinion, any repairs are required, you should forward a report to the Department, stating definitely the nature of the repairs and the approximate cost of same.\n\nYou should also make requests in due time for the fuel required.\n\nRev. R. C. MacGillivray,\nIndian Agent,\nPictou, N.S.\nNo expenditure in connection with the school, unless of an urgent nature, should be undertaken without first referring the matter to the Department, and receiving approval.\n\nIf there are any outstanding accounts in connection with school activities since the death of the late agent, I shall be pleased if you will obtain itemized accounts, in duplicate, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify and send to the Department, in order that payment can be made. In future all accounts for expenditure in connection with the school should be itemized, and in duplicate, and properly certified by you before being forwarded to the Department for payment.\n\nIt is hoped, as a result of the encouragement which you can give to the parents and the teacher, there will be much progress made in the educational work at the Indian Cove Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nA.

He also states that some slight repairs are required to the roof on the east side of the school building and to the roof of the coal shed.\n\nI have to request that you will furnish an estimate of the approximate cost of building a new out house of an inexpensive type for the boys, and also the cost of the repairs to the roof of the building and coal shed. When we have this information, consideration will then be given to authorizing the funds required for the purpose and giving you the necessary instructions to have the work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

MacGillivray\nAgent\n\nRecommended for August 1st\nOttawa, May 3rd, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nIn a report on the Indian Cove Day School, dated the 25th ultimo, Inspector J. C. McDonald states that the teacher is anxious to teach the girls knitting, embroidery, etc., provided material is supplied.\n\nThe Department is prepared to supply a reasonable quantity of the necessary material to this school.\n\nIt is not considered advisable, however, to supply this at the present time owing to the fact that the present academic year is nearly completed but you might keep the matter in mind and request authority to purchase whatever material you consider is required early in September. In making this application, you should state the probable cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKensie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. R. C. MacGillivray,\nIndian Agent,\nPictou, N.S.\nOttawa, July 20th, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nMiss MacDonald, Travelling Nurse for the Province of Nova Scotia, recommends that individual cups and individual towels be supplied for the use of the pupils of the Indian Cove Indian Day School. You may arrange for the purchase and delivery of an enamel drinking cup for each pupil, before the school reopens after the present summer holidays.\n\nYou might consult the teacher when the school reopens regarding the individual towels and, if she can arrange to have the children attend to the laundering and, also, see that there would be no loss of the towels, you may purchase two for each pupil. While one towel is being used, the other could be laundered. The Department will leave the question of providing the towelling in the hands of the teacher and yourself and, if you consider it advisable, you may arrange to purchase the towels as mentioned above.\n\nYou should forward accounts in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the above supplies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. R.C. MacGillivray,\nIndian Agent,\nPictou, N.S.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir:\n\nThe Indian School at Pietermaritzburg is decidedly shabby being badly in need of paint both inside and out.\n\nThe paint\u2014for two coats\u2014would cost in the vicinity of $75.00 and the labour would not exceed .50\u00a2 per hour.\n\nThe grounds about the school are clay, and in the weather that obtains in spring and fall they are covered with dense tufts of mould. This could be remedied by the application of four 25' x 30' loads of gravel. The gravel could be hauled and spread for .50\u00a2 cent a load. I hereby seek authority for the above expenditure and have occasion to warn the work done before the opening of the School.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nR.C. MacMillan,\nAgent.\nOttawa, August 12, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, informing the Department of the need of painting the interior and exterior of the Indian Cove Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange to have this building given two coats of a good grade of paint\u2014both the exterior and the woodwork in the interior. You should arrange for the purchase of the paint, oils, etc., and for the labour in having the work carried out. I shall be pleased if you will see that a satisfactory job is completed before the school reopens after the present summer holidays. You will be good enough to keep all expenses as low as possible, having in view the carrying out of a satisfactory job.\n\nYou should keep proper time sheets for the labour employed. All particulars as called for by the returns should be filled in and signed by the individual labourers employed. A supply of forms for the purpose is enclosed herewith.\n\nYou may also arrange to have approximately 30 loads of gravel spread on the grounds around the school building. We note that you can have this gravel delivered and spread for 50 cents a load. An account, in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded after the gravel has been supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. H. C. MacGillivray,\nIndian Agent,\nPictou, N.S.\nOttawa, September 7, 1929.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI inclose herewith Departmental cheque No. 3075 for $88.00, drawn in favour of Augustus MacDonald, in payment for labour performed on the Indian Cove Day School. The labour return which you submitted in favour of Mr. MacDonald is signed by him to show that he received payment. If you paid Mr. MacDonald you can have him endorse the cheque over to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H. Paget\nChief Accountant.\n\nRev. R.C.

Consequently as the men were working I undertook to order the material and to have the steps, platform and door renewed. This explains the attached Voucher.\n\nP.C. MacKellaway\nAgent.\nSir,\n\nOn painting the Indian Cove School, I found that some of the shingles had been stripped off the roof by recent winds. Also that all the shingles required repainting. This would require about two hundred of shingles, 15 or 20 lbs of nails and three days labour.\n\nI hereby request authority to have the work done.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nR.C. MacMillan\nAgent\nOttawa, September 13th, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:-\n\nI enclose herewith Departmental cheque No. 3201 for $76.60, drawn in your favour to pay labour employed in connection with the painting of the Indian Cove school. Your labour return calls for a total of $68.60, but you apparently have made a mistake in reckoning the amount due to the men employed. Fifty-four hours at 35\u00a2 an hour amounts to $18.90. With this correction the return amounts to $76.60. I note that you asked to have the cheque made out in favour of Chief Matthew Francis, but I have to point out that it is necessary to have the labour return signed by each man employed in the space provided for same under \"Received payment\" to show that each man has received the amount of money due him. This is necessary to meet the requirements of the Auditor-General. Each signature should be witnessed by third disinterested party.\n\nOne copy of the corrected labour return is also enclosed herewith. Kindly see that the men are paid and have them sign the labour return as instructed above and return it to the Department, as it will be required as a voucher for the Auditor-General.\n\nIn future, do not have labour returns signed by men employed until you have paid them. When an expenditure is authorized and you have to pay labour, it is in order for you to ask for an advance cheque, stating the amount, so that you can pay the men employed and have them sign the labour returns. Of course, if it is only a small expenditure, you can submit a voucher in favour of the person employed, and it will be paid direct by the Department.\n\nYou may purchase two bundles of shingles, 20 lbs. nails and arrange for the labour in having the shingles on this school re-nailed, and the new shingling required attended to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F.

The teacher, Miss McGirr, has tried to improve the grounds by flowerbeds etc., but on account of unnecessary traffic it is very discouraging, and not an easy matter to keep the school grounds looking up to the mark. I would recommend that a fence be built there next year and trust that you will see fit to make provision for this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 21, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, requesting that the cost of building a new fence around the school grounds at the Indian Cove Day School next spring be provided.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you should draw this matter to the attention of the Department when considered timely by you next spring, when it is hoped that funds can be provided to pay the cost of the fencing required, which, we note, you estimate will be approximately $120.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Please take this matter up with the local Indian Agent, and state if the present stove could be repaired and the approximate cost. If not possible to make satisfactory repairs, you should state the cost of supplying a new stove. Please give this matter your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. J. McNeil, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAntigonish, N.S.\nOttawa, October 20, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 14th instant, I have to say that the Department will approve of the serving of a hot lunch to the various Indian schools in your inspectorate, the same as was done last year. The schools at which this lunch was supplied to the pupils were as follows:\n\n- Easkasoni, Indian Cove (Pictou Landing)\n- Sydney, Afton,\n- Whyecocomagh, Salmon River.\n\nThe supplies for the lunch should be of the same type and approximately in the same quantities as last year. You may inform the various agents, arrange with them to purchase the articles and have the teachers start the serving of the lunch from the middle of November, next. They may continue serving lunch to the pupils at these schools until the end of April, 1932. All expenses in connection with the purchase of the supplies required should be kept as low as possible. Itemized accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded, covering the expenditure incurred in this connection for each school, separately.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nG. J. McNeil, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAntigonish, N. S.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter No.58-I-5 of October 15th, 1931, I beg to state that I have examined the stove in the Indian Cove Indian Day School and must report that it will be necessary to install a new stove. The old one is considered beyond repair. I would recommend that a stove of the air-circulator type be purchased. These stoves cost approximately $45.00. Will you kindly approve of a purchase please.\n\nFurthermore, I beg to report that repairs such as new locks are required for both doors of the school also a few panes of glass. $12.00 should be sufficient to have these necessary repairs effected please.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 10, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, relative to the condition of the stove at present in use at the Indian Cove Indian Day School and recommending that a new stove be supplied.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase from sources which have already been indicated to you of a stove of the air-circulator type, and have same delivered and set up in the school. It is noted that the cost of the stove will be approximately $45.\n\nYou may also incur an expenditure of approximately $12 in having a new lock installed on both doors of the school and the necessary panes of glass installed.\n\nAfter the stove has been delivered and the work authorized completed, please forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. J. McNeil, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAntigonish, N.S.\nAntigonish, N.S.,\nDec. 4th, 1931.\n\nSir:-\n\nI would refer you to your letter No. 58-I-5 of Nov. 10th, 1931, in which you authorized an expenditure of $45.00 for a new stove of the air-circulator type for Indian Cove Indian Day School.\n\nAt present there are two stoves in this school and it has been found that the better one of the two will also have to be replaced next year. Now one large air-circulator could heat this school, would eliminate one stove and many yards of stove pipe. Therefore it is considered expedient to put in a large air-circulator now and make one job of it. There would also be a saving on fuel. One large enough to heat the school would cost about $75.00 installed. Instead of an allowance of $45.00 as granted would you kindly allow $75.00 for this purpose please.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 9, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, relative to the purchase of a new stove for use at the Indian Cove Indian Day School. It is noted you recommend that a large air circulator type of stove be supplied to replace the two stoves at present in use, thus effecting a saving in fuel and providing for better heating of the building.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase and installation of an air circulator stove of a type large enough to heat the school. It is noted that the cost, installed, will be approximately $75, and this amount should not, if possible, be exceeded. The purchase should be made from a firm on the list to receive consideration, in accordance with departmental instructions. The purchase and installation of this new stove should receive early attention.\n\nAfter the stove has been supplied and installed, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Fifty or more children are to be provided for. Can the Department grant ten dollars for the purchase of candies and simple toys? Miss McGirr will appreciate an early reply.\n\nIn my Letter No. 277, October 15, 1935, I asked if the Department could grant ten dollars for the purchase of materials to aid Miss McGirr to carry on craft work with her girls and boys, but my letter has not been answered - probably through oversight.

The shingles on the roof need patching, the steps need repairing and a new door is needed on the school. Three panes of glass are also required.\n\nThe teacher asked for the following tools, as she is making an effort to teach some manual training: A bench saw, claw hammer, 3 chisels (small size), a plane, a small square, screw driver, nail set, brace and a few bits, 1 fret saw, 1 pail, and a book on manual training.\n\nThe teacher has also asked for some material for sewing.\n\nA new out house is required at this school.\n\nRegarding the painting, I asked some of the members of the Band if they would take a contract for doing the work and they said they would. Rev. Father Johnston will, in due course, send in the tender. We were to buy the paint and the Indians would do the work. I, of course, stipulated that I did not know whether the Training Division would have funds for this work or not.\n\nI found that there were 27 children on the roll and an average attendance of 24 to 25.\n\nMiss McGirr has taught for thirty years and I am sure she is performing very good work on the Reserve. She lives in New Glasgow and goes back and forth every day.\n\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nFig 1 - Actual disposition of stoves\n\nFig 2 - Proposed new... & building new chimney\nThorburn, N.S.\nSept. 11, 1939.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn a separate sheet you will find in Fig 1 a rough sketch of the present arrangement of the heating system in Indian Cove school. In Fig. 2 you will also find a proposed new disposition and for which I am asking permission, for the following reasons:\n\nUnder the present system of heating an annual purchase of stove pipes has to be made, because they rust during the summer in spite of all precautions being taken to prevent rusting. The stove pipes are hung in the school room on wire, (about 35 ft. in all), Besides the bad appearance of the arrangement, it may not be the safest method.\n\nWith the building of a new chimney outside the building as shown in Fig. 2, it would do away with the buying of stove pipes every year, the appearance would be better and the heating system would be safer.\n\nThis proposed chimney would be about 28' high. Size: 12\" x 8\", with lining inside. A foundation of cement would also be necessary. The total cost according to Mr. Shackley of New Glasgow, who is a brick layer, would be between $90 and $95. These figures include labor, accessories, etc., etc.\n\nShould this plan be not acceptable, kindly give me authorization to buy 12 links of stove pipes at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. E. Chiasson,\nIndian agent.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 20, 1939.\n\nEX'D.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th instant you may expend an amount not exceeding $95.00 in erecting a new chimney at the Indian Cove school. It is noted from your letter that the amount stated will cover the cost of both material and labour.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. E. Chiasson,\nIndian Agent,\nThorburn, N. S.\nThorburn, N.S.\nAugust 8, 1940.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPermission is hereby requested for minor necessary reparations to the Indian Cove School, Pictou Landing, to the amount of approximately between $65.00 and $70.00.\n\nThe reparations are as follows:\n\nReplacing about 75 or 80 feet of clapboards\n\" two panes of glass & repair frames\n\" one outside door & repair another one\n\" shingles on the roof (about 3 or 4 bundles). The roof can last a year or so by replacing missing shingles. Removal of two piazzas annexed to the building and replacing them by ordinary steps. These piazzas are now unsafe as they are partially rotten. As they serve no purpose but are only there for ornamentation and as they are costly in their upkeep, I suggest that they be replaced by ordinary steps. Materials needed besides those mentioned are nails, putty and 24 pieces of lumber 6'x10'x2'.\n\nThe approximate cost is tabulated here below:\n\n| Item                  | Cost   |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Labour, one carpenter at $4.50 & helper at $2.00 a day, or six days at $6.50 | $59.00 |\n| Clapboards            | $3.00  |\n| Lumber                | $5.00  |\n| Shingles              | $3.00  |\n| Nails                 | $1.15  |\n| Putty                 | $.30   |\n| Two panes of glass    | $1.10  |\n| One door              | $7.50  |\n| Trucking              | $5.00  |\n\n$65.05\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. Chisholm\nIndian agent.\nOttawa, August 14, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th instant, the Department approves an expenditure not exceeding $65.05, covering the cost of material and labour for making necessary repairs to the Indian Cove Indian Day School. It is understood that Indians will be employed to do this work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend E. Chiasson,\nIndian Agent,\nThorburn, N. S.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI beg to inform you that during school vacation about 18 or 19 panes of glass have been broken with stones at the Indian Cove school. The R.C.M.P. of New Glasgow have been informed of the fact and are now conducting an investigation after I conducted one myself without results. I doubt that they will find the culprit. I firmly believe that the above mentioned fact is the result of plain devilment on the part of some Indian boys (probably not going to school) but it is extremely difficult to find out who are the guilty ones.\n\nI must confess I am at a loss as to devise plans to prevent such future occurrence unless the Department issues a stiff warning to the Reserve as a whole that if such a thing happens again, drastic measures will be taken. I shall gladly convey the message.\n\nHoping an early reply re. this matter with suggestions as to what course to follow, I remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. E. Chiasson,\nIndian agent.\n\nP.S. School starts on Sept. 2nd and these panes will have to be replaced. In order to show that the Dept. is not too readily prepared to replace them, it might be a good idea to replace them some time after school has started.\nOttawa,\nAugust 29, 1941.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th instant you may arrange for replacing the glass which has been broken in the Indian Cove School.\n\nYou should also issue a stiff warning to all on the Reserve to the effect that if such a thing happens again drastic measures will be taken.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. E. Chiasson,\nIndian Agent,\nThorburn, N.S.\nJuly 12th, 1941.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nAn inspection of the Pictou County Agency was made this date and Rev. E. Chiasson, Indian Agent, interviewed.\n\nSCHOOL\n\nThe school building is neat and adequate for the Reserve. The roof I am advised is leaking badly and should be reshingled. It is difficult to understand this leaking as the present shingles are not old and look quite serviceable. Due to the caretakers absence the interior of the school was not inspected. Father Chiasson assures me the leak is not from the ridge cap or flashing would indicate the present shingles being poorly laid. I would recommend that an experienced roofer be requested to report on the condition of the roof, and if necessary, the roof be reshingled. Three windows have been broken and will require replacement. Two outside doors also require to be rehung with possibly new frames at an approximate cost of $15.00.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 9, 1941.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIn reporting on his visit to the Indian Cove School Mr. Arneil states that an amount of $15.00 is required to rehang two of the doors. You may incur this expenditure.\n\nMr. Arneil also reports on the condition of the roof. It is difficult for us to supply the funds necessary to place a new roof on this building this year but if minor repairs will be sufficient to carry it for another winter you may proceed with the work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. E. Chiasson,\nIndian Agent,\nThorburn, N.S.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe following repairs are needed on the Indian Cove School: The roof is leaking especially around the chimney. The water coming in here has caused the plaster to break and fall. A new front door is needed and the outhouses should be moved and repaired.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGertrude McRee.\nPictou Landing\nN.S.\nShubenacadie, N.S. July 8, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't. of Mines & Res., Ottawa.\n\nRe attached letter from Bay School Teacher, Pictou Landing.\n\nI am forwarding a letter received recently from the teacher of the Pictou Landing Day School. As you will note the school building requires some repairs but I desire your authorization before commencing it.\n\nThis building is a very good one and the teacher here in my opinion is doing good work. It is highly improbable that there will be many Indian families leaving this particular reserve as long as there is sufficient and highly remunerative work to be found at the shipyards, steel plant and elsewhere. In my opinion there will be use for this school for a few years yet and would recommend that it be repaired sufficiently to prevent further disintegration and spoilage by leaks.\n\nPlease advise if you concur with this and if so I will endeavour to find an Indian carpenter of this band and have him do the work.\n\nH. C. Rice, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, July 12, 1944.\n\nMr. H. C. Rice, Indian Agent, Shubenacadie, N.S.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th instant, you may arrange to have repairs made to the Indian Cove Indian Day School.

S.,\nJuly 13th, 1949.\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont., Canada.\n\nRe: Indian Cove Day School,\nPictou Landing, Nova Scotia.\n\nReference to your letter of June 7th last respecting the captionally noted Day School which is urgently in need of interior and exterior repair.\n\nOn the 12/6/49, in company with A. M. HAWKINS, a competent builder and contractor, a patrol was made to the Indian Cove Reserve, where the Day School was examined. This building, which is of wood frame construction is 54' X 24' X 14' post. There is a concrete foundation under the whole building and is in good condition. However, the main building is in such disrepair that a lot of material has to be replaced. The roof which was covered with wooden shingles is completely gone as are the underneath rough boards. One side wall and one end wall will have to be shingled. Outside doors have to be replaced, some of the window sashes are rotten and they also have to be repaired.\n\nAttached hereto you will find a labour contract submitted by Mr. HAWKINS in the amount of $1,145.00 which to my mind is a very reasonable price for the work that is to be done. This figure includes all outside and inside rough and finish carpentry, painting the outside and inside two coats and repairing the school desks (teacher and pupils).\n\nMost of the materials can be supplied Con. Sheet # 2.\nRe: Indian Cove Day School,\nPictou Landing, Nova Scotia.\n\nfrom stock on hand at a reduction of current market prices. A list of these materials is also attached hereto with an estimate of the cost in each instance. To this figure can be added the cost of truckage, approximately $67.50 if the Agency Truck is used.\n\nShould the contract of Mr. HAWKINS be accepted, periodic inspections can be carried out by Harry B. MacDonald, our outside foreman, thereby eliminating the necessity of another building inspector being sent here or hired to oversee the work.\n\nMay we be advised at your earliest convenience what your decision is in respect to these repairs?\n\n(H. C. RICE) Superintendent,\nShubenacadie Indian Agency.\n\nEnclos/ 2.\nJuly 13th, 1949.\n\nMr. H.C. Rice,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nMicmac, Hants Co., N.S.\n\nRe: Indian Cove Day School,\nYour File 51/6-253\n\nWe have your letter of the 13th instant with reference to interior and exterior repairs which you consider are required at the above school. It is noted that the total cost of repairs recommended will be approximately $2,000.00.\n\nIs there any likelihood of closing this school within the next two or three years? If so, do you consider the expenditure mentioned above is justified? If you feel that the school will be in operation for some years to come, we are prepared to favourably consider the expenditure.\n\nIn the fourth paragraph of your letter you state in part as follows: \"Most of the materials can be supplied from stock on hand.\"\n\nI enclose the list which you forwarded and I would appreciate it if you would distinctly mark the items which can be secured from the stock in order that the other items can be ordered through the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nBernard F.

S.\n\nUpon going over the completed work and repairs to\nthe Indian Cove Day-school, it was found that the stoves\nwere in disrepair and their continued use would constitute\na serious fire hazard.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that immediate steps\nbe taken to purchase two new heaters suitable for this\nschool. The building is approximately 15000 cubic feet\nand as there is no basement in the school, it is necessary\nto use stoves for heating purposes. Several heaters are\non the local market which would be suitable for use in\nthis school. Hillis & Sons, Halifax, N. S., have a slow\ncombustion coal burning heater which has proved to be\nvery satisfactory and it is possible that two of these\nwould be adequate for the school. Other firms which might\nbe able to supply a suitable heater are the Enterprise\nFoundry, Sackville, N. B., Fawcett Foundry, Sackville, N. B.,\nRecord Foundry, Moncton, N.

There are upwards of 20 children who could attend School. From my experience, I do not see tend that that number would attend on an average. Indeed whenever they approach me on the School question, I tell them that School would be no use to them. They would not send their children anyway away. They promised faithfully to make their little ones go to School if you established one, the poor people have a right to School privileges and they ought to have a chance to teach their children. They tell me that many would come to Malagoo if there was School on the Reserve. To get the Indians from Sydney and other towns would be, indeed, a good thing, though I for one do not want here them among those there. However the most good to the poor people must be the Motto, What say you about the School? It is a crying need.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJuly 16th 1907\nOttawa, August 1, 1907.\n\nRev. Sirs:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th ult., with reference to the establishment of an Indian day school at Malagawatch, and in reply I beg to say that this matter will receive consideration and you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. D. MacPherson,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendale, C.B.\nOttawa, August 1, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Rev. D. M. MacPherson, Indian Agent, has written the Department recommending the establishment of a day school for the Malagawatch Indians, and I have to request that on the first occasion on which you are in this locality you will be good enough to look fully into this matter and report thereon to the Department.\n\nThe Agent also states that some of the Indians from Sydney would come to Malagawatch if a school were opened there. Your report should show the probable number of children that would attend.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nA.J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeoise, C.B.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant, and to assure you that the business to which it refers will have my best attention as soon as possible. I do not think, however, that I shall be able to report upon the case until about the 20th inst.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAs stated above, I visited the Sydney reserve also, but could discover no evidence of intention on the part of any Indians residing there now, to locate at Malagawatch in the future under any consideration. I was informed, however, that some families who lead a more or less nomadic life, had been living there for a time but had gone away. Possibly the agent had these in mind when he stated that some of the Indians from Sydney would come to Malagawatch if a school were opened there.\n\nI visited the Sydney reserve school, and have much pleasure in bearing testimony to the proficiency displayed by the five pupils present at the time, but I regretted to note that the attendance on a whole was small.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n[Signature]\nD. B. Boyd\nDistrict Agent, Nova Scotia\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 1st ultimo, I have the honor to advise that I visited both the Malagawatch and Sydney Indian reserves on the 24th and 25th of August respectively, and as a result of my visits I have the following report:\n\nThe number of families permanently resident on the Malagawatch reserve is less than the total population shown; fifty-three and the number of children of school going age twenty-one. I was informed at Malagawatch that two other mission families having no permanent place of abode at present would settle on that reserve as a result of the establishment of a school there, because the situation otherwise was the most desirable to them. These two families would add four to the number of children of school going age already on the reserve. The Indians whom I interviewed manifested a deep interest in the establishment of a school, which I sincerely hope will be accomplished.\n\nI am very partial to school privileges and facilities, and to secure them in some particular case might be dispensed by greater lengths than the circumstances would justify warrant. But I submit that, in this age, and particularly in this country any community having upwards of twenty children who should be receiving an education, in the elementary branches at least, ought to be provided with a school; and therefore, I have no hesitation in recommending the establishment of one at Malagawatch, as applied for by the Agent-Head.\nSir,\n\nThe Indians of Malagawatch, Shawnee, &c., &c., are clamouring for the establishment of a school on their reserve, and I beg leave to enquire what the prospects are in that regard.\n\nMr. John Jac, captain of the Malagawatch band, who came to see me a few days ago, states that several families of Micmacs now living in the vicinity of North Sydney, but formerly residents of the reserve, would welcome it if a school were in operation there.\n\nI have already made a report to the Department on this subject, but may say further that owing to the fertility of the soil at Malagawatch and the ease with which it may be cultivated, besides other advantages due to situation, the place is a desirable one for occupation by any class of people, and, therefore, I think it would be the part of wisdom to give the Indians every encouragement to remain and to enlarge the settlement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Boyd\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 27th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Malagawatch school building is now ready for occupation as soon as a teacher is obtained, and I should be obliged if you would give the name and address of a suitable person to take charge of this school; the qualifications should also be stated. As all the Indians of this locality are Roman Catholics the teacher should be of the same persuasion. I may add that the Department will provide suitable quarters for the teacher when appointed. The salary will be at the rate of $300.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nA. W. Chisholm, Esq., M.P.,\nMargaree Harbour,\nInverness Co., N.B.\nHouse of Commons\nOTTAWA\n\n[Stamp]\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter of October 27 received, asking for the name & address of a suitable person to take charge of the Indian School at Malagashworth, New Brunswick. In reply I beg to say that it is impossible to get a good teacher for the annual sum of $300. I have had a conversation with a man whom I want to recommend. He is willing to go to work for $400 a year, if you decide to give him this amount. Kindly let me know without delay as I cannot wait here paying whether or not he will be employed, & when can he begin work.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nA.W. Christie\n\nThe name & address of the man are: Mr. Burns\nGrand Falls\nNewfoundland\nOttawa, Nov. 15th., 1909.\n\nSir,-\n\nIn reply to your letter of today's date nominating Mr. Arsen Burns, of Grand Bang, Inverness County, N.S., as teacher for the Malagawatch Indian day school, I have to inform you that if Mr. Burns' qualifications entitle him to the payment of the salary mentioned, namely, $400.00 a year, the Department will be willing to pay him at that rate. If Mr. Burns will communicate with the Department forwarding his certificates and stating what his past experience has been, the matter will be given immediate consideration. I may say that owing to the distance of the school from any white settlement and the consequent difficulty of obtaining a proper boarding place the Department is erecting two rooms at the rear of the school which may be occupied by the teacher. A few simple articles of domestic furniture will be placed in these rooms so that comfortable quarters will be provided for the teacher who may be appointed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. W. Chisholm, Esq., M.D., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nGrand Etang,\nNov. 29th, 1909.\n\nMr. J. D. McLeay,\nActing Sec'y, Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application to you for the position of school at Malagamath for the present year, and I have no doubt that once appointed to the position you will be satisfied to leave me the position for years. I have been teaching in public schools for over ten years, and can furnish good references if necessary. Moreover, I am being advised by Mr. Christy, as per his letter to me of the 17th inst., to make application to you for the position, which I understand he has already fixed up with your department. Thanking you in anticipation of your granting me this, only humble request,\n\nHumbly beg to be,\nYours very truly,\n\nArsene Burns,\n\"Teacher.\"\nOttawa, November 29, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd inst., applying for the position of teacher of the Malagawatch Indian school, and in reply I beg to say that, before the Department can consider your application, it would need to have further information with reference to your experience, certificates, age, etc. You will be good enough also to inclose copies of any testimonials held by you.\n\nAs soon as these are received you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nArsene Burns, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nGrand Etang,\nN.S.\n\nSecretary.\nDear Sir,\n\nI immediately reply to your letter of 27th Oct., I humbly beg to state the following with regard to my experience in teaching school certificates, age etc.\n\nI have taught school at Friars Head first for 4 years then 1 year at Pleasant Bay, another year at Friars Head again, one year at West Cross, Atholshag, all in Inverness County, and two terms at Ingonish, Nova Scotia, and one term at South Bay, Newfoundland both of West Co.\n\nI enclose you copies of my certificates. I am thirty-three years of age married and enclose you copies of my testimonials now at $400.00 so Dr. Maclean wrote me I shall be only too pleased to accept the position which I understand to be vacant (for I love to teach) but would wish to make sure as soon as possible, so that I could not miss any other good chance.\n\nYours truly, Arlene Burns.\nOttawa, December 13th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the copies of your certificates and testimonials were not enclosed with your letter as stated.\n\nThe Department cannot finally decide with reference to your engagement until it has information regarding your certificates and testimonials. If these are satisfactory you will be engaged to take charge of the school after the Christmas holidays at a salary of $400.00 per annum. The permanency of the position will depend upon the success you meet with in the work.\n\nI am good enough to send the copies referred to by return mail.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nsecretary.\n\nArsene Burns, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nGrand Etang, N.S.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nEnclosed please find my registered letter, my teacher's license and other certificates which need to be returned to me at Grand Bay of Simcoe County, Ont., where I have been engaged for five years in teaching. I have also one year in Pleasant Bay, one year and a half at Port Hope, three years all in Simcoe County and one year and a half at Port Hope. I have now thirty-two years of age married and have a family of five children.\n\nI am respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Address]\nHalifax, 315278\n\n[Stamp]\nMr. Secretary, I shall be ready for the appointment immediately and it should suit me to have it to move over my family before the cold winter sets in too severely.\n\nBelieve me,\nYours sincerely,\nArchie Burns\nTeacher\nOttawa, December 17th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant enclosing your certificates and giving the Department further information as to your experience, age, etc.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you have not as yet sent your testimonials from the schools in which you were previously engaged. It will be necessary for the Department to have these before it can come to a final decision.\n\nI would also remind you that the living accommodation for the teacher at this school is only an addition to the building consisting of two rooms each about ten by twelve. It is noted that you have quite a large family and it is doubtful whether this accommodation would be sufficient for you. The Department thinks it well at least to advise you as to the conditions as they exist.\n\nThe Department will await the receipt of your testimonials.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nSecretary.\n\nArsene Burns, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nGrand Etang, N.S.\nTo whom it may concern:\n\nIt has been my privilege to enjoy the personal acquaintance of Mr. Mason Burns of Grand Bay, N.S., for the past fifteen years. Mr. Burns is a gentleman of fine character and during his period of service as a teacher in various schools of New Brunswick and Victoria Counties has acquired an excellent reputation both with regard to the discipline of his duties and with regard to his personal conduct. I have no hesitation whatever in recommending Mr. Burns as a suitable teacher for any community.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nA. B.

(RG 10, Volume 6047, file 25k-1, part 1)\nOttawa, December 31, 1909.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department has appointed Mr. Arsene Burns, of Grand Etang, N.S., as teacher of the Malagawatch Indian school at a salary of $400.00 per annum, his duties to commence on January 4, 1910.\n\nYou will be good enough to give Mr. Burns the necessary instructions with reference to returns, etc., and to see that the building is ready for occupation. The Department will send a supply of stationery, etc., and I have to ask you to see that a supply of fuel is provided.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. D. MacPherson,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendale, N.S.\nOttawa, December 31, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department has appointed Mr. Arsene Burns, of Grand Etang, N.S., as teacher of the Malagawatch Indian school at a salary of $400.00 per annum, his duties to commence on January 4, 1910.\n\nRev. D. MacPherson, Indian Agent, has been informed of this appointment and asked to give Mr. Burns the necessary instructions with reference to his returns, etc., and also to see that fuel is provided.\n\nIt does not appear that a stove was ordered among the other furnishings for this school, and I have to ask you to be good enough to see that a suitable one is sent in at once. The Department will leave the choice of this stove to your discretion. The stationery will be sent as soon as a requisition is received from Mr. Burns, who has been asked to make out a list of what is required.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nGlendale, N.S.\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, December 31, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of the 17th inst. and previous correspondence in regard to your application for the position of teacher of the Malagawatch Indian school, I beg to say that the Department, in view of your certificates and the testimonial received, has decided to appoint you at a salary of $400.00 per annum, your duties to commence on January 4, 1910.\n\nYour retention in the position will depend upon the success with which you meet in the work. In addition to your work in the school-room it will be necessary for you to obtain the confidence and sympathy of the parents. This can only be done by mingling freely with them in their homes. Indians as a rule are apathetic in their attitude towards the education of their children, and the arousing of their interest is one of the essentials of success. As you are an experienced teacher it is not necessary to say anything with reference to ways and means of interesting the children themselves in the work of the class-room.\n\nArsene Burns, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nGrand Etang, N.S.\nThis is a new school, and the Department will watch with interest the result of your efforts.\n\nThe Department supplies the necessary books, etc., for Indian schools and you should send by return mail a list of the articles you will require. These have to be ordered through the Government Stationery Office and it takes some little time to have requisitions filled.\n\nYour certificates will be returned by registered letter.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nSecretary.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI have duly opened the Indian School at Malagawatch, and have an enrollment of 16. Malagawatch is quite out of the way place and it is very difficult to go any place from it, and very inconvenient to get things. The mail comes only twice a week. I had advised Rev. Dana to send books, but he apparently got nothing yet. I came my family over, wife & five children from 4 to ten years of age and find the two rooms for kitchen almost full-there should be a cellar to store provisions and very little expenses would have completed the loft which would thus give ample room for a family to live in. If given permission, I could show that done myself at very small cost. Again the water is my good, and I believe very unhealthy and there is no well, but I understand from the Indians that you can have a well built at the spring. The Indians allow to be very kind to me.\n\nI have fifteen scholars so far from ten to twenty-eight years of age and they seem to be more than intelligent. I thought a few good\npencils, chalk & slates, etc., to start them with, and hope to trust you with what I can give in necess-\nary books, etc., yours sincerely,\n\nRosene Burks,\n\"Teacher.\"\n\n358515\nOttawa, February 8th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to learn that you have in attendance at the Malagawatch School a large number of children. The Department hopes that you will be able to increase this and to keep the interest of the parents and the children in the work.\n\nWith reference to increased accommodation I beg to say that the Department had not in view the making of provision for such a large family as yours; however, if you will obtain an estimate of the cost of the material to complete the attic of the addition the Department will consider the question of supplying it, if you will do the necessary work.\n\nThe stationery, etc., asked for by you was ordered from the Government Stationery Office on the 19th ultimo, and they were asked to forward it as soon as possible.\n\nIf you will send an account for the supplies that you bought to the Department through the Agent payment will be made.\n\nThe matter of providing a water supply will also be taken up.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nArsene Burns, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nBig Harbor Island P.O., N.S.\n18 Books (Universal/12in); Numerical Yall (from 1444)\n\nSett $2 per set; Blackboard Board $3\n\nQuin Royal Drawing Paper 21x26\n\nLawton's Imperial Marshall & Kennedy Pen\n\nGrosvenor Book for Pitts; Fountain Pen\n\nGeorge and Scribbling Books\n\nScribblers 12 in.

They are willing to pay the expenses incurred in the education of their children, but they cannot afford the necessary time in the school.

Many of the supplies asked for in this requisition are considered altogether unnecessary for the junior pupils in a primary school, and you will be good enough in future to confine yourself to those required for the work of your class-room.\n\nThe Department would like you to use ink when sending communications, as these letters have to be placed on record and the writing in lead pencil soon fades.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nArsene Burns, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nBig Harbor Island P.O., N.S.\nRiver Bourget, 18th March, 1910.\n\nWith reference to the application of the Indians of the Malagawatch Reserve, for the establishment of a night school, I beg to say that I have recently interviewed them personally, and can vouch for their being in earnest about the matter.\n\nThey are so enthusiastic over the success thus far attending the recent establishment of a school for their children, that they appear to be thirsting for instructions also in the elementary branches of an English education; and as they cannot attend a day school, being otherwise occupied, they have petitioned for a night school under the management of Mr. Burns, the teacher at present employed at Malagawatch Reserve. I recommend that the prayer of their petition be granted tentatively for three months.\n\nMr. Burns demands payment for conducting the night school at the same rate he is now receiving as teacher of the children's day school; but I think if he got $75 per quarter as remuneration for his services, he should be satisfied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. J. Boyd,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 4th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo reporting upon the advisability of establishing a night school for the Indians on the Malagawatch Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in view of your recommendation the Department will try this experiment till the end of the current quarter, and Mr. Burns will be so instructed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Burgeois, N.S.\nOttawa, April 4, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department has authorized Mr. Burns, teacher of the Malagawatch school, to try the experiment of conducting a night school on the reserve till the end of the current quarter. He is to have a session of two and one-half hours for five evenings a week and his pay is to be at the rate of fifty cents per hour. Mr. Burns has been authorized to purchase six lamps and wall brackets and instructed to forward the accounts through you.\n\nThe Department would like you to visit the reserve soon after the night school is started and report as to the work being performed.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nRev. D. MacPherson,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendale, N.S.\nOttawa, April 4, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of the 9th ult. I beg to say that the Department has decided to try the experiment of conducting a night school on the Malagawatch reserve till the end of the current quarter.\n\nInstruction should be given for two and one-half hours for five evenings a week and the Department will pay you at the rate of fifty cents per hour. Should the school prove a success and the Indians avail themselves of the opportunity of obtaining an education the question of continuing it will be considered.\n\nYou are hereby authorized to purchase six lamps and the necessary brackets to be fixed to the walls and also coal-oil to hold them. Your account for these should be forwarded to the Department through the Agent.\n\nFor a time at least the Department would like to have weekly reports on this work, in which you should deal with the attendance, work performed, success attained, etc., etc.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nArsene Burns, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nBig Harbor Island P.O.,\nN.S.\nBig Harbour Island, P.O.,\nMalagawatch Indian\nReserve, N.S.\n23/4/1910\n\nMr. J.G. McClean,\nSecretary of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn compliance to the wish of the Indian Dept., as per your esteemed favor of the 4th inst., I humbly beg to advise you of our progress in the attendance worked performed, and success attained, etc., in the preliminary experiments with re. to the night-school on the Malagawatch Indian Reserve, which I have every reason to believe will eventually be crowned with complete suc-\n\ncess. I have already fourteen scholars enrolled giving an average attendance of 9\u00bd which I consider to be extremely good at this season when the poor Indians have had to scatter abroad for the want of food and the other necessaries of life. At this time of the year the Indians on this reserve are extremely poor, and if it were not for anticipated opening of a night school I really believe there would remain on the reserve\nat present, but one or two families (owing\nto being small). Since the opening of\nthe night school some have already\ncome back, and some more, I am being\ninformed, are coming back next week.\n\nThe middle aged Indians are more or\nless intelligent; the English language coma\nin easier to them than the younger children,\nsome of them having already reached the\nstandard (in reading and translation) with the\nscholars in the day classes. In my estimation\nthey are doing remarkably well. They write a\nfairly good hand. So far, I did not con-\nsider it prudent to take up any more\nthan reading, translating, and writing. They\nboth those in the day classes as well as in\nevening classes, understand thoroughly the\nlesson they can read, they can also write them\nand spell the words without the book, although\nI never yet got them to learn by memory. They\nlearned them by beginning to make one simple\nword, then another, and another and so on. And\nthey can do a little drawing, and count up to\na hundred. I did not care to push them too\nsoon in too many things yet, for fear of\ngetting them confused. Both in Day and Evening\nclasses, they are certainly very fond of School.\n\nBelieve me, Yours truly,\n\nArsene Burns, Indian Teacher\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith for your information a copy of a report received from Mr. Arsene Burns, Teacher on the Malagawatch Indian reserve, bearing on the night school recently started there.\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to report upon this matter at a convenient time in the near future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N. S.\nBig Harbor Island, P.O.,\nMalagawatch Indian Reservation,\n30/4/10.\n\nTo J. D. McLean,\nSecy. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Night School.\n\nMy dear Sir - With further reference to the Night School started by the Malagawatch Indian Reserve, I beg to state that both day and night School have been visited by Rev. Dana McPherson, P.P., Indian Agent, on Wednesday, the 27th inst. and I am pleased to be able to say that he apparently found both day & night teaching operations practical first-class in every respect, the resulting effects of which, upon his own thorough and keen examination, he found to give him complete satisfaction. Undoubtedly, you have already received the good report he has had reason to make of both Day & Night School.\n\nI have an enrollment of 14 registers for Night School at present, giving an average evening attendance of 9-8.\nreceipt of information re opening of night school a number have arrived to-day from North Sydney and some more I am told are coming back next week so I have not the slightest hesitation in assuming that our efforts re experimenting the conducting of a night school shall be crowned with success. By the way the post office of Big Harbor Island also distant from the school about two miles and a half and at that there is but a bi-weekly service to Big Harbor Island. The Indians wanted me to write for the establishment of a post office on the school premises of the Reserve with a mail service direct from S.S. River District or rather in connection with the proposed establishment of a Post Office at Big Harbor Road which will still be at a distance of about three miles from the Indian School. I understand from various sources that the electors of Big Harbor Road are very much inconvenienced for the want of a Post Office in consequence of which they are after petitioning the Dominion Government through our worthy representative H.W. Chisholm Esq M.P. Pov in connection with this proposed post office at Big\nHarbor Road, which is very much needed there, the Indians wish for a mail service to continue from Big Harbor Road (which is supposed to be direct from S.S. River Denis, P.O.) to the Indian School. They also wish for the telegraph line to be continued up to as far as the Indian School, or at least the telephone line. If the Dept. will decide upon giving due consideration to the Indians in their requests through me, in these matters, I shall be only too well pleased to take charge of same upon establishment, at a reasonable compensation. A mail service through Marble Mountain way via Big Harbor Island, P.O., is very slow, and very inconvenient in cases of any pressing mail matter. The electors of Big Harbor Road need very badly a mail service direct from S.S. River Denis, P.O., for which they petition through our monthly representative Dr. A.W. Chisholm, the Dept. Post Office, and the Indians of the Malagawatch Indian Reservation, through your humble correspondent, beg leave to pray the Indian Dept. for the establishment of a mail service direct from S.S. River Denis via the proposed post office at Big Harbor Road to the\nIndian School on the Malagawatch Indian Reservation. In addition to this the Indians also beg of the Indian Dept. for the establishment of a telegraph line, and telephone line to the Indian School on the Malagawatch Indian Reserve, and I have not the slightest doubt but that their requests shall be duly considered as being worthy of approval by the Indian Dept.\n\nThrusting you in behalf of the Indians on the Malagawatch Indian Reservation in anticipation of your prompt and careful consideration to their humble request, through your most humble correspondent, I beg leave to remain,\n\nYour humble servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n\"Indian Teacher\"\nOttawa, May 10, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo reporting again upon the night school being conducted by you on the Malagawatch Indian Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to learn that your work in this line is meeting with success. The reports referred to by you have not yet been received from the Rev. D. McPherson, the Indian Agent, but will no doubt come to hand in due time.\n\nIn reference to the establishment of a mail service from Big Harbor Road to the Malagawatch Reserve I beg to say that this is a matter which should be taken up with the Post Office Department. In view, however, of the fact that you have at present a post office within 2\u00bd miles of the reserve the Department is of opinion that it would be difficult to persuade the Post Office Department that an office should be established on the reserve.\n\nThe extension of the telephone system is a matter which rests entirely with the company operating the line.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nArsene Burns, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nBig Harbor Island P.O., N.S.\nDear Sir:-\n\nI have much pleasure in acknowledging the receipt of your esteemed favour of the 10th Inst., and with farther ref. to the night school conducted by me on the Malagawatch Indian Reservation, I can only repeat that it, as usual, meeting with a continuance of regular attendance, rapid progress and on the whole complete success; and I have not the least doubt by this time that you have received very satisfactory reports from Rev. D. McPherson, the Indian Agent, to that effect, for he had promised me most faithfully that he would, with much pleasure, lose no time in rushing forth to the Department a most satisfactory report in token of his very deep appreciation of my success with both day and night school on the Indian Reserve,\n\nArsene Burns\nIndian Teacher.\nOttawa, June 10, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThe Department has had two reports from Mr. Arsene Burns, teacher of the Malakawatch Indian school, dealing with his work in connection with the night classes and in both of these reports he has made reference to your visits and expressed the supposition that no doubt the Department has received from you reports.\n\nNo reports from you would appear to have been received and the Department would be glad to hear from you in regard to Mr. Burns' work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nsecretary.\n\nRev. D. MacPherson,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendale, N.S.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo.\n\nIn reference to the night School conducted by Mr. A. Burns at Malagawatch in this agency I beg to report as follows:\n\nI visited the school on April 27, 1910. The school was opened April 8, 1910 with 6 present.\n\nAverage attendance from April 18 to April 27 was 8.4.\n\nOn April 27th, 14 present of which 3 married men and 8 women.\n\n7 present attending day School School, is said to begin at 7:30 p.m., Continuing to 9:30.\n\nAll the day scholars including Mr. Burns' family usually attend evening School.\n\nI again visited the school about May 8th but found teacher absent.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nD. MacPherson, P.P.\nIndian Agent.\n\nAs teacher had to start with materia prima in this school one visit could give no idea of work done and benefit accruing.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOttawa, July 19, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant reporting upon the night school conducted at Malgawatch by the teacher, Mr. A. Burns.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the attendance would appear to be favourable and the Department would be very glad if you would visit the school at intervals and report as to the progress being made by those who are attending the classes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev.

A supply of the ordinary forms will, however, be sent you, upon which you can give the statement of attendance.\n\nIt is not considered advisable to re-open the night school at least till late in the autumn, as the attendance would during the busy season in all probability be very small. As soon as a final decision is arrived at you will be advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nsecretary.\n\nArsene Burns, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nBig Harbor Island P.O., N.S.\nOttawa, July 27, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Burns, teacher of the Malagawatch school, has asked the Department whether the night school should be continued or not and he has been informed that it is not considered advisable to re-open it at least till late in the autumn.\n\nBefore a final decision is arrived at the Department would like to have a report from you on the work done, so that it will know whether the results justify the expense. Only one report has been received from the Agent, Rev. D. MacPherson, and from this report it would appear that the day pupils attend the evening classes. You will be good enough to ascertain definitely how many of the Indians, for whom this night school was opened, are taking advantage of it. It is thought that the tuition furnished during the day should be sufficient for the younger children. In the meantime no action will be taken until your report is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgogne, N.S.\n\nSecretary.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th ultimo, No. 315278/2, I regret not being able to report favourably with regard to the night school opened some months ago at Malagawatch for the benefit of the adult young Indians of that place.\n\nSpeaking to Mr. Arsene Burns in May, I notified him that I would visit Malagawatch again before the end of the quarter to inspect the night school conducted by him. Accordingly, at 5.30 on the evening of June 27th., I went to the school, but found it closed. Presently, however, Mr. Burns presented himself, and I inquired why his night school was not in session. He answered that it had just been dismissed, saying also that he thought the hour was much later, and blaming his timepiece for deceiving him. I then asked if he could re-assemble, without much trouble, the night scholars who \"had just been dismissed\", or some of them, so that I might have an opportunity of seeing what was being done. He said he would be glad to do so, and in a very short time several children presented themselves in the school room. But I soon discovered, to my surprise, that they were the pupils attending the day school also, and Mr. Burns acknowledged such to be the case.\n\nFrom all I could learn on that occasion, it would seem that those for whom the night school was intended, have not been taking advantage of it; and I very much fear that they are not likely to improve the opportunity in future.\n\nHowever, it might not be the part of wisdom to close the school permanently. I would advise closing it during the present, and\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOFFICE OF THE INDIAN SUPERINTENDENT,\n\nRIVER BOURGEOIS, N.S.\n\nand the ensuing quarter; and in the meantime, if the Indians interested can show good and sufficient reasons why it should be re-opened, the matter can be considered and a decision reached in time to open again the school about the beginning of the winter quarter.\n\nThose who would be expected to attend a night school are usually absent from June to December.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of No.\n\nI received Teacher Burns' report for night school but not legible last night. I enclose it herewith. Perhaps you can do without my signature. If so, please let me know this that perhaps we did not get it and yet they may not be much in reality or in your district opinion. After what he says about the money he could make return on ordinary form he ought to have for three to him to that effect even a month ago.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nDonald MacPherson\nIndian Agent.\nBig Harbor Island, N.B.\nSimcoe Co., N.S.\nAugust 1910.\n\nTo Rev. Dan MacKinnon, C.B.,\nIndian Agent,\nPlendale, C.B.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose you herewith Return for Night School which I have fixed in as soon as I know how and hope you will have Cheque for same posted forward as soon as it will be possible for the Dept. to do so cause I am really much in need of funds to meet my own obligations. Had I known that I should have used the same form of Return as for Day School you would have\nhave received my return since about a month ago this would have been a great saving of inconvenience to me.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nAnna Burns\nIndian Teacher\nRev.

It would appear that very few Indians for whom this night school was instituted took advantage of the opportunity afforded and at any rate it is only during the winter season that there is any prospects of even a fair attendance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Secretary.\n\nArsene Burns, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nBig Harbor Island P. O. N. S.\nHouse of Commons\n\n[Signature]\n\nAugust 25, 1910\n\n369391\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThere has been a night school in operation at the Metagamalah mission reservation last winter, under the guidance of Mrs. Burns, teacher. From information I get there has been very good work done, and I am convinced this is a most desirable move and will be productive of good results. I trust you will have this night school continued during the whole of next term.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, August 31st., 1910.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th instant with reference to the continuance of the night school conducted for some time before the summer holidays at the Malagawatch Indian School and in reply I beg to say that the Department has decided that it would not be advisable to re-open the night school at least until the winter season sets in. All the reports and returns of attendance received show that very few of those in whose interest this night school was instituted take advantage of the opportunity afforded. Nearly all the pupils enrolled were also in attendance during the day and it is not considered necessary to provide a night school for these young children as the hours of confinement in the daytime are long enough for them.\n\nThe Department is further advised that there will be no prospect of securing a good attendance of adult Indians before the end of December.\n\nFurther consideration will be given this matter and if circumstances warrant it the school will be re-opened during the months of January, February and March.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. W. Chisholm, Esq., M.D., M.P.,\nMargaree Harbour,\nC. B.\n\nSecretary.\nBig Harbor Island, N.S.\nDecember 12th, 1910\n\nTo J. D. McClean, Esq.,\nActing Deputy Secretary\nOttawa, Ont., Can.\n\nSir, I beg to inform you that the Mic Macs of the Malagawach Indian Reserve are now all back home with the exception of one family which is not expected to show up until May, and they are again anxious to have the \"Night School\" started. I understand from Mr. Bisholm, Esq., M.P. for Simcoe Co., that you were to have the Night School opened on this Reserve at the beginning of the next school quarter, which would be very satisfactory both to the Indians and myself. As the nights are long in the winter months, and as some of the night scholars have had a good beginning last spring, and have taken an interest in education, I would suggest that at least three hours teaching be allowed them per evening. Now, as this current quarter is nearing to a close, I would be pleased to hear from you favorably with me, to the opening of the night school at the beginning of the next quarter.\n\nBelieve me, Your obedient servant,\n\nArchie Burns\nIndian Teacher\nOttawa, December 19, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant in reference to the re-opening of the night school on the Malagawatch reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is of opinion that the results produced last year were hardly such as were anticipated. Your return showed that there were 24 pupils enrolled in the night school, but 17 of those were day school pupils, leaving only 7 of those Indians for whose special purpose the classes were instituted who took advantage of them. It is not considered necessary that the day school pupils should attend the night classes; in fact the hours of confinement during the daytime are thought to be quite long enough provided faithful work is done during the period. Unless, therefore, there is an assurance that a considerably larger number of the adult Indians would attend these classes it is not considered advisable to continue them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nArsene Burns, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nBig Harbor Island P.O., N.S.\nSir\u2014With reference to your official letter of the 17th inst. I humbly beg to submit to you the following touching on the Night School Proposition:\n\nOf the 44 pupils enrolled in the night school for the quarter ending June 30, 1910, there are 17 adult Indians over 16 years of age as follows: Mrs. Peter Hervey 29 yrs. old; Mrs. Michael Joe, 26 yrs. old; Mrs. Tom Bernard, 27 yrs.; Miss Magdalen Doucet 27 yrs.; Miss Harriet Michael, 22 yrs.; Miss Mary Lewis, 19 yrs.; Tom Joe, 17 yrs.; Tom Bernard, 29 yrs.; Noel Hervey, 65 yrs.; Michael Paul, 38 yrs.; Peter Hervey, 33 yrs.; Francis Hervey, 20 yrs.; Solomon Paul, 26 yrs.; Jim Joe, Indian Capt., 32 yrs.; Michael Marshall, 28 yrs.; Tom Cool, 17 yrs.; Stephen Simon, 17 yrs.\n\nOf these 17 adult Indians the following day school as follows during the same period or quarter in which they attended night school: Mrs. Peter Hervey, 12 days; Mrs. Michael Joe, 4 \" Mrs. Tom Bernard, 0 \"\nMiss Magdalene Doucet, 26 days\nMiss Harriet Michael Joe, 17\nMiss Mary Lewis Joe, 5\nMr. Tom Joe, 3\nMr. Tom Bernard, 2\nMr. Noel Henney, 0\nMr. Michael Paul, 1\nMr. Peter Henney, 0\nMr. Francis Henney, 1\nMr. Solomon Paul, 0\nMr. Jim Joe, Indian Capt., 0\nMr. Michael Marshall, 0\nMr. Tom Boyd, 1\nMr. Stephen Simon, 0\n\nWith the exception of two, viz.: Miss Magdalene Doucet and Miss Harriet Michael Joe, the others have merely attended the day school on the strength of their attending the night school, and then for a very limited number of days, which would certainly have escaped their attention, were it not that the night school had awakened their interest in education. This is their own statement to me, and at a recent gathering which the Indians held today with me, the following have\nsubscribed their names with the assurance that they would give a good attendance if favored with the reopening of the Night School.\n\nv.g.: Jim Joe, Indian Capt.\n\nPeter Henney, Francis Henney\nMagdalen Henney, Tom Boal,\nTom Bernard, Mary Lewis Joe,\nSandy Deny, Mrs. Sandy Deny,\nMichael Marshall, Michael Lewis Joe,\nTom Lewis Joe, Mary Michael Joe,\nNoul Bernard, Michael Joe,\nMagdalen Dorcet.\n\nTo make sure of fulfilling their promise they decided to strike off the doubtful ones. Judging from the interest they apparently had at the meeting, I am safe in assuming you a fair attendance, if favored with the reopening of the Night School. And as those adult Indians tell me that their occupations will prevent them from the attendance of the day school, I cannot too strongly recommend a continuance of the experiment so well begun.\n\nThey wanted me to form them a petition, but I did not deem it necessary. So, however, it should be considered.\nadvisable I shall certainly be pleased to draw them one which they will readily sign. Believe me\n\nYours truly,\n\nArchie Burns,\nIndian Teacher\nOttawa, January 12, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo in further reference to the re-opening of the night school on the Malagawatch reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the return of the day school for the December quarter has just come to hand and from the very poor attendance there leads the Department to the decision that these Indians are not sufficiently interested in educational matters to warrant the operation of a night school. In fact, unless a decided improvement in the attendance at the day school takes place before the end of the current quarter, the matter of closing the school will have to be considered, as the Department would not be justified in continuing the large expenditure with such very poor results. The average attendance during the December quarter was only a little over four and for the September quarter, last, only 2.76. The Department will look to you to produce a decided improvement during the present quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nArsene Burns, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nBig Harbor Island P.O., N.S.\nSir,-\n\nThe documents enclosed herewith will, I trust, explain themselves, and serve to indicate my attitude on the subject of a night school at Malagawatch.\n\nMy opinion is that the amount involved in operating a night school there would be money spent to little or no purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Supt.\n\nJ.

But in view of the fact that these same petitioners neglected to embrace the opportunity presented to them last winter, when a night-school was operated for their particular benefit, through the liberality of the Department, prompted by its ever present desire to promote the welfare of our Indians in every respect, I do not feel disposed to recommend granting the prayer of petitioners by reopening the night-school this year.\n\nI shall simply send the memorial with a copy of this letter to the Department, leaving the authorities at Ottawa to deal with the matter as may seem fit to them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Supt.\n\nMr. Arsene Burns,\nTeacher,\nBig Harbour Island,\nInverness Co., N.S.\nOttawa, January 20, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant with enclosures relative to the re-opening of the night school at Maligawatch.\n\nIn reply I beg to forward for your information a copy of the last communication sent to the teacher on this subject.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Your remuneration for this work will be at the rate of 50 cents per hour. It is to be hoped that you will be able to secure a more regular attendance than you did last year. While the enrolment last year was very good the average attendance was poor. You should keep your register of attendance accurately and on March 31st next, you should forward a separate return through the office of the local agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

It was thought hardly fair to pass final judgment upon the success of the scheme with only one winter's experience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.B.\nBig Harbour Island, N.S.\n\nJanuary 23, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, and carefully note its contents.\n\nIn my humble estimation, it is a mistake to believe that the Indians of the Malagawatch Reserve are not sufficiently interested in educational matters to warrant the operation of a night-school for the current quarter and at least two months of the next; for it is only about the first of July that the Indians begin to leave the reserve to go to the neighbouring towns, the seashore, etc., for a means of livelihood.\n\nThe attendance in the day school is now as good as can be expected from the number of children of school age on the Malagawatch Reserve. There is an enrollment of ten on the register, and these give a regular attendance.\n\nPermit me to observe that I believe there is a moral responsibility attached to the neglect of teachers towards the educational interests and general welfare of the Indians, which I for one have no desire to share, and as I am\nreasonably sure in this regard that compensating results will ensue, I feel that I cannot too strongly recommend granting the prayers of the Indians by the roofing of the night-school for the current and ensuing quota for their particular benefit, though the liberality of the Department prompted by its ever present desire to promote the welfare of our Indians in every respect.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nArchie Burns,\n\"Indian Teacher\"\n\nJ.R.

I may add that the Department wishes you to devote a portion of the time each evening to practical talks on domestic science, cleanliness, sanitation, ventilation, preparation of food and citizenship. You will also forward at the end of each week a statement showing the pupils enrolled, their ages and the number of evenings present in class.

The Department cannot understand this explanation. You state that you taught on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, although Wednesday was one of the regular nights on which the school was to be in operation.

The enrolment and average attendance at this school have been growing less and less during the past year and unless there is a decided improvement between now and the 31st of December the Department will be forced to close the school and, should this action be taken, your services will of course be no longer required. Much will depend upon the result of your own efforts with the Indian parents and children to produce the desired result. It is thought only just to give you reasonable warning in order that, in case there is no decided improvement, you may take the necessary steps to look for other employment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nArsene Burns, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nMalagawatch Indian School,\nBig Harbor Island P.O., N.S.\nOttawa, October 12, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the September quarterly return of the Malagawatch School which shows an enrolment of two with an average attendance of one. The enrolment and average attendance at this school have been growing less and less during the past year and Mr. Burns, the teacher, has been informed that unless there is a decided improvement between now and the 31st of December the Department will be forced to close the school and, should this action be taken, his services will no longer be required.\n\nI may say that the Department is not aware of the reasons which have led to this state of affairs on the reserve, but apparently there is something wrong. I should be pleased to have a special report from you as some action must be taken to improve conditions. There is no use in keeping this school open with such a small attendance. If the fault lies with the Indians some measures must be taken to force them to send their children to the school, on the other hand if the fault lies with the teacher it will be necessary to make a change.

I don't if he is back now. This man who did about as he pleased, like the others I should have something to do with an agent, is singularly fortunate in being on the right side of politics again. He was slated for dismissal if the old Government had remained in power. You figured on me as a dyed in the wool Indian and you gave me no say in the affairs over which no agent I ought to have control. I could have resigned but that would not help the Indians any although it would have relieved me of a good deal of humiliation and bother. So Mr. Burns going to do as he pleases with the school? What about his salary for period school is closed? In case he gets a more satisfying job for which he is likely finding should I not have the choosing of his successor? What is the agent, for if not to handle the Dept's business in his district?\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6047, file 254-1, part 1)\nOttawa, November 27, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant in reference to the absence from duty of Mr. Burns, teacher of the Malagawatch school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the necessary action will be taken when the returns are received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. D. MacPherson,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendale, C.B.\nOFFICE OF THE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL.\nOTTAWA.\n\nDecember 1, 1911.\n\nThe Chief Accountant,-\n\nIt is represented that the Indian school at Malagawatch should not be closed for the winter, and that, in addition to the day school, there should be a night school. Will you please let me have a memo. with reference to this.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nOttawa, December 2, 1911.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nThe Indian school at Malagawatch Reserve is conducted by Mr. Arsene Burns. The average attendance at this school has been so small that some action had to be taken and Superintendent Boyd was written to on October 12th and informed that unless there was a decided improvement in the attendance between that date and the 31st of December we would be forced to close the school and Mr. Burns' services would be no longer required. Mr. Boyd has not yet reported and we would, of course, take no hasty action in closing the school. It was with the intention of improving the attendance that this statement was made.\n\nThe following is a statement of the enrolment and average attendance:\n\n|                | Enrolment | Average |\n|----------------|-----------|---------|\n| June quarter, 1910 | 20        | 5.7     |\n| Sept.          | 7         | 2.7     |\n| Dec.           | 9         | 4.2     |\n| March 1911     | 15        | 7       |\n| June           | 6         | 2       |\n| Sept.          | 2         | 1       |\n\nYou will agree, I think, that this is a very poor showing.\nWhen Mr. Burns heard that we were conducting a night school at Whycocomagh he made application for permission to conduct a night school also. He conducted this night school during April, May and June, 1910, with an enrolment of 24 and an average of 8.9. For this we paid him $76.25.\n\nBetween January 30th and March 31st, 1911, the school was resumed and he had an enrolment of 16 and an average attendance of 10 and we paid him $36.00. His remuneration for this extra tuition was 50 cents an hour for two hours a week night for five evenings a week. The salary paid him as teacher of the day school is $400.00 per annum. There is accommodation for residence at the school, which is away from any white settlement. Mr. Burns must take hold of his work and make this school a success if it is to be kept open. We should not be called upon to employ such an unsuccessful teacher.\n\n[Signature]\nSir,-\n\nWith reference to your letter of October 12th., No. 315275/1, I have to state that the almost negative attendance of pupils for the past quarter at the Malagawatch school is due to the fact that all the Indian families but one belonging to that Reserve, and having children who might attend school, left the place last Spring and are only now returning to it. That is their annual custom, and consequently the Reserve is almost deserted every summer.\n\nI discussed the situation with the teacher recently, and he admitted that it was useless to keep the school open in Summer under prevailing conditions. But in winter time, he believes it would be of advantage to the Malagawatch Indians to have both the day, and night, school in operation.\n\nMalagawatch Indians are the most backward among the Micmacs of Nova Scotia, and progress will be slow in any movement making for their advancement. What should be done by way of inducing them to remain at home the year round, beyond what has already been done, I am absolutely unable to suggest. But, at any rate, I would recommend keeping the school open during the months of Jany. Feby. March, Apl. and May, while present conditions exist. Suitable teachers can be got who would be willing to engage for these months in the school at a pro rata salary paid the present teacher, who, of course, would continue in charge during the coming Winter and Spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nIndian Department.\nOttawa, December 19, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report from Mr. Superintendent Boyd in reference to the continuance of the Malagawatch Indian Day School. In this report Mr. Boyd states that he discussed the matter with you.\n\nThe Superintendent says that owing to the nomadic habits of the Indians during the summer time it is useless to expect an attendance that would warrant keeping the school open during those months. The suggestion is made that the school be kept open, while present conditions exist, during the months of January, February, March, April and May and the Department approves of this suggestion.\n\nIt is understood that you will be willing to continue your services during these five months at the salary now paid you and that the school will then close to re-open next fall or winter.\n\nThe Superintendent further states that you think it would be to the advantage of the Indians to continue the night school. The Department is prepared to make the same arrangement for this work as it did last year, viz\u2014 that you conduct classes on Monday, Wednesday and Friday evenings of each week during the three months, January, February and March, for a session of two hours each night. Your remuneration for this work will be at the rate of 50 cents per hour. You will keep a separate register of attendance.\n\nArsene Burns, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nMalagawatch Indian School,\nBig Harbor Island P.O., N.B.\ndance for the night school and report to the Department at the end of each month, showing the name, age and attendance of each pupil enrolled.

Kindly signify by return mail your acceptance of the above terms.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, December 19, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department has authorized Mr. Burns, teacher of the Malagawatch Indian school, to continue the night classes during the months of January, February and March upon the same terms as last year, viz.\u2014that he conduct classes on Monday, Wednesday and Friday evenings of each week during the three months for a session of two hours each night.

I humbly beg to state that I shall be pleased to continue my services with the day classes in the Malagawatch Indian School during the five months of January, February, March, April and May for the salary of four hundred dollars; but with reference to the evening classes, I would much prefer, in behalf of the considerable number of adult Indians on the Reserve, who cannot take advantage of the day school, that the same arrangements be made as in the winter of 1910, viz.: five evenings per week, for a session of two and a half hours per night.\n\nMeanwhile, awaiting your further instructions at an early date, I beg to remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It is to be understood that this means at the rate of $400.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nArsene Burns, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nMalagawatch Indian School,\nBig Harbor Island, P.O., N.S.\nInverness, N.S., Jan 8/12, 191\n\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Malagawatch Indian School\n\nWith regard to the project of keeping this school open during five months only, and closing it during the summer, I would beg to state that this is probably the best thing to do under the conditions that prevail on that Indian Reserve. There is one thing, however, that I would wish to bring to your attention. I think it would be unfair to expect that the teacher would work during five months only, and to receive pay at the rate at which he is now paid. What I mean is this, that he should not be expected to teach for five months, and receive only five twelfths of a year's pay. For as you may well understand, the fact of a person being engaged for part of the year debars him to a large extent, from earning what he otherwise might, during vacation. It is very hard for a person to enter upon any clerkship or any other such position for a part of the year only. The result is that the teacher will run a chance of being practically without employment during the period that the school is closed. I would therefore, suggest that Mr. Burns' salary for the period during which the school is open, be the whole salary now paid him for the year, or as near thereto as possible.\n\nTrusting that this matter may receive your favourable consideration, I remain,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTHOS. GALLANT\nBarrister, Solicitor, Etc.\nOttawa, January 15, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant in reference to the salary of the teacher of the Malagawatch Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that it cannot adopt your suggestion to pay Mr. Burns a salary of $400.00 for the five months, which would be approximately at the rate of $800.00 per annum. Presumably Mr. Burns will be able to obtain other employment during the seven months when he will not be engaged as teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. Gallant, Esq.,\nBarrister, Solicitor, etc.,\nInverness, N.S.\nOttawa, February 1, 1912.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nThe last census returns show that there were 38 members of the Malagawatch Band all told. To provide for the education of the children of this band a new school-house was built about two and a half years ago and Mr. Arsene Burns was placed in charge as teacher at a salary of $400.00 per annum. The school was opened in January 1910 with an enrolment of 17 and an average attendance of 11 for the first quarter.\n\nMr. Burns was given an extra allowance of 50 cents per hour for holding a night school and was allowed $25.00 a year as caretaker. In addition to this he has quarters for himself and family, wife and five children, fuel and light.\n\nThe attendance has been so unsatisfactory that Mr. Superintendent Boyd recommended that the school should only be kept open during the months of January, February, March, April and May (five months) that is why the present conditions exist. The Indians are nomadic and nearly all of them are absent from the reserve during the remainder of\nthe year. The Superintendent says that suitable teachers could be obtained who would be willing to engage for the five months at a pro ratio salary of that at present paid. Mr. Burns was informed of the Superintendent's recommendation and he offered to teach the school for the five months at the salary now paid him, which would be at the rate of $500.00 per annum. This is out of reason as there are only 14 children of school age on the reserve and he would only be teaching for half the school year. I consider that Mr. Burns would be amply remunerated if he were allowed at the rate of $500.00 per annum for the five months, which is approximately $50.00 per month. He would still have his night school, which nets him about $75.00 for the season and his allowance for caretaking and his lodging and other incidentals. If you approve of this suggestion and Mr. Burns accepts the offer it should be on the distinct understanding that the school is only open for the five months.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, February 5, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to the personal interview had with you last week and correspondence on the subject of the salary of the teacher of the Malagawatch Indian Day School I beg to say that the Department will be prepared to pay Mr. Arsene Burns, the teacher of this school, a salary of $50.00 a month for the five months which it is proposed to keep the school open. The Department considers that this would be ample remuneration and he would still have his night school, which nets him about $75.00 for the season, his allowance for the caretaking and his lodgings. The Department trusts that this arrangement will be satisfactory as it is the best which it can consider under the circumstances.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. Gallant, Esq.,\nBarrister, Solicitor, etc.,\nInverness, N.S.\nBIG HARBOR ISLAND,\nInverness Co., N. S., Can., Feb. 191\n\n358796\n\nSir - In your letter of January 5th, I notice that from the beginning you meant my salary to be at the rate of $400 per annum, or equal to a salary of $66.66 for the five months' service with the day school. I meant $400 for 5 mos.\n\nNow, as you are no doubt aware, the Malagawatch Indian Reserve, is an out of the way place, and six miles from the nearest store, ten miles from the nearest medical doctor. To hire a team to haul a barrel of flour for me, I have to walk two miles and a half to the very nearest to the school. Then with the flour as with everything else coming in, I have to be very liberal with the Mic Mac nation, to keep on friendly terms with them. They are not yet the civilized Mic Macs of Whycoomack or Kejimkujik although they are improving fast. I manage to keep on friendly terms with them and to keep up their interest in school. On the whole they are generally obedient to me, but I have to be very liberal with them. It is expensive to get to the Indian Reserve and to get away from it. It is a most expensive place to live in, and for the sake of my health\n\nJ. D.

In this I have more\ntrouble than in anything else, but they have suffered\nsome in their filthy habits and very few have been\nsick of late. They are beginning to understand\nbetter the danger of consumption.\n\nAgain, considering the fact that I am\npractically thrown out of employment for the\nrest of the year, and that it is to the interest\nof the general public to have the mic more\nbrought to light of better civilization, I therefore\nhave to humbly ask of your honourable government\nto favourably consider giving me the salary of $150.00\nfor the five months, or as near thereof as possible.\n\nAnd your humble and obedient servant, as\nin duty bound will ever pray,\n\nJ.

Indian School that I be appointed to the position.\n\nI belong to Inverness County. I hold a Class B. License & a N.Sch. First Rank Diploma.

Should, however, one occur your application will be noted. I may inform you that the Department would not be prepared to pay anything like the salary you ask.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJas. D.

Mr. Gallant was told that this was the best offer the Department was prepared to make and it would like to know definitely whether you will accept it or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nArsene Burns, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nMalagawatch Indian School,\nBig Harbor Island, N.S.\nI am pleased to let you know definitely that I am fully agreed to accept for my services as teacher with the day school on the Malagawatch Indian Reserve, your offer to pay me $50.00 a month for the five months, as outlined in your letter to Mr. Gallant, Barrister of Innercass of the 5th ult., and confirmed in your official letter to me bearing date February 23/912 and No. 315 275-1, and that as usual, I will do my utmost to bring the natives to the light of day from an educational standpoint.\n\nBelieve me, Yours sincerely,\n\nArsene Burns,\nIndian Teacher\nInverness, N.S., April 29th 1912\n\nFrank Pedley Esq.,\nSuperintendent General Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am informed that the enrolment at the Indian school at Malagawatch is larger than at the corresponding season last year; that two families intend moving, before long, into this reserve, from North Sydney, and that the prospects for a reasonable average attendance are now very good.\n\nI would, therefore, ask your favorable consideration for the keeping open of this school until the regular holidays. I think Mr. Boyd, the Indian Superintendent, will bear me out in this.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, May 8, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo in reference to the Malagawatch School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the attendance for the past quarter was only 36, which is a trifle over half the attendance for the same quarter last year. Under the circumstances the Department cannot favourably consider keeping the school open during the month of June.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos.

General Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIf the department closes this school before the regular closing, I would suggest that some consideration be given the teacher in compensation for the fact that he may, so to speak, lose the benefit of the summer holidays. As I understand it, the regular summer holidays are taken out of the quarter from July 1st to Sept. 30th, and the teachers get paid for this the same as for any other quarter. I would therefore recommend that Mr. Burns be given some allowance for the comparatively long vacation which he will have. In any event, owing to the conditions that prevail on the Malagawatch Reserve, I trust that the Department will deal as leniently as possible with Mr. Burns, who is doing very good work in connection with the school and with every other matter confided to him by the Department at that reservation.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTHOS. GALLANT\nAttorney, Solicitor, Etc.\nOttawa, June 4, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that in counting salaries in our schools the holidays are not taken into consideration. There are 200 teaching days in the year and all payments are based on this number. It must be remembered that Mr. Burns is paid by the month at the rate of $50.00 a month for five months and in making this payment the Department has already made an allowance for the long holidays that he will have in as much as his salary was raised from $400.00 to that above stated, which approximately is at the rate of $500.00 per annum. Considering the very small attendance the Department considers that it is dealing very fairly with Mr. Burns and it will expect better returns in regard to the attendance in future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. Gallant, Esq.,\nBarrister, Solicitor, etc.,\nInverness, N.S.\nInverness, N.S., May 30th, 1912\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nGeneral Supt. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSince forwarding my communication to you dated May 25th, on this subject, I have had some correspondence with Mr. Bruns, the teacher, and he suggests another arrangement, which I would submit for your consideration. This proposition is that the school be kept open as usual until the summer holidays, and that it be re-opened at the usual time and kept in session until the last of September; and that it then be closed for the ensuing quarter, namely from October 1st to December 31st.\n\nI would submit this proposition for your favourable consideration. It seems to me that this might be the most convenient arrangement.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTHOS. GALLANT\nBarrister, Solicitor, Etc.\nOttawa, June 7, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is not disposed to change the arrangement already made with regard to the Malagawatch School. The attendance during the summer is so small that the Department would not be justified in incurring the expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. Gallant, Esq.,\nBarrister, Solicitor, etc.,\nInverness, N.S.\nInverness, N.S., June 17th 1912\n\nFrank Peiley, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your several communication with regard to the Malagawatch Indian School. I admit that the attendance has been rather low, but I think there are possibilities of increasing it. I am given to understand that there are several families moving from North Sydney and other reservations. If the attendance for June shows an appreciative increase, could the department at all consider the advisability of keeping the school in operation until the last of September.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos. Gallant\nOttawa, June 26, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 17th instant in further reference to the Malagawatch School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that if your suggestion were carried out the school would be open almost nine months and as there are only ten school months in the year it would be well to keep it open the full term. This arrangement, however, could not be carried out unless the attendance would warrant it and furthermore the salary would have to be reduced to the figure previously allowed, viz.\u2014$400.00 per annum. It is, therefore, considered advisable to adhere to the present arrangement for this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. Gallant, Esq.,\nBarrister, Solicitor, etc.,\nInverness, N.S.\nSir,\n\nMr Burns, teacher on the Malagawatch Reserve, wrote me that he discontinued school May 31st. As I do not likely go back there, please instruct me in making application for salary. Have you ordered the school discontinued? If so, when?\n\nYour obedient servant,\nD.MacPherson P.K.,\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\n[Stamp: Schools Board]\nJUL 4 1912\nOttawa, July 5, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that an arrangement was made whereby for the current year the school would be kept open for five months from January to the end of May. Mr. Burns was to be paid at the rate of $50.00 a month for these five months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. D. MacPherson,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendale, N.S.\nof the Indians are returning to the Reserve from North Sydney and other places whither they have been living for sometime past.\n\nTo my mind, of preventing the nomadic habits of the Indians is to encourage agriculture among them. I may also state that it sometimes arises that Mr. Burns has to give little assistance to the Indians in some form or other either in provisions or some other manner; each individual item may be small but still when it is repeated it counts up. I think that the Supt. will bear me up in this. In view of the above and in view of the fact it is very necessary to have Mr. Burns stay at the Reserve, until harvest time, I would recommend that he be paid for the quarter ending Sept. 30th. Then when the Department issues curtail the school term, the school may be closed during the quarter ending December 31st, this would give Mr. Burns an opportunity to go somewhere and earn something for himself and family, during that time. School could then begin January 1st. or perhaps it may be decided to leave the school open continually, in view of the fact that the attendance is increasing.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you on this subject, and in the interest of the Indians I would recommend everything possible be done for Mr. Burns.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nInverness, N.S., September 6th,\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe Indian School at Malgawatch.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. Burns who notifies me that he kept the School open during the month of June. I understand that he consulted the Supt. of this and that the latter agreed to have the school open in June, that being the case I would recommend he be paid for that month, June. I would also recommend that Mr. Burns be paid for the quarter ending September 30th. You are doubtless aware that conditions at this Reserve are more or less peculiar and the position of the teacher is difficult enough. Mr. Burns has a family at Malgawatch, and has aided the Indians in many respects, and is interested very much in farming operations, especially this season. He might have gone away during the holidays to earn something for himself, but in this case there would be no one left to guide the Indians in the matter of agriculture. I think that I could safely say that according to Mr. Burns there will be a fine crop at Reseau this year, moreover, some\nOttawa, September 13, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant asking that Mr. Arsene Burns be paid for his services as teacher of the Malagawatch School for the month of June.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the explicit conditions on which Mr. Burns' salary was increased to the rate of $50.00 per month for five months and furthermore in view of the fact that the average attendance for the June quarter shows practically no increase, the Department regrets that it cannot comply with your request that he be paid for the months of June and September.\n\nThe conditions at this school are such that the Department would not be at all warranted in paying a salary at the rate of $500.00 per annum, when it is known that the Indians are absent from the reserve and the children cannot, therefore, attend.\n\nIt is regretted that Mr. Burns appears unwilling to stand by the agreement entered into when the present arrangement was made, the terms of which were then agreed to by him, and you will readily recognize that it is not possible to pay him for work that cannot be performed, even though owing to conditions over which he may have no control.\n\nIn your letter you refer to the increasing attendance, from which the Department is lead to believe that conditions may not have been correctly represented to you.\n\nThos. Gallant, Esq.,\nBarrister, Solicitor, etc.,\nInverness, N.S.\nas the average for the June quarter was only 4 as compared with 3.6 for the previous quarter. This can hardly be looked upon as an increase sufficient to justify the continuance of the school during the summer months. In fact, if there is not a more decided improvement in the attendance during the time the children are on the reserve, it will be necessary for the Department to consider closing the school or obtaining the services of a teacher whose influence with the Indians may obtain better results. During the three winter months of 1912 the highest enrolment was but half the number of children of school age on the reserve, a condition which shows that there is fault somewhere.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I trust that the Department will reconsider this matter and do something for Mr. Burns. I have explained the facts in my last communication. He has certainly done some good by staying on the Reserve this summer. I think that the Supt. of Indian Agencies will bear me up in this.\n\nWith regard to attendance I admit that it is small, though increasing gradually.

General Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am informed through Mr. A.J. Boyd, Indian Superintendent, that the Dept. object to making any payments on account of services rendered as teacher at Malagawatch after the 31st of May last. In explanation of the fact that I kept the school open after that date, I may say that I was expressly instructed to do so by Superintendent Boyd. In view of that authorization, and of the fact that the attendance was improving, I continued teaching. It is no easy thing for me to maintain my family on the reservation under present conditions. I would respectfully ask, that in view of the above, some compensation be made to me for services rendered in good faith.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nFrances Burns,\n\"Indian Teacher\"\nMEMORANDUM\n\nSchools Branch -\n\nWill you please let me know if there is any objection to opening the school at Malagawatch, N. S., sometime either this month or the beginning of next.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nMr. Pedley,\n\nThe objections to opening the Malagawatch School before the 2nd of January are fully set forth in my memorandum of the 1st of February last, turned out on this file. The Indians do not return until Christmas and there would be no practical good in opening the school before the New Year. This was all pointed out to Mr. Burns, the teacher, who agreed to the present arrangement, and Mr. Gallant was also advised of the conditions on which the school was to be operated. Mr. Burns draws a salary of $250.00, $75.00 for holding a night school and $25.00 as caretaker, this makes $350.00 for five month's work, in addition to which Mr. Burns has free lodgings and other incidentals, such as fire and light. Compared with the salaries of the teachers of Nova Scotia Mr. Burns should have no complaint, as the following list will show:\n\n| School       | Average | Salary   |\n|--------------|---------|----------|\n| Bear River   | 8.7     | $400.00  |\n| Eskasoni     | 8.3     | 375.00   |\n| Indian Cove  | 21.7    | 310.00   |\n| School               | Average | Salary |\n|----------------------|---------|--------|\n| Malagawatch (5 months) | 4       | $350.00 |\n| Middle River         | 10      | 300.00 |\n| Millbrook            | 8.1     | 400.00 |\n| New Germany          | 7.4     | 350.00 |\n| Salmon River         | 11.7    | 350.00 |\n| Sydney               | 11.5    | 400.00 |\n| Whycocomagh          | 16.8    | 500.00 |\n| Shubenacadie         | 8.5     | 350.00 |\n\nYou will see from the foregoing list that the Malagawatch School has only an average attendance of four during the five months the Indians were on the reserve. As they are absent for the remaining five months of the school year it would reduce the average attendance to less than one, as there would be no attendance. Mr. Gallant should know that the school is maintained for the education of the Indian children and not entirely for the purpose of providing a salary for Mr. Burns. Taking all things into consideration he is the best paid Indian teacher in the province.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartha Benson\nOttawa, November 12, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo in reference to the payment of your salary since the 31st of May, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is communicating with Mr. Boyd, the Indian superintendent, in reference to your statement that he expressly instructed you to keep the school open. In this connection I may say that it would not appear from this that you had informed Mr. Boyd of the arrangement made between yourself and the Department that this school was to remain closed after the 31st of May.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 18th inst., I have to say that Mr. Burns' statement, which you quote, is hardly correct. He should have stated that he succeeded in persuading me that the Malagawatch Indian school should be kept in operation, and not not closed at the end of May as intended. I was not aware at the time of the new agreement as to salary entered into between him and the Department at the beginning of the year; otherwise, his arguments relative to keeping the school open might not have appealed to me as they did.\n\nBut Mr. Burns' claim for four months salary (1st. of June to 30th. Sept.) at $50 per month is not reasonable, as the school was closed all the months of July and August. His demand for extra services rendered as teacher should be for the months of June and September only.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. J. Boyd,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. Mclean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to yours of the 12th inst., No. 315275-1, I beg to say that apparently you are not conversant with the conditions that exist on this reserve. From the census it would appear that there are a number of children of school age in the vicinity of the school, and that they remain on the reserve. Now this I can assure you is not the case. The Indians here are very nomadic in their habits. They remain at home a couple of months in the winter and then they move to North Sydney or Sydney and build camps and stay there until they can find work to do.\n\nWhen Mr. Boyd came out as official agent last spring a number of families came back here and as a matter of course Mr. Boyd saw a splendid opportunity of having the children take advantage of going to school and ordered him to keep the school open. I was of the opinion that Mr. Boyd was cognizant of my arrangements with the Dept. However, he being my superior I thought it best to obey his orders. There was in my humble opinion no other course open to him, so he is always anxious to have the children brought under school influence.\ninfluence. So I wrote the school open in good faith, and when I found that my salary was not forthcoming I can assure that it has been due me for a great deal of trouble and worry. I have a family to support, besides I had some bills to pay when I took charge of this school combined with my duty of supporting myself and family made it necessary for me to considerize a good deal what I knew that I would not be paid before this would have taken advantage of another situation that was offered me for the summer months. I am now reduced to great straits in fact I have to rely on the generosity of some of my friends to get me through to support my family even for a month. I hope and pray that you will consider the justness of my claim and see that my salary is paid. I have told you the plain unvarnished truth and would respectfully urge you to Mr. Boyd, Rev. D. McPherson, Indian Agent, Sagamore, &c., &c., to Mr. A. McCauley Esq., General Manager at this place to consider my statement.\n\nI have the honor to be your obedient servant,\n\nJ. McCauley,\nIndian Teacher\nPost Office & School, Sagamore, Sagamore, Ont.\nOttawa, December 6, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nMr. Burns represents to the Department that he has kept the Malagawatch School open continuously during this year, although arranged that it should be closed at the end of May. If, however, he has kept the school open, the Department is prepared to pay him at his old salary of $400.00 per annum upon receipt of returns showing the attendance for the September and December quarters. He has been instructed to prepare these and forward them to the Department through your office. I may say that a return to June 30th has already been received.\n\nIt has also been decided to continue this school next year, but to keep it open only from the 3rd of January to the 31st of May and for these five months Mr. Burns is to be paid $50.00 per month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy Land Secretary.\n\nRev. D. MacPherson,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendale, O.B.\nOttawa, December 6, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo in further reference to payment for your services as teacher of the Malagawatch school during the past summer.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the circumstances, the Department has decided to allow you pay for the month of June and for the September and December quarters, upon receipt of properly certified returns for the last two quarters. Both these should be sent in at the same time through the office of the Indian Agent when the school closes for the Christmas holidays. Payment will, however, only be made at the rate of $400.00 per annum, which was the annual salary before the new arrangement was made.\n\nI may say that the Department is prepared to try the arrangement of conducting the school for five months, i.e., from the first of January to the 31st of May next year and, if the results are not better, the question of closing the school will have to be considered. You will, therefore, bear in mind that the school should be kept open from the 3rd of January to the 31st of May and you will be paid for these five months at the rate of $50.00 per month. The Department does not wish to have any\n\nArsene Burns, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nMalagawatch Indian School,\nBig Harbor Island, N.S.\nany trouble next year such as has been experienced this year and no change from this arrangement may be made without the express authorization of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

December 14, 1912.\n\nThe Schools Branch,-\n\nApplication is made to have an Indian night school kept open this year on the Malagawatch reserve, as heretofore. Will you kindly let me have a report with regard to this.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nOttawa, December 16, 1912.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nA night school has been conducted on the Malagawatch Reserve for the last two winters. Last year the enrolment was 9 and the average attendance was 6. There are only on this reserve according to the last census 17 people between the ages of 16 and 65. You will thus see that there is not much prospect of a flourishing night school. The school population has dwindled from 14 in 1911 to 6, due probably to the migration of the Indians. I cannot see that there would be much advantage from a night school, but it might be tried again for three nights a week during the months of January, February and March for two hours each evening, the teacher to be paid at the rate of 50 cents an hour.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, December 19, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Department has decided to try the experiment of the night school on the Malagawatch Reserve again this winter. You will be good enough to conduct the school for three evenings each week between the first of January and the closing of the school for the Easter holidays, which will be a little less than three months. The session should be two hours each night from seven to nine and the Department will remunerate you at the rate of 50 cents per hour. Last year you exceeded the number of sessions allowed and also taught two and a half hours instead of two hours, as instructed. This year no payment will be made for any time over and above the two hours nor for any number of sessions other than those above mentioned. The Department must have a report at the end of each week showing the attendance, the subjects taught and in the first report you should show the ages of those enrolled. When your return and requisition for salary are made at the end of March it will be necessary for you to show on the return the dates on which the school was held. This was not done last year. It is hoped that you will have a larger attendance than you succeeded in getting last year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nArsene Burns, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nMalagawatch Indian School,\nBig Harbor Island, N.S.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, December 19, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department has decided to continue the night school on the Malagawatch Reserve. The teacher has been instructed to hold classes three evenings each week from seven to nine from the first of January to the time of closing the school for the Easter holidays. His remuneration is to be at the rate of 50 cents per hour for the two hour session.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. D. MacPherson,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendale, C.B.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of No.\n\nI enclose returns from Mr. Greene Burns teacher on the Malagawatch Reserve, so the agreement sufficiently existing between the teacher and your Dept., seems to depend on something outside of my knowledge I can't very well sign for his salary for I have conventions elsewhere in doing so, perhaps Mr. Sup. Boyd who seems to have had a finger in having Mr. Burns teach even against your Dept.'s wishes can certify both accounts.

It is the first time I have had my way in such an appointment, and I appreciate the fact that you were permitted to acquiesce in my wishes. I know that you feel that I, as a priest, must have the interests of these poor people at heart and I am aware that you would let me have a free hand if politics permitted. Last summer, for instance, you would have had me spend the most money allotted to the reserves on this agency and in that case the poor Indians would have received some of the money spent, if not the most of it. It was a real shame that so little of it went to them.\n\nI expect to go to Malagawatch next week, Babot, for the first day and I feel assured that with encouragement received he will make good and thus be entitled to another term.\n\nThere is a young man, fellow, John Gosso, aged 18, of the Weygewonagh Reserve in whom I am taking particular interest. Will you not allow me about $5 to pay his expenses at the short course at the Jarvis Agricultural College? I took the course last year and showed Gosso and the Board would benefit by it.

Chisholm: Who is the Indian teacher at Malagawatch reserve, Nova Scotia?\n\nMr. Roche: I am not able to give the information just at the moment. I understand the school is closed at the present time.\n\nMr. A.W. Chisholm: Was there a teacher there last season?\n\nMr. Roche: I can get the information for my hon. friend later on.\n\nMr. A.W. Chisholm: I will come to the rescue of the minister. My information is that a young Indian teaches there and I would like to know whether he has the necessary qualifications.\n\nMr. Roche: I will get the information.\n\nMr. Carroll: I would like to refer to a matter that has been brought up in this House before. I refer to the teacher at St. Peter's, Provincial Inspector of schools, Mr. T.J. McNeil refused to visit or have anything to do with the school on the ground that the teacher was not qualified. This young man was appointed after Miss Devereaux's dismissal and I would like to know whether he has the necessary qualifications now.\n\nMr. Roche: I cannot tell the hon. member.\n\nMr. Carroll: It is a rather peculiar state of affairs if we are to pass estimates for Indian education all over the country without being in a position to know whether the teachers are qualified. I think the minister should be in a position to tell me whether licensed teachers or backwoodsmen are teaching the children in the Province of Nova Scotia in which I am interested.\n\nMr. Roche: I understand that no teacher is employed in any school unless he is properly qualified.\n\nMr. Carroll: Last year it was proved to the hilt in this House that the young man succeeding Miss Devereaux was not qualified under the Provincial Education Act of Nova Scotia.\n\nMr. Roche: I have a hazy recollection of having read the papers in connection with that and of the discussion that took place. I understand that Miss Devereaux was dismissed for very strong reasons, opening school after ten o'clock in the morning.\n\nMr. Carroll: I am not finding fault with her dismissal, but with the fact that the person appointed in her stead was not qualified. The provincial inspector of schools refused to visit the school on that account. Has the department seen to it that that school has now a qualified teacher?\n\nMr. Chisholm\nMr. A.W. Chisholm: I think the minister will find he has something to attend to with respect to the qualifications of teachers for Indian Schools. It is all very well to say that a teacher is qualified because somebody else says so, but there are certain qualifications required by the Provincial Education Acts, and the minister cannot hope to have Indian schools in their proper condition unless he sees that every teacher possesses the recognized qualifications. I cannot understand how this Malagawatch teacher can have the qualifications. I had the opportunity of recommending a couple of men myself as teachers at Indian schools, but I took very great care that the persons I recommended were qualified under the provincial law.\n\nMr. Roche: I understand that teachers are appointed on the recommendation of the Indian agents and inspectors. Personally I am not aware of any complaints having been made to the department with regard to the qualifications of those teachers, except the case that came up last year, and I am not sure whether that particular teacher is still employed. Perhaps he is better qualified by this time. It is not so very unusual a thing to have an Indian teacher.\n\nMr. A. W. Chisholm: I quite recognize that. I am not reflecting on his appointment because he is an Indian, but I know this man very well and I can hardly see how he could possess the necessary qualifications. That is just the point. Men are sent out to teach without the necessary license. It is quite possible that that may be done successfully in some cases, but it is opening the door to a very dangerous practice. It is quite possible that politics may enter into this thing and that an inspector may be induced to recommend a person who has not the necessary qualifications, but if that practice is to be followed there will be a great deal of trouble.\n\nMr. Roche: We have adopted a rule to have qualified teachers wherever possible, but in some cases we are not able to get qualified teachers for Indian schools, then we get the best qualified person we can.\nMemo,\n\nRe Malagawatch School.\n\nSchool was closed on May 31st, 1913.\n\nOn November 13th, 1913 the Agent, Rev.D. MacPherson recommended that Mr. Frank Cabot, an Indian, should be appointed teacher.\n\nRev D. MacPherson, in his letter, stated that Cabot had attended school regularly, and as he was the only son of a widowed mother the position would be a great benefit to him.\n\nIn official letter dated December 1st, 1913, the agent was notified as follows:\n\n\"You may appoint Mr. Cabot to the position of teacher of this school for the winter months, salary to be at the rate of $30.00 a month. It must be understood, however, that this appointment is only for the one term.\"\nMemo\u2014\u2014 Mr. Scott.\n\nThe total population of the Malagawatch Band according to the last census, is, only, 27.\n\nThe school has been carried on for some years, during the winter months. Night school classes were also held.\n\nIt was closed on May 31st, last. The teacher, who had charge of the school up to that time, when sending in his resignation on November 16th, last, suggested that it would be greatly to the advantage of the Indian band there to have the school kept open for at least the five winter months. Rev. D. McPherson, the agent, recommended the appointment of a young Indian, named Frank Cabot, stating in his letter that Cabot had attended school regularly, and as he was the only son of a widowed mother the position would be of great benefit to him. The agent was informed on the 8th of December that he might appoint Cabot for the winter months, salary to be at the rate of $30.00 a month and that it must be understood that the appointment was only for one term.\n\nCabot has no professional qualifications but is teaching under permit. It could hardly be expected that a qualified teacher could be found willing to take charge of this school at the remuneration offered and for so short a period.\n\nAs the term, only, closed on the 31st ultimo, the quarterly return has not yet been received. The agent's report on this school for the month of March shows an enrolment of 7 with an average attendance of 4\u00bd. In reporting on the school the agent says:\n\n\"With Mr. Frank Cabot, Indian, of the Whycocomagh Band, in charge of this school for this quarter I think conditions are satisfactory. Of course, the young man is not qualified to teach in our...\"\nin our provincial schools but I am of opinion that he is doing better work with these few backward children than a qualified teacher could do. He knows the language of the children and he can give them the English of their words and thus avoid the necessity of teaching an unknown language through an unknown medium. Prospects are good for fair results.\"\nExtract from the annual report of Supt. A.J. Boyd.\n\nI am disposed to particularize in the case of Frank Cabot, a young Indian, who has charge of the school at Malagawatch, Inverness County. His education is limited, but, in my estimation quite sufficient to meet the requirements of the position he occupies. He is doing conscientious work and on the occasion of my visit to his school recently his pupils acquitted themselves very creditably under examination in Reading, Writing and Arithmetic. One thing which appealed to me and which was in contrast with my experience in some other and more pretentious schools, was the fact that his pupils understood well what they were doing. This I attribute to his being able to explain to them in their own language the subject and the sense of each lesson and each exercise.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th inst. referring to the school at Malagawatch.\n\nSince my return from Ottawa I visited that school, and was agreeably surprised to find it quite different from what I expected. In my report on education, which has been forwarded to you, I thought proper to refer to it particularly, and in doing so, was tempted to mention the fact that its pupils showed better progress under present conditions than those of any other Indian school in Cape Breton.\n\nI hope that no attempt is being made to dismiss the teacher, Frank Cabot, a young Indian belonging to Whycocomagh. I was planning to send him some place, at the Department's expense, during the Summer vacation, where he might improve his education and add to his qualifications as a teacher. It was my intention to write you and ask for your approval of my plan before taking any action on it. Kindly let me know what you think.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nApril 30th, 1914.\n\nDear Mr. Boyd -\n\nI have your communication of the 26th instant in reference to the Malagash School.\n\nI am very pleased indeed that you are able to report so favourably upon the work performed during the winter by the teacher.\n\nThere is a very small population on this Reserve and our Census shows there are only four children of school age and the average attendance during the winter months was only a little over four. In view of these facts the Department would not be justified in assuming any large expenditure. On the other hand I am interested in your proposal and I would like to know more definitely where you propose to send this young man and what the probable cost might be.\n\nI may inform you that Frank Cabot was engaged only for the winter months. It is considered useless to keep the school going in the summer months, as the few that are there leave the Reserve during that period.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir,\n\nEnclosed are returns from the French teacher at Malagamatch, this agent and teacher's salary list. Kindly send Mr. Lebelot's cheque $60 direct to Whytevannah. I think Mr. Scott Boyd will bear evidence that Lebelot's five months' term was an improvement on the old regime which may not be doing very much for his method or efficiency. Lebelot deserves encouragement and I wish you would authorize me to send him somewhere for further training. The Indians are fond of him and so are the keepers of the Malagamatch band last week and he thinks Lebelot did well at school keeping since January. If Lebelot got to college now for a year or two or even till January it would help him. He is anxious to go to school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nD. MacPherson, O.C.,\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 8, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that Mr. Agent MacPherson has brought the case of Frank Cabot, who has had charge of the Malasawatch School for the winter months, to the notice of the Department and recommends that he be authorized to send him somewhere for further training.\n\nThis is the same young man about whom you wrote to the Department on the 24th of April, last, and I should be glad if you would state whether you have been able to make any arrangements for continuing his education and, if so, where and on what terms.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

MacPherson,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendale, C.B.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th inst., and to say that I have not been able so far to make arrangements for continuing the education of young Frank Cabot. I have an idea that, for certain reasons, Mr. Agent McPherson would be more likely than I to succeed in that respect. Therefore, it would be advisable to authorize him to send the Indian somewhere for further training.\n\nI am very anxious that Cabot should be afforded a good opportunity to improve his education, feeling sure that he would take full advantage of it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.

The Rev. President writes me and says Board costs $50 per year, Bed & Boarding $20 per month, 3 or 4 doctors fees, 1/2 library fees, $15.00, etc., etc. Of course the boy would need an additional outlay to secure clothing, shoes, etc. I should think $75 or $100 would pay railway fares, clothes, books, etc. I am very pleased indeed, that this boy is to get such a chance.\n\nI have another boy, John Cooper, more promising than I admit, the same you allowed me to send to the short course at the Princetown College last January. Is there any chance of sending him also to Monmouth? If you give the boys a term I promise not to have them spoiled by looking for everything being paid. I shall be doing all that they will work hard during the school days, but now both of them are working like fine fellows at Wolseyconough. In a year or two I could get them a place from which they could go to school and earn their keep by doing chores, etc. All is done for them; they won't be better than most whites who are born with the silver spoon in the mouth.\n\nFor the time being,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, November 19, 1914.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nWith reference to the engagement of a teacher for the Malagawatch day school, I have to inform you that it has been decided to appoint Miss McDonald, of River Dennis, C. B., for the position at a salary of $30.00 per month, the same as was paid the former teacher. This school, however, is to remain open only during the winter term, namely, from January 1st to May 31st, and the Department can pay no salary after that date. Miss McDonald should be informed of this, so that she will be in a position to take charge at the beginning of the new year.\n\nAgent McPherson is being advised of the reopening of this school and the appointment of Miss McDonald as teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

In view of this I would respectfully recommend that Mrs Annie McNeil of Port Hawkesbury be appointed teacher at said school. Mrs. McNeil had had experience as teacher at the Indian school at Nyanza, Victoria County, and I am firmly convinced that she will give entire satisfaction.

I have been appointed pastor as his successor in this parish, including the Indians people at Whyte's corner and Malagawatch. I have received a letter from Mr. Thomas Gallant, Secretary of the council, stating that he has recommended me as Indian Agent to succeed Mr. Phelan to your department.

At the present arrangement the school is opened January 1st to May 31st. I am advised that the attendance at this school is improving somewhat, and that the prospects are favourable for an increase in future. I would urge, if at all possible, that the school re-open on September 1st or October 1st.\n\nIf any further recommendation be necessary, I would recommend that Mrs. Annie McNeill be continued as teacher at above school.

I would be very glad, indeed, to open the school earlier in the year if conditions would warrant, and the Department is now in communication with the Agent respecting the matter. The return for April and May came in after he had been written to, and, unless there would be prospects of better attendance than that early in the fall, I think you will agree with me that there would be little or no use in opening the school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nThomas Gallant, Esq.,\nInverness, Nova Scotia.\nOttawa, October 15, 1915.\n\nRev.

This return shows an enrolment of five pupils, with an average attendance of three.\n\nIn view of the small number of children who are likely to attend this school during the winter months, you will be good enough to instruct Mrs. McNeil to close it at the beginning of the Christmas holidays and it is not to be re-opened during the winter months. You will be good enough to give this matter your early attention and inform Mrs. McNeil of the Department's instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. STEWART\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nRev. J. N.

The attendance at this school has been hardly sufficient to justify its being continued. During the last six years it has fallen off from an enrolment of 20 to 9, but to make up this number the return shows that there were three children five years of age and under and one over sixteen. The last census return shows that there are only two children of school age on the reserve. There are only 37 members in the band, 25 of whom are over 21 years of age.\n\nThe Public School Inspector, who visited this school last year, suggested that it should be continued during the summer months, this being the best time for the\nthe children to attend. His report on Mrs. McNeil, the teacher, is, on the whole, favourable. She is only paid at the rate of $30.00 a month and I would suggest that the school be re-opened for six months, say from the middle of this month.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, May 8, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo asking for information as to whether there are any prospects of the Indian school at Malagawatch being opened in the near future and stating that Mrs. Annie McNeil, the teacher, is ready to resume her functions as soon as she is ordered to do so.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has decided to re-open this school for six months and Mrs. McNeil may be placed in charge. She will be paid at the rate of $30.00 a month for her services and she may re-open the school at once.

Gallant of Inverness, in reference to the re-opening of the Malagash Indian School.\n\nThe Department has decided to re-open this school for six months under the charge of Mrs. Annie McNeil, the former teacher. Mrs. McNeill will be paid at the rate of $30.00 per month for her services and the school may be re-opened at once. Mr. Gallant has been advised to this effect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. N. McLennan,\nActing Indian Agent,\nGlendale, N.S.\nOttawa, August 15, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Macneil, Public School Inspector, in a recent report on the Malagawatch School, recommends that the school be kept open the full year. The last return received from this school shows that there were only six children on the roll with an average attendance of four and the Department considers that unless there is a decided improvement in the attendance the school should be closed.\n\nThe Department would like to have a full report from you in regard to conditions at this point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

MACNEIL ON THE MALAGAWATCH SCHOOL.\n\nI would also suggest keeping the school in session the year round, barring the usual vacations, if only, as an experiment for one year. If the children learn anything at all while the school is open they forget it all while it is closed. This is the teacher's experience and I concur in it entirely.\n\nDate of Inspection: June 13th, 1916.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 15th inst., I would say that probably Mr. Macneil, Public School Inspector, shares the idea entertained by others, especially by those in touch with day schools generally in Nova Scotia, that the attendance of pupils at the Malagawatch school should be better in winter than in summer, as I believe is the case in all Indian communities, and, therefore, that if it is thought desirable to have this school in operation during the summer, there should be no question about keeping it open in winter, when results on the score of attendance would almost certainly be more satisfactory.\n\nI regard the prospects for a decided improvement in the school attendance at Malagawatch as not very encouraging. I cannot see that conditions there warrant a larger average attendance than six at any time of the year, because the pupils are not in sight, and it seems evident that some few years must elapse before any change for the better in this respect may be looked for.\n\nShould a development of circumstances in the near future make the school situation at Malagawatch more promising, I shall duly bring the fact to the attention of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.

Box 1031\nJune 30, 1917.\n\nDear Mr. Gallant,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 27th instant, and to say in reply that it is quite possible that we may open the Malagawatch Indian school next winter, but it is too soon to make a decision now.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nThomas Gallant, Esq.,\nBarrister, Solicitor, &c.,\nInverness, N.S.\nExtract from letter from Agent J. N. McLennan,\nGlendale, N.S., dated May 3rd, 1920. Original on 254086/53.\n\nThere are now about 12 or 14 Indian children of school age on Malagawatch Reserve who should have the advantages of a little education. This school is now closed for several years.\nSir,\n\nI may say that there are now about twelve children of school age at Malagawatch, where there is a fine school-house. This school should be opened and the term to close about the 15th of May when the parents generally leave to work elsewhere. In case it should be opened, this Mrs. McNeil, Teacher, gave satisfaction there before, as the children are small and in elementary work.\n\nI am,\nYour obedient servant,\nJ.N. McLennan,\nAgent.\nOttawa, December 8, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nA request has been received from Mr. Agent McLennan, Glendale, N.S., to re-open the Malagawatch Indian School during the present winter. He states that there are about twelve children of school age at present at that point and he recommends that Mrs. McNeil, who has resigned as teacher of the Whyccocomagh Indian Day School, be appointed teacher, the school to be open from January 1st to about the 15th of May, next.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will state your views regarding this request and whether you would advise, taking into consideration the expense involved and the success that would likely be obtained, whether this school should be re-opened or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nOttawa, December 8, 1920.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 1st instant, in which you recommend that the school at Malagawatch be re-opened during the winter months and that Mrs. McNeil, who is resigning as teacher of the Whyccoomagh Indian Day School, be appointed teacher, I beg to say that the Department is communicating with Mr. Inspector Boyd regarding this matter. As soon as his report is received you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. N. McLennan,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendale, N.S.\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th. instant, and to say that I cannot advise the Department to re-open the Indian Day School at Malagawatch during the present winter, as requested by Mr. Agent McLennan of Glendale, N. S., because in my judgment the probable results would not be at all commensurate with the expense that must necessarily be incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 20, 1920.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn further reference to your request to have the school at Malagawatch opened for the winter months I beg to say that Mr. Superintendent Boyd, to whom this matter was referred, is of the opinion that the probable results obtained would not be at all commensurate with the expense that would be involved. The Department agrees with him that it is very doubtful if the attendance and the success that would be achieved would warrant the re-opening of the school and the Department, therefore, cannot approve of your request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. N. McLennan,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendale, N.S.\nSir,\n\nThere are now 11 Indian children from 7 to 15 years of age at Malagawatch Reserve, N.S., who, I submit, should be furnished with school accommodation, particularly as the chief requisite for that purpose is a teacher, the school house being already provided.\n\nAs the Department is aware, an Indian Day School was in operation at Malagawatch a few years ago, which had to be closed on account of the very small and unsatisfactory attendance of pupils, but I do not think that such a contingency would likely recur, because the number of children at that reserve now is twenty form 2 to 15 years of age.\n\nUnder the circumstances above related I would urge the reopening of the school at the beginning of the ensuing term.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nActing Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 13, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, in which you recommend that the Malagawatch Indian Day School be re-opened at the beginning of the ensuing term.\n\nIn view of your report that there are a sufficient number of Indian children to warrant the conducting of classes at the above named school, the Department will approve of its re-opening from the first of the next school year, on or about September 4th, next. I have therefore to request that you will arrange to obtain the services of a suitable teacher, also that you will have any repairs, or cleaning, required to the school building, carried out. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher secured by you should be forwarded for the approval of the Department. The salary allowed will be at the rate of $500 per annum, supplemented by the bonus provided by law.\n\nWe will supply any school material needed, upon receipt of a requisition for the same. There should be a sufficient number of desks, also blackboards, in the school building. Only such cleaning and repairs as are absolutely necessary to place the building and classroom in a serviceable condition should be carried out, and no undue expenditure should be incurred for the purpose. Please forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the amount involved.\n\nThe Department will leave in your hands the matter of securing a teacher and the cleaning and repairing of the school building. It is hoped that, if this school is re-opened, the Indian parents will avail themselves of the privilege offered and see that the children of school age attend regularly. Please give this matter your early attention, in order that the work can be started as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois,\nN. S.\nSir,\n\nMr. Superintendent Boyd informs me that the Indian Day-school at Nakogwatah is to be opened this term. It has been closed for a number of years, owing to the very few children to attend. The probable number to attend now will be from 12 to 14.\n\nBe good enough to send books, pencils, copy books, scribblers, ink and a school register to Miss Florence A. Hill's Alba Station, A.B., N.S., who is to take charge of the school. Standard I, II and III books for twelve or fourteen pupils.\n\nI am\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. H. Maclean\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, Sept. 8, 1923.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 4th instant, I beg to say that the articles requested for the Malagawatch Indian Day School are being ordered from the Government Stationery Office. As the Department is not certain regarding the correct address of the teacher, the supplies ordered are being sent to you, and upon receipt of the same, you should have them delivered to the school.\n\nIt is noted that Miss F. A. Gillis has begun duties as teacher. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $500 per annum, plus the bonus allowed by law. The Department trusts that you will give her every possible assistance in her work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. N. MacLennan,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendale, C.B., N.S.\nOttawa, Sept. 8, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is informed by Mr. Agent MacLennan that Miss F. A. Gillis has begun duties as teacher at the Malagawatch Indian Day School. As requested in official letter of the 13th ultimo, you should furnish the Department with the qualifications and experience of Miss Gillis.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois,\nN.S.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that Miss Florence Agatha Gills, of Alba, Inverness County, N. S., has been engaged as teacher of the Indian Day School at Malagawatch Reserve in accordance with The Department's instructions to me. I enclose herewith Scholarship Certificates awarded her by the Council of Public Instruction of Nova Scotia. These indicate her qualifications for the position and are satisfactory to me, as I hope they will be to the Department. Kindly return them when they have served your purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 11, 1923.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, informing the Department of the appointment of Miss Florence Agatha Gills, as teacher of the Malagawatch Indian day school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the appointment of Miss Gills is approved.\n\nWe are informing Mr. Agent McLennan that the salary allowed her will be at the rate of $50.00 per month for each teaching month, plus the bonus provided by law.\n\nThe certificates which you forwarded are enclosed herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Bonus.\n\nA born teacher, highly successful, and has done wonders in the short time she has been employed, being last year, and the present term, to date\n\nExercises were gone through in physical drill, vocal music, reading, spelling and translating from English into Indian and vice versa.\n\nThe teacher has already acquired a considerable vocabulary in the Mic-Mac language, and seems to have great aptitude in imparting instruction in language.\n\nThe only suggestion I have to make is that the teacher should be retained if possible and that her salary should be increased to a reasonable amount to make it worth while living in such an isolated region.\nOttawa, December 20, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector who visited the Malagawatch Indian Day School, in a report on his inspection, draws attention to the excellent work being performed by Miss Florence A. Gillis, the teacher, and recommends that she be given an increase in salary. In view of the inspector's report, the Department is pleased to grant Miss Gillis an increase of $50 in her yearly salary. This increase will date from the first of October, last, and will make her salary from that date at the rate of $550 for the ten teaching months, plus any bonus provided by law. Please inform Miss Gillis of the increase allowed her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. N.

She is a girl of good character, and I can recommend her to take charge of the Indian School. As Miss Kennedy holds a higher grade than Miss Gillis, it is only right that she be paid the same salary as that paid to Miss Gillis.\n\nA.D. Maclean Esq.,\nActing Deputy Secretary,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 10th, 1925.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, informing the Department that Miss Florence A.

The salary allowed Miss Kennedy will be at the rate of $70 per month for the ten teaching months in the year, which is the same amount, including salary and bonus, as was paid Miss Gillis.\n\nPlease inform Miss Kennedy of her appointment and arrange with her to begin duties on the date mentioned.

Your letter, which I cannot find at present, authorized for the schools as above named, to be kept open during September and to be closed during January, as I recommended.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. L.

On account of the condition of the roads and weather during January, the attendance of pupils is much easier during September. Kindly authorize the above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. G.

On account of weather conditions etc., in January, the above change would this year, as was from last year, be to the best advantage of all concerned and would cause a higher average of attendance, kindly authorize.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.C.

The whole question of the dates during which the schools should be operated has been very carefully considered from all angles, and it has been decided that all Indian day schools should open October 1, 1941, and close on June 30, 1942.\n\nIn reviewing the returns, I find that in the March quarter of 1940 the enrolment at the Malagawatch School was 12 and the average attendance, 10; in the March quarter 1941 the enrolment was 12 and the average attendance, 11.\n\nAt the Whycocomagh School, in the March quarter of 1940 the enrolment was 50 and the average attendance, 29. At the same school, in the March quarter of 1941 the enrolment was 28 and the average attendance, 15.\n\nFrom the figures just stated, it is evident that the closing of these schools for the month of January 1941 did not have any advantageous effect on the attendance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend A.

His salary at the Malagawatch School is $70.00 a month and we will allow him $75.00 a month at Whyecocomagh which is the same salary as is being paid to Mr. MacDonald.\n\nThe attendance at the Malagawatch School is very small and it can remain closed for the balance of the current academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. A.C.

His appointment at the latter school will date from May 1, 1942. For the months of May and June, 1942, he should be paid salary at Whysoconagh at the rate of $75.00 a teaching month plus bonus.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nLast week we visited Malagawatch reserve, that has been closed for some time. There is a fair school there and I wished to estimate what could be done with it. This is a problem as the reserve is so far out in the woods that it would not be of value for us to remove the building for our own purposes. I visited two school sections nearby thinking that possibly they would consider a purchase but they both have good schools. I shall get in touch with the Inspector of Schools for that County regarding the matter.\n\nThere is only one factor that may be a hindrance to selling the school and that is that the people are afraid to make use of it as it may contain tubercular germs. There are a few houses on Malagawatch reserve but we may tear them down and burn them. This reservation is not good, the land being poor and most of the lumber removed. If I can get a school section to remove the school, which is now an eye-sore out in the woods, I shall do so; if not I will dispose of it in the most economical manner.\n\nJ.A.

I have obtained teaching regularly, and had I known that I would not be paid for full time as usual (I was unemployed during the new summer holidays) I could have taken advantage of another situation that was offered to me, but preferred instead to keep on teaching in good faith, and hope that the Dept. will decide favorably towards sending me off for the balance of my claim for having continued to teach school in Malagash. For the month of June I claimed in $33.33 and Sept. $100.00\n\nReceived Cheque $166.66\n\nSo that I feel justified in claiming fifty dollars $66 ($50.66) and hope to be favored with Cheques for said amounts upon return mail, or at your earliest convenience, thanking you very much and favorable reply.\n\nSincerely,\n\nNellie Burns,\nIndian Teacher\nOttawa February 17, 1913.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the amount of salary which you received for your services as teacher of the Malagawatch Day school for the period between June 1st and December 31st, 1912.\n\nThe quarterly returns received, show that you only taught this school 58 days between the above named dates. Your salary for that period was at the rate of $400 per year, and you were therefore paid 58/200ths of that amount, or $116.00, which is the full amount due. The Department, therefore, cannot make no further payment, as you have been paid salary for the full number of days which you taught this school during the above named period.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nArsene Burns, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nMalagawatch Indian School,\nBig Harbour Island, N.S.\nProvince of Nova Scotia\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTEACHERS' SALARIES\n\nFOR QUARTER ENDED March 31, 1913\n\n| NAME OF TEACHER | NAME OF SCHOOL | Annual Grant or Salary | Amount Due | Address to which Cheque is to be sent |\n|-----------------|----------------|------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|\n| A.

It is hoped that she will be able to resume duties on the 1st of March, next. The qualifications which Mr. Colin Kennedy possesses have been noted. It is hoped that he will be able to carry on the work satisfactorily during the period he is acting as substitute. Salary will be allowed him at the same rate as was paid his sister, but the Department will be unable to allow Miss Kennedy salary for the period she is absent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. J. McNeil, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAntigonish, N.S.\nOttawa, April 18th, 1931.\n\nSir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the March quarter return of the Malagawatch Indian Day School. While this return is signed by Mr. Colin Kennedy, it does not state if Miss Mary Kennedy resumed duties at this school on March 1st. (Reference official letter of December 16th, 1930).\n\nIn view of Miss Mary Kennedy's services at this school during the past five years, the Department is disposed to allow her, at least, one month's sick leave with pay, but the necessary adjustment in the salaries of herself and her brother cannot be made until we have definite information regarding the length of time that each of them taught during the March quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nRussell T.

If you consider that his services would be satisfactory for the next school year, the Department would approve of his appointment, with salary at the rate of $70 per teaching month, the same as he is now receiving as substitute teacher.
