A reasonable fee should, however, be exacted to be given to the teacher as remuneration for the extra work entailed. Be good enough to state what you consider would be a reasonable fee. These fees should be collected quarterly and handed over by you to the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. A.

Irving Esq.,\nBuctouche, N.B.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am now in the employ of the Dalhousie Branch of the Royal Bank. I am getting along well and like the work. On July 1st last I wrote you a letter containing the returns of the Big Cone School. I stated that as I had taught 182 days and as I had only been paid $56.74 I should get the remainder of the salary. The days required by the Department to be taught were in number 316 and as I have had taught 182 days I should have been paid $52.77 for my year service. As I have already received $31.94 there is a balance of $20.83 due me. On teacher Ryan's visit to the school last spring I asked him if I should not receive more than $78 at the end of the year and he said that I would certainly get more as teachers were paid for the days that they taught. Hoping that you will consider my request.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRay McInerney\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a communication that I received from Mr. Ray McInerney, formerly teacher of the Big Cove Indian School, which will read for itself.\n\nMr. McInerney claims a balance of Twenty-one Dollars and Eighty-three cents due him for his services as said teacher.\n\nWill you kindly advise me in reference to the matter.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 12, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 7th instant enclosing a communication from Ray McInerney, late teacher of the Big Cove Indian School, with reference to the amount of salary paid him for the period which he taught this school I beg to inform you that a cheque for $24.83, being the balance due, will be sent you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

You may, therefore, expend this sum for each of the schools and forward vouchers in the usual way.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. A. Irvine, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nHootchuck, N.B.\nSir;\u2014\n\nI have the honour to report, that the Chief of Big Cove Band has applied to me for a new Teacher for the Big Cove Indian School. He claims that there is some dissatisfaction among the Indians with the present teacher and that they would like to have a teacher who could play the organ in the Church on Sunday during their services. I may say, that Miss Johnson of Richibucto, daughter of Sheriff B.J. Johnson, who holds no license to teach but who is well educated and who can play the organ, is willing to accept the position. In the event of a change. As the time is short, I would like to have as early a reply as possible in order that the school might open at the beginning of the present term, providing the change was made.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 17, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th inst., and in reply I beg to say that, in view of the favourable reports received on Miss Sutton's work at the Big Cove school, it is not the intention of the Department to replace her at present. The reasons advanced by the Indians are not considered sufficient.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\n\nR. A. Irving, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBuctouche, N.B.\nSir;\u2014\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith, Quarterly school return of Miss Kathelyn E.M. Sutton, Teacher of Big Cove Indian School, Kent County, N.B. for the quarter ended September 30th., last past, which I trust you will find satisfactory and correct.\n\nI do recommend that Miss Sutton's salary be increased from $350.00 to $400.00 per year to commence from the First of July last past, the same as Miss Geraghty's salary, teacher of the Burnt Church Indian School. I consider that Miss Sutton is doing efficient work in her school and the average attendance is good and I think her efforts to increase education in this byand should be recognized. I therefor consider that as a reward for merit her salary should be increased to $400.00 per year.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Superintendent.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 14, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant in which you recommend an increase in salary from $300.00 to $400.00 for Miss Sutton, teacher of the Big Cove School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the favourable reports received from yourself and Mr. Superintendent Ryan on Miss Sutton's work and the fact that there is a very fair enrolment and average attendance at this school, the Department will pay Miss Sutton at the rate of $400.00 per annum from the first of the current quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nR.

Original on File 160370-19F, Mar.Provinces.\n\nIs mid-day meal served?\n\nNo mid-day meal is served but if it were I am convinced better results would be obtained.\n\nKathlyn E.M.Button,\nTeacher.\nOttawa, February 28, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nMiss Sutton, teacher of the Big Cove Indian School, in her annual report states that she is convinced that better results would be obtained if a mid-day meal were served.\n\nThis has not been done in New Brunswick, but the Department would like to have a report from you as to the necessity of providing these children with a mid-day lunch. The usual practice is to furnish only a limited supply to supplement that brought by the children from home and give them a cup of tea and this practice is only followed when children come some distance to school and have to carry cold lunches. The Department would like to have your opinion on this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR.A. Irving, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiotouche, N.B.\nSir;-\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your communication of the above number of the Twenty-eighth Ultimo regarding the matter of a mid day meal for the scholars of the Big Cove Indian School, and in reply I may say that I do not consider the same necessary and do not approve of the same as the children that attend this school live in the immediate vicinity of the school and very few, if any, bring their lunch to school for dinner hour, consequently, if you did provide them with anything you would have to provide them with a full meal and I feel that under the circumstances that this would be impracticable.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Ontario, March 13, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 8th instant, I am to say that the Department agrees with you that a mid-day meal for the scholars of the Big Cove Indian School is unnecessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR.

M.Sutton, whose services as Teacher of this school are not very satisfactory, and I am today in receipt of an application from Miss Nathalie Babin for this school, which I herewith enclose. Miss Babin formerly taught in this school and also was teacher for considerable time of the Burnt Church Indian school. In the event of the Department making a change, it would be proper that Miss Sutton be notified as soon as possible, that her services will not be required after the Christmas holidays.\n\nKindly instruct me upon the matter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 17, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant stating that some of the members of the Big Cove Band would like to have another teacher to replace Miss Kathelyn E. M. Sutton and submitting an application from Miss Natalie Babain for the position, should a vacancy occur.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the favourable reports received from yourself and Mr. Superintendent Ryan on Miss Sutton's work, the Department is not disposed to dispense with her services at present. The Chief of the band is the truant officer and if he attends to his duties properly there should be no reason why the attendance should not be satisfactory and you will be good enough to so inform him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Original on 130688/6.\n\nThe attendance at this school is far from being up to the average of the other schools of the province and the reason seems to be the total indifference of the parents to the education of their children. Being ignorant themselves they fail to realize the importance of a little learning to their children and on the slightest pretext they keep them at home.\n\nA few live at a distance, but that should be no obstacle to their attending school, as many of the white children throughout the provinces have much greater distances to cover to attend school.\nMundleville, N.B.\nNov. 13, 1913.\n\nMr. R.A.

There is no doubt whatever but that the school is a more difficult one to handle than any of the other schools in my superintendency\u2014 and it requires a teacher with very special qualifications to make a success of the work here. These qualities are wanting in Miss Sutton and in consequence the children are not as advanced as they should be. Miss Sutton has not been in very good health this past year and no doubt ill-health added to the fact that she is hardly adapted for work in an Indian School, has somewhat militated against her success at Big Cove.\nOttawa, February 9, 1914.\n\nRev. Sir,-\n\nIn reference to your report on the Big Cove Indian school I have to ask you whether, in case the Department was disposed to dispense with Miss Sutton's services as teacher of this school, as suggested by you, would you be in a position to secure the services of a thoroughly competent person to take her place.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

D. McLean, Esq.\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\nIn submitting report of the Big Cove School, I regret I cannot find a more encouraging account of its progress. As stated in previous communications, I am of the opinion that until a new and more up-to-date building is erected for this Reserve, a building which will be bright and cheerful in its interior furnishings, much good cannot be effected among the children. Apart from...\nThus, a teacher should be provided who will be more in touch with Indian characteristics than the young lady now in charge, and so he in addition to teaching the regular branches of studies, would also be able to play the organ for their church services and teach the children to sing. This kind of teacher is the one that is wanted by the Indians of the Reserve, and they say if such a one comes to them they will take all the interest wanted in their children's education.\n\nSuch a teacher, I have in mind. She is a sister of Miss Isaacs, the very efficient teacher of the old Grand Trunk, and would be\navailable after the summer holidays. She is at present recuperating from an attack of fever, and must rest for 6 months. She has the same diploma as her sister, Miss Robert, C.F., Mrs. Smith, etc., and in addition is a musician. She is 19 yrs. old, and having a knowledge of both languages, Micmac and English. She ought to have tried the excellent work done by her sister at Dr. James' Mission in Rebecca Shoals. Miss D. Laughlin learns. She is hardly \"wasting time\" and in the interests of the children, I feel a change should be made after the summer holidays. All of which I respectfully submit to the consideration of the Dept.\n\nYours, Sir,\n\nJ. H. Kelvington\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ryan,\nDept. of Indian Schools,\nWoodstock, N.B.\nOttawa, December 3, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Big Cove Indian School I beg to say that Rev. Father Ryan, Superintendent of Indian Schools, has recommended Miss Rene Gideon for this position. He has been informed that she may be placed in charge of this school after the Christmas holidays and that she will be allowed a salary at the rate of $400.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Sheridan, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBuctouche, N.B.\nSir Jack Nov. 3rd 1918\n\nI have written to Mr. Sheridan, Ruston, who is in charge of the Maritime Committee at Ottawa, as he has been very busy with the affairs of the Indians who have left the reserve near here. Sheon who taught me in my little school one day in May last, asked me to lend her a few dollars to get a box of provisions. She promised to send me from Ottawa when she got there.\n\nHer draft came to her.\nIn August, about the twelfth day when our provincial officers came she belongs to Quebec City. She paid my address but sent me out $1.00. She returned to Quebec in Aug. wrote me twice, but I paid no attention. Before her death draft came. Before her death the matter was settled by Mr. Sheridan. Her check comes to the telegraph office as soon as you receive this. She does not pay rent at once. She is ill when she gets her pay. Letter office here to get my check cashed. All ready, I waited but her mother came away about the middle of last week. I did not pay me off. Her school was closed because of influenza & she could not go back. She was very sick. I did not hear from her until now. I am getting him some truth as Mr. Sheridan.\nIt's known me as a public school teacher in No. 3 for thirty-two years. The bill is $5.79. They further advised me to send a constable to the reserve but they said surely pay me after stating they had paid me being a stipendary down. She felt sorry to put her to further expense so she could get the Indians' grants. Little business is small but my sight prevents me from seeing it. I wrote letters in years of a reg. mail. Now where to send her her other reg. letters? I must draw their money when the Board of Health closes. I think Miss Gideon will have her money for the future during which...\nIndian Reserve school is closed & I ask you to please pay me my bill of $5.19 out of the Indian school. If you will not send it to me, I will go to pay Mr. Sherrida where he will testify as to the veracity. Kindly do the best you can for me. After Paul left from our school, I wrote to you & please see me paid him also asking Gordon to let me know about William. This letter is your calling of family. Dear Mrs. Margaret Lomack, Main River Kent Co. New Brunswick\nNovember 19, 1918.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, in which you state that Miss Gideon, teacher of the Big Cove Indian School, owes you $5.19 and ask the Department to pay this bill out of Miss Gideon's salary for the current quarter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department cannot deduct this money from Miss Gideon's salary, but she is being written to in regard to the matter.

Ryan, late Superintendent of Indian Schools, who was asked to investigate the trouble at the Big Cove Indian School, reports that the Indians are dissatisfied with the present teacher, Miss Roach, and he thinks it would be advisable to make a change there. As it would appear that Miss Roach would never make a success of this school Mr. Superintendent Sheridan has been instructed to inform her that her services will not be required after the summer holidays.\n\nThe Indians have requested that John Sark, an Indian who taught the Lennox Island School for a time, be placed in charge of this school.\n\nThe Department considers that it would be well to transfer Miss McGrand from Tobique to Big Cove and I have to ask you to be good enough to communicate with her and ascertain whether she would agree to this transfer. Kindly advise the Department of Miss McGrand's decision as soon as you hear from her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLellan,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. F. O. Ryan,\nSuperintendent of Indian schools,\nMaliseet, N. B.\nSir,\n\nThis is to certify that Jacob Sack is a young married Indian of this place. He is the son of Chief Sack's (sic) and has been engaged as school teacher at a good salary but his brother John Sack a returned soldier who has lost the use of the legs and has a wife to support and no other suitable occupation offered. Jacob generously offered the position as teacher to his brother and since he is younger and better able to face the world than his less healthy brother he now goes to seek employment.\n\nI trust that he will have no difficulty in securing a position. He was a good faithful teacher, was a student at St. Dunstan's University and is sober and honest and worthy of any position of trust.\n\nFor the undersigned\n\nIndian Agent\nand Parish Priest.\nJ.

First, I do not know its salary and I have no wish to step backward since I have given no cause. Second, I am in the Inspectorate of new newly-appointed. In Section I have little responsibility for any unjust report from him. Consequently, I cannot think favorably of Big Cove School.\n\nIf the salary is not inferior to what I have been faithfully called for, and if the right would be kindly acquiesced, the right of the teacher of acquiring the recommendation of the Indian Agent whom he might be before insisting on a second removal or discharge I might consider.\n\nIf the reason for the change of teachers is anything like reports I have heard here from time to time, I could give satisfactory reasons. I have been informed by the new Inspector of Big Cove School. To this I am not replying concerning this sufficient.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Date]\n\nIndian Affairs.

F. O. Ryan, Superintendent of Indian schools. Father Ryan is being informed of the need of a teacher for the Big Cove School and is being requested to endeavour to obtain a suitable teacher at as early a date as possible, in order that the school can be re-opened after the summer holidays on or about September 2nd, next.

The Indians have applied to Dept. for the appointment of Mr. Jacob Dart, a P.E.I. Indian, a brave of Pennock Island Reserve, a young man of some experience in the Island Indian Schools & whose recommendation by Fr. Macdonald of that parish. He is now at Big Bone and has been there since, I think, the month of May or early in June. He has a Big Bone wife.\n\nI would give him a trial, had I the opportunity.\n\nMiss Margaret Roach of Main River would like to get into School. She was taken last term & fell sick. It is no place for her & she is not the person for the school & with them the Indians do not want her & will not send the children to her.\n\nHave her your address recently, but I told her too, that the Dept. did not, I would not.\nEmploy a teacher ---- if anything else could be done,\nwho had served before in the reserve schools\nand who had been dismissed or had resigned.\nThis I said to her, as the policy of the Dept.\nof Indian Affairs is so far as I have seen\nin the schools.\n\nI do not know just now of any other\nthan Mr. Sark.

However, I have heard that both parties intend going West on January so I suppose matters would be satisfactory for at least a time.\n\nIf you cannot procure a licensed teacher there is a young man living here who attended St. Joseph's College here until the middle of this year. He is 19 and was in Grade II last year. He is a good boy and quite smart and happens to be in town now. He came here recently and he is able to get a position here that for a while, he thought of applying for a local license to teach but he is not strong enough to work hard having undergone an operation and being...\nMaliseet Vict.

This explains the difficulty.\n\nFather J.J. Ryan & Father McLaughlin of Richibucto, thinks the Dept. should give Mr. Jacob Sark, an Indian, now living on the Big Cove Reserve, a trial at teaching.

He should, however, be informed that his retention in the position will depend on the success with which he conducts the work in the school. He will be paid the same salary as was allowed the former teacher, viz., $400.00 per annum. You will be good enough to inform Mr. Sark accordingly, and also the Department as to the date on which he begins duties. Kindly give this matter your prompt attention, in order that this school may be re-opened on or about the 2nd of September next, the date on which the other Indian schools open after the summer holidays.\n\nYou should inform Mr. Superintendent Sheridan regarding the appointment of Mr. Sark.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. F. G. Ryan,\nSuperintendent of Indian Schools,\nMaliseet, Vict. Co., N.B.\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nExtract from report of Inspector F. C. Ryan on the Big Cove Indian Day School, report dated June 3, 1920. Original on 130688/6.\n\nThe situation of this Reserve so far removed from white people makes it hard to get a good teacher to teach there.\n\nThe only thing that will induce a good teacher to sacrifice herself in such a place and under such conditions would be an extra salary and certain inducements if she would teach Domestic Science. The more work the more pay.\n\nA good teacher like I have suggested for Burnt Church would be the only salvation of these people. Their Pastor W. Naughlin lives over 14 miles away; this is surely a great misfortune. Stern measures, with both this and Burnt Church, would be the only way. The Department must stand behind the teacher and aid her in every way. It would only mean one or two years at the most, of strenuous work; after that the harvest would be great.\nOttawa, July 20, 1920.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nWith reference to that portion of your report on your inspection of the Big Cove Indian Day School regarding the appointment of a qualified teacher I beg to say that it is considered in the best interests of the Indian children that the present teacher, Jacob Sark, be asked for his resignation.\n\nYou should arrange, if possible, to secure the services of a teacher having the necessary qualifications and one who will teach sewing, knitting, etc., to the children and who will visit the families, especially the Indian women and instruct them in the proper care of their homes and children. If a teacher of this kind can be obtained, the Department would be disposed to pay an increased salary. The Department understands the conditions at this school and the difficulty of inducing a teacher to take up the work of teaching on this reserve. It hopes that you will be able to secure a teacher who would undertake the work and make a success both with the children and the parents. It might be well to consult Mr. Superintendent Sheridan in the matter. The name, age, qualifications and experience of the person secured by you as teacher should be submitted for the consideration of the Department.\n\nI might add that a reasonable expenditure will be allowed in the purchase of material to teach the children sewing, knitting, etc., and, as in the case of Burnt Church, the children, after they have completed the garments made from the material supplied, can retain them for their own use.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you at an early date as to whether you have been able to secure a teacher, which it is hoped you will do in time for the re-opening of the school after the summer holidays.\n\nRev. F. C. Ryan,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nMaliseet, N.B.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nRev. Father,\n\nYour favor of the 26th inst. has been received.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that I gladly accept the offer you have made for the King's School. Kindly let me know when to begin my work. Wish to thank you for same.\n\nI remain yours respectfully,\n\nRebecca Louance.\nDear Mr. McLean:\n\nI have placed the matter of securing good efficient teachers in the hands of Rev. O'Leary of Chatham and a number of active priests. We must have \"EXTRA\" teachers to fill schools at Big Cove & Burnt Church. ---that is \"EXTRA\" in quality, in order to raise these schools to the standard.\n\nMiss Rebecca has consented to take the Kingsclear Ind. school. She taught before at Burnt Church, but the Dr. ordered her inland. I feel she will do well at this school, as it is small, and away from the heavy salt air, her health will permit a greater success.\n\nI trust her salary will be the same as in the past.\n\nI expect applications from other teachers within a few days, I will forward same for your approval; I feel sorry that we cannot secure the services of Miss Barry of Chatham, since she could only come, on condition that I would board her, this I cannot do. I will at once look for another teacher.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nI am sending you letters of correspondence & to show I am leaving nothing undone to secure good & competent teachers.

Sir,\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 23rd instant regarding the securing of a teacher for the Big Cove Indian Day School it is noted that it has not been possible to obtain the services of a suitable teacher and that it will, therefore, be necessary to retain Jacob Sark as teacher.\n\nThe temporary re-appointment of Jacob Sark will be approved. It is hoped at a later date, when the repairs to the school building have been completed, that it will be possible to obtain a qualified teacher to replace him and until such time as a good teacher is secured he may continue the duties of teacher at the Big Cove School.\n\nI may say that consideration is being given to the tenders secured by Rev.

Ryan,\n\nI went, as you requested, and saw Miss Taylor anent her choice of school. She much prefers Burtt Church as a school for next year. Human nature likes a little variety now and then. So I gave her to understand it would be all right. I called on my way on Miss McLaughlin to learn from her what the contents of her letter were. She told me she asked for $800.00 per annum, but had no fancy for the job. I also spoke to others; but a negative was the reply. An Indian school does not appeal to our white race or the Irish school of thought. A French girl would, I think, be more practical and not mind.\n\nAs a last resort, I called on Miss Frances Schultz of Bridgetown. She taught the Indian school at Kel Ground some years ago; but the Indians got it into their heads that \"Selfdetermination\" should be the ideal, applied for an Indian, \u2014one who could address them and teach them in their own language. So, was told that her resignation might be accepted. She left. Now, last night I coaxed her to resume teaching and accept the principalship etc., etc., of Kel Ground Academy. She was to write you this morning, and make the necessary application. I would that advise that the application be favorably considered.\n\nThe Indians are going to have a picnic on Labor Day. They want to give me something out of the proceeds, should anything be left. I get nothing from them by way of support; and they are not killed with generosity. Poor people!\n\nWishing you every happiness,\n\nI am etc., etc.\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Rev. Fr. Ryan\n\n[Signature]\n\nWilliam L.\nVictoria C.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI must confess that I have been just tearing out my brain during all vacation looking up good teachers and had a great many of the Clergy and others doing the same for me, and have only at the last hour been able to complete this order of things.\n\nI feel very sorry that in some instances time would not permit me to consult you re some of the changes, but as I have, in every case, worked in the interest of the Dept. & Indians, I feel that the Dept. will be satisfied.\n\nMiss Taylor goes from Belgrand to Burnt Church, Miss Francis A. Schultz goes to Belgrand, Miss Lillian Murdock comes to Maliseet, Miss Rebecca Isaacs goes to Kingsclear, Miss Bernier takes over the Edmundston School, Miss Dunphy the Woodstock school while Elkhorn & St. Mary's & Oromocto have their same teachers. Big Cove school, as yet, has not been filled. I do regret placing this school under the care of Jacob Sark.\n\nI am still trying for a teacher and if the school does begin a little late it would be better than to continue under the old regime.\n\nI am sending, inclosed, letters showing applications & correspondence, in order to show you that I left nothing undone to get good teachers.\n\nTrusting you are well,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInsp. of Ind.

It is hoped that she will meet with success in her work and get along satisfactorily with the Indian parents.\n\nAs you were informed by official letter of August 9th, last, the Department approved of the transfer of Miss Rebecca Isaacs from Burnt Church to Kingsclear. Her salary will be at the same rate as was allowed the former teacher, namely, $450.00 per annum, together with the bonus.\n\nThe appointment of Miss Emile Bernier as teacher of the Edmundston Indian Day School is approved, as you were informed by official letter of the 10th instant.

I sincerely regret that I had to close my school, but I have no intention of withdrawing my duty in any respect, only in my own mother who is seriously ill with heart trouble & needs attention. Under such circumstances, I could not very well remain there & wait for you reply giving me permission to close the school, I communicated to the Dept. about the matter.\n\nI may become another teacher if you wish, as to substitute no one else around here is undertake my love school.\n\nYour respectful,\n\nMatte Evans.\nDear Mr. Perrier,\n\nSupt. of Ind. Education, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will please find inclosed a letter from Fr. McLaughlin, pastor of Big Cove. It will explain itself. You will also find Miss Isaac's letter. She does not answer my questions in full, therefor I do not know when she intends to open the Big Cove Ind. day school. The fact is that both the Miss Isaacs are very independent. She knows well that no other teacher would go to Big Cove. Her sister Rebecca who teaches in the Belcourt school but nine miles from me, (Red Bank), went home twice and lost about three or four weeks, so I am informed, never as much telephoned. She & sister states they do their business with Ottawa &c. I care me nothing in this respect, but I do not want the schools to suffer. The Teachers should therefor be notified that they should in each and every case let me know when called away.\n\nYou will also find a letter from Mrs. Peter Clair applying for the Big Cove School. Fr. McLaughlin says she is not much, and that this school would be better closed until Miss Isaac returns. It would be impossible to get a white teacher, since the SCHOOL HOUSE & Teacher's house is such that no white girl would go there. Miss Isaac boards with an Indian. (The both Miss Isaacs are Indian girls) I always feel sorry for the Big Cove Reserve. It is the largest in population and the most neglected as for school, &c., in the Province. The Dept. has not done its duty by this Reserve as far as Education is concerned. Under present conditions and for years past this SCHOOL merely meant a waste of money, nothing else.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Ind. schools for N.B.\n\nIndian Affairs.

She was instructed to inform you accordingly. I might point out that in official letter to you of the 7th ult., you were informed that she had closed the school on the last of February on account of the serious illness of her mother, and that she did not wish to resign but requested that the position be held for her until she was able to return.\n\nIn all cases where teachers of Indian day schools in New Brunswick communicate direct with the Department, they have been referred to you for instructions.\n\nMiss Martha Isaacs was informed that the Department did not wish to have the school at Big Cove remain closed for any further period than was absolutely necessary, and if she does not return within a short time she should be informed that her services will have to be dispensed with, and you may then arrange to obtain a teacher to succeed her.\n\nThe application which you forwarded from Mrs. Peter Quaire is returned herewith as requested. If you do not consider that she would be a satisfactory teacher, she should not be engaged, and steps should be taken by you to endeavour to obtain another teacher that you consider satisfactory for the position if Miss Isaacs does not decide to return.\n\nThe Department is aware of the need of a new school building and teacher's residence on the Big Cove reserve, but we are handicapped by lack of funds, and it will hardly be possible to have these buildings erected during the coming summer, as we had hoped to do.\n\nThe Department will leave the question of the retention or the dispensing of Miss Martha Isaacs' services in your hands to deal with as you consider in the best interests of all concerned.\n\nI might further add for your information that we have received a communication from Mr. Superintendent Sheridan informing us that Miss Rebecca Isaacs, teacher of the Eel Ground school, has returned and resumed duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.

She brought a boy with her morning her own son and he is a crazy fellow act so funny that the children get lot of fun from him at school and loses their time also he chases them around with sticks and other things during school hours. The last teacher satisfied us alright she was a good teacher and showed progress among the children so the people want her back again she is a help everywhere both at church and at School.\n\nThis is all truth what I say and we will be satisfied if there is a man come from Ottawa to settle this business I'm not signing my name to this but there is a man needed from Ottawa to come then I will show up and prove to these things we have writing down.\n\nWe are yours truly,\n\nBig Cove Reserve\nOTTAWA, September 30th, 1922.\n\nRev.

He was there last year. She does not allow this boy to attend the Ind. day school.\n\nMrs Savage informed me that Mrs Peter Clair was a frequent visitor to her house and informed her that she (Mrs Peter Clair) did not want the Big Cove School yet at the same time she was writing to me for the school.\n\nTo make matters worse, Mrs Peter Clair feels so confident in her teaching ability, that she states in one of her enclosed letters, that she intended having her PUPILS ready for \"HIGH SCHOOL\". What \"HIGH School\" she means I really do not know.\n\nWe were most fortunate in getting Mrs Savage for the present. She is well qualified to teach and is taking a deep interest in the children. I do trust the Dept. will understand this, yet if you should think it advisable to comply with the wishes of Mrs Clair, it might be well to send someone from Ottawa to look into things.\n\nIt was against my wish, that Mrs Clair was given this school, yet as the Dept. wanted the school opened and as there was no teacher available other than Mrs. Clair she was placed in charge of said school.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nInspector of Ind.

Perrier, Esq.,\nSup't Indian Education,\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir:\n\nWe Indians must let you know that since we are about to have a new school, we also want a new teacher. The one that we know will be able to advance the scholars and able to control them. The teacher we had last year was not worth even the 1/4 of the salary that was paid to her, for she could not teach the pupils as they should be taught. Our children are just as ignorant as the first day they went to school. Besides they use their own language about the school. They say words that should not be said by pupils of their age, and swear at the teacher and mock her. She only stands there and laugh at them, for she do not understand them; so it is very hard for her to be able to correct them. We saw a big difference between last year and this year. When the inspector came last year they were a large number of scholars. This year only five or six. I do not see why the inspector favors a teacher that is not any good. For our part we don't send our children to school, and will not until we have a teacher that suits us. We have one here on our reserve that understands the three languages, English, French and Indian. She taught before in our school last year, and just had the pupils well strengthened out when she was taken out with no reasons whatever. We were all satisfied, for she had a good discipline among the pupils. Her name is Mrs Peter Clare, and we are all willing to have her back, for we know she is a good teacher, able to control the pupils and have order among them. Father Ryan when he comes to inspect the school, he only stays not even an hour. How does he know how the pupils succeed or not. He is always in a rush, just take time to copy down the report, that is\nSo it is not much use for him to inspect the school here. But we Indians on the Reserve that see and follow the education of our children, we know of how much they are advanced. It is of no use for our children to go to school if the case is, when they get an education, then they are not able to get a chance to teach. This cannot be. So this Mrs Peter Clare has a first Class diploma, both in English and in French, and will go through an examination any time. So it is her we want. Her former name was Miss Rita Reta G\u00e9d\u00e9on. She taught here in 1918. If you look it up, you will see. And we have no fault with her.\n\nWe have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour most humble servants\n\nChief Joseph Samigoo\n\nTHE BIG COVE BAND\nno Big Love\nfrom April 1825\nto June 30th 25\n\nRyan says June 25\nmarried couple needed\n\nMrs. Bellmore \"no good\"\n\"a freak\"\nWhat SALARY would the Dept. be willing to pay a man and his wife to take charge of the Ind. day school at Big Cove?

They are at present in U.S.A., He states they would fill the BILL, but it would take a good SALARY to get them to take over this work. Both hold, I think, 2nd class License.\n\nOn account of the trouble with Mrs. Peter Clair, at Big Cove, I think it would be better to leave this school closed until the new one is ready, then begin the new system in the proper way.

It is considered that a married man having the necessary qualifications, who would perform the work in the classroom, and his wife, who would assist him, and also teach sewing and domestic science to the older girls and women on the Reserve and visit their homes and instruct them in housekeeping and the proper care of children, etc., should be obtained for this school.\n\nYou will, therefore, in conjunction with Rev. Father Ryan, Inspector of Indian Schools, endeavour to obtain the services of a married couple having the necessary qualifications. They would be known as teacher and assistant teacher, respectively. The salary allowed would be as follows:\n\nTeacher - $600, plus bonus of $150 per annum,\nAsst. Teacher - $400,\n\nThis would make a combined salary and bonus of $1,000 per annum. In addition to this, if the teacher will perform the duties of janitor and truant officer, we will allow him salary at the rate of $50 per annum for each of these services, which would add an extra $100 per annum to the above combined salary.\n\nIt is hoped that it will be possible to obtain the services of suitable teachers in time to re-open the school when the building is ready. The names, qualifications and experience of any applicants received should be forwarded for the consideration of the Department.

It is considered that the services of a married couple would be the most satisfactory for this school. The man should be a qualified teacher, who would carry on the work in the classroom, and his wife, who would be classified as assistant teacher, should assist him and teach sewing and domestic science to the older girls and women on the Reserve, and visit their homes and instruct them in housekeeping and the proper care of children, etc. The salary allowed will be as follows:\n\nTeacher - $600, plus bonus of $150 per annum,\nAsst. Teacher - $400,\n\nThis would make a combined salary and bonus of $1300 per annum. In addition to this, if the man would undertake the duties of caretaker and truant officer, another $100 would be allowed for these services.\n\nWe have informed Mr. Agent Hudson accordingly, and hope that, acting in conjunction with him, you will be able to obtain the services of a properly qualified couple to take charge of this school.

Father Ryan, Inspector of Indian Schools for the Province of New Brunswick, has forwarded an application from Edward Whalen on behalf of himself and his wife for the positions of teacher and assistant teacher, respectively, at the Big Cove Indian Day School. Mr. Whalen has excellent qualifications, and has had previous experience. We have approved of the appointment of Mr. Whalen as teacher, and his wife as assistant teacher and matron and to instruct the older girls and women on the Reserve in sewing and household work.\n\nThe salary allowed Mr. Whalen will be at the rate of $650 per annum, to be paid on a basis of ten teaching months in the year. This salary is to be supplemented by a bonus at the rate of $15 per month for each teaching month. Mrs. Whalen will be allowed salary at the rate of $450 per annum, supplemented by bonus at the rate of $15 per month for each teaching month. In addition, if Mr. Whalen will perform the duties of janitor and truant officer, he will be allowed an extra $50 per annum for each of these services.\n\nIt is hoped that Mr. and Mrs. Whalen will accept the positions and be ready to take up duties when the schools re-open after the new year.\n\nYou will be good enough to see that the furnishings from the present teacher's residence are transferred to the new school, and you should forward a list of any new furnishings that will be required.\n\nIf Mr. and Mrs. Whalen accept, I have to request that you will give them every assistance you can in their work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nThe Dept. of Ind.

Ryan.\nOttawa, December 28, 1923.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of the 21st instant, I beg to inform you that we are pleased to note that Mr. and Mrs. Edward Shales have accepted the positions as teacher and assistant teacher respectively at the Big Cove Indian Day School, and that they will be ready to begin duties early in the new year.\n\nWe are informing Mr. Agent Hudson accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. F. O. Ryan,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRed Bank, North. Co.,\nN.B.\nOttawa, December 28, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is informed by Rev. F. C. Ryan, Inspector of Indian Schools, that Mr. and Mrs. Edward Whalen have accepted the positions as teacher and assistant teacher, respectively, at the Big Cove Indian Bay School, and that they will begin work on January 3rd, next, or not later than the 6th of the same month.\n\nYou should assist the teachers in obtaining a good attendance, and also in any other way you can in their work. We hope that they will meet with every success, and that the Indians will take full advantage of the opportunity offered their children to obtain an education by encouraging a regular attendance.\n\nWe hope that both the school and teachers' residence will be ready for the teachers when they arrive.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nI am forwarding you requisition for articles necessary for use in the Big Cave School, also a list of things needed by Mrs. Whalen for her sewing classes in this school.\n\nI wish to say that everything in connection with this school is progressing very favorably; the teacher is well satisfied with the accommodations, and finds the school and dwelling warm and comfortable. The Indians are also well satisfied with the teacher, so far at least, and are sending the children very regular. I believe he will be a good truant officer as they seem to think that there is no way to avoid sending them, as he will not take any excuses.\n\nI would ask you if you have forms with which Mrs. Whalen can keep a record of her work in teaching domestic science. And how you wish her to make report of her work; will she need to keep a register for the attendance of her pupils? I think it would be a good plan, as it would be easier to know what success she was having in this line.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian agent\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, reporting on the progress being made by the teachers at the Big Cove Indian Day School since it was re-opened in the new school building. The Department is pleased to hear that the Indians are well satisfied with the teachers and that the children are attending school regularly.\n\nI may say that we have no special forms on which Mrs. Whalen, the assistant teacher, can forward a record of her work in teaching domestic science. She should make a written report, showing the work that has been performed, and forward it through your office at the end of each quarter. She should state the attendance, enumerate the articles made by the pupils, and state generally the progress that has been made, and the interest shown in the work. A register is being sent you under separate cover in which Mrs. Whalen can enter the names of the pupils and their attendance. This register should be kept entirely separate from that showing the attendance of the pupils at the day school. The school material asked for by the teacher will be sent addressed to him, Reaton, N.B.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nChas.

Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, enclosing a communication from Edward Whalen in which he tendered the resignation of himself and his wife as teacher and assistant teacher, respectively, of the Red Bank Indian Day School. I have the honor to say it is regretted that Mr. and Mrs. Whalen have given up their duties at this school and their resignation is accepted.\n\nThe application which you forwarded from Miss Miriam O. Dunphy for the position as teacher and the recommendation that Miss Elizabeth McDade be appointed as assistant teacher was also received. In view of your request and the fact that Miss Dunphy would be satisfactory for this school, the Department will approve of her appointment, as well as the appointment of Miss McDade as assistant teacher. The salary allowed Miss Dunphy, who is to perform the duties of teacher, will be at the rate of $600 per annum for the ten teaching months, supplemented by the bonus provided by law. Miss McDade, who is to perform the duties of assistant teacher and matron and instruct the girls in sewing and household work, will be paid at the rate of $500 per annum for the ten teaching months, supplemented by the bonus provided by law. The bonus to teachers of Indian day school for the present fiscal year ending March 31st, 1925, will be at the rate of $15 per teaching month.\n\nBesides the salary allowed Miss Dunphy as teacher, she will be paid at the rate of $50 per annum for the performing of janitor services, and $50 per annum for performing duties as trusty officer. This will provide Miss Dunphy with a total salary and bonus for the above services at the rate of $650.\n\nIn view of the fact that Mr. and Mrs. Whalen had special qualifications, it is considered that the total salary offered to Miss Dunphy, viz., $650, and the total salary offered to Miss McDade, viz., $550, would be a very fair remuneration.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will ascertain from both these ladies whether they will accept the positions offered and be prepared to take up duties when the school re-opens after the present summer holidays, on September 2nd, next. Kindly inform the Department of their decision in order that we can communicate with Mr. Agent Hudson and give him the necessary information and instructions.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will further state whether you have received any applications for the positions as teachers at the Red Bank, Eel Ground and Eel River Indian Day Schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

She understands cooking thoroughly, has had experience in dress making, and has served her apprenticeship in a Tailor shop.\n\nShe is of a painstaking character, of a very high moral standing, and I feel confident would exercise a splendid moral influence over the Indians. I am sure, also, that she would be very conscientious in her work.\n\nI am, Rev. Father,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mrs. McDade\nThis girl does not hold a\nNormal School license, but is an\naccomplished book keeper, a\ndress maker, and can cook\nbeautifully. I think she would\ntake an active interest in\nthe work on Reserve both in\ntemporal and spiritual matters.\nShe is very reliable, and would\nI am sure make good, the Dept.\nwould have no cause to\nregret their choice. It is\nnot easy to find a licensed teacher,\nsuitable in every respect for a\nplace like this, and I feel sure\nshe would prove satisfactory.\n\nI shall see to apply for the\nschool and to enclose her from\nRev. F. M. Lockey,\n\nI trust this information and the enclosed recommendation will be sufficient to procure the position for her, as I would be very pleased to have her for a companion.\n\nYours respectfully,\nWilliam Murphy\n\nP.S. In my own application I state I was a High School Graduate, M.B., License of Second Class, State Certificate from Maine, three years attendance at Boarding School, five years of pioneer teaching on Red River.\n\nHowever I suppose the Dept. would recognize me as the former teacher at Woodstock M.B.

I can assure the Department, Miss Umphrey has been one of the best teachers in my Agency. Her domestic work was a credit to any school, as well as all of her other work. I was very sorry when I was informed she was leaving the Woodstock School. I would recommend the Department employ her as teacher of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB.J.

Some of the children were away on account of no clothing.\n\nThe Indians are very poor this year and there is little or no work around here. They are beginning to move away already and a lot more plan on going away as soon as fishing starts along the shores.\n\nOliver Simon had been poorly this winter and now he is having boils. He dislikes history so I told him we would take very little of it as you see by the report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEdward Walker.\nMain River, N.B.\nMay 27/27.\n\nRev. Father Ryan,\nBank, N.B.\n\nDear Father:\n\nI hereby resign my position as teacher of the Big Cove Indian Day School. Resignation to take effect June 30th, 1927.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.J. Whalen.\n\nP.S. This includes Mrs. Whalen also.\n\nE.J. W.\nWoodstock, N.B.\n\nJanuary 21st, 1929\n\nDyson, Dept. of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have applied for a position in the Customs Dept. (Dept. of National Revenue) and that Dept. has asked me to obtain from your Dept., a statement showing particulars of my service while employed as a school teacher on the Big Pine Reservation, Ont. Co., N.B., i.e. the inclusive dates of such employment, the salary received, the amount of sick and special leave granted since Jan 1st, 1924, and the amount of statutory leave since April 1928.\n\nI was not employed in your Dept. since June 30th, 1927 so complete to that date.\n\nAnd oblige,\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nE. J. Wilson.\nOttawa, January 24th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, requesting a statement showing particulars of your services while employed as teacher at the Big Cove Indian Day School, Kent Co., N.B.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that our records show you began duties on January 3rd, 1924, as teacher, with salary, including bonus, at the rate of $80 per month. You were also paid at the rate of $50 per year for janitor's services and at the rate of $50 per year as truant officer. You resigned on June 30th, 1924.\n\nYou were re-appointed as teacher of the Big Cove School on January 1st, 1925, with salary for your services as teacher, janitor and truant officer at the same rates as mentioned above. You were employed continuously from the date of your re-engagement to June 30th, 1927, when you resigned.\n\nDuring the above periods of your engagement, you conducted school on the regular teaching days, the only holidays taken being the usual two months' summer vacation and the holidays allowed at Christmas and Easter and statutory holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The Department paying two-thirds of the cost and the balance, about $100, to be taken from the funds on the credit of the Band, as it knows of no way in which this money should be spent to better advantage. The Band having only about $300 to their credit, there would be no interest money of any account to distribute, and the Indians should be only too glad to have an opportunity to contribute to such a laudable object. The Department has the power to authorize the expenditure of Indian funds for such purposes, and the Indians should be so informed.\n\nI may add that the Band is not being asked to contribute anything towards the salary of a teacher, which will be paid by the Department when the school is opened.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.D.

It is tragic in the extreme. Who is responsible for the farce? I know not.\n\nIt is impossible for the teacher to take any interest in the school unless her surroundings are made better. Her old desk is but an old table and the school room but a mere woodshed compared with the rest of the Indian schools throughout the province.\n\nThe Department's attention should be given in earnest to this reservation and school. When the teacher arrived she had no place to board and finally got two rooms in the chief's house. I thought the teacher's house theme should have been prepared for her.\n\nUnder the careful care of Miss Isaacs I believe this school will improve. She is the best teacher I could get, at present among the Indian schools of the province. In going there I promised her that she would have a good home and school all newly arranged, for I expected the Department to carry out my reports as best they could. When Miss Isaacs arrived she found the teacher's apartments there so filthy that she was forced to get rooms in the Chief's house. The painting in the schoolhouse is poorly done. The kalsomine over the plaster was so thin that it would have been better if the school had never been touched. The plaster is still broken. The teacher has an old table for a desk.\n\nWhether the interior of the school is done in \"Bee's Beer\", or the man or men were under its influence, I cannot say, yet, it is fine production of some unbalanced brain.\n\nFUEL.\n\nThere was neither coal or wood at this school when I was there.\n\nF.

You should obtain prices for a suitable desk and submit the same for the consideration of the Department, and this matter should receive your prompt attention.\n\nThere was neither coal nor wood at this school when the Inspector was there.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Sheridan, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBuctouche, N.B.\nSir:\n\nYour favor of Nov. 30th. received, containing a report by Inspector Ryan, regarding the repairs to the Big Cove School.\n\nWhy did he not make a definite report setting forth the facts, as he calls it, he states the kalsomine is thin, I must agree they might have done a better job, but they stated they had never done this kind of work before, and got it streaked somewhat, as regards the other work, I am satisfied, it is a good decent piece of work, and the material of good quality. The painting was done by Noel Denny, an Indian who painted the Church for Father McLaughlin, and it was satisfactory to him. Probably Inspector Ryan is not satisfied to see the roof tipped in creosote instead of being painted, as they all want the roofs painted red.\n\nRegarding the plaster, the holes and cracks were repaired with rock wall, they were alongside the floor, and the slamming of a heavy door, might have knocked it off again, if this is so, the only way will be to have it all taken off, and a spring attached to the floor, to prevent it slamming, as it is impossible to keep plaster on, if the floor is slamming all the time.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Supt.\n\nSecretar.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, December 12th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, reporting on the manner in which the repairs to the Big Cove Indian Day School were carried out.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, if the plaster is falling off, caused by the slamming of the door, your suggestion that a spring be attached to the door to prevent it slamming should be carried out. If you consider this would overcome the difficulty, you may arrange to have a suitable spring attachment placed on the door. The plaster should also be repaired, and the new plaster should be kalsomined in the same colour as formerly used.\n\nThe Department will leave in your hands the question of having the plaster repaired and the spring attachment put on the door, and will expect you to make the best arrangements in the matter. This should receive your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst.

Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMessrs. Ketchum & Co.,\nSparks St.,\nOTTAWA.\nOTTAWA, June 30th, 1922.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThe Supplementary Estimates for the current fiscal year which have recently received the assent of Parliament provide an amount sufficient to erect a new school building with living quarters for a teacher attached, on the Big Cove Reserve. As early as 1914, your predecessor, Rev. J. J. Ryan, drew the attention of the Department to the need of a new school building on this Reserve.\n\nPlans are now being prepared for a building to accommodate about 40 children, with living quarters attached suitable for a married teacher.\n\nIt will be necessary, before building operations commence, to select a suitable site, and I have therefore to request that you will state whether this new building should be erected on the site of the present building, or alongside, or whether another site on the Reserve should be obtained. It will be necessary to have at least an acre of land, in order to provide playgrounds and garden plots, if the latter should be desired. The site should be level and permit of good drainage.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will inform the Department as soon as possible regarding the site on which you would advise that this school should be erected. I am sure you will be able, from your knowledge, to give the Department the information desired. It is hoped that the present site near the old school building will be suitable and in that case it would not be necessary to obtain another site. Any information you can furnish in this matter will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. F. C. Ryan,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRed Bank, North. Co.,\nN.B.\nOttawa, August 1, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Supplementary Estimates for the current fiscal year provide an amount sufficient to erect a new school building, with living quarters for a teacher attached, on the Big Cove Reserve. Plans are in course of preparation for a building to accommodate about 40 children and with living quarters for a married teacher.\n\nIt will be necessary, before building operations commence, that a suitable site be secured. Rev. Father Ryan, Superintendent of Indian Schools for New Brunswick, states that the site on which the present school is located would not be satisfactory, as there is not sufficient ground. He mentions that an excellent site could be purchased across the road from the old school, from Patrick Simon, who would sell an acre of land for $30.00.\n\nI have to request that you will arrange with Mr. Simon for the purchase of one acre, if you consider this land suitable for the purpose. It should be dry, well drained and level. You should forward a description of the land selected, giving briefly its dimensions by meters and bounds, in order that a quit claim deed can be drawn and submitted for Mr. Simon's signature.\n\nWill you kindly forward a properly certified voucher in duplicate covering the amount to be paid for this land.\n\nThe Department would appreciate your early attention to this matter, as it is proposed to go ahead with the erection of the building at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Aest. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJohn Sheridan, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBuctouche, N. B.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF INSPECTOR RYAN ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE BIG COVE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL, DATED JUNE 28th.\n\nI can only say it is a very poor excuse for a school. It would be better known as a barn or woodshed.\n\nReally I am so pleased that the Department will build a teacher's house and school at Big Cove this summer. The old building could not be repaired, and was too small, about all the plaster has fallen down. This old school would make a good woodshed.\n\nA large reserve like unto this requires a married couple who will devote all their energy to better conditions. Great changes could then be expected.\n\nThe grounds will be too small for the new buildings, but an acre or more could be purchased for about $20.00 or less from a Ginish just opposite the present school.\n\nIndian Affairs.

F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nChas. Hudson Sec.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nOttawa, September 18th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Sutherland, of this Department, who visited the Big Cove School on the 11th instant, states that it will be necessary to have a well dug for the use of the new school and teacher's residence. You may, therefore, arrange with a competent person to drill a well of the required depth, and you should purchase a pump of the type required, as well as the necessary piping and casing. It is considered that the cost of drilling should not exceed $50 per foot, and that a depth of approximately 50' should be sufficient to obtain an ample supply of water. This well should be drilled and completed before the winter sets in.\n\nIt will also be necessary to obtain a stove for the classroom of the new school. It is considered that a box stove not exceeding approximately $35 would be satisfactory for the purpose. You should also purchase the quantity of stove pipe required. If possible, competitive prices should be obtained, and the purchase of a stove of the type considered satisfactory should be made in ample time to have it set up before the school opens.\n\nAs this is a new building, it should be furnished with a fire extinguisher. You may, therefore, arrange for the purchase and delivery of a 24 gallon fire extinguisher, properly charged and ready for use. This should be placed in some convenient position in either the schoolroom or the teacher's living quarters.\n\nWith reference to the old school building, it is considered that, if this building were removed from its present site and placed near the new school building, directly in front of the coal shed, it would be of great use as a playroom, or for storage purposes for the use of the pupils and teacher. You may, therefore, arrange early this coming winter to have this old school building moved. Mr. Sutherland discussed this matter with you, and in moving the building you should carry out his instructions. When the building is moved, it should be placed on stone piers, the stone now under the building should be used for that purpose. It is considered that it will be possible to have the building moved at an expenditure not exceeding approximately $50.\n\nThe toilets at the old school building may remain where they are, and, if required, they can be used in connection with the hall.\n\nThe desks in the old school building should be removed, and, as they are of no further use, they may be broken up, or disposed of.\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\ndisposed of in any manner considered advisable by you.\n\nYou will be good enough to attend to all of the above matters, and have the work completed in time for the re-opening of the school, on or about the last of January, next.\n\nProperly certified vouchers should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nWe will place an order here for the desks required, and you will be notified later as to the name of the firm from whom they will be obtained, and when they will be delivered at Rexton, the nearest railway station.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The Department will approve of having the building removed. The work should be done by day labour under the supervision of a competent foreman. Proper time sheets, in duplicates, should be kept for the labour employed. The stone from the present foundation should be used as foundation or support for the building on the new site. It is considered that the moving of this building could be more satisfactorily carried out after there has been a fall of snow. After the old building is moved, the site should be levelled and all rubbish removed. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to make the best possible arrangements for the moving of the building, and at the lowest possible cost.\n\nRegarding the staining of the shingles on the roof of the new school building, as mentioned in your letter of the 23rd ultimo, I beg to say, if the staining is done, it should not be considered as an extra on the contract.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

We have given Mr. Agent Hudson the necessary instructions to proceed with the work. There is a hall on the Reserve near the old building which should provide ample accommodation for the members of the Big Cove Band for the purposes of holding meetings.

B. Vautour, of St. Louis, to undertake the work at the price charged by him, viz: $1.40 per foot. It is hoped that it will not be necessary to bore to a greater depth than approximately 50 feet in order to obtain a good supply of water. You will be good enough to see that the work is satisfactorily completed, the well drilled to a sufficient depth to obtain plentiful supply of water. As instructed in our letter of September 20th, last, you may purchase a pump of the type required, as well as the necessary pipe and casing. You should see that the well is finished in all respects in order that the teacher can obtain the water necessary.

And is a very satisfactory piece of work in every respect. The lumber is of the best quality that can be procured, well seasoned, according to specifications.\n\nThe masonry is as good as any concrete work done in the country, a very neat and carefully finished piece of work. The plastering of the walls is done with Rockwall, the best kind of material that can be used down in this part of the country, as it is a quick drying sort of plaster, very suitable for use in a damp climate.\n\nThe finishing of the interior is neat and substantially done, stained and varnished according to your directions. The wood shed and toilets are all done with as much care and attention as any part of the other building; those little buildings are also painted, and roof stained with creosote, although they were not mentioned in the specifications.\n\nI can safely recommend that this building would satisfy the most critical of inspectors. The window locks, storm window fasteners, close hooks in the cloak rooms, chalk trough and box, blackboards, and every little thing are all neatly put in place.\n\nThe contractor would like to be advised when you intend that he should cancel the insurance on this building.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian agent\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed, that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item in the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The exterior of the following buildings should receive one coat of paint: Combined school and teachers' residence; the old school building which is used for domestic science purposes; the wood shed and the coal shed and the two out houses. You should arrange for the purchase of the paint, oils, etc., required, and for the labour in having the work done. You should obtain the services of a competent painter to act as foreman on the work, and he should employ Indian labour as far as possible. Proper time sheets, in duplicate, should be kept. If you require forms for this purpose and an advance to pay the wages, you should make application in due time for same. If possible, you should obtain competitive prices for the paint, etc., required.\n\nRelative to the two out houses, you should arrange to have a screen erected in front of each door. No unnecessary expense should be incurred for this purpose.\n\nIt is noted that you estimate the cost of the painting, including material and labour, to be approximately $300, and the total cost of the work should not, if possible, exceed this amount.

Father Ryan, in a report on his recent inspection of the Big Cove Indian Day School, states that very fine mesh window screens should be provided, in order to keep out mosquitoes. He states that seven screens are required for the school and four for the teachers' residence. If you consider that these screens are necessary, you may arrange for the purchase and installation of same. It is not intended that any unnecessary expense be incurred for the purpose.\n\nThe Inspector also states that the drain from the teachers' residence portion of the school should be opened and repaired, as water lies in the cellar all spring and summer. I shall be pleased to have a report from you regarding this drain, stating what you would recommend be done, and the approximate cost of same.\n\nThe Inspector further states that the teachers require a heater in their residence, as it is very cold in winter. I shall also be pleased to have a report regarding this matter, giving the approximate cost of supplying a heater of a type that would be satisfactory.\n\nI shall also be pleased to have a report from you regarding the Inspector's recommendation that a small shed be built against the old school building, in which the teacher can store his car. It may be that if the rough lumber, nails, etc., were supplied for the purpose, the teacher could put up this shed himself. Please furnish your suggestions regarding the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto,\nN.B.\n\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of June 26th, File No. 55-1-5 referring to recommendations of Rev. Father Ryan concerning the Big Cove school, I beg to say that window screens are necessary, but 4 for the school and 3 for the teachers residence will be sufficient.\n\nIn regard to the drain from the teachers residence I have to say that the only remedy for the water lying in the cellar, would be to dig a drain from the cess pool to the river. This will be a distance of about 40 rods. And in this drain will have to placed 4\" tiling. The condition of the soil where these buildings are situated is of such a nature that the cess pool fills and the water backs into the cellar. A piece of work like this will cost about $250.00. I would say that if this work was to be authorized by the Department it could be done principally by the Indians with a competent foreman, and would relieve the unemployment among them for a while.\n\nIn case of a heater being supplied for the teachers residence I would recommend a small cabinet heater that would not cost more than $25.00. I think it necessary that a heater of some sort be supplied.\n\nIf the lumber could be supplied for a shed to be used by the teacher for storing his car, the work will be done without any cost to the Department.

It is noted that 4 window screens for the school and 3 for the teachers' residence are necessary. You have already been authorized to purchase and install these screens.\n\nWith reference to the supplying of a heater for the residence, I beg to say that you may arrange in due time for the purchase of a small cabinet heater and the necessary stove pipe. The cost should not exceed your estimate of approximately $35.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase of lumber, not exceeding in cost approximately $25, to be used in the erection of a shed for the storing of the teacher's car. It is to be understood that the teacher will perform the labour in the erection of this shed, without any cost to the Department.\n\nPlease forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the above authorized expenditure.\n\nRelative to the drain from the teachers' residence portion of the school, it is noted that you recommend the opening of a drain from the school to the river at a distance of about 40 rods. It is regretted that, owing to the cost involved in the work of installing the drain and the expenditure we have already authorized for painting and for other purposes at this school, we will have no funds for the work in connection with the drain. This will have to stand over until next year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. J. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.

H. Paget,\nChief Accountant.\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N. B.\nSir:\n\nIn your letter of July 11th, authority was given me to purchase lumber for the amount of $25.00 for the erection of a shed for storing the teacher's car. When the shed is erected it will just take that amount of lumber to provide the frame and rough boarding for the outside. The roof needs covering; and also a floor is required. I will have to ask the Department to authorize the expenditure of about $30.00 additional, for to complete this shed.\n\nIt might seem extravagant to the Department, to build this shed, but it is necessary for the teacher to have a car in order that he can get away from Big Cove on week ends. And then it is not reasonable that he should have to leave his car out in the weather. No lumber will be used but what is absolutely necessary to build the shed.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, October 31st, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, relative to the authority which was given you to purchase lumber to an amount not exceeding $25 to erect a shed in which to store the teacher's car at the Big Cove Indian Day School, and requesting that an extra amount of $30 be granted in order to complete this work.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say that Rev. Father Ryan, in a report on his recent inspection of this school, states that it would be advisable to have, in connection with this garage, a storeroom in which to store the double windows, screens, etc. He states that a storeroom is greatly needed, as everything is always very untidy about the place due to want of a proper storeroom. Would you recommend that space be provided for storage facilities over the shed or garage used for the storing of the teacher's car? If so, the Department would be prepared to authorize the expenditure necessary to have storage facilities provided. I shall be pleased to have, as soon as possible, your views as to the suggestion of the Inspector. If you recommend that these storage facilities be provided, you might furnish an estimate of the cost of the material required, stating whether the teacher could do the work without cost or whether it would be necessary to pay for part of the labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nSir:-\n\nYour File 55-1-5\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo referring to recommendation of Inspector Rev. F.C. Ryan that there should be a store-room in connection with the garage which is in course of construction at the Big Cove Indian Day School. In reply I beg to say that I would approve of Inspector Ryan's suggestion that there should be a place to store the storm doors and double windows in the summer season, and window screens etc., in the winter.\n\nThe amount necessary to complete this building, including the extra labour will be not more than $75.00 in addition to the $25.00 already authorized in Departmental letter dated July 11th. File 55-1-5. This will cover all expenses including a coat of paint.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nP.S. The teacher would not have the time to do all the work necessary to complete this building.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 9, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, relative to the recommendation of Rev. F. C. Ryan, Inspector of Indian Schools, that a storeroom be provided in connection with the garage which is in course of construction at the Big Cove Indian Day School, and giving an estimate of the cost of providing this accommodation.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of provision being made for the storage of the storm windows, double doors, window screens, etc. We note that you estimate the total cost to be $75 in addition to the $25 already authorized to provide storage facilities. You may arrange for the purchase of any material required and also for the labour. It is noted that the estimate which you submit will cover all expenses, including a coat of paint.\n\nIt is expected that the teacher will give any assistance possible in the construction of this garage and storeroom. You should arrange to have this work completed before the extreme cold weather sets in, keeping all costs as low as possible.\n\nAfter the work has been completed, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the material and for the extra labour employed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nOttawa, September 7, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nRev. F. G. Ryan, Inspector of Indian Schools for New Brunswick, states that the teacher of the Big Cove Indian Day School, in conversation with him at the recent convention of Indian school teachers in North Devon, drew his attention to the heating of the Big Cove Indian Day School. He claimed that it might be impossible to continue teaching during the extreme cold weather of the coming winter unless a furnace was installed.\n\nThis school has been heated by stoves since it was built, and, as far as the Department is aware, this was satisfactory. I have to request that you will state your views as to the necessity of installing a furnace and if, in your opinion, the school could not be kept sufficiently warm by the stove at present in use. If you consider that the installing of a furnace is urgent, you should state the type you would recommend and the approximate cost of supplying and installing it. The Department has incurred considerable expense at this school during the past few years and is not prepared to provide the cost in connection with the installation of a furnace, unless same is considered necessary to properly heat the school and residence.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your early report concerning the necessity of a furnace, which should be independent of the teacher's opinion.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The reason that a stove is not satisfactory is that the chimney is erected at the extreme end of the school building, and to heat the room satisfactorily the stove has to be placed so far from chimney that it will not burn without the pipe being cleaned about once a week. There is a distance of nearly forty feet between the stove and the entrance to the chimney, which is covered by 6\" stove pipe.\n\nI will get, as soon as possible, a suitable man who can install a furnace, to look at this job, and I will then be able to give an estimate of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent\nSept. 21, 1927\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs in accord with\nall the doors.\n\nSept. 21, 1927\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Ryan, in a report on his recent inspection of the Big Cove Indian Day School, recommends that a sand table be supplied. You may arrange to have a table suitable for the purpose built locally, keeping all expense as low as possible. This table should be installed in the school where required by the teacher.\n\nThe Inspector also recommends that the interior woodwork of the school be well washed, and that the floors should be scrubbed, and, when dry, given a coat of oil. You may arrange to have this work carried out. You should also arrange to have the toilets thoroughly cleaned and placed in a sanitary condition.\n\nThe Inspector further recommends that the domestic science room in the old school building be sheeted with beaver board, as he states the plaster is falling off. I have to request that you will furnish an estimate of the cost of the material and labour in having this work carried out. Please furnish this information at an early date.\n\nThe Inspector also recommends that in the Fall the school grounds be plowed, as the teachers are most anxious to have the grounds placed in good condition. You should arrange to have any bushes near the school cut down and removed, in order to prevent fire hazard. You should bear this matter in mind and have these grounds plowed early this coming Fall, and any brush or bushes removed.\n\nIt is also recommended that a furnace be installed. In this connection I would refer you to your letter dated October 5th, last, giving an estimate of the cost. Our funds this year are extremely limited and, unless there is urgent need for alteration in the heating arrangements, we would not be prepared to consider the installation of a furnace. I shall be pleased to have a further report from you regarding the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacNairty,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nChas.

Twelve water coolers would be required. These may be obtained from the General Steel Ware Co., 221 Prince St., Saint John. The cost would be $10.00 ea. less 33 1/3% which amounts to $80.00 My reason for making this recommendation is that the existing system in the schools is very unsanitary.

Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nRichibucto, N.B., Dec. 29th, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nOn account of the heavy expense for relief to the Indians I have not asked the Department for anything to provide a mid-day meal for the pupils of the Big Cove Indian Day school, but I think it advisable to recommend that it should be provided from Jan. 1st to March 31st next. The provisions provided will answer a double purpose, a meal for the children and means to teach them to prepare food. I will require an expenditure of $25.00 per month. This meal was provided last year from December 1st to April 30th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas. Hudson.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 8, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, regarding the supplying of a midday meal to the pupils of the Big Cove Indian Day School during the period from January 1st to March 31st, next.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $60 in the purchase of the supplies required to provide the midday lunch to the pupils during the above mentioned period. You should arrange for the purchase from time to time of the supplies required, and furnish itemized accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred. The total cost of these supplies for the period the meal is to be served is not to exceed in the aggregate the sum of $60.\n\nThe purchase of the supplies should be made from a firm on the list to receive consideration, in accordance with departmental instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\n| DATE | PARTICULARS                        | DEBIT | BALANCE |\n|------|-----------------------------------|-------|---------|\n| Jan 12 | To 4 bbl Potatoes @ 75\u00a2           | 3 00  |         |\n|      | 1 bbl Turnips @ 60\u00a2               | 60    |         |\n|      | 2 bus Carrots @ 50\u00a2               | 1 00  |         |\n|      | 100 lbs Cabbage @ 2\u00a2              | 2 00  |         |\n|      | 95 lbs Flour 3.00                 | 3 00  |         |\n|      | 10 lbs Shortening @ 16\u00a2           | 1 60  |         |\n|      | 1 case Milk @ 6.25                | 6 25  |         |\n|      | 25 lbs Prunes @ 9\u00a2                | 2 25  |         |\n|      | 2 pkgs Pepper @ 15\u00a2               | 30    | 20 00   |\n\nIndian Affairs.

As this branch of the school seems to be very satisfactory I think it advisable to provide the stove.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 19, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, regarding the condition of the stove in use in the domestic science school building on the Big Cove Reserve, and recommending that a new stove be supplied and giving an estimate of the cost.\n\nIn reply I have to say that our funds this year are so limited we would not be prepared to authorize the purchase unless it is absolutely necessary that a new stove be obtained. Could not the present old stove, with some repair, be placed in a satisfactory condition? Please enquire further into the matter and forward a report.\n\nI may add that it may be necessary to greatly curtail expenditure in connection with domestic science work at all our schools, and, in future, requests for materials, etc. should be kept at the lowest possible point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nDear Sir,\n\nNow that the schools have commenced their fall term I find that there are a few children to be vaccinated and inoculated and we are getting these completed. In visiting the schools I am stressing routine tooth brush drill, administration of cod liver oil and personal cleanliness. Regarding the latter, I am asking the teachers to have a basin, soap (lifesaver preferred), nail brush and towels always in readiness, in case of need. I hope that we will be able to resume milk lunches in the schools next winter. I would recommend that the children of all reserves (excepting Tobique and Saint Mary's) be supplied with good bread and butter along with their milk. I am asking the teachers to appoint one of the older children to be responsible for the cleanliness of the medical supply cupboards.\n\nI would like to visit all of our New Brunswick schools before making the proposed trip to Nova Scotia. This would probably take another three or four weeks. I would then be ready to go to Nova Scotia about the first or second week of October.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSgd: Mary L. Murdoch,\nPublic Health Nurse for N. B.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 19th instant File 55-1-5, re replacing the stove in the Domestic Science School building on the Big Cove reserve. In reply I have to say that it appears to me that this old stove cannot be repaired so that it will be safe for the children using it, and I would not like for the Department to be blamed for neglect if any of the Indian children were badly burned in using this stove. I believe the proper thing to do will be to install a new stove.\n\nI note what you say in regard to funds being limited and will do my best to curtail expenses.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 26, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, in further reference to the supplying of a new stove for use in the domestic science school building on the Big Cove Reserve. It is noted that the stove at present in use is beyond repair and unsafe.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase, at the lowest possible cost, of a stove of a type that would be satisfactory. You should make the purchase from a firm on the list to receive consideration. After the purchase has been made, please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nTO - Charles Hudson Esq.,\nINDIAN AGENT\nRichibucto, N.B.\n\nSIR:\n\nI recommend that the schoolchildren of your Agency of Northeastern New Brunswick be supplied with Tooth Brushes, they are required as follows:\n\nBig Cove Reserve - 2 dozen\nIndian Island - 1 dozen\nBurnt Church Reserve - 4 dozen\nRed Bank - 1 dozen\nEel Ground - 2 dozen\n\nMy reason for making this recommendation is that the children need tooth brushes to practice oral hygiene. Some of these schools were supplied with brushes one year and in some cases two years ago, and those brushes have been worn out.\n\nMary L. Buddell\nPUBLIC HEALTH NURSE\nI have been requested by Nurse Mary L.

Could not the floors be sprinkled with water before sweeping, which would keep down the dust? Our funds are limited, and it is necessary that all expenses be kept as low as possible and only the equipment absolutely necessary supplied. You may arrange for the purchase and delivery of 4 brooms, and when we hear further from you regarding the Dustbane, consideration will then be given as to whether same can be authorized or not.\n\nPlease forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the brooms.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nOttawa, October 24, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, regarding the request of Nurse Murdoch that ten dozen tooth brushes be supplied for the pupils of the various Indian day schools in your Agency.\n\nIn reply I have to say that recently the supply of brushes considered necessary was forwarded, as follows:\n\nBig Cove - 24\nBurnt Church - 45\nEel Ground - 24\nIndian Island - 25\nRed Bank - 12.\n\nTwenty-four brushes are now being forwarded to the teacher of the Eel River Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

For a year now, the poor little children have been sitting on high benches about 4 tables and for domestic purposes, in this their domestic science hall. We are now forced to turn our domestic science hall into a primary department.\n\nDesks for 30 children, a map for the Maritime Provinces, 3 or 4 blackboards, a teacher's desk, a board, will be required. As for cards and the rest all can be brought over from the old school. Mr. Fraser has more than he can do with the 6 higher grades. Next year, he will have about 30 in his Adv. Dept. and his wife will have about the same number in the old schoolhouse for a Primary Dept.\n\nRe desks for the old school - Mr. Fraser could give some from his Dept. to the old school. These are simple desks, iron legs and sides. I would advise purchasing same so that, when either Department should require a few more, or less, same could be brought back and forth from each building. 20 new seats would be enough - I think eight could be obtained from the new school.\n\nDouble windows should be purchased for the old school, it is an excellent building, quite warm, in fact a better building in this respect than the new one.\n\nThe inside of the new school must be kalsomined and cleaned. It is very dirty. The inside of teacher's house should be done.\n\nThe outhouses must be cleaned and whitewashed and repaired.\"\n\nPlease let the Department have a full report regarding the situation at Big Cove. You should keep in mind that our Appropriation is limited and that no heavy expenditure can be authorized. In replying, you state which improvements recommended by Inspector Ryan you consider necessary, and give an estimate of their cost. In the case of the desks, you should state the minimum number that would meet the requirements at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of June 28th, File 55-1-5 referring to the situation of the schools at the Big Cove Reserve. In reply I beg to say in regard to the necessity of providing more seats and desks, the case is about as the Inspector says it is. There are more pupils than can be accommodated in the new school building, and it does require that more seats should be supplied, and 20 would be the number. The type of seats in the new school building are named the \"Silent Sanitary School Desks\" these were purchased from Rhodes Curry Ltd., Amherst N.S. I might state that the seats required are single, and cost $7.00 each.\n\nIn regard to double windows for the old school, there is no need to purchase new ones as the old windows are in good condition except for the need of a few panes of glass.\n\nThe inside of the new school should be cleaned and kalsomined, and also the inside of the teachers residence should be treated the same. The expense for all the work and material to do all cleaning and necessary repairs should not cost more than $25.00. This will cover whitewashing and repairs for toilets.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 21, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant, I beg to say that you may purchase the new panes of glass that are required at the Big Cove Indian Day School. The inside of the school and the inside of the teacher's residence may be cleaned and kalsomined and the toilets whitewashed and repaired. It is noted that the cost of the materials and labour will not exceed $25.00.\n\nRegarding the 20 new desks, it is noted that you can secure these at a cost of $7.00 each, from Rhodes, Curry, Limited, Amherst, N. S. Please arrange for the purchase and installation of these desks. When placing the order, you should inform the firm regarding the ages of the children for whom the desks are required, in order that they can supply the proper sizes. When forwarding the usual account, in triplicate, covering the cost of the desks, you should quote as your authority E. R. No. 2407.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKensie,\nSecretary.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nCharles Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N. B.\nWith further reference to cleaning and repair of the Big Cove school buildings, I beg to inform you that when I have examined the outside windows of the old school, I find that instead of taking a few panes of glass it will require 30 panes, size 15\" x 28\", and these will cost about 35\u00a2 per pane. When I had those windows stored a few years ago, there was only a few panes broken, but since then the remainder of the glass was used to replace glass broken in the inside windows. Those outside windows have not been used for a number of years.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 15, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant, I beg to say that, if you consider it necessary to use the outside windows at the Big Cove Indian Day School, you may purchase the 30 panes of glass required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The teacher claims that these articles are not altogether satisfactory but that she could manage with them until next year.\n\nIn regard to local purchase of the above articles, there is no firm nearer than Saint John, or Amherst N.S.

F. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N. B.\nOttawa, January 26, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, informing the Department that, as a result of a reduction in the supply of milk to the Indians, the Chief has ordered all the children on the reserve to remain at home and not attend school and, also, that he demands the removal of the teacher.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department is not prepared to make any increase in the supply of milk. However, it has been decided that it would be of advantage to the children who attend school to provide them with a lunch at midday. You may therefore incur an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $60 in the purchase of food and supplies for the lunch for the pupils during the months of February and March, next. No doubt, Mr. Fraser, with the assistance of the older girls, could prepare and serve the lunch. We understand that there is a stove on which to prepare the hot lunch. Should any utensils be required, you may arrange for their purchase and delivery. I would request that you consult Mr. and Mrs. Fraser at the earliest possible moment regarding the food supplies required and the serving of the meal. It is thought that, if the children received a warm lunch at midday, there would be no objection to their attending school regularly. It is suggested that the lunch consist of soup with meat and vegetables and tea or cocoa. Condensed milk could be used for the latter. Please arrange at once for the purchase of the supplies, from firms on the approved list, and have the goods delivered to the school.\n\nIt is hoped that, as a result of the providing of a lunch at midday, the objection of the Indians to\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nallow their children to attend school will be overcome. In any event, this is all the Department is prepared to grant in the way of extra supplies for relief.\n\nYou should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, for all purchases which you make. These accounts should be attached by you to proper voucher forms, certified in the usual manner and forwarded for payment.\n\nRegarding the attitude taken by the Chief, I would request that you forward a further report concerning his activities in discouraging the attendance of the children. If satisfactory evidence is produced in connection with his actions in contravention of Section 10 of the Indian Act, consideration will be given to deposing him from his position as chief. You might state if you would recommend that this action be taken.\n\nPlease advise the Department, after the serving of the lunch has commenced, the result in the increased and regular attendance of the children. The Department does not desire to take any drastic action by having the Mounted Police visit the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. P.

He suggests that this ceiling be covered with metal sheeting or wood.\n\nI would request that you arrange to have the interior of both buildings thoroughly cleaned during the summer holidays, keeping costs as low as possible. Please forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nRegarding the installing of a metal or wood ceiling in the old school building, I would request that you furnish an estimate of the cost, together with your opinion regarding the material to be used.\n\nThe Inspector states, further, that the two outhouses are too small and should be enlarged. I would request that you report concerning the need of enlarging the outhouses and give an estimate of the cost of any work you would recommend be carried out in this connection.\n\nI may add that the Department will have no funds to install a furnace to heat the classroom and teacher's residence this year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

The cost of the necessary labour will not be more than $10.00. The both rooms are quite large and all the woodwork and seats and desks need to be washed.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is necessary for me to ask you for authority to purchase material to construct a small bridge over the ditch of the road in front of the school on the Big Cove Indian Reserve.

A. ROEY,\nSuperintendent Welfare & Training\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith regard to schools I presume there will be no painting done this year as it is getting late now for such work, but it is a pity that the Burnt Church and Big Cove buildings should be painted.\n\nYou usually have a recommendation from the Inspector Rev.F.C.Ryan as to what cleaning and varnishing is necessary for the interior of these buildings, and then you have sent me the orders to do what is necessary, but this year I have not received any orders about this work to date and now I will have to make a recommendation of my own, which will be that a good scrubbing be given the floors and no varnishing is necessary. This work will not cost much and I will need to have it done without waiting for your reply. I trust that you will be able to approve of my action.\n\nP.S. There is yet time to paint those schools, and they are the shabbiest of any in N.B.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nyour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 8, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 30th ultimo regarding painting the schools in your Agency I may say that there is an amount of $300.00 available for repairs and improvements. This sum may be used for painting one or two schools.\n\nIf the cost of the paint required for each school is more than $50.00 you should let me know the exact quantities of paint required in order that purchase may be made by our Purchasing Branch.\n\nHowever, if paint for the Burnt Church school can be purchased for $50.00 and the work done by Indians without employing white labour you may proceed with the purchase of the paint and arrange for the painting at the earliest possible date. What I have said regarding Burnt Church also applies to Big Cove.\n\nIf white labour is necessary you should advise me giving the approximate length of time that a painter would be employed and I will then ascertain the name and address of the person whom you should engage.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N. B.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th instant File 55-1-5 referring to painting of the schools at Big Cove and Burnt Church Reserves. In reply I would like to ask if the toilets at the Big Cove Reserve, the building of which has been authorized, will have to be paid for out of the $300.00 available for repairs and improvements. I imagine it will be, and if so there wont be sufficient left to paint the schools, as those toilets will cost about $40.00 each, there are two of them.\n\nWith regard to the work of painting, the Indians will be able to do the work, but it will be necessary to have a white man for foreman to see that the work is done properly and keep the Indians at work.\n\nI have not yet figured up what the paint will cost but I do not think there is any doubt but what $50.00 will purchase sufficient for each building.\n\nWith regard to the length of time necessary to paint those schools I believe it will require 10 days for Big Cove and about 1 week for Burnt Church, and it all depends on how many men are employed.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nyour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6660, file 275-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nSeptember 18, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th instant you should proceed at once with the painting of the Big Cove and Burnt Church schools.\n\nIt is noted from your letter that the cost of the material will not exceed $50.00 for each building; consequently, you may make the purchase from a firm or firms on the approved list.\n\nIt is also noted that you intend to employ Indians to do the necessary work but that a white foreman will be required at each school. In connection with the foreman at the Burnt Church school you should consult Mr. J.F. Barry, M.P., Chatham, N.B., and in regard to the foreman at the Big Cove school you should consult Mr. L.F.A. Robichaud, Richibucto, N.B.\n\nThe construction of two toilets at the Big Cove school at a cost of $40.00 each is also approved.\n\nIt is understood that repairs are required to the furnace at the Burnt Church school and as the necessary repairs can be done at a cost of $21.35 you may arrange for the work that can be done for this amount.\n\nYours truly,\n\nChas.

It will however cost about $3.00 to have it transferred from Indian Island to Big Cove, and as the roads at this time are very bad it may some little time before the job can be done.\n\nI will find out as soon as possible if this board is in good condition, and if it is I will have it taken to Big Cove and installed.

Hudson,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn connection with the Big Cove Day school, we will some minor repairs to the heater and cooking stove in the teachers residence. We also need a few panes of glass for the windows of the school and basement of the teachers residence. With regard to the stove, it needs a lining for the firebox and a patch on the lining of the oven. The heater needs two patches on the lining.\n\nIt is also necessary to have the toilets cleaned and the school-room washed. The total expense may reach the sum of $25.00 for labour and material. If it is possible to have it done for less, this sum won't be used. Repairing the stove and heater will take an experienced man and such workmen are hard to get, and not cheap at that, but it will be very much less cost than to purchase new stoves. This cooking stove has been in use for about 20 years and is in fairly good condition yet.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nyour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept., of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 1, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo and to state that you are authorized to proceed with the repairs that appear to be necessary at the Big Cove Indian Day School.

Hudson,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nRichibucto, N.B., August 13th, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nSome time ago I asked for your authority to have the floors of the Big Cove Indian Day School cleaned and oiled; also the walls washed. You approved of this, but now it is learned that the inside of this school is in bad need of painting. As far as can be learned, this school was never painted inside since it was built about twenty years ago. I believe the matter was taken up with you last year by the late Chief Hudson, though I can find no correspondence in that regard. The total painting job, including paint, brushes and labour, should not cost more than $400, and I would strongly recommend that this job be done before school re-opens September 1st.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

In view of the apparent need, however, you are authorized to proceed with this work and, if possible, to have it completed prior to the opening of the school year. It is noted that the cost is not likely to exceed $40.00.\n\nR.A.

Previous to this there had been a shortage of desks. In the Junior Day School, approximately twelve children are using long benches placed around a large table, while in the Senior Day School one bench and a long table are being used.\n\nTwenty-four desks were requisitioned so that each child might have desk. However, during the winter months there will be a smaller average attendance so that the present accommodation will not be so strained. If half the number of desks specified on our requisition of November 29, 1948 could be supplied, it would improve the seating situation in these days two Day Schools.\n\nThe breakdown in desks would be as follows: 6 Large and 6 Small.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[E.J.

I think that it would be much more convenient to have it adjoining the school house, as it would be warmer in the winter time, and the Teacher could have access to the school from her cottage, without going outside. If this building is built separate and apart from the school house, it will cost about $300.00.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 27th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant stating that the two-roomed cottage can be erected as an addition to the Big Cove school-house to provide accommodation for the teacher at an approximate cost of $150.00.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has no funds at present to put up this addition, but hopes to be able to undertake the work when the estimates for next year are available. In the meantime I should be glad if you would forward further details as to the material, construction, etc., of the lean-to which you could have erected for this sum.

If the pipe from the stove in the lean-to is connected through the wall with the pipe of the School House, a second chimney will not be required and probably this would be preferable to building a chimney on the lean-to as the same would have to be built above the roof of the school house, otherwise the stove would smoke and the same would not give satisfaction. I did not include any amount for the chimney in my previous estimate, but have included the same in this one.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 25th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant enclosing an estimate of the cost of an addition to the Big Cove School for the purpose of providing accommodation for the teacher.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as you were advised in official letter of the 27th ultimo, the Department trusts to be in a position to undertake this work when funds are available after the first of the next fiscal year.

This I do not know as it was not measured but I had to supply the dry wood for the time that I was there and will not ask any more less than ten dollars for it.

I am glad that I had not the authority to have the expenditure. We have been here so long that the house was fit to rent.\n\nSir Isaac came up to ask about anything and let me know what he thought that house fit for. He said there wasn't anything in the house that I could use. He said he had never heard of such a thing. I knew that the authorities were not interested in any surveying or the articles and records. He said he had nothing at all. What was there was all destroyed since we moved here. He had the authority to destroy them and keep the records. I think you people had\nto get out there on a cold February morning and start a fire with a green maple but the night before you would have went some wood. I wrote Sheridan about the wood and thought he would have informed the Dept. when that Miss Gibson was there she took everything out of the house to her own and it never came back only an old bedstead that had been used for a water. I think he slept in it since he was there and whatever became of the other bed stand that I knew that was not the one but there by the Dept. Division of Sheridan would make more frequent visits to Big Lake they would not be doing as they please when we asked to open school I informed Sheridan that the house was not provided had to wait two weeks till the school was fitted then\nShe didn't wish me to lose any more time and advised me to take my sick so I had to clean the house and take my bed and cooking utensils this so much that all winter the goods coming from the Depot in March. Now you say I should not have told Mr. Sheppard what I should have done after Isaac tried was sit at home and wait till matters were visited.

I beg to submit the following list, which I think is sufficient for the need of this teacher, as no doubt he will supply such things as bedding, dishes and things like that.\n\n1 Kitchen table, 3 chairs, 1 rocking chair, 2 yards table oilcloth, 1 coal scuttle, 1 scrubbing brush, 1 stove polish brush, 2 blocks stove polish, 5 window blinds for residence, and 1 water pail.\n\nAnd Sir we should also have 5 window blinds for the windows of the school room.\n\nThe cost of those articles would be approximately $40.00.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nIndian Agent\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Dec. 11, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, giving a list of the furnishings required for the use of the teacher's residence in connection with the new day school building on the Big Cove Indian Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of one kitchen table, 3 chairs, one rocking chair, 2 yards table oil cloth, one coal scuttle, one scrubbing brush, one stove polishing brush, two blocks stove polish, one water pail, 6 window blinds for the teacher's residence and five for the school. It will be necessary, if possible, to obtain competitive prices and the purchase of the above articles should be made from the firm quoting the lowest price. Please forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred, to which should be attached a memo showing the names of the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted. While the above mentioned articles should be of a serviceable type, it is not intended that any expensive supplies be purchased. When the blinds have been delivered you should arrange to have them put up.\n\nIt is hoped that you will have the teacher's living quarters and the classroom ready for use at the beginning of the new year. As you are being advised in another letter, the services of a married teacher have been secured for that date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nChas.

The drain pipe from the sink can be connected with the drain leading to the septic tank.

I think it will be possible to save $20.00 a year by getting a new stove.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 14th, st, concerning the matter of installing a sink in the teachers residence at the Big Cove Indian Reserve. I wish to say that it has taken me some time to get prices on this sink, which is the reason for me not answering your letter sooner.\n\nThe type of sink suggested by Father Ryan was a combined sink and laundry tray, a rather simple looking affair; But the price of this is about $90.00 not including the freight; which will be around $5.00. This makes this sort of arrangement rather expensive. Then there is an ordinary sink, heavy cast iron, porcelain lined, a good serviceable affair and one that I think would answer the purpose very well; This one can be bought for about $25.00 including the necessary pipe, and trap to connect it with the drain to the septic tank.\n\nThe latter is the one that I would recommend, for the ordinary washtub will answer the purpose of the laundry tray, and costs much less.\n\nThe teacher and I will put it in position.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Agent\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 29th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your two letters of the 25th instant, regarding the installation of a sink in the teacher's residence at the Big Cove Indian Day School, and the supplying of a cooking stove and bed spring.\n\nRegarding the installation of a sink, I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase and installation of the heavy cast iron, porcelain lined, sink, which you state can be obtained for approximately $25, including the necessary pipe and trap to connect it with the drain to the septic tank.

Father Ryan, in a report on his inspection of the Big Cove Indian Day School dated June 23rd, last, recommends that a new cooking stove, a table for cutting out garments and a cupboard, also a few utensils, be installed in the old school building which is used for the teaching of domestic sciences.\n\nPlease state the approximate cost of a new stove, also whether you can arrange to have a suitable table and cupboard built, and the cost of same. You might obtain a list from the teacher of the cooking utensils required, and forward an estimate of their cost.\n\nThe Inspector also recommends that the woodwork of the new school building be washed, and the floors oiled. He states that the oiling of the floors should be done by a competent man.\n\nHe further recommends that the outhouses be cleaned and whitewashed. You may arrange to have this work done with as little expense as possible. He also strongly recommends that a toilet be built for the teacher's use. Please state if you would recommend that this be done, and, if so, the approximate cost of the material and labour in erecting an inexpensive toilet.\n\nYou may purchase and have delivered 6 cases of laundry soap, 6 yards towelling and an inexpensive looking glass.\n\nThe Inspector also states that the teacher is anxious to instruct the boys in manual training, and requires a set of carpenter tools for the purpose. Please consult the teacher and have him prepare a list of what tools he requires, and furnish an estimate of the cost.\n\nYou should arrange this coming fall to have the grounds around the school plowed and harrowed, in order that next spring the teacher can teach gardening to the pupils.\n\nIt is expected that you will give all of the above matters your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Father,\n\nFollowing is a report of the Big Cove Domestic Science for the month of June, 1925.\n\nMittens finished - 5 pairs\nBlouses finished - 10\nDresses finished - 14\n\nTotal for April, May, June:\nSweaters - Blouses - Mittens - Dresses\n17 - 11 - 14\n\nSince your visit there were 2 blouses and 1 dress made for the three children that had started school that day. That makes a total of 15 blouses and 11 pairs of mittens. The dresses to be distributed the last day of school, the other two blouses were given to the boys as they were made as they were in immediate need of them, also the mittens. The mittens shall keep at school until fall.\n\nYours truly,\nMrs. E.J. Johnson.\nBig Cove, N.B.\nJune 25/25.\n\nRev. Father Ryan,\nRed Bank, N.B.\n\nDear Father:\n\nMuch better results could be obtained in the domestic science work if a sewing machine was placed in the old school house in connection with that work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEdward Whalen.\n\nP.S. A cook stove is also necessary in order to teach cooking.\n\nE.J.W.\nBig Cove, N.B.\nJune 25/25.\n\nRev. Father Ryan,\nRed Bank, N.B.\n\nDear Father:\n\nMrs. Whalen would like to have, in connection with the old school house, two cupboards built in connection with the cooking part.\n\nThey are described on the separate sheet of paper.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEdward Whalen.\nDear Father:\n\nReceived your letter today but I had already mailed your sweater to you. Hope you get it alright.\n\nFather Ryan, in regard to the fixing up of the old school house I am almost stuck as for the table in the corner as we spoke of, Mrs. Whalen would rather have a movable table so people could be on both sides if necessary. She says a plain table with probably two drawers near the top, to keep good scissors, patterns etc., in would suit fine. This table would cost very little, not over $10 or at the most.\n\nShe would also like a cook stove so as to teach cooking, and in connection with the cooking part she would like two cupboards each about 5 feet wide and 2 feet deep to a height of 3\u00bd feet. Then a continuation of the cupboard in height 3\u00bd feet farther and about 1\u00bd or 2 feet deep.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6061, file 275-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nI think if we are to have a school garden next year the ground should be plowed as soon as possible so the sod will rot. Then when I come back in September the ground could be harrowed and I could have a chance in my spare time to level and clean off the roots, etc.\n\nAs for a closet for the teacher, I could build that at any time, if they would supply the lumber. It would not cost over $35 I should not think.\n\nNow I will send sketches of the table and cupboards as desired by Mrs. Whalen but as for the closet any form at all will do as long as we get one.\n\nI would rather a chemical closet than an out building but either will do. Hope these plans and sketches will be suitable. I am a very poor person to draw plans.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEdward Whalen\n\nP.S. Mrs. Whalen would also like a sewing machine, in connection with...\nReferring to your letter of July 17th, concerning the price of a cooking stove to be installed in the old school building at Big Cove, I would say that the price of stove that would answer the purpose, would be about $40.00.\n\nI think the best way to arrange for the table and cupboard would be to procure the necessary lumber (which would need to be seasoned) and have the teacher build them. He could do this in his work of manual training of the boys; which would lessen the expense of those things very much. The cost of the material, lumber and nails should not be more than $10.00.\n\nIn regard to the erection of a separate toilet for teacher of this school, I think that it is necessary, and the best way to have it done is to provide the lumber and have the teacher build it. This also might be done by the work of manual training. If not, the expense of the toilet would not be more than $25.00.\n\nI have not yet received the list of cooking utensils, and carpenters tools, from the teacher, but will forward to you as soon as I get it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 15th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, relative to the cost of providing a cooking stove for use in the old building which is used for the teaching of domestic science at Big Cove.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of this stove, and the cost should not exceed your estimate of $40.\n\nYou may also purchase the lumber required to build a table and cupboard. The teacher should carry out the work of building the table and cupboard of the dimensions considered necessary, and the older boys should assist and in this way receive some training in manual work. We note that you estimate the cost of the material and labour required to be approximately $10.\n\nYou may also purchase the lumber and other material required to erect a separate toilet for the teacher. The teacher should also, in this case, arrange for the work in putting up the closet, and the older boys should assist him. We note that you estimate the cost of the material for the purpose to be approximately $25.\n\nYou should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost of the stove and for the material, lumber, etc., required in the erection of the table, cupboard and toilet for the teacher.\n\nPlease arrange to have the above work carried out at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nA.

Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWe have just finished our Convention at North Devon. It was most successful and in due time the Dept. will receive full reports of same.\n\nI wish by this hasty letter to call the Dept.'s attention to a long neglected matter, viz: the opening and the extending of the cellar drain at the teacher's house in Big Cove. The cellar is and has been in a most deplorable condition, flooded with water from the sink, &c., that back up into the cellar.\n\nAgain, Mr. Fraser claims that it might be impossible to have school in the Big Cove Ind. school if the coming winter be in keeping with our Country's tradition (the last two winters have been mild) unless a good FORAGE IS PLACED IN SCHOOL. I trust the Dept. will take care for these IMPORTANT ITEMS AT ONCE.\n\nEvery encouragement must be given Mr. Mr. Fraser. It would be nothing short of calamity for BIG COVE IND. RESERVE should Mr. Mr. Fraser leave.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Ind. Schools, p.m. 1889.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6061, file 275-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa, September 7, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, relative to the condition of the drain and the installing of a furnace at the Big Cove Indian Day School. In this connection I have to say that the Department is communicating with Mr. Agent Hudson, with the request that he report regarding the condition of the drain and the cost of carrying out the repairs required to place same in a satisfactory condition. Further, he is being requested to advise the Department concerning the urgency of installing a furnace. When his report is received, consideration will be given to both the above matters.\n\nI note that the convention of Indian school teachers, recently held at North Devon, was most successful and that you will forward full reports of same in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. F. C. Ryan,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRed Bank,\nNorth. Co., N. B.\nOttawa, September 7, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nA communication has been received from Rev. F. G. Ryan, Inspector of Schools for New Brunswick, in which he draws attention to the condition of the drain from the cellar in the teacher's residence portion of the Big Cove Indian Day School. He states that this cellar is, and has been, in a most deplorable condition - flooded with water from the sink, that backs up into the cellar.\n\nI have to request that you will furnish a report as soon as possible, regarding this drain, and state what you would advise be done in order to overcome the difficulty and to provide proper drainage. You should give an estimate of the cost of any work you recommend be carried out. The Department will expect your early report, in order that, if any work is authorized, it can be completed before the extreme cold weather sets in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N. B.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of the 7th instant referring to a communication from Rev. F.C. Ryan relating to the condition of the cellar of the Big Cove Indian Day School, and in reply I have to say that I have examined the cellar and find that the only way to correct the condition would be to have a drain dug and piping placed to carry the water from the cellar.\n\nThe distance from the cellar to where an outlet could be secured is about 200 feet, and the cost will be between $250.00 and $300.00 as the formation through which the drain has to be made is a shell rock and hard to dig. I would say that this drain is necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Agent\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, relative to the condition of the drain from the cellar of the Big Cove Indian Day School. It is noted you recommend the drain be dug and the necessary piping placed therein to carry the water from the cellar and that the length of this drain to a place where an outlet could be secured would be approximately 200'.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department would like to have arrangements made for a satisfactory drainage system for the school and residence portion of the building. You may arrange for the labour required in digging the drain, and you should see that it is dug to a suitable depth below the frost line and at a proper grade to permit of all water running freely from the pipe. You should also arrange for the purchase of the pipe required, and you should see that it is satisfactorily laid in the ditch from the cellar to the outlet, and that all joints are securely fastened, and the drain properly filled in. It is noted you estimate the cost to be approximately $300. If possible, this work should be carried out at a lower cost, as the department will rely on you to see that no unnecessary expense is incurred, having in view the performing of satisfactory work. It is thought that Indian labour could be used under the charge of a competent man who could supervise the work. The teacher might be able to undertake the service, keeping proper time sheets of the labour employed. Please arrange to have this work completed before the extreme cold weather sets in. The drain pipe should be securely connected to the sink in the teacher's residence, and it should also be arranged that any water from the cellar could flow out through the drain pipe. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to see that a satisfactory job is completed, and at the lowest possible expense.\n\nAfter the work has been completed, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the labour employed and for the quantity of piping required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

A previous order reached the Department and was paid. There are at present unsettled claims against Mr Bernard, the payment of which will anticipate his salary for the next six months, but as he has apparently obtained credit from you and other merchants on account of his official position, the Department is willing to assist in liquidating the liabilities at present outstanding and of which it has had notice. Mr Bernard will be informed that a distribution of his salary to meet these liabilities will be made, to extend over one year from the 1st July last, if he remains that length of time in its maxim the service, and on receipt of his acknowledgment of the indebtedness you will be paid 25% of your claim at the end of each school quarter.

As, however, Mr Bernard has apparently received credit from Merchants on the strength of his being an employee of this Department, it has decided to pay his outstanding liabilities out of his salary for the current year, should he remain so long in its service by quarterly payments of 25% of such claims.

Bernard absented himself from the school during the whole of March quarter last, and ever since he has been teaching he has been a constant source of annoyance to the Department through his creditors. He has made a practice of anticipating his salary by giving orders on merchants for more than his actual earnings, and as soon as one claim was satisfied another was sent in for payment.

As you remark enthusiasm is a very necessary qualification and will enable the teacher to overcome many difficulties.\n\nTrusting that you will eventually succeed in obtaining a teacher who will co-operate with the officials of the Department in its effort to raise the standard of Indian schools in your superintendency, I remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev.

Nathalie Babin Teacher of the \"Burnt Church School.\" I saw Miss Babin at Burnt Church some few days ago and she informed me that she had sent her resignation to take effect on the first of April next. I advised her that it was pretty short notice and she had better teach on to the end of June or until a teacher could be procured. She promised me that she would do so. I have made enquiries with a view of securing the services of a successor. All applications will be submitted to the Department for consideration. May I cause an advertisement asking for applications as teacher for this school to be inserted in the \"Newcastle Advocate,\" a paper printed and published in Northumberland County. I consider that this is the most advisable way of getting applications.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 24th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department would like to have Miss Babin remain in charge of the Burnt Church School till the end of the June quarter, as suggested in your letter. The opportunity of obtaining a qualified teacher will be much more favourable at the close of the school term than at present. In the mean time you may make inquiries and, if a suitable teacher can be had, there will be no objection to the change before that time, but it is not thought well to advertise till the month of June, if Miss Babin will remain.\n\nYou may use the columns of the \"Newcastle Advocate\" for advertising.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nR. A. Irving, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBuctouche, N.B.\nOttawa, March 24th, 1910.\n\nRev.

The Department is of opinion that the opportunity of obtaining a qualified teacher will be much more favourable at the end of the school term than at present, and Mr. Irving has been told not to advertise till June. If either yourself or he, as a result of inquiries, should be able to nominate a competent teacher before that date there will be no objection to making the change.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. J. Ryan,\nSuperintendent of Indian Schools,\nSt. Mary's Ferry, N.B.\nSir,\n\nI beg to state that I am just in receipt of a letter from Miss K. Babin, Teacher of the \"Burnt Church School\" Northumberland County, N.B., in which she states, that if a Teacher cannot be procured to take charge of this School for April 1st., that she will continue her services as Teacher until the end of September, providing that her resignation to the Department would not be any objection to her salary for the term ending September 30th., I cannot see that this should make any great difference and as a successor has not been procured and no applications have been received by me, I think it would be wise to allow Miss Babin to continue teaching this School until the first of October, by that time, the new School will be completed, besides it is much easier to procure the services of a Teacher to take charge of the School for that date, than it is now, as our School terms here end on the Thirtieth of June and the contracts of the Teachers now engaged, will only expire at the end of the term and in the meantime, I would consider it prudent to advertise for a Teacher to take charge of this School for the first of October as Miss Babin will not teach any longer than the first of April unless she is permitted to remain until the Thirtieth of September. Kindly advise me as to whether or not these arrangements will be satisfactory to the Department in order that I may communicate the same to Miss Babin.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nOttawa, April 1st, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo, in which you state that Miss Babin will not remain in charge of the Burnt Church school unless her term is extended to September 30th, next.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department considers that a new teacher, if procurable, should take charge immediately after the summer holidays, and, if Miss Babin will not remain till June 30th, you will be good enough to grant her discharge at once. Would it not be possible for you to secure the services of some young lady, who, although not necessarily the holder of certificates, would be competent to take charge of this school for the next three months?

Teachers claim she has all the children of school age, and that only 4 are...\nnot attending twice faster. To this I have also complained. I have tried my best to make the fact of having a teacher. Wednesdays and Fridays the boys are dismissed at 2:30 while the girls remain to clean house and sewing and knitting. I am obliged to the other that a boy I was unable with his teacher's help to deal with. And this feeling has been aggravated by the spring clothing he recently got from children who do not get any. I have not getting any feeling the teacher was very favorable they only seemed to play with things. Some of them may be the this is evidently difficult to make it unpleasant for girls. Eating and I he had any backing. He explained will be gone. It is strange a young teacher from Ontario. But I am convinced the difficulties may have to do in the minds of the children to accept this teaching's resignation. I would respectfully suggest that Miss Rebecca Isaac may be considered.

It would pay the Dept. to even increase the salary in order to induce a teacher of this kind to take up this great and charitable work.

As she was but a 3rd class teacher, I did not trouble the Dept. about an increase, and as time was so short, I had to do the next best thing. The new teacher\u2014Miss Elizabeth Driscoll, has taught very successfully for three years on local license, so I understand by phone from Father Wallace, and he gives her a good recommendation. She will open school on Monday, I feel hereafter that new teachers coming to Ind. schools should sign a contract and not leave us in such a condition again.\n\nI do trust dear Mr. Scott this will meet with your approval.\n\nTrusting you will not work too hard and that the Dept. did not allow too much work to pile up, that will take away the joy of your trip now, by hard labor I do wish you could get down to see this place. It is very nicely located on the Miramichi River. All kinds of fishing here. Should you come do bring Mrs. Scott, as my sister keeps house for me, I feel you would enjoy your visit here.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nI remain yours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It was owing to the great scarcity of teachers that I was forced to take Miss Driscoll. I have been trying very hard to get good teachers for all our schools but find it most difficult.

It is noted that Miss Driscoll has no professional qualifications and that her success has only been fair. The Department will leave the matter of the teacher for the next school year in your hands to act upon as you decide to be in the best interests of the work at this point.\n\nIf you make any change in the teacher at this school you should inform the Department of the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher you may secure to replace Miss Driscoll.

We note you recommend that the salary allowed her be at the rate of $500 for the ten teaching months, supplemented by the bonus at the rate of $15 per month, and the Department will allow her salary at the above rate. It is presumed that Miss Delaney, besides performing duties as teacher, will instruct the children in domestic work until such time as the teacher's residence is erected and an assistant teacher appointed.

Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your report of inspection of the Burnt Church Indian Day School.\n\nI may say with reference to the new teacher's residence that this building is to provide accommodation for the teacher only, and it is considered that it is of a size suitable for that purpose. The Agent has received the necessary authority to have the painting of the exterior of this and the school building carried out. We are requesting him to furnish an estimate of the cost of building an addition at the rear of the present building, being to provide a room in which to carry on domestic science work, such addition to have the same first floor level and a door leading from the classroom. We had no funds available last year to do all the work necessary in providing this accommodation, and it may be doubtful, owing to the many demands, if we can provide the funds necessary this year. However, after we have an estimate of the cost from the Agent, due consideration will be given to authorizing the work.\n\nThe Department will approve of the appointment of Miss Stella Blansfield as teacher for the next school year to replace Miss Delaney. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $65 per month for the ten teaching months. It is considered that the appointment of a second teacher to carry on domestic science work can be held over until such time as accommodation is provided for the purpose. It is hoped that funds can be provided and that accommodation and equipment will be ready by the first of the new year. Please inform Miss Blansfield of her appointment to begin duties on or about September 1st, next. I shall be pleased to hear definitely from you as to whether she accepts the position or not, in order that we can inform Mr. Agent Hudson accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. F. C. Ryan,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRed Bank, North. Co., N.B.\nI have just phoned Miss Stella Blansfield re her appointment to the Burnt Church Ind. day school, she refuses said school, as the salary is too small. She asks for $500.00. She states that she will teach Domestic Science three nights out of the week and visit Ind. houses and do the full work that we would be doing. She also would go to Woodstock, N.B., and take a course for a week from the Rev. sisters on Domestic Science, and teaching of Indians at her own expense. She is one of the best teachers in our white schools. She is very determined to make good. She got $500.00 in the school here and could have retained her school at $500.00 I would suggest that she try said school at $800.00 under the above conditions. Not hearing herself, she will have plenty of time in the evenings to devote to Domestic work, and the Teacher's house could do the necessary until the Dom. Science hall was built. I would suggest that it be built at once. I told the Agent that a place built on the present school about as long yet not so wide would do.\n\nI trust you will please let me know by return mail just what to do. I feel that Miss Blansfield did lose her chance of getting another school, just waiting for this chance.\n\nAs yet I had no word about the Teacher for Malgreux but will let the Dept. know as soon as I hear from Mrs. O'Shields girl.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nInspector of Indian Schools for N.B.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir:\n\nRelative to the communications from the teachers of the Burnt Church Indian Day School which you handed to the department during your recent visit, which they request that increases be granted them, I beg to inform you in view of your report on the work being done at this school, the Department is not disposed to grant any increase for the next school year. We note that the services of the assistant teacher and the work she performed in the teaching of domestic science, etc., has not been very satisfactory.\n\nIt is hoped this coming summer to build an addition to the present school building to provide accommodation for the proper teaching of domestic science. Would it not be possible to obtain the services of a married man having the necessary qualifications to perform the classroom work, and his wife could teach domestic science and attend to field matron work on the Reserve? This arrangement has met with success on the Big Cove Reserve, and it is thought that a married teacher and his wife would be better at Burnt Church; it would be more satisfactory than the continuing of the services of the Misses Bransfield. If the services of a competent married man and his wife could be obtained, the Department would be prepared to pay salary at the same rate as is paid at Big Cove. We will leave this matter in your hands and shall be pleased to hear later as to what arrangements you have been able to make for the carrying on of the work of teacher and field matron at Burnt Church.\n\nYou may inform the present teachers that it will not be possible to grant them any increase in salary, as it is considered that they receive ample remuneration for the services they render.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The Department is approving of the appointment of Miss Cahoon for the next school year, to begin duties on September 1st, next. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $55 per teaching month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nOttawa, November 15, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of the report of your inspection of the Burnt Church Indian Day School. Your recommendation that a change in the teacher be made at an early date has been noted. If Miss Bransfield resigns, the Department would be pleased to approve of the transfer of Miss Maria Cahoon from the Bel Ground School. This matter is being left in the hands of yourself and Mr. Agent Hudson. Please arrange for teaching services at this school which you consider to the best advantage. I shall be pleased to hear from you at a later date concerning any change in the teacher and the date on which same takes effect.\n\nThe Department is pleased to learn that the new addition for domestic science has been completed and that good work has been done on same. We are requesting Mr. Hudson to arrange for the supplying of a cupboard to store school materials. I may say that, since your visit, the inside of the school has been calcimined and the floor oiled. I am pleased to note that Miss Cahoon, the teacher of domestic science, is performing satisfactory services. I hope that the Indians will take advantage of the opportunity offered them and see that the children attend school regularly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Mclean,\nAsst.

Both are wonderful teachers. Miss Bransfield would do better, I think, in a smaller school.\n\nMiss Marion did wonderful work at Bel Ground Reserve, but resigned from the fact that she would be alone another year as her little sister who stays with her must attend the Convent. She would, therefore, go to Burnt Church to teach provided her sister would remain as the Domestic Science teacher.\nOttawa, July 4th, 1927.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of the communication which you forwarded from Miss Marion Cahoon, teacher of the Red Ground Indian Day School, together with the report of your inspection of this school. It is stated that Miss Cahoon intends to resign her present position, but that she will accept the school at Burnt Church. The Department agrees with your suggestion that Miss Cahoon be transferred as teacher of the Burnt Church School for the school year beginning on or about September 1st, next. If this arrangement can be carried out, the two Cahoon sisters will be together, and this may result in more satisfactory work, both in the classroom and in the teaching of domestic sciences. I have, therefore, to request that you will arrange, if possible, to carry out the above arrangement.\n\nThe question of obtaining another school for Miss Stella Bransfield will be left in your hands. If you consider that it would be satisfactory to replace Miss Cahoon at Red Ground, it is stated from the communication which you forwarded from her that she might not want to accept another school. If you succeed in transferring Miss Cahoon to Burnt Church, and cannot arrange any other appointment for Miss Bransfield, you should inform her that her services will not be further required.\n\nThe Department will leave the matter of the appointment of teachers for the next school year in your hands, and I shall be pleased to hear definitely at a later date what arrangements have been made by you for the teaching services in the schools in New Brunswick.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. F. O. Ryan,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRed Bank, North. Co., N.B.\nDear Reverend Father,\n\nI feel conscientiously that I cannot do justice to my highest class owing to the crowded number of pupils on this reserve. We have more boys roll 56 pupils. It is impossible for me to keep the work and duty to the house should to each class. Against our class room is not large enough to accommodate so many we will have more seating-room for us and the addition of new desks will have very little space for the pupils moving to and from classes. Thus far I have stated the pupils but placing three in a hall and they occupy right chairs from the Domestic Science room.\n\nI suggest Reverend Father,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6061, file 276-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nSubject to your approval, and the sanction of the Department, that the educational work and Domestic Science be divided between my sisters and myself in this way:\n\nHave two Domestic Science rooms fitted up as class-rooms with about eight new double desks, the remainder required to be taken from the class-room, and a blackboard; the Domestic Science teacher to have the entire responsibility of each only which consists of 21 pupils, teaching them from nine to eleven in the morning, and from one to three in the afternoon, and will have me with grades 2 to 7, numbering 35 pupils.\n\nThis arrangement will necessarily give the Domestic Science teacher too little for her work to overcome this, I suggest we divide this work also, but only teaching Domestic Science subjects beyond 11 days, thus enabling the Domestic Science teacher to carry on her special work, such as painting the houses, finding the sick, etc., and giving us an opportunity...\nTo prepare our own meals and do our housework up top. It was almost two weeks to the store and Post Office, and to where we get our milk.\n\nIn the past, there has been so much work that we cannot take all up our duty. We can now divide the class, giving half to each teacher every second day. By this plan, Reverend Fathers, such teaching work will be more easy, but it will allow more subjects in each class, and provide room for the pupils, without either teachers doing too much work.\n\nShould you consider any suggestion, practical or approved by the Department, we are very anxious to adopt the new work and shall expect to receive an increase in each teacher's salary, as we consider, we are taking the place of a third teacher. As to the amount we have that to the judgment of the Department.\n\nHoping to hear from you as soon as convenient,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMarion [signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6061, file 276-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa, October 1, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has received a communication from Rev. F. C. Ryan, Inspector of Indian Schools for the Province of New Brunswick, regarding the Burnt Church Indian Day School. He states that the attendance of Indian children is in excess of the accommodation provided in the classroom, and recommends that a number of new desks be supplied and placed in the domestic science room, and that the domestic science teacher take the first two grades, teaching from 9 to 11 A.M. and from 1 to 3 P.M. He also states that she could attend to the domestic science classes by working a little later each day.\n\nWe recently closed the school in Lunenburg, N.S., and have a supply of desks on hand, which we are requesting the local Indian Agent to have securely crated and forwarded to Burnt Church, via Loggieville, N.B. When these desks arrive, I have to request that you will arrange to have them assembled and set up in the domestic science classroom. The domestic science teacher, Miss Evelyn Cahoon, can arrange to teach the two lower grades, carrying on the work during the hours mentioned above. Any cost involved in setting up these desks will be paid upon receipt of an account, in duplicate, properly certified.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nChas.

The Department is assured from reports received from both Rev. Father Ryan, Inspector of Schools, and Mr. Agent Hudson that excellent work is being performed at the Burnt Church School, and hopes that both you and your sister will remain as teachers for the balance of the present school year, ending June 30th, next.\n\nI would suggest that the child who does most of the work on a garment be given same when completed. However, you are in a better position to know which child is in the most need of clothing, and I am sure you will see that no favouritism is shown in the allotment of the finished garments. The Department has every reliance in the tact of your sister and yourself in dealing with the Indian parents and in the disposal of any garments made by the domestic science class.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Marion E. Cahoon,\nBurnt Church,\nN. B.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF REV. FATHER RYAN,\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN SCHOOLS FOR NEW\nBRUNSWICK, DATED SEPTEMBER 24, 1929, ON\nHIS INSPECTION OF THE BURNT CHURCH INDIAN\nDAY SCHOOL.\n\n---\n\nIt was agreed last year, when Miss Evelyn Cahoon\nwas recalled from her duties as field matron, that by an\nincrease of salary they could also carry on Domestic\nScience. They did all that could be expected. The\nresult is that this branch of our work has about completely\nfallen down, and the Reserve looks it. We must do some-\nthing to better conditions. It is simply imperative from\nevery standpoint of view.\n\nI would, therefore, suggest that the Department\nsend Miss Evelyn Cahoon back at her field work and have\nanother sister come in and teach the Primary Department.\nThe Department could take $75 or $100 from both sisters'\nsalaries and add $300 to this, or $500. This would be\nquite enough salary for a Primary teacher. Even $450 would\nbe a fair salary. Both sisters should be willing to lose\na part of their salary when this extra work is removed from\nthem. We cannot, with 52 children of school age and the\npresent state of the Indians on this our largest Reserve,\nlet things stand as they are. We must meet the difficulty\nand surmount same before it becomes unsurmountable. This,\nto my mind, is the only solution to the question. It will\nbe the duty of the Field Matron to be the truant officer\nand report on all Indians & children of school age absent from\nthe Reserve, their whereabouts, etc. This \"line-up\", with\nall her duties of domestic science, caring for the sick,\nteaching economy, etc., that she so successfully carried on\nbefore, will be an incalculable one, uniting the present\ndivergencies with a common unit that can alone spell success to\nthis Reserve. To here falter would be a huge mistake.\nNovember 13, 1929.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nRev. Father Ryan, Inspector of Indian Schools for New Brunswick, writes (File 55-2-5) that the services of a field matron are required on the Burnt Church Indian Reserve. In the past, the Department employed two lady workers, both paid from School Vote. One was responsible for the academic work in the classroom - the other for noonday lunch, instruction in sewing, etc., and for field work. Last year, the classroom work, the teaching of domestic science and the preparation of the noonday lunch became so heavy - the average attendance being approximately 40 - it was necessary to let the field work go and to divide the duties at the school proper. At present Miss Marion Cahoon, senior teacher, has five grades and Miss Evelyn Cahoon, her sister, has three lower grades and the domestic science. Their salaries are $300 and $650, respectively. Father Ryan now writes regarding the result of no field matron activity. His letter reads in part as follows: \"The reserve looks it. We must do something to better conditions. It is simply imperative from every standpoint. . . . . To falter now would be a huge mistake.\"\n\nDo you think that you should arrange for the creation of a position and for the voting of $450 or $500 salary for a field matron? Father Ryan nominates a Miss Cahoon, a sister of the two teachers, for the post and suggests the salary mentioned.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF REV. F. G. RYAN, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE BURNT CHURCH INDIAN DAY SCHOOL, DATED JUNE 6, 1930.\n\nIn consideration of the extra hard work that Miss Evelyn Cahoon is given by teaching the Primary Department and Domestic Science, I feel the Department should give her an increase in salary of $50. This would make her salary $700 for the ten teaching months. She more than earns her money. In the next four or five years this Reserve should be well civilized and able to earn much of what is now being supplied by the Government.\nOttawa, July 18, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that, in view of the report on the work being performed by Miss Evelyn Cahoon, teacher of the Primary Department and Domestic Science at the Burnt Church Indian Day School, it has been decided to grant her an increase of $5 per teaching month in her salary from the first of September, next. This will make the total salary paid her from that date at the rate of $70 per teaching month. Rev. Father Ryan and Miss Cahoon are being informed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

The specialist was here a short time ago and informed us that, while there is some improvement, the lungs have not yet healed, and we do not know how much longer Marion will be bedfast. At any rate she is not to get up until the doctor returns to Edmundston which will be in May or June.\n\nWe know this tuberculosis was caused by conditions in the Indian school. My daughter was not predisposed to this disease as we have never had tuberculosis in my husbands or my own family or in our immediate family. The epidemic of whooping cough among the Indian pupils last winter, which Marion contracted from them, weakened her lungs, and apart from this there were tubercular children in the school.\n\nWe feel knowing this, and also the years of service Marion gave there, the Dept. would be willing to grant her an allowance, for the necessary care and expense her long illness entails, considering the fact that through her environment, and not by any fault of her own she is ill. The only regret is that she did not leave the school last winter while suffering from whooping cough, but as you know the doctor did not approve of closing the school, we therefore consider school conditions as directly responsible.\n\nHoping to hear from you as soon as convenient.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6661, file 276-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPoor copy\nRichibucto N.B.\nFeb. 12th,\n1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith attached, for your consideration, a letter I received from Mrs. E.S.

F. MACKENZIE,\nSecretary.\nDear Reverend Father,\n\nI have a pupil, Raymond Ward age 13, who is causing me considerable trouble.\n\nI promoted him from Grade IV in June conditionally; he is very stupid; it seems he cannot learn anything. He is also subject to fits and was out of school last year for a couple of weeks by order of Doctor Freeman.\n\nLately he is becoming very very bad. I find it hard to punish him since he refuses to take the strap on his hands. Of course I do punish him but I am afraid I may overstep in strapping him elsewhere.\n\nI feel that having him in class may in time interfere with the conduct of\nmy other pupils as I try to overlook some of his actions rather than punish him so much.\n\nI am asking you to consider the matter further and to kindly try to have him removed from school if possible at your earliest convenience.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\nMary Hogan\n(Principal).\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated Oct., 2nd, File 55-2-1 with enclosure from Miss Mary Hogan, of Burnt Church, which refers to Raymond Ward, who is a pupil of the Burnt Church school. I am obliged to inform you that I agree with Inspector Rev. F.C. Ryan, when he advises that this pupil should be removed from the school. I have examined this pupil and would say that he is not of average intelligence and does not appear to make any progress in school, and besides is very unruly which does show a bad example to the other children.\n\nI am returning you the letter of Miss Mary Hogan, and would recommend that this boy be removed from the school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 18, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to Raymond Ward, a pupil of the Burnt Church Indian Day School.\n\nIn view of the information given in your letter, the Department considers that it would be advisable to have this boy removed from the Burnt Church School. At the same time, he does not appear a suitable pupil for the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School, as he is apparently sub-normal.\n\nIs there any provincial institution in the Province of New Brunswick where he could be placed? If so, you should let me know the name and location of the institution, and also ascertain the yearly cost of his maintenance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of Oct.15th.File 55-2-1 referring to Raymond Ward, a pupil of the Burnt Church Indian Day school. In reply I beg to state with further reference to this boy, that there is no institution in New Brunswick where he can be placed to any advantage, and I think the best thing for him to do is to stay home and help his father do some work. He has not been at school since I received your letter of October 18.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 16, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant, I beg to say that the Department agrees with you that Raymond Ward should not attend the Burnt Church School in future. It is noted that he can assist his father at home.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nwhose homes she was obliged to visit according to the School regulations. At least seven of her former pupils died as a result of Tuberculosis and one is now a patient at Notre Dame des Lourdes Sanatorium.\n\nMiss Cahoon was not predisposed to Tuberculosis, as no case of the disease has ever existed in her father's or mother's family. She has now been confined to bed four years and six months with consequent enormous expense to her parents, doctor's visits, X rays, hospital care, medicine etc. The T.B. specialists are positively convinced that Miss Cahoon contracted the disease from the Indians.\n\nIt seems to me that in view of the circumstance outlined the Department should do something for Miss Cahoon by way of compensation grant or allowance. While undoubtedly it is impossible to absolutely establish the fact that Miss Cahoon contracted this disease from the Indians, there can really be little or no doubt in the ordinary mind that such is the case.\n\nIs there no possible way for the Department to do something in this very deserving case.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nJFB:NL\n\nIndian Affairs.

She was not permitted to close the school but was obliged to teach in a class room, the basement of which was filled with water, from April until June so that the furnace could not be used.\n\nFurthermore Tuberculosis existed to a high degree not only among Miss Sahoon's former pupils but also among the adults\nJanuary 15th, 1926.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter of January 9th has just been received in which you make representations on behalf of Miss Marion Cahoon for compensation on the ground that she contracted tuberculosis while teaching in the Indian school on the Burnt Church Reserve.\n\nI may say that as you are aware this matter has been brought to the attention of the Department on a previous occasion and also to that of the Right Honourable R. B. Bennett. While we regret exceedingly the circumstances, I must advise you that there is no precedent for such compensation as Miss Cahoon desires and there are no funds from which payment could be made. Payment of any grant to Miss Cahoon could only be made by special Act of Parliament. I regret that in no other way could compensation be made to her.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJ. P.

However, all teachers should at once receive notice so they could find other schools.\n\nNo. 1 - Since Miss Mary Hogan has resigned her place as principal of the Burnt Church Ind. day school, which is another sister Carmel still in the Primary Department, and as it is impossible to place any other teacher there except in SISTERS IN BLOOD\u2014as my reports of FIVE YEARS AGO clearly prove\u2014when then we had such serious trouble\u2014I would now recommend her other sister Veronica Ann Megan who is now principal of the large White school at Sunny-corner with some 90 children attending same. She is a bright teacher. Her application is here inclosed.\n\nNo. 2 - I would recommend Miss Ruth Murphy as teacher for St. Mary's Ind. day school to replace Mrs Regina McElegott, who is only a 2nd class teacher and far from satisfactory. \u2014SEE my report on this school\u2014\n\nMiss Ruth Murphy is a first class superior teacher with a real missionary spirit, knows Indians well and should make good. Her application is here inclosed.\n\nNo. 3 - I would recommend Miss Blanch Leclair Arsenault, as teacher for the Eel River Ind. day school (a first class superior teacher) to replace Miss Alice Tremblay who is only a 2nd class teacher and sickly. \u2014See my report on this school.\n\nNo. 4 - I would recommend Miss Delphine Gertrude Murphy of Newcastle (no relation to Miss Ruth Murphy) a first class superior teacher, to replace Miss Irene Fitzgerald at the Belgrand Ind. day school. \u2014SEE my report on this school. A change is required.\n\nNo. 5 - I would recommend Miss Mary Eileen Scott, a first class superior teacher to replace Miss Delaney only a 2nd class teacher at Oromocto Ind. day school, SEE my report on this school.\n\nNo. 6 - I would recommend Miss Monica Donoghue, a first class superior teacher to replace Miss Stella O'Brien (only a second class teacher) at Kingsclear Ind. day school, See my report on this school.\n\nProper applications for schools No.s 5 & 6 will soon follow.\u2014Their written applications are herein inclosed with all the others.\n\n\u2014 NOTE \u2014\n\nBy such a change no teacher could be offended\u2014since we are but following our white schools, hiring FIRST CLASS TEACHERS. We get them for the same \"SALARY\". The only 1st class teacher to go would be Miss Irene Fitzgerald, yet as you will see by my report on this the \"BELGRAND\" school \u2014 A change would be better. All new teachers have good records and possess as I am informed real Missionary life.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

All letters seemingly know about the resignation of teachers, which are not a fact. Teachers write them making up this one same story: \"I HEAR THAT SUCH OR SUCH A TEACHER IS RESIGNING\" - then asking their influence to get the said Ind. school. All are after the \"SALARY,\" but few are competent teachers for Ind. schools.\n\nIn order to get rid of a lot of such teachers I have asked the Dept. to hire only FIRST CLASS SUPERIOR TEACHERS, as they can be obtained for the same salaries, then we have a better chance to choose the most qualified from this few and not be over crowded by useless applications.\n\nSome six or seven years ago, I had no trouble. However, if the Dept. would only refer all applicants to me, I assure you there would be little trouble. I feel Mr. Sutherland well knows this as he has been so often here. I want the very best teachers, whether they be the Rev. sisters or otherwise, I have no favorites whether recommended by priest or Bishop, or politician, I have always found that such teachers that come backed up with influences prove, after a short while, little good and most hard to get rid of.\n\nI have not heard anything about the Miss Hogans resigning. I would be most sorry to lose them, they have done wonderful work.\n\nI am inclosing letters that seem to know, as is always the case, more than the teachers (the Miss Hogans) themselves, about their resignation.\n\nI trust you are well,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoey,\nSup't. of Welfare and Training,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSince the Indian Day Schools are not to reopen until October we would like to have it arranged for us to substitute September for the month of January as the weather conditions during Jan and lack of proper clothing results in irregular attendance.\n\nI trust the matter will meet with your approval and an immediate reply may be received.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nVeronica E. Hogan,\nPrincipal of First Church Indian Day School\nOttawa, August 27, 1941.\n\nDear Miss Hogan:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of August 25, in which you seek departmental permission to teach during the month of September, 1941, rather than the month of January, 1942.\n\nI may state that immediately following the decision of the Department to operate Indian day schools for a 9 month rather than a 10 month period, sympathetic consideration was given to requests from a number of teachers who selected certain months during which they wanted their schools closed. Our experience has taught us, however, that such exceptions create almost insurmountable difficulties in the Department. You can readily appreciate how difficult it is to make provision for the payment of salaries in the Treasury Division, the shipment of supplies and administration generally, when exceptions are made. In view of these difficulties it was definitely decided this year that no exceptions would be made.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMiss Veronica A.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Chas. Hudson,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nTo The Department of Mines & Resources\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI would like to know the reason and why does our teacher here at Burnt Church N.B. has rights to take the children's relief of if they happen to be sick and is not able to go to school for a day or two they take twenty-five cents a day off the children's relief. No matter if they are sick is that right way to do to the poor Indian children many little children go to school without any thing to eat and they get so weak that they have to go home and suffer with hunger. These teachers has been here too long now over seven years they abuse the Indian children to much these teachers has been loosing time every week all winter they loose two and three days out of every week they don't care they get their pay from the government.\n\nPlease let them teachers know in case of sickness or wanting of food not to take their relief off or lack of clothing.\n\nIndians are poor.\n\nTruly,\n\nMrs. Noel P. Paul\nBurnt Church - N.B.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant File 55-2-1 with a letter from Mrs. Noel P. Paul, Burnt Church, N.B., referring to school affairs at the reserve. In reply I beg to inform you in the first place, that the letter is not written by Mrs. Noel P. Paul, and then if it were, this woman has no children attending school. I am of the opinion that the letter was written by one of the pupils of the school, and it may be a grandchild of Mrs. Noel P. Paul.\n\nWith regard to this letter I have to say that it is just ridiculous, and there is no true statement in it. With regard to relief, it is only deducted when a pupil stays away from school for no good reason, and never when a child is sick. The teachers are just a little too lenient in some cases rather than too severe; and with regard to lost time, they never lose any time from school, without it might be a day now and then by sickness. I might state that the teachers of this school are very capable and are very careful about attending to their duties.\n\nI am returning Mrs. Paul's letter and wish to state that it nothing but a lot of falsehoods.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nBurnt Church, MB\nMay 27th 1943\n\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI hereby inform you I am resigning my position as Principal of the Burnt Church Indian Day School on June 30th 1943.

In each case these salaries are supplemented by a bonus and the school will be in operation from September 1, 1943, to June 30, 1944. The teachers' living quarters are attached to the school.

July 9, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI desire to refer to Mr. Pratt's memoranda of June 16 and June 24, suggesting the appointment of Miss Francis B. Hartery and Miss Lillian Robichaud as teachers of the Burnt Church Indian Day School.\n\nThe qualifications of both teachers appear satisfactory and they have both accepted a pointment. They will begin duties on September first.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\nOttawa,\nSeptember 16, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Burnt Church Indian Day School, No. 276.\n\nIn my memorandum of June 28, I advised you of the resignation of the previous teachers effective July 1, 1943. We have now appointed the following:\n\nPrincipal - Miss Frances B. Hartney, salary $60.00 a teaching month, plus bonus;\n\nAssistant - Miss Lilian Robichaud, salary $75.00 a teaching month, plus bonus.\n\nBoth the above appointments are effective September 1, 1943. I enclose copies of letters of appointment and other documents are being forwarded to you.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nLast evening I received a telephone call from Rev. Father John Ryan, parish priest of Nelson N.B., enquiring if it would be possible for Miss Frances B. Hartery, teacher of the Burnt Church Indian Day School, to be excused from her duties for the last five days of the present term.\n\nRev. Father Ryan is having a number of the leaders in his Parish proceed to Montreal to take a summer course on religious education and he would like to have Miss Hartery take the course which opens on June 23rd.\n\nI might say that this course might be very valuable to Miss Hartery in her duties at Burnt Church and if her absence should be approved by the Department, Miss Robichaud would be able to handle the whole school for the last week of the term.\n\nWill you please let me know at once whether this meets with your approval or not.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJune 22, 1944.\n\nMr. A. Lee Fraser, Indian Agent, Rexton, N.B.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 20th instant, the Department approves Miss Hartery being excused from duties as teacher for the last five days of the present term. It is noted that during her absence Miss Robichaud will be able to handle the whole school for the last week.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI wish to inform you that Miss Frances B. Hartery, Principal of the Burnt Church Indian Day School, has resigned her position.\n\nFor your information I would say that Miss Hartery has received an appointment to Harkins Academy at Newcastle, N.B., which is right at her home.\n\nI had hoped that Miss Lillian Robichaud would have resigned, as her work has not been entirely satisfactory, but owing to the scarcity of teachers, I have been reluctant to ask for her resignation.\n\nI might respectfully point out that the combination of a French and English teacher is very seldom satisfactory, and that where possible, a man and his wife should be in charge of any Indian schools, where two teachers are employed.\n\nI would, therefore, ask your permission to make the best arrangement possible, in regard to this school for next term.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 26th, 1945.\n\nMr. A. Lee Fraser, Indian Agent, Rexton, N.B.\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, with reference to the resignation of Miss Frances B. Hartney as Principal of the Burnt Church Indian Day School. Her resignation is accepted.\n\nYou may make the best possible arrangements in order to secure a teacher for this school for the coming academic year.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, July 26th, 1945.\n\nMemorandum\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Burnt Church Indian Day School No. 276\n\nPlease note that Miss Frances B. Hartney has resigned as teacher of the Burnt Church Indian Day School, effective July 1st, 1945. No further payment of salary should be made to her.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nOttawa, 9th August, 1945.\n\nMr. A. Lee Fraser, Indian Agent, Rexton, N.B.\n\nWith reference to your letter of 23rd ultimo and my reply of 26th ultimo in connection with the vacancy at Burnt Church Indian Day School, I am advised that we can acquire the services of Miss Mary Kenna, Little Bartibogue, N.B.\n\nI would like you to get in touch with her as soon as possible and ascertain her qualifications and experience and advise me whether you consider she will be suitable as Principal of the school.\n\nIt is possible you prefer to promote Miss Robichaud from Junior Teacher to Senior Teacher. If so, you should make a recommendation to this effect.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nAugust 9, 1945\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER:\n\nRe: Teaching staff, Indian School,\nBurnt Church, N.B.\n\nMr. J.W.

He gives as his reasons for wishing this change the severity of the winter and its effect on the pupils and teachers. He thinks the attendance record would be improved and a higher standard of Education obtained, if this change were made.\n\nThe teachers concerned are supporting the chief in this matter and have suggested that the change be made effective this year.\n\nThis Agency recommends that this change be made to take effect this year.\n\nE.J.

He is quite definite in wanting a male teacher at Poorman and we have been able to secure the services of such a teacher. You may hear from Mr. Indian Superintendent Nixon concerning the Poorman School but I agree with Mr. Ostrander that it would not be fair to you to start your teaching service with our Department in such an isolated school. We prefer to have our teachers begin their work in schools where at least they will have some social life.\n\n... With\n\nIndian Affairs.

On the whole the classrooms are quite satisfactory. The building has been newly painted inside and out.\n\nBoth these teachers are capable and interested in their work. Miss Allain is the senior teacher and knows her job well. The children should improve under her teaching. Miss Robichaud has the junior grades and her experience has made her a capable primary teacher. She may be willing to transfer to a school in Western Canada.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n1. The provision of a water cooler, cups and coat-hooks.\n2. The provision of a sewing machine for the senior room.\n3. The provision of blackboards in the junior room.\n4. The installation of hydro now on the reserve.\n\nTeacherage -\n\nThis is in a separate building and has recently been lined with gyproc and painted.

B.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acquaint you that the school house is in a very inconveniently located, and that it should be on the side where the Reserve is more thickly settled, and for the following reasons:\n\nFirst, thirty-five pupils attending school at present time, and out of this number twenty-four residing on the opposite side the river when the school is now situated and only eleven\npupils reside on the side where the school is situated.\n\nSecondly, the road on its own in the place in fact and spring, generally overflows and it is always with difficulty for teachers and pupils to come across when this occurs. Thirdly, in winter time, very many of the pupils will not be able to come to school on account that the school being so far from their homes.\n\nIt would not cost much to take the building over to near the church and much comfort would be rendered. The building could be taken down to the shore, which is only little over hundred yards and\nthen be put on to a\ntwo scows and then\ntowed across without\ndifficulty.\nI beg you most\nhumly to pay attention to\nthis matter! Please\nanswer.\n\nI am,\nYours faithfully,\nChas. Bernard,\nTeacher.\nNew Brunswick,\nNorth Eastern Division,\nRichibucto, 29 Oct. 1903.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose a letter received from the teacher of the Burnt Church Indian School, asking that the school building be removed from its present site to the opposite side of the river where the great body of the Indians live. There is no doubt but that the building is in the wrong place and I intended bringing the matter to the attention of the Dept before, but did not do so as I was informed the new building now in course of erection on this reserve was to be used in part for a school house. Since the Indians have resolved to put it to other uses, I think the old school house should be moved to where the Indians, or at least the great body of them, now live. I did think the best and easiest way to move it would be on the ice after it formed, but perhaps Mr. Bernard's idea of moving it on scows would be the better way. The cost I think would not exceed $50 and it might be less.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Supt.\nOTTAWA, 5th November, 1903\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo enclosing a letter from the teacher asking that the Burnt Church school building be removed from its present site to the opposite side of the river; and in reply I beg to inform you that the Department considers that it will not be necessary to remove the building, as the new one which is being erected is designed for a combined school and council house and will, when completed, answer both purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\n\nW.D.

Mr. Emerson by the Indians, asking that the building lately erected on the Burnt Church Reserve for a combined council house and school house be used for their missionary. The Department, however, came to the conclusion that it would be inadvisable to divert the building from the purpose for which it was originally intended. I presume that in coming to this conclusion the Department thought it would be establishing an awkward precedent to comply with the request of the Indians. Could not some other building be utilised?\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. James Robichaud, P.P.,\nBurnt Church, N.B.\n\nSecretary.\nOTTAWA, September 26th\u20141904.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that Mr. Charles Bernard, teacher of the Indian school at Church Point, has applied to the Department for permission to teach school in the new council house and to take up his abode in the kitchen which is attached to this building.

James Robichaud, P.P.P.,\nAmagashus Pont,\nCape Breton, N.S.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of official letter of 28th Sept. last, and the reason I did not reply sooner was that I wished to visit the reserve personally as I was convinced the Indians would not consent to the proposal or at least the latter part of it. The new building is not yet completed inside, and on looking over the ground I think the better proposal would be if possible to move the school building across the creek from where it is now to a place nearer the Indian village. This could be done on the spot at a cost of not more than $100. When the school building was built the Indians were settled chiefly east of the creek in small log or frame buildings. Now they have settled chiefly on Point and as they have constructed more substantial houses it is probable that the settlement is permanently located. The school house where it now is is about 2 miles from the western end of the reserve and in an inconvenient location for at least nine tenths of the Indian children to attend, as the creek is flooded in spring and fall, and about three hundred yards of the road overflowed.\n\nIndian Affairs.

McDonald, and in reply I beg to say, that I have been to Chatham and interviewed Mr. McDonald for the purpose of having the contract and bond executed as instructed. Mr. McDonald was not prepared to execute the contract and wanted some little time to look over the plan and specifications and also the contract. He informed me that since he had ascertained that Mr. Howat's tender had been accepted, that he had taken a couple of other contracts, and would not be in a position to commence the Burnt Church School, before a month, and could not complete it before the first of October. He would also like the Department to consent to his using concrete for the basement instead of stone. I left the contract and bonds in blank with him to be executed before a Notary Public of Chatham, which he promised he would send me. I also left a copy of the plan and specifications with him. I informed him that I would like\nto have the school completed by the first of September, for\nthe beginning of next term, but this he said he could not do.\nI suppose there is no serious objections to school being\ntaught in the old school house for a month or two during the\nautumn weather.

The Department will allow Mr. McDonald till the 1st of October for the completion of his contract and you may insert that date in the agreement.

I am also informed that the specification calls for a stone foundation from the surface of the ground to the sill. It has been represented to me that it is difficult to secure stone in that locality, and I have been asked to consider substituting for the stone, good hard red brick, or if you prefer cement blocks these could be used on top of the cement sub-structure, instead of the stone. As I understand it, the foundation to the top of the ground is to be of concrete, and from there to the sill, of stone, but if agreeable to your authorities I would suggest that you substitute brick or cement blocks instead of the stone, provided same is satisfactory to the Indian Supt. here, and to the officials in charge. The cement blocks, if used, could be 16 x 8 ins. I understand the lintels of the windows also were to be of stone, and it is suggested that you change this to\ncement provided your subordinates ensuing it will go equally well.\n\nYours truly\n\nW.B.L.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have just returned from Chatham and while there, I saw Mr. McDonald but was unable to get the necessary papers executed, as Mr. McDonald demurred in signing them until further communication with the Department. He informed me, that he had made a slight mistake in figuring on this contract and thought that the Department might allow him from Three to Four hundred dollars extra on and above the amount of his tender, providing the estimate cost of this building made by the department would permit of the same. Mr. McDonald is a poor man and does not feel like losing money on this work. I interviewed Mr. W.S. Loggie while in Chatham, and he informed me that he had been advised that Mr. McDonald had tendered too low on this building and that he would like to see him receive fair remuneration for his labour. Mr. McDonald also informed me that in consequence of the recent fire conflagration at Campbellton, that he was unable to get\nwhat men he required to do the work in order to complete this school building by the first of October, and would require until the first of November in order to complete the same.\n\nYou might kindly advise me as to whether or not Mr. McDonald can be allowed anything extra over and above the amount of his tender.\n\nI regret that there has been so much delay and hesitation in connection with this matter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 26, 1910.\n\nR.

Please answer me by return mail.\n\nPeter B.

If wood is plentiful and is the cheaper fuel a wood furnace should be supplied. On the other hand if coal is cheaper and more convenient the furnace should be one to use this fuel. The Department is not in a position to decide and the matter will be left to your discretion.\n\nWith regard to the extra price asked for a coal furnace, if you decide to install one of this kind you should make inquiries and allow the contractor the difference, if any.\n\nWith reference to the ceiling I may say that in the Woodstock and Oromocto schools the Department has had metal ceilings of an approved pattern put in for the same price as the V jointed pine. As Mr. McDonald asks $45.00 more for the metal ceiling you may instruct him to use the pine.\n\nKindly advise the Department as to the decision arrived at in regard to the furnace.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.

To carry out his contract, we did not allow him any money on account until he was through with his contract when becoming uneasy about an amount we asked him to give us an order on R. A. Irving, the Indian Commissioner. For this amount, which he has refused to do, saying he had lost $4000.00 on his contract and wanted us to take a note for part of the amount, this we refused to do as we believe it is only a put off to him until he gets his cheque, and as he is worth nothing, we believe in his own name he will let us look after it. We wrote Mr. Irving to hold back his cheque until Mr. McDonald arranged for bills on the school house, and we now have a letter from him saying that he would agree with the Department as to the state of Mr. McDonald's indebtedness on the school, and ask you to send this cheque to him in such a way so that he could pay all the bills on the school paid, thus we would ask you to do as we fear that we will be left if Mr. McDonald gets his hands on the cheque.\n\nThinking that Mr. McDonald might write and ask Mr. Leggin M.P. & C. at the Department and bring his cheque home with him when he came home for recesses, we have written Mr. Leggin asking him not to do so but to keep the cheque here.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The schoolhouse is now Church Indian Reserve. Your Secretary will see that immediately behind, and now I take the privilege, dear Sir, to ask you to look into the matter, and let your department consider it to settle the debt. Probably you are aware that before accepting contract, the Department asked me what I would take, and complete schoolhouse, as I was afraid my original tender was too low, and was on the eve of throwing up contract. I sent an answer by telegraph saying five hundred.\ndollars, $400/- but before setting a reply I considered the matter & send a telegram accepting at my initial figures, with the hopes after completion thereof for the four hundred I asked.\n\nNow dear Sir, the statement I sent to Ottawa is correct. I sent it personally to Mr. Smith he then had representation. I have asked him to do his best & he will be willing to find out any information & I believe the thanks I should be helped. I am in a first-class job which Mr. Brown, Indian Dept., has not yet been able to fill me also tell me my position in life, & what position I will be placed in if I have to assume the burden of fills. I only wrote into the matter & let me know what the department proposes to do regarding the paying of fills. I mean in first-rate way they mean to depress, if the money in hand.\n\nTrusting you will use your influence\n\nRemain Yours Truly\nDonald R. McDonald\nP.S. The department will pay the four hundred $ asked. I will pay the remainder which I owe.\n\nD. M. D.\nOttawa, August 5, 1910.\n\nMem. re contract for Burnt Church school-house.\n\nOn June 15th, last, the tender of Mr. Donald R. McDonald to erect this building for $2375.00 was accepted. Shortly after that Mr. R. A. Irving, Indian Superintendent, of Buctouche, visited Chatham with a view to having the necessary contract and bonds executed, but Mr. McDonald declined to enter into a contract, stating that he made a slight mistake in figuring on the work and asking that he be allowed three to four hundred dollars extra. He was then asked to state the lowest sum for which he would erect the building and the reply received was that he would take four hundred dollars more than the amount of his original tender, which made the amount $2775.00. This placed Mr. McDonald higher than the next lowest tenderer and Mr. Loggie was informed that it was impossible for the Department to give him the contract at a price higher than the next lowest tenderer and that, in any event, it would be necessary to obtain the sanction of His Excellency the Governor General.\nin Council. Mr. Loggie then wired on the 28th ultimo that Mr. McDonald would accept the contract at his original price and on the 29th ultimo Mr. Loggie, Mr. Irving and Mr. McDonald were advised that as soon as the contract was signed and the bonds executed the necessary authority to commence the work would be given. These have not yet reached the Department, but immediate action will be taken as soon as they come to hand.\n\nU. P.

I do not see in what way any increase over that amount can be allowed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. S. Loggie, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 26th January, 1911\n\nSir:-\n\nI beg to transmit herewith cheque No. 2317 for $20.00 in favour of Mr. Donald R. McDonald in full settlement of the amount due him by the Department in connection with his contract for work on the Buctoutch school house.\n\nThe Department understands that certain persons who furnished supplies etc. for Mr. McDonald have not received payment in full from him. It is therefore desired that you will use your influence to get him to make settlement from the proceeds of the enclosed cheque.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst.

Wilfrid Logue, Legace Settlement for $7,200.00\nWilliam Scott, Chatham, $4,700.00\nDonald R. McDonald, Buxton, $2,375.00\nJames Mowat, Chatham, $2,100.00\n\nAn Order in Council was passed accepting the tender of Mr. James Mowat, the lowest tenderer, but on being informed of this he stated that upon further consideration of the plans and specifications he could not do the work for less than $2500.00. Another Order in Council was then passed accepting the next lowest tenderer Mr. McDonald, but before he would execute the contract he looked more fully into the question of the plans and\nspecifications and he stated that it would cost $400.00 more than the amount of his tender to complete the work. This would bring him up to $275.00 more than the price for which Mr. Mowat said it could be built, namely, $2500.00 so the Department wired Mr. Mowat to have him verify the statement that he would build it for $2500.00 and before a reply in the affirmative was received from him Mr. McDonald advised the Department that he would take the contract at the amount of his original tender, $2,375.00. This was accepted and under this contract he has completed the building. I do not see how we can pay anything more than the contract called for as the claim of Mr. McDonald is not made for extras, but for work done under the original plans and specifications, and Mr. Mowat was willing to erect it for $275.00 less than the amount he now asks for.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is regretted that this was inadvertently overlooked. The Department will be unable to furnish all the supplies, such as the quantity of milk, butter, etc., which the nurse recommended be furnished. Our funds are limited at the present time, and the cost involved would be excessive.\n\nHowever, the Department will approve of you incurring an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $50 in the purchase of the food supplies to be used in serving a lunch at midday. It is thought that you could arrange to purchase the quantity of oatmeal cookies, or a suitable biscuit, at wholesale prices. You may arrange also for the purchase of a quantity of cocoa, sugar and dry milk powder and a number of white enamel drinking cups for this purpose.\n\nIt is understood that the teachers, with the help of the older girls, will prepare and serve this hot drink, together with a biscuit, to each of the pupils at noon on each teaching day. This lunch is only to be served during the winter months or until the end of April, next. Please give this matter your prompt attention, have the above supplies purchased and delivered as soon as possible. It is presumed that the teachers will make the necessary arrangements to serve the lunch.

(RG 10, Volume 6061, file 276-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, July 16, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nRev. Father Ryan, in a report on his recent inspection of the Burnt Church Indian Day School, strongly recommends that the interior of the senior classroom be painted and the woodwork in the room used by the Primary Department well washed, and the floors scrubbed in both rooms and, when dry, given a coat of hot oil. I have to request that you will furnish an estimate of the cost of having the woodwork and walls of the senior room painted, as recommended by the Inspector. Any other cleaning as recommended by him may be carried out. When we have information as to the cost of the painting, consideration will then be given as to whether funds can be provided for the work or not.\n\nThe Inspector states that, owing to the condition of the drain, the cellar was filled with water and that the furnace could not be used. I have to request that you will furnish a report regarding what steps you would advise be taken to have the drain placed in good condition, and, if possible, give an estimate of the cost.\n\nYou should arrange to have the out houses at this school cleaned, whitewashed and any repairs required carried out, and these buildings placed in a good sanitary condition.\n\nThe Inspector also recommends that a sand table be supplied. You may arrange to have a suitable table built locally, keeping the expense for the purpose as low as possible.\n\nAfter the above work which you have been authorized to have carried out is completed, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nThe Inspector has drawn attention to the seating arrangements in the Primary Department. He states that at present large single desks are placed side by side, which take up the entire floor space. He recommends that 12 double desks be supplied. I shall be pleased to be advised as to whether you would recommend that the number of double desks as asked for by the Inspector be supplied or not. The funds are very limited and unless a change in the desks is urgent we would not be prepared to authorize the expenditure this year.\n\nThe Department will expect to hear from you regarding the above matters at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letters of the 16th, instant referring to slight repairs, cleaning, painting etc., on the four Indian schools in this agency, and in reply will say that these matters will be attended to immediately.\n\nThe first thing I would like to take up is the drain from the basement of the Burnt Church school. This drain is about 800 feet long, from the school to where it empties into the river. About 400 feet from the school, the pipe which is 4 inches in diameter, connects with the drain from the basement of the Church, which is also 4 inches in diameter. This size of pipe is not large enough to carry off the volume of water from the both basements.\n\nThe only thing that can be done is to dig a trench from where the drain from the school connects with the one from the Church, to the river, and continue the pipe from the school without connecting with the pipe from the Church. This will mean that there will be a separate drain from the school to the outlet at the river without intersecting the drain from the basement of the Church.\n\nThis work will cost about $500.00 for labour and material. It is true that for a period last spring, of about six weeks the furnace could not be used on account of the basement being nearly full of water.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In reply I have to say that the Department was not aware that it would require the work and expenditure mentioned by you in having this drain put in a satisfactory condition. Our funds for the present fiscal year are extremely limited and it will not be possible to authorize the amount mentioned by you as being required for the material and labour in installing a new drain.\n\nCould not a drain, connecting the school and residence - if necessary to drain the residence - be constructed in a direct line from the school to the bay? This would be a much shorter distance than the present drain which connects with the drain from the church. You might consider the question of a separate drain for the school, and, if same is feasible and the work could be carried out at a lower expenditure than the relaying of the present drain would involve, you should give an estimate of the cost, as it will be necessary to provide the amount in our Estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This was done last winter, and was satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Agent\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 20, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, relative to the repairs required to the furnace and the banking of the teacher's residence at the Burnt Church Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange to have the repairs required to the furnace carried out. It is noted you estimate the cost to be approximately $6. You may also incur an expenditure of approximately $15 in banking the teacher's residence, in order that frost can be kept out of the basement during the winter.\n\nAfter the above work has been completed, please forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nChas. Hudson Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nOttawa, November 4, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nReverend Father Ryan, in a report on his recent inspection of the Burnt Church Indian Day School, requests that a desk be supplied for the use of the teacher of the Primary Department. In this connection, please state if you can arrange for the purchase of a suitable desk and table for the teacher's use and also a chair, if same is required. You should give an estimate of the cost of supplying this equipment. Your early attention to this matter is requested.\n\nFather Ryan draws attention to the condition of the wooden ceiling in the senior classroom. He states it is very dirty. In this connection I would refer you to official letter dated July 16th last, in which you were requested to furnish an estimate of the cost of having the woodwork and walls of the senior room painted. As Father Ryan appears to consider that this work is urgent, I would request that you furnish the Department with an estimate of the cost of having the interior of this classroom cleaned and any necessary painting carried out.\n\nFather Ryan requests that three side tables, hinged to school wall, be installed in the room for domestic science purposes. He recommends that three tables, about 5 ft. long and made like a door, be hinged to side of wall of school, with proper supports and so constructed that they can be lowered against the side of the wall when not in use. Please give an estimate of the cost of having these tables built and installed.\n\nIt is presumed that you have had the repairs required to the furnace carried out, as authorized in official letter of the 20th ultimo, also the backing of the teacher's residence completed. I have to request further than the usual furnace site information asked for in official letter of July 24th last regarding the construction of a drain. It is necessary that we have this information at an early date as, if, after your report is received, it is intended to have the work done, the funds will have to be provided in our estimates for next fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N. B.\nSir:-\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 4th instant File 55-2-5 and one of July 24th, referring to the drain from the basement of the Burnt Church Indian Day school building, I beg to say that the only practicable way to construct a drain from this building is to disconnect the pipe where it joins the pipe from the basement of the Church, and to continue the pipe from the school to the Bay. This will require a new pipe about 40 feet in length, and an excavation six feet in depth. It may be possible to have this work done for less than $500.00 but I do not think so.\n\nIn regard to the painting of the wood-work in the senior class room, it will cost in the vicinity of $100.00 for material and labour to do this work. All the other work mentioned in your letter of July 16th, has been carried out. I might state that the walls, woodwork, and floors, of both of these school rooms were thoroughly scrubbed during the summer holidays, and the floors were oiled.\n\nIn reference to desk, tables, and chairs for these class rooms, I will find what the expense will be, and then report to you. It will be possible to procure these tables here, and School furness has been repaired. Teachers residence banked some time ago.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nIndian Agent\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 17, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, giving an estimate of the cost of constructing a drain from the basement of the Burnt Church Indian Day School building. An item is being noted for inclusion in our Estimates for the coming fiscal year to provide the funds required in the construction of the drain next summer. We have no funds at the present time, and this work will have to stand over until the necessary funds are provided.\n\nRelative to the painting of the woodwork in the senior classroom, I have to say that this work will also have to stand over until next summer holidays, as we have no funds at the present time to provide for the cost of the work. You should draw this matter to the attention of the Department early next spring, stating definitely the work required, the cost of the paint, etc., and the labour.\n\nIt is noted that you will obtain a price for the installing of three side tables, a desk and chair.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

But now the children of this reserve nearly all have the whooping cough, and I believe it will be necessary to provide something for them to eat at mid-day.\n\nI would think that cocoa with milk and sugar, and some sort of biscuit would be suitable for this lunch. This would cost about $4.50 per week. I would recommend that this be provided from Feb. 1st until May 1st.

It is noted the cost will be approximately 75 cents each. After the purchase has been made, please forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nOttawa, May 27, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nRev. Father Ryan, in a report on his recent inspection of the Burnt Church Indian Day School, recommends that the interior walls of the older portion of the school building be kalsomined, as the present walls are very dirty. He also states that the woodwork should be well washed and the floors oiled in both classrooms during the coming summer holidays. You should arrange to have the interior walls of the older portion of the school kalsomined, all woodwork cleaned and the floors scrubbed and oiled before the school reopens in September, next.\n\nRegarding the teachers' house, Father Ryan states that the clapboards are falling off and should be repaired at once, also that this building should be painted on the outside, and that all the work in connection with the painting and repairs required would not cost very much. Please inform the Department whether you would recommend that this building be given a coat of paint on the outside, and, if so, the approximate cost of the material and labour. It is considered that you could arrange with the Indians to do the work if you purchased the paint. You should see, however, that any repairs required to the clapboards on the outside of the building are attended to.\n\nAfter the above authorized work has been completed, you should forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nChas.

I estimate the quantity of paint required, to be 44 gallons, that will cost about $3.00 per gal., and the labour can be provided by the Indians and should not exceed $10.00.\n\nIn regard to the clapboards on the outside of the building, they do not need repairing but have to be repainted, and this I have arranged to be done, by an Indian.\n\nIf you decide to have this house painted anytime during the summer vacation will be suitable.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Agent\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 22, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, giving an estimate of the cost of painting the outside of the teacher's house at the Burnt Church Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say it is noted that the cost of the material and labour will be approximately $25.50. The Department will approve of you arranging to have the house painted before the school reopens after the present summer holidays. You should arrange for the purchase of the paint and other material required for the purpose from a firm on the list to receive consideration and also for Indians to perform the labour. The entire cost should, if possible, be kept within your estimate.\n\nPlease forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the paint, etc., and for the labour employed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The meal is to be served the pupils from December first, next, to March 31st, following. The above amount must not be exceeded.\n\nIn checking over the accounts for this service last year it is considered that certain of the supplies furnished at that time can be discontinued, such as dried apples, barley, codfish, onions and beef. It is not intended to furnish a full meal but only a lunch, to supplement what should be brought by the pupils from their homes. Last year, an expenditure of $60 was authorized for the supplies for the Big Cove School, and it is noted that accounts were forwarded by you and paid to the amount of $60. No payments can be made this year in excess of the amount authorized above for each of these schools. You will please govern yourself accordingly.\n\nPlease obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of the supplies for each of the schools, separately.

He reports that the house is very cold and that it should be repaired in some way to make it warmer. Please inform the Department concerning the quantity of linoleum required and the approximate cost. You should also state what work is necessary to improve the condition of the residence and make it warmer during the cold weather. Please give an estimate of the cost of any work which you recommend be carried out.

In reply I beg to inform you that I certainly am amused at some of the statements made by the Reverend Inspector.\n\nIn regard to the painting he saw, it was on a small portion of the wall of the domestic science wing from which the paint had all disappeared and it looked very shabby. When I had a man doing the work authorized by your letter of June 26th File 55-2-5, I asked him to put a little paint on this shabby part (at no cost to the Department). The surface covered was about 10 feet square. It happened that this was not done until quite late and on the day the Inspector visited the school. He may have thought the whole school was being painted, but I cannot understand how he could be mistaken like that.\n\nI trust the Department did not think I would undertake a contract like painting a school without your authority.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept., of Mines and resources,\nIndian Agent\nOttawa.\nNeguac, N.

I trust that you can approve of my action, as it is the best thing that can be done until Spring. The Indians will take his pay in groceries if it is satisfactory to you.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is noted that these repairs will involve an expenditure of approximately $22.00 and you are authorized to have this work undertaken at the earliest possible date.\n\nMay I point out that it is highly desirable that repairs to Indian day schools should be undertaken and completed during the vacation period. This is the practice invariably followed in the case of public schools and I am anxious that our procedure should be brought into conformity with the practice followed at public schools. The repairing of a furnace or the painting of a building, I know from experience, is a constant source of annoyance to the teacher in charge of any school. I feel confident that you will be glad to co-operate with the Department in at least attempting to have repair work done during the months of July and August.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

B.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 18, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th Instant you should proceed at once with the painting of the Big Cove and Burnt Church schools.\n\nIt is noted from your letter that the cost of the material will not exceed $50.00 for each building; consequently, you may make the purchase from a firm or firms on the approved list.\n\nIt is also noted that you intend to employ Indians to do the necessary work but that a white foreman will be required at each school. In connection with the foreman at the Burnt Church school you should consult Mr. J.J. Barry, M.I.C., Chatham, N.B., and in regard to the foreman at the Big Cove school you should consult Mr. L.F.A. Robidoux, Richibucto, N.B.\n\nThe construction of two toilets at the Big Cove school at a cost of $40.00 each is also approved.\n\nIt is understood that repairs are required to the furnace at the Burnt Church school and as the necessary repairs can be done at a cost of $21.35 you may arrange for the work that can be done for this amount.\n\nYours truly,\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe work of painting the Burnt Church and Big Cove schools is under way, if and/or it will not be inconvenient to you, I would respectfully ask if an advance of $200.00 could be made to pay for labour. This work is proceeding without any annoyance to the teachers, and the painters who are in charge claim that it is the proper time to do such work, much better than in the hot weather of the summer.

For over six years we have been trying to have something done on the interior of this school. Outhouses should be repaired, cleaned, whitewashed.\n\nThis school should be painted both inside as well as on the outside and steps & vestibules repaired.\nOttawa,\nJune 24, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reporting on his inspection of the Burnt Church School on the 10th instant Inspector Ryan recommends that the interior of this school be painted. Please let me know what expenditure would be involved in carrying out the Inspector's suggestion and at the same time you should state if Indian labour is available or if white men will have to be employed in the event of funds being available.\n\nThe Inspector also recommends that the outhouses be repaired, cleaned and whitewashed. It is not likely that this will involve any heavy expenditure and you should have the necessary work done before the schools re-open after the summer holidays.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Chas. Hudson,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.

Part of the work to be painted has been covered with varnish and this will have to be washed off, which makes as much work as the painting itself. I believe the Indians could do this work satisfactorily.\n\nThe floors of this building should be cleaned and oiled, and this will cost, for material and labour $7.00, in addition to the cost of painting.\n\nThere are two entries to this School and they are in very bad condition and should be almost entirely replaced: This will cost for material and labour, $20.00.\n\nWith regard to the above I would like to inform you that if it was done by days labour, I believe it would cost more than these figures, as material for scaffolding would have to be procured and erected, and a lot of time is required for this job. I presume you have the blue print of this building and you will be enabled by it to know the size of the area to be painted. It roughly is for the main school room, 36' x 34' x 14'. The cloak room is 8' x 26' x 14'.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nyour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Now it is the furnace at the Burnt Church school that has about given out; It has been repaired one or more times and I do not believe it is worth repairing again, and another thing is that I know a heater that will cost about $45.00 will heat the building better than the furnace that is now used. There is nothing else for me to do but recommend that a circulator heater be provided for this school at a cost of about $36.00 (I have again looked up the price and find that the plain steel type only costs this figure) with additional cost for pipe of about $3.50.\n\nI believe that by using this circulating heater much fuel may be saved. If the furnace gives out entirely before receiving your letter I may have to set up this heater, as there is quite a good attendance at this school and I presume you would not want the school to be closed on account of the heating system. I know it will save money by installing such a heater as I have mentioned instead of the furnace. The weather here now in intensely cold.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nyour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept., of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 29, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th instant you may purchase a stove for the Burnt Church School.

Hudson,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn the basement of the Rural Church Indian school, there is a work cut furnace, which has old pipe and a few pieces of old iron, which the chief asked me if the Department will allow him to purchase it for $100. It is only fit for junk, and he still has $600. He has already $150. Will the Department allow him to have it or these $600? It should be removed and it will cost more than to do so, and I would recommend that Chief Paul Taylor be allowed to have it at the above figure.\n\nPlease let me know what to do with this junk.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nCanada.\nOttawa, June 30, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 27th instant in which you submit for Departmental approval a request received by you from the Chief of the Band for the purchase of the old furnace in the basement of the Burnt Church Indian School.\n\nIf this furnace is of no value to the school, and if it is the intention of the Chief to collect it in a patriotic salvage campaign, the furnace should be transferred to him without cost. This transfer should be made on the understanding that he will, at his own expense, remove it from the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A.

Also there is at this school about 3 cords of 3 Ft. wood that was furnished for the furnace when it was in use, and I would like to have it cut and split small enough for the heater that we now use. This will save considerable expense for fuel this winter.\n\nI can have an Indian do all this work at an expenditure of not more than $20.00.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nyour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I do not know what the water coolers would cost, as they have never been used in the schools of this agency before, that I know of. For reasons of sanitation I would strongly recommend them, but if the cost is too high, I am sure that the water pail will still serve the purpose.

You may also endeavour to secure 2 water coolers and, if these can be bought at a reasonable rate, you may purchase them.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nRichibucto, N.B., November 9th, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI respectfully submit for your consideration, the attached Voucher No.279, for various articles and materials for the Burnt Church Indian Day School, and teachers' residence. I regret that I have to submit this voucher without having first obtained your authority, but on account of a misunderstanding on the part of Miss Hartery, teacher at the above school, she had the articles and materials supplied, instead of obtaining prices, and submitting a list to me to forward for your approval. When I was last in Burnt Church, Miss Hartery had requested certain items for the school and her residence. I informed her to make a list and send to me, and in the meantime I advised her to purchase at once a few articles such as broom, mop and window panes, which were very urgently needed, but she evidently did not understand the necessity of not purchasing such items as she did, without the proper authority. The articles, materials and labour shown on the supporting account were absolutely essential, and I trust that you will accept the account and pass it for payment, and I will see that things like this do not happen again.\n\n[Signature]\nActing Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 15, 1943.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMr. F.J. Hudson, Acting Indian Agent, Richibucto,\nN.B.\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, enclosing voucher No. 279. This is being paid, but I should appreciate your advising Miss Hartery that in future no accounts of this nature will be considered, unless previous authority has been received from this office. As you are aware, the Department has toothbrushes and would have forwarded these direct to the teacher. We obtain them for approximately 15\u00a2 each. Miss Hartery paid 30\u00a2 apiece for them.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 8, 1944.\n\nMr. F.J.

When submitting the above voucher, when it was being prepared your letter containing the authority was not immediately at hand, so I intended showing on the voucher in the space provided, the file number and date of letter, but after removing the voucher from the typewriter, the voucher was signed and unintentionally enclosed without my having written in the authority.

I can only say that the greatest care in purchasing, and in the use of the materials for this work will be exercised.\n\nWhere capable Indians are not available, local white workmen are used and it is not thought that any could be found willing to work for less than .75\u00a2 per hour as per quotations.\n\nIt is understood that the foundation and roof referred to in your letter are those of the school building.\n\n(S.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Sheridan, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBuctouche, N.B.\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nI visited the Burnt Church Indian Day School on the 15th instant. The school building is on a cement foundation, is in good condition, and except for a few minor repairs will be satisfactory during the coming winter.\n\nBoth Rev. Father Ryan, Inspector of Indian Schools, and the local Indian Agent, Mr. Hudson, strongly recommend that, in order to retain the services of teachers at this school, it is necessary that provision be made for the erection of a residence to accommodate two teachers. I would recommend that arrangements be made to have this building erected next summer on the present school site. This is one of the largest reserves in New Brunswick, and it has always been difficult to obtain satisfactory teachers owing to the lack of proper boarding accommodation. This reserve and the Big Cove reserve will be the two most important reserves in New Brunswick, as the Indians from the other reserves are gradually moving to these reserves. A combined school with living quarters is in course of erection at Big Cove, and, when the teachers are installed, this will solve the question of proper school facilities at this reserve. The same arrangement should be undertaken at Burnt Church, where it is necessary that a married teacher or two single teachers be secured. It is considered that a suitable residence could be built at Burnt Church at a cost of approximately $3,000.\n\nAt the time the contract is let for the erection of this building, steps should also be taken to make a few alterations and repairs to the school building. The partition at the rear, between the classroom and sewing room, should be removed. This would provide ample seating accommodation for all the children who would attend. The inside walls above the wainscoting should be sheeted. New steps at both entrances should be built. When the contract is let for the building of the residence, it should include the above repairs to the school building.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHON. CHARLES STEWART.\n\nOn the Burnt Church Reserve, Province of New Brunswick, it has become difficult to obtain satisfactory teachers owing to the lack of accommodation and boarding facilities. Rev. Father Ryan, Inspector of Schools for the Province, and Mr. Agent Hudson, Richibucto, have urged the necessity for the erection of a teachers' residence, with accommodation for two teachers.\n\nThe Burnt Church Reserve contains a larger population than any other of the Reserves in New Brunswick. There are 40 children of school age. The Indians from other Reserves in the province are gradually moving to this, and the Reserve at Big Cove. It is intended when a residence is provided to secure a married man as teacher and his wife who would assist him and perform certain field matron's duties, or two female teachers - one to perform duties in the classroom and the other to assist and carry on field matron work on the Reserve.\n\nIt is proposed to erect a building of the bungalow type, on the same plan as was provided in 1919 for the Red Bank Reserve, the work to be done by day labour, under a competent foreman, the Indian Agent to arrange for the purchase of the material and for the labour required. A plan of the building will be prepared by our Architects and forwarded for the guidance of the Agent, who will oversee the work. Besides the erection of the residence, it is proposed to undertake certain repairs to the school building. The inside walls of the classroom are to be sheeted above the wainscoting, and a partition between the classroom and sewing room is to be removed in order to provide more accommodation. New steps are to be built at the entrance. It is estimated that the cost of putting up the residence for the teacher and the repairs to the school would be approximately $1200. An item has been included in the estimates for the current fiscal year to provide for this expenditure.\n\nI would request your approval for the necessary authority to undertake the above mentioned building operations, the Agent to undertake the work by day labour and to arrange for the purchase of all materials and oversee the work, and that the sum of $1200 be allowed to meet the expenditure.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 9th instant, regarding the building of a teachers residence at the Burnt Church Indian Reserve: I would say that if 18 feet could be added to the length of this building, to be used for Domestic Science class room; the building would then be large enough, but would be better if there was a small sitting room in addition to the bedroom and kitchen.\n\nI have drawn a pencil line on the blue print where I would suggest that the extension be made.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, Sept. 18, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to the building of a teachers' residence on the Burnt Church Indian Reserve, I beg to advise you that the Department approves of you proceeding with the erection of a residence by day labour.\n\nI am enclosing herewith blue print copies of the plans, similar to the ones sent you recently, and the building should be built in accordance with these plans with the addition of ten feet on the end in order to provide a sitting room. It is not thought necessary at present to make provision for a domestic science room.\n\nI am also sending you a specification which will be of assistance to you in the purchasing of materials and time sheets on which to keep your labour. Before purchasing the materials you should obtain competitive prices and make the purchase to the best advantage from the firm quoting the lowest price, and when submitting vouchers to the Department for payment a memo should be attached showing the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted. The time sheets should be kept for all labour employed on the building and forwarded to the Department in duplicate. An accountable cheque for payment of labour will be sent to you on application.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Shields, which is for work with himself and horse hauling lumber and other supplies for building the teachers residence at the Burnt Church Reserve.\n\nOwing to it being late in the season when this work was begun the lumber had to be stored until it was used, which made it necessary to have most of it hauled the distance of about 30 rods; this is the work stated in this bill.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Agent\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 16th instant, asking what would be the cost of completing the teachers' residence at the Burnt Church Indian Reserve, I would say that I have to purchase about $50.00 worth of lumber to finish the interior of the building, this together with the cost of labour to complete it would be about $200.00. But this would not include the cost of painting. And as it is entirely too cold at this season of the year to paint I have not yet got any figures on the cost of painting this building. But would say that it is likely to be about $250.00.\n\nSir I have not done anything at the work since December 20th, when the exterior of the building was completed. I intended to go on with the work this week, but will now wait until I again hear from you. The reason for the delay is that I could not get a carpenter since the Christmas holiday.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Agent\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 5th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, stating the cost required to complete the teachers' residence on the Burnt Church Indian Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure to the amount of approximately $250 in the purchase of the lumber required to finish the interior of the building and in payment of the labour required. I shall be pleased if you will arrange to have the interior of this building completed as soon as weather conditions permit. Proper time sheets, in duplicate, should be kept for the labour employed, and a certified account, in duplicate, should also be forwarded covering the cost of the lumber required.\n\nRegarding the painting of this building, I beg to say that this can stand over until next spring. You should bring the matter to the attention of the Department in due time, giving an estimate of the cost of the material and labour required in the painting, and, if it is decided to authorize the work, it can be undertaken during the summer holidays. We have no funds available at the present time to carry out this painting.

Possibly you could secure his signature by mail. If you think there is a possibility of the return being lost, you might make out a proper receipt and send it to Bernard and have him sign it before a witness; or, if you made payment to him by cheque, and your paid cheque shows clearly that it covers the payment of $12.00 for wages for the week ended March 14th, 1925, you could attach the paid cheque to the labour return.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H.

And the toilet is also in need of painting, and it would be a good plan to have the whole job done when the painter is there, it would be cheaper. The expense for painting all those buildings would not exceed $225.00.\n\nI might mention here that it will be necessary to furnish this residence with a stove and some furniture before the school opens after the summer vacation. I cannot say just how what it would cost to supply those things but it should not be more than $150.00.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Agent\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 16th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, relative to the painting of the new residence which has been erected for the use of the teacher on the Burnt Church Reserve, and also the painting of the exterior of the school building and the toilets.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of having this painting done. The buildings should receive a coat of a good grade of paint. You may select the colours and arrange for the purchase after obtaining competitive prices for the paint, oil, etc., required. You should also engage the labour in doing the painting, keeping proper time sheets in duplicate. The Department will expect you to see that the work is satisfactorily performed and at the least possible expense. We note that you estimate the cost of same to be approximately $225.\n\nRegarding the furnishings required for the teacher's residence, I shall be pleased if you will furnish an itemized list of what you would recommend be supplied and the approximate cost of same. When we have this information, authority will be granted you to purchase the furnishings considered necessary.

I may point out that the freight receipt is for .56\u00a2 only.\n\nWhen the voucher, duly amended, reaches the Department, the matter of payment will be given prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

We have in Elk ground sixty-five children, that ought to attend school, and are deprived of Education from the very fact of not having clothing sufficient to attend school or not having fit footwear. And a great many too hungry to attend school. The average attendance of our school is only thirty scholars. You will give this matter your earliest attention. It would be well to have the town employed teaching that number, as it is teaching eight of a number. What is life without Education?\n\nAnother matter I would wish to call attention to, in reference to our Church. The Lieutenant has refused to allow the usual salary, that is usually given yearly, which he claims he is duty bound to do. As for the people that attend Church they are really too poor to pay anything toward the support of the Church. And we demand of you to attend to this matter above all others. The Indians is not like the White man he is barred out from making money and therefore he is unable to give anything to the support of the Church.\n\nAnother matter I would call your attention to, which is the principal thing for the welfare of the Indians. And that is...\n\nIndian Affairs.

Of late years there has been a very small quantity of seed given them in our district; there are sixty-six settlers in our district that work their land and a lot more that do not. There has been a small yearly sum of one hundred and seventy-five dollars distributed amongst sixty-six settlers you can gather from this how much farming there is done. What a chance the poor Indians have to live, when he is limited to such a small quantity of seed, they have the finest tracts of land in the country and they only want the seed to sow.\n\nThere is also another matter that I would like to bring your attention to. And that is the poor old people of Poor Town. We claim that we have received enough good money for the care of the poor people of Elgin County, but there is a great many old people who are sick and not able to work also a lot of cripples and old age people. Besides others that have known way of making a living and a lot of orphan children to look after and be provided for. This matter you will take into consideration, and try and allow a little more.

With regard to the supply of seed grain to the Indians, Mr Agent Carter has been instructed to do the best he can for your Indians in this respect, consistently with the amount of the grant and the interests of the other Reserves, and he has been requested to make a special report on the seed requirements of your Indians next spring.\n\n2. I have informed Mr Agent Carter of your complaint that sick and destitute Indians do not receive enough assistance from him, and that he should be careful not to let any suffering take place but not to give any supplies to those who should provide for themselves.\n\n3. With regard to the missionary, I regret it is impossible to comply with your request to pay him a salary as nothing is voted by Parliament to pay such salaries and there is no other fund from which the same can\n\nChief Peter Julien\nNorth Bol\nMormichia, N.B.,\ncan be paid. It is only in cases where a Missionary has been receiving salary for a number of years from the Department that he is paid, and whenever he dies or is removed the salary has to be stopped as was done in the case of the Revd Mr Crumley.\n\n4. Your request that the Indians of your Band be allowed to fish from the time the ice forms in the fall until it breaks up again, is being urged upon the Department of Marine and Fisheries for the most favorable consideration that can be given it, but very slight hope is entertained by this Department that the request will be granted, as the Department of Marine & Fisheries is very adverse to any fishing being done during the close season which for bass begins on the last March and the ice does not break up as a rule for at least a month after that date.\n\nAs to the regulations spoken of for the bass...\nOttawa, 20th October, 1896.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of a report from you on the Richibucto School dated the 13th instant.\n\nWith reference to the absence of the teacher on account of illness, I have to request that you will, as promptly as possible, secure the services of another teacher holding at least a third-class certificate, the engagement to be made with the understanding that the position is to be vacated should Mr. Plimne, on his recovery, desire to return to his charge.\n\nA requisition should be sent to the Department for such school materials as may be necessary to replace the personal property removed by Mr. Plimne.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.
