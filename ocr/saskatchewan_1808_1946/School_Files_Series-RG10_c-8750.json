MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to the Sliammon Indian Day School.\n\nWe do not appear to have on file a copy of the tender submitted by Vancouver Steeplejacks Limited. Please forward this so that it may be submitted to the Minister for approval.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Indian Agent Taylor's letters of July 31st and August 14th in connection with repairs required at the Sliammon Indian Day School at a cost of $1200.00.\n\nI have discussed this matter with Mr. Taylor and am convinced that the condition of the building is such that the children could not be reasonably expected to attend or forced to attend the school and there would appear to be no alternative but to have the repairs carried out.\n\nIn the absence of any other tender it is recommended that the Vancouver Steeplejacks Limited be asked to carry out the work.\n\nIt is unfortunate that no provision was made in the estimates for such a large expenditure and it is intended to have Mr. Taylor inspect the various school buildings in his Agency with a view to adequately providing for necessary repairs.\n\nFor D. T. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nmh enc.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVancouver.\n\nReplying to your letter of the 5th inst., regarding repairs for Sliammon Day School, I would advise that the advertisement in the Powell River News was verbally authorised by Acting Indian Agent Mr. J. D. Caldwell during a visit to Powell River. Apparently, there was no Departmental authority for this expenditure. We have no copy of the advertisement or of any report made by Mr. Caldwell.\n\nVancouver Steeplejacks' letter advise that the repairs to the Dispensary total $20.00.\n\nI would ask that authority be given for the School repairs as quoted on by the above firm, less $20.00, and this latter amount will be asked for from the Medical Vote.\n\nI am informed that the Fire Hall is used to house hose-reels for fire-fighting.\n\n[Signature]\nH.E. Taylor,\nIndian Agent.\n\nAA.\nIndian Commissioner, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter of the 30th instant which was inadvertently sent directly to Ottawa instead of to you, concerning much needed repairs to the Day School at Sliammon I.R. No. 1.\n\nSince writing, I have received additional information from Mr. and Mrs. Gallagher, the school teacher and field matron respectively. They report that pupils are endangered by falling plaster, one large piece narrowly missing a small girl's head recently. After rain the school floor is a mass of puddles and the stove heat makes a steam which dampens the class room. It is usually noon before the floor dries out.\n\nI note that reports of November 12th 1944 and June 6th 1945 by the Provincial Inspector of Schools refer to the school toilets as dirty and needing repairs. They frequently blow down, the roofs leak and the sides are split.\n\nThere is at present cardboard in some of the broken windows and it would seem that we are setting the Indians a very poor example in permitting children to attend school under such conditions.\n\nThe dispensary roof also leaks badly and only one chair is available for Indian patients; this is usually wet from roof leaks. The water supply is non-existent during summer months, so there is no fire protection, neither has the matron any hot or cold running water for treatment of patients. The water situation will form the subject of another report.\n\nIn urging acceptance of the only tender submitted vide my letter referred to above, I would submit that we are inviting severe criticism over the conditions of this School. Will you kindly air mail this to Ottawa with the necessary recommendations?\n\n(H.E. Taylor)\nIndian Agent\n\nT/DH\nOttawa, August 19, 1946.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, British Columbia.\n\nRef. your 215-14-4854 of August 10, 1946.\n\nThe Department authorizes the expenditure\nof approximately $35.00 for sports equipment at the\nSliammon Indian Day School.\n\nI would like to recommend that the\nexpenditure for supplies requested by the Indian Agent\nfor the following be substituted:\n\n2 Softball bats,\n1 Softball catcher's mitt,\n1 Softball base mitt,\n2 Footballs and bladders,\n4 Softballs.\n\nYou will find that softballs are much\nmore expendable than are softball bats.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Indian Agent Taylor's letter of August 2nd and requisition covering the supply of sporting equipment for the Sliammon Indian Day School.\n\nThis equipment will cost approximately $35.00 f.o.b. Vancouver, and although not immediately available I would recommend that authority be granted to place the order.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C\n\nenclos.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVancouver.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose requisition in duplicate for recreational equipment for playground activities at the Sliammon Day School. Apparently no such equipment has ever been supplied for this School, and I am advised by the school teacher that there is an urgent need for the articles listed. In view of the very unattractive condition of the school buildings, as recently reported by me, and the absence of any equipment for playground games, I would suggest that more regular attendance of pupils may result from an effort to create a pleasanter atmosphere, and organised games would certainly play an important part in this. No local competitive prices have been secured, as it is considered that you may have a more satisfactory source of supply.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(H.E. Taylor),\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncl.\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1946, September | To Cartage on supplies from Ottawa for Sliammon Indian Day School, as per attached account. | $2.00  |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Mackay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVancouver.\n\nReferring to your letter of the 28th ultimo enclosing copy of District School Inspector Davey's report on the Sliammon Indian Day School, and to that portion of your letter regarding construction of new school toilets.\n\nThe need for toilets and other repairs was the subject of correspondence with you last Fall, but funds available only permitted the re-shingling of the school and dispensary roof. Following receipt of your letter I asked the school teacher, Mr. Gallagher, to obtain an estimate for new toilets. As a result I have a price from one John Gibson, building contractor of Wildwood Heights near Powell River.\n\nI enclose a copy of his tender and you will note that it includes other repair work.\n\nThe additional work is certainly necessary, and in view of the difficulty of obtaining tenders for these small repair jobs, I would recommend that the other work be done at the same time. The locks on the school doors are broken and the doors are continually banging. The woodshed is unsightly and new steps are needed.\n\n(H. E. Taylor),\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncl.\nAA.\nAir Mail\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\n\nMay 10th to Mr. Indian Agent Taylor with respect to\nthe construction of new toilets at the Sliammon Indian\nDay School, I am enclosing Mr. Taylor's letter of May\n13th and enclosure referred to therein. Mr. Gibson's\ntender covering the construction above mentioned and\nother minor repairs in the amount of $157.00 is con-\nsidered to be reasonable and I have authorized Mr.\nTaylor to have the work proceeded with.\n\nD.

I would advise as follows:\n\nSince the teacher, Mr. Trembley, resigned last Fall because of ill health, the teacherage has been vacant.\n\nMr. Trembley omitted to turn off the water and the Indians did not concern themselves. Consequently, during the severely cold weather prevailing in December, the plumbing was frozen up.\n\nI visited the Reserve last week and made arrangements for the arrival of another teacher, Miss O'Connor.\n\nIt was necessary to engage a plumber to inspect the water pipes and thaw out the kitchen and bathroom plumbing and tighten and adjust all connections.\n\nHe also replaced a window in the dispensary, broken by an unknown party.\n\nI also arranged for fires to be maintained in the house and for house cleaning pending the arrival of Miss O'Connor who will go to Shapton on the 21st instant.\n\n(H.

No. 1 revealed a pressing need for the repapering and repainting of all rooms.\n\nDifficulty in obtaining and retaining teachers in such reserves is enhanced when the accommodation provided is gloomy and repellent for lack of paint and paper.\n\nThere are three bedrooms in the house, a bathroom, kitchen, pantry, dispensary and dining and living rooms.\n\nFurther deterioration will result in heavier expense later for maintenance.\n\nThe accompanying tender from Gulf Coast Construction Company in Westview, B.C. is $405.35 for work as specified.\n\nKindly advise if authorized.\n\n(H.

Taylor,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of April 6, we have made an inspection of the work as outlined in your letter to the Sliammon School and wish to make a suggestion regarding the plaster. The plaster on the ceiling is beyond repair, apparently due to a leaky roof at sometime has caused it to crack all over and is liable to all come down should it be touched. We would like to suggest covering all the plaster with a \u00bc\" P.V. Hardboard, this will make a more substantial job. We have estimated the cost of the labor and material to do the walls and ceiling of the classroom, cloakroom and store-room to be $256.50.\n\nPainting the interior walls and ceiling of the classroom, cloakroom and store-room with two coats 1st. quality paint for the sum of $186.50.\n\nPainting the exterior walls with two coats of 1st. quality house paint all for the sum of $193.00.\n\nStain the roof area with once coat of 1st quality shingle stain all for the sum of $53.00.\n\nPaint the interior and exterior of the outside toilets with one coat of 1st quality paint all for the sum of $25.00.\n\nRepairs to sink outlet all for the sum of $15.00 includes new trap and pipe.\n\nSupply material and hardware for two doors to outside toilets all for the sum of $14.00.\n\nThanking you for this opportunity of quoting you our estimate and trust we may again be of service to you, we are\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGULF COAST CONSTRUCTION CO., LTD.\nOttawa, May 11th, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Sliammon Indian Day School,\nVancouver Indian Agency,\nElectoral District of Vancouver N.,\nProvince of British Columbia\n\nIndian Commissioner Arneil reports that the above mentioned school requires extensive repairs.\n\nTenders were requested from two firms in Powell River, but only one submitted a tender.

While technically it might be claimed that after one tender had been received the conditions laid down by the Cabinet had been met, I imagine that that was not what was intended. It may not always be practicable to secure more than one bid, but it is thought that in future when a recommendation is being made to the Deputy Minister that a contract be let, it be stated whether public tenders are invited, and if not, what the circumstances are that justify the acceptance of an individual tender.\"\n\nThis means that it would not be possible to secure an Order-in-Council for the acceptance of the tender from the Precision Housing Company Ltd., until we have assured the Minister that we have attempted to secure other prices.\n\nIn the case of Cape Mudge we had already advertised for tenders and so it was relatively easy to obtain the authority.

The outside of the building was given three coats of paint, and the roof shingled and new steps both back and front were constructed, three leaks fixed on the roof, and windows puttied. Bath-room, kitchen and scullery were renovated or salsomined, and the dispensary, which is part of the residence, was given one coat of paint. Other rooms were papered, but this work was done voluntarily by the occupants and is not charged. I enclose herewith the Return of Labour.\n\nMr. Wood's reports that he found the Indians very slow and not anxious to assist. All work done by this man previously has been first-class work, and judging from reports received on this job it is more than satisfactory.

Warren, of the Dominion Water Branch, visited the Reserve with regard to the water supply but did not make a written report. She strongly recommends that the plumbing be given prompt attention, as it is in bad shape.\n\nI would respectfully recommend that a plumber be sent to the Reserve from Powell River, which is only four miles away, to ascertain what repairs are necessary, as I do not feel competent to express an opinion, although I do not think it is at all an extensive job.\n\nAs this is a question of health, it should receive early consideration, and nothing will be done without previous authorization from you.\n\nI have advised the teacher that nothing can be done until I hear from you, as the experience I had in connection with repairs to the Squamish Residential School are still fresh in my memory.\n\nIt would be advisable to have this work done as soon as possible.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB/DH.\n\n[F.J.O.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nMarch 7, 1941.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant you may arrange to have a plumber visit the Sliammon School and advise what it would cost to repair the plumbing.\n\nOnly the urgent work should be considered and when submitting your report you should show separately the amount to be expended in the room used as a dispensary and the amount to be expended in the rooms used by the teacher and matron as a residence.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

I should like to recommend that simple tools to the value of some $20.00 be supplied to the Sliammon Indian Day School and that at the same time lumber of various assorted sizes to a value of not more than $10.00 be made available. The teacher tells me that he is able to instruct in simple manual training and the boys could make a few simple articles of use in the school, a small bench, table etc. If you agree with me that such equipment and lumber might be supplied I would ask that this simple set of tools be supplied in time for the opening of school in September of this year.\n\nThe girls are learning to knit now and I shall have some suggestions to make with regard to their vocational training at a later date.\n\n(Sgd.)

Barry.\n\n..........................\n\nExtract from Major MacKay's letter dated April 1, 1939:\n\nAn expenditure of $20.00 on simple tools and $10.00 for lumber for use in manual training work is recommended for favourable consideration.\n\n(Sgd.)

Wool as well as sewing materials are needed. The\ngirls are in fact starting to make their own dresses. The\nfew knitted articles I saw were made of the last of the wool\nover from last year. Some $10.00 might well be expended\non the materials asked for by the teacher for the balance\nof the present academic year. As I do not remember seeing\nthis particular requisition in your office I do not know\njust what has become of it. Perhaps you would look into\nthe matter for I am of course anxious that the instructions\nof the Department in the way of extending the vocational\nactivities in the day schools should be followed.\n\nGerald H. Barry.\nInspector of Indian Schools for B.C.\nVancouver, B.C., Feb. 7, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith report of Capt. G. H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for B.C. together with his covering letter of the 24th ultimo, with respect to his inspection on the same date of the Sliammon Indian Day school, Vancouver agency, B.C.\n\nWith reference to the 3rd paragraph of Inspector Barry's covering letter accompanying this report it would appear that the materials referred to were requisitioned for by the Indian Agent, Mr. Ball, on July 10th. The Department approved of the supply of some of the items included in this requisition (vide your letter 167-24-5 of July 18th, addressed to the Agent) but to date has not approved of the purchase of the wool, etc. Should funds be available, I would recommend that the purchase of these materials be authorized.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No.167-24-11 dated May 6th 1943.\n\nVoucher No. 110 Date: June 30th 1943 Agent\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6415, file 845-11, part 1)\nJuly 12, 1943.\n\nF.J.C. Ball, Esq., Indian Agent, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nReplying to your letter of the 20th ultimo regarding Sliammon Indian Day School, I would request that you ascertain the cost of a suitable sheet iron protector for the stove.\n\nYou advise, in connection with manual training, that when the boys get bigger they usually go to Sechelt Residential School, but you do not make it clear why such transfers should be made when a school is operating on the Reserve, and as Departmental instructions are to the effect that this is not to be done except where the home conditions warrant such transfers, manual training is being carried on successfully in other Indian Day Schools, even by women, this usually being done at the time when the girls are engaged in domestic science.\n\nMr. Gallagher's general reaction to the Inspector's observations would indicate somewhat of a defeatist attitude and resistance to change. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Department will, undoubtedly, accept the opinion of the Inspector as against that of the teacher.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nre: Sliammon Indian Day School\n\nI enclose herewith an account for supplies for the above School as recommended by the School Inspector. Mr. Gallagher advised me recently that he applied to the Department for a number of the articles included in the attached bill, but never received them. He is not in favour of plasticine for various reasons.\n\nOn a recent visit to the School, I made a careful check-up of the various matters mentioned by the School Inspector in his report on this School. Regarding the stove, the teacher states that a circulating heater is required, as he is afraid that the children will be burned when getting too near the present stove, which is often red hot. As these circulating heaters are practically unprocurable (in fact, any kind of heater is almost non-existent) I would recommend that a sheet iron protector be placed round the present stove.\n\nWith reference to the manual training, there is no room for this in the school, and in any case the boys are too small. When they are bigger, they usually go to Sechelt Residential School, where they are given manual training. In any event, the noise from a manual training class would prevent any other instruction at the same time. Another point which should be reckoned with is that the next teacher might be a woman in which case manual training would not be given.\n\nWith regard to the inspector's observation that the school should be made more attractive, Mr. Gallagher advised that all the children want to come to school. There is no difficulty in getting them there when they are on the Reserve, but the parents have to move around to make their living, and are forced to take the children with them. Mr. Gallagher, who has had long teaching experience, made the observation that it is quite common for a new inspector to make an adverse report on his first visit to a school so that he can claim improvement due to his efforts and inspections.\n\nB/DH.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJuly 19, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M.

Arthur Barner, Superintendent of United Church Indian Missions, has discussed with me the experiment started by Dr. Spencer and Captain Oliver at Smith Inlet. If Charlie Walkus has been able to keep a class together, it is just possible that the United Church will ask us to recognize it as a day school and pay for a qualified teacher. There is a Miss Winifred Potter, at present at Kitimat, who is willing to accept this post. If this arrangement was approved it would be satisfactory to all concerned if a temporary arrangement for a salary at the rate of $4 per teaching was made.\n\nMr. Barner was able to put me in touch with some old desks at the Alberni Indian Residential School and I have written to the Rev. Principal concerning them.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier\nOttawa, March 16, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 57 of the 3rd instant, with reference to the request that desks be supplied for the school which has been established at Smith Inlet. In reply I have to state that there are no funds for the purpose at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Charlie G. Walkus, stating that he is starting a school and teaching the younger children at Smith Inlet, and is asking for 12 desks for his school-room.\n\nWith regard to this school, I would refer you to past correspondence, particularly my letter of August 20, 1927, in which Dr. Spencer had made recommendations for the school at Smith Inlet.\n\nI would recommend that 12 individual desks be given, as it seems a very reasonable request, and even though Charlie G. Walkus, may not be an expert teacher he is better than none at all, and there is no other school within forty miles where the children could go.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Halliday\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6415, file 846-1, part 1)\nOttawa, September 6, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 57 of the 20th ultimo, with reference to a school for Indian children at Smith Inlet. I regret that there is no appropriation to assist this activity and, at the present time, I cannot agree to any payment of teacher's salary. If those interested actually commence a school, the Department might give favourable consideration to classroom supplies; but I regret that I cannot now agree to the supplying of desks.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI am receipt of a letter from Dr. J.C. Spencer of the Crosby Marine Mission regarding a school at Smith Inlet for the Indians of the Kwashola Band. The United Church has erected a small building to be used for church and educational purposes and have been discussing the matter with this office for about one year.\n\nThey now recommend that the Department supply 12 individual desks and the following school supplies:\n- 1 doz 1st primers\n- 1-2 doz 2nd primers\n- 2 doz scribblers\n- 1 doz no 1 drawing books\n- 2 doz copy books no 1\n- 2 boxes white chalk\n- 1 \" colored chalk\n- 1 doz boxes oil crayons for coloring animals fruit etc.\n\nThey further recommend a grant of $30.00 per month to a lad named Walkus who was a pupil of the Alert Bay Residential school for about three years.\n\nWith regard to the above I am very much in sympathy with the plan as outlined above but I could not recommend Walkus as a teacher as he has not had any experience nor training along those lines. Smith Inlet is very much isolated and in order to get to it or away from it it is necessary to travel Queen Charlotte Sound which in winter is only fit for small craft on occasional days. It is one of the stormiest places on the coast of B.C.\n\nThis means that the people living there are practically cut off from the rest of the world for months at a time excepting for the monthly visit of the mail boat. There is no school near and there is no accommodation for any more children at the residential schools.\nI am aware that the policy of the Department in every instance where possible aims to assist in the education of the Indian and I would be ready to recommend that the grant be given for one year as an experiment provided they had someone who was able to teach the children and do a little missionary work along with it, but I fear Walkus could not be relied on as a teacher although he would be better than none at all.\n\nHe would be cut off from all supervision so that he could get little help from either the Missionary Society, the Inspector of Indian Schools or the Indian Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nW.M.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, relative to the experiment which has been conducted at the village of Takush, Smith's Inlet, and note that there is a good prospect of carrying on school activity at the close of the canning season.\n\nThe Department has already arranged with the Principal of the Alberni Indian Residential School to forward 12 double school desks, which were surplus to requirements at that school, to Smith's Inlet.\n\nIf the services of a qualified teacher are secured, the Department will pay salary at the rate of $4 per day for each day the school is in operation. When you visited the Department early in May, last, you stated that there was a Miss Winnifred Potter, at present at Kitimat, who might be willing to accept this post. I shall be pleased to hear from you as to the name of the teacher who will take up duties after the canning season is over, together with particulars as to the qualifications, etc., of the teacher appointed. When we have information as to the name of the teacher and the probable date of the re-opening of the school, our local Agent will be advised accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Arthur Barner,\nSupt., United Church Indian Missions,\n97 Craighurst Ave.,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, August 9th, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant relative to the school which will be conducted at the village of Taknah, Smith's Inlet, under the auspices of the United Church of Canada. We have had correspondence with Rev. Arthur Barner in connection with the establishment of this school, the engagement of the services of a teacher and the salary that would be allowed.\n\nMr. Barner informed the Department that Miss Winnifred Potter was engaged as teacher and we agreed to allow her salary at the rate of $4. per day for each day the school is in operation. This grant will be paid upon receipt of the usual quarterly returns showing the attendance and the number of days the school was open during the quarter. These returns should be forwarded through your office and certified by you. We note that Miss Potter is ready to proceed to the school, also, that the desks which were being transferred from the Alert Bay Indian Residential School have arrived and that, therefore, Miss Potter can commence teaching activities as soon as she reaches the school.\n\nWhen a requisition for school material is received, it will be given consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nAs Fr.-MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nThere has been considerable correspondence between this office and the Rev. Arthur Barnar, superintendent of the United Church Missions whose head office is, 67 Craighurst Ave., Toronto 12, Ontario, regarding the establishment of a school at Takush Harbor for the Indians of the Kwashela Band.\n\nMr. Barnar wished me to recommend Charlie Walkus as a teacher which I could not honestly do, but I told him that if they got a good white teacher I would recommend him. He informed me in one of his letters that they had been dealing with the Department with regard to other schools and that the Department generously had made a grant in other instances of $4.00 a day for every day the school was kept open and I told him I would be very pleased to make this recommendation to the Department in case they got a suitable teacher.\n\nI have just received a letter from Mr. Barnar stating that they have appointed Miss Winnifred Potter to the school, and Mr. Barnar says that she has a life certificate and has had 16 years experience in teaching. He says that she is used to Indian children at Kitimat, and is healthy and strong and likes to live alone.\n\nBy yesterdays mail I received a letter from Miss Potter, stating that she is ready to go in at any time and that the difficulty about school desks which was referred to in your letter of March 14th has been adjusted as they have had seats from the Alberni school shipped to them and they are there on the spot.\n\nBy todays mail I am sending Miss Potter some requisition forms for school material which I will forward as soon as they are returned to me, and I would recommend that this lady be supplied with funds to the amount of $4.00 a day for every day the school is open and also with the necessary school material.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Halliday\nIndian Agent\n\nSecretary\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, October 3rd, 1928.\n\nDear Miss Potter:\n\nIn reply to your letter of September 4th, reporting that some of the children in your school are suffering from a bad skin disease, I have to advise you that Mr. Ditchburn, Indian Commissioner, Victoria, has been requested to send you some supplies for their treatment. You will receive some sulphur ointment, some ammoniated mercury ointment and some chloroquine tablets. The tablets should be used for making a wash to cleanse the sores as well as possible before applying the ointment. Two tablets to one cupful of warm water will be about the right strength. If you will look between the fingers and on the front of the wrists of these pupils, you may find some little black specks in the skin or short black lines or tiny blisters. If you find these, you may take it that you have itch or scabies. The treatment for this is the sulphur ointment which should be rubbed in pretty thoroughly wherever there are spots and you may find it necessary to be patient if the cure is slow, as some cases of itch may have quite big sores as well, and these will take some time to clear up. If you do not find these little spots it may be better to use the mercury ointment but these are both good ointments and should benefit any sort of skin disease. The great thing is to get the spots pretty well cleaned up before you put the ointment on.\n\nMr. Ditchburn will also send you some absorbent cotton and gauze to use for cleansing purposes and dressings. I might also say that chloroquine tablets are one of the best applications for cuts and wounds of any kind that you can get.\n\nI shall also suggest to Mr. Ditchburn that he sends you two gallons of cod liver oil and you will find it beneficial to give every one of your pupils a good spoonful after they have had their noon meal.\nIt will be appreciated here if you will send a little report every month stating how your pupils are getting on. You need not write much but we like to keep in touch with school pupils as much as we can.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.L.

We are informed by the Acting Indian Agent that Miss Potter, the teacher, is likely to be subjected to considerable hardship next winter, unless the living quarters are repaired and placed in a more satisfactory condition.\n\nThis matter is being drawn to your attention, as it may be possible for your church authorities in British Columbia to undertake the expense required in making the building comfortable for the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Benton, B.A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nSir:\u2014\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith the original of a duplicate letter dated July 11th, instant, received at this office from Acting Indian Agent E.G. Newnham, of Alert Bay, with respect to the continuity of the services of Miss W. Potter as Indian Day School Teacher at Takush Harbour, and making requisition for a supply of seven cords of wood at $10.00 per cord for the use of the above mentioned school.\n\nI would ask the Department to kindly note the suggestion of Mr. Newnham and that the United Church Authorities be informed that Miss Potter, the teacher, is likely to be subjected to considerable hardship next winter which it is impossible for this Department to obviate. The matter is submitted to the Department it being understood that the Department will prefer to deal with the Church Authorities directly in any such matter.\n\nWith respect to fuel asked for it should be stated that no provision was made by the late Indian Agent in his Estimates for 1933-34 for the purchase of fuel for this School, but no doubt the Department has made provision for fuel in connection with its current Estimates in anticipation of which the requisition is commended to the favorable consideration of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas. G. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosure:\u2014\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nFile 57-1\n\nOFFICE OF\nINDIAN AGENT\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nJuly 11, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI have received official letter No. 156-46-1 dated June 27th from the Department stating that it has been decided to continue the services of Miss W. Potter as Day School teacher at Takush Harbour, but emphasizing the fact that she will have to carry on there on the resumption of the school session under existing conditions.\n\nWhen I visited this school, although I did not commit myself to any definite promises, it was obvious that this lady expected that the Department would undertake a certain amount of very necessary repair work to the school building and her quarters before she returned there in September next. However in view of these latest instructions it will be futile for you to requisition for the necessary expenditure to be incurred. I would however recommend that the Associate Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church be informed that this lady is likely to be subjected to considerable hardship next winter which it is impossible for this Department to obviate.\n\nHowever I understand that this Department will be obligated to the extent of furnishing fuel, and I hereby make requisition for the supply of seven cords of wood at ten dollars a cord for the use of this school during next winter. The sum of ten dollars a cord may appear somewhat excessive but is due to the fact of the Indians having considerable difficulty packing the wood up two flights of stairs after it has been cut into stove lengths.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.G. Newnham\n(E.G. Newnham)\nA/Indian Agent\n\nC.C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Commissioner for B.C.,\nVictoria, B.C.\nOttawa, June 27, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to the continuing of teaching services at the Smith Inlet Indian Day School, Takush Harbour, B. C. In this connection I have to inform you that the question of the continuance of this school was discussed with the Associate Secretary, Board of Home Missions, of the United Church. In view of the valuable work which Miss W. Potter, the teacher, has performed, not only in the classroom but among the Indians at this point, it has been decided to continue her services during the coming academic year.\n\nThe Department will have no funds, however, to carry out any repairs to the teacher's residence at this school. If Miss Potter remains, she will have to carry on under existing conditions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. G. Newnham, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI have to report in connection with the Indian Day School at Takush Harbour, Smith Inlet, B.C., that in order that the teacher's residence at this point should be habitable for next winter, considerable expenditure would need to be incurred in order to carry out repair work. In view of the fact that the number of pupils on the register is only seven, and the average attendance during the quarter ended March 31st was only 6.1, a condition due to the fact that the Kwashela tribe of Indians who own this reserve spend very little of their time there and are of a nomadic disposition, I fail to see that there is any justification for this Day School to be continued, especially in view of present conditions when it does not seem possible for authority to be granted for the necessary expenditure to be incurred.\n\nThe teacher, Miss W. Potter, is fully qualified and thoroughly imbued with the missionary spirit. She was placed there by United Church authorities, but I am of the opinion that under present conditions her energies are misspent and it would be better if the United Church authorities found a place for her elsewhere. The Inspector of Indian Schools, Capt. G.H. Barry, is also of this opinion and does not include this school in his itinerary.\n\nThe Kwashela Indians are not of the best type and need far more Police supervision than they have been getting for a number of years. Takush Harbour is in a more or less isolated location particularly during the winter months, and I have no hesitation in stating that it would be better handled if it were included in the Bella Coola Agency, as it is not so difficult of access from Bella Coola as it is from Alert Bay.\n\nI would be glad to receive instructions in regard to this as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[E.G.

The Department is glad to learn that the work being carried on at this school is having a good effect on the Indian community at that point.\n\nRelative to the request that the point of land to the south of the school house, taking in twenty-five yards back to the west, measuring from the front of the school building, be set aside by the Band for school purposes, I have to say that the Department approves of this arrangement being carried out. You should see that this point of land, which is needed for school purposes, is definitely determined and the boundaries marked. It is understood from your letter that the Indians will agree to the use of this point of land for school purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. H. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Rev. Arthur Barner, Superintendent of Missions for the United Church of Canada, with regard to the school at Takush Harbor for the Kwashela Band. In his letter, he states as follows:\n\n\"I think that the only word which will describe the change there during the past eighteen months since Miss Potter took charge is 'transformation'. Of course there is not much change in the older people, and in the appearance of the village, but already there is talk of building better houses. It is in the children our hopes are centred, and certainly they are changed. I was astonished at the progress they have made with only five months schooling, which is the total the register shows.\"\n\nMr. Barner adds that at a meeting held on the evening of the 14th of February, Miss Potter made a request that the point of land to the south of the schoolhouse taking in twenty-five yards back to the west, measuring from the front of the school building be set aside by the people for school purposes, and it was agreed by all present that this be done. It was further requested at the meeting that Mr. Barner write to me to recommend to the Department to consent to this arrangement. At the present time Miss Potter has no privacy, and she would like to have this done, and also that she may have an opportunity to beautify the point of land. I would recommend that this be done. The point of land is only small, and they have plenty of land for their own purposes, and it will not be depriving them of anything.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M. Halliday)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, February 24, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Barner:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, from Smith Inlet, B.C., with reference to the success of Miss Petter at the Indian Day School there. The Department is glad to learn that this worker is having such a splendid effect upon the community as a whole.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Arthur Barner,\nThe Mission Rooms,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nI am spending a day here with Miss Smith, and I am quite sure that if you could have the privilege of seeing her, you would be convinced that this effort is well worth while.\n\nIn the first place, the courage and devotion of Miss Smith is very impressive. She has not been easy for her to stay here as there is still much work to do, but she does not complain at times. But she has no fear and she believes this to be her place.\n\nIn the second place, she is a real teacher. It is almost beyond belief that children who were entirely ignorant of English or any line of education should be able, with only five months of actual teaching, to show such advancement. Classroom work is done in drawing, not only in the three \"K's,\" but in sewing, dance work, etc. Miss Smith has taught school every available day when the children were at home, often on Saturdays, holidays, but the people are unsettled in their ways and they go off here and there.\n\nOf the third place, the spirit of the village is changing, and the men are talking about better homes. The hope in these \"smoke houses\" is very crude, and not much real advance can be made until the homes of the people change. But it seems as though they would never come until some one was willing to live in the village and act...\nis an object lesson to the people.\n\nIn conclusion I must say that there were 11 children in the school today. I think they are under 7 but the training is good for the little ones and they pick up conversational English quickly at that age. They are all bright and show great interest in the school work.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nFaithfully,\n\nArthur Bower\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nOctober 9, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nWe have just been advised by Dr. H.D. Barner of the R.W. Large Memorial Hospital, Bella Bella, that Miss Winifred Potter who has been the missionary-teacher located at Takush Harbour, Smiths Inlet, has been ill, and it was necessary to remove her to the hospital at Bella Bella. Dr. Barner states in his letter it will be some time before Miss Potter is able to return to her duties and that there is some question that she may not return at all.\n\nWe regret very much Miss Potter's illness, and wish to express to the Department our appreciation for the very splendid work she has been doing as missionary-teacher at Takush but have felt for some time from the standpoint of the school it was not very satisfactory, owing to very few Indians living at this village during the past few years.\n\nThe conditions at Takush village have been reported on as very unsanitary and it is our opinion that these Indians should be moved out of this location. Most of them have been living on other reserves with friends on account of the condition of the village at Takush. We feel now that since it was necessary for Miss Potter to give up her work, this school should be closed entirely and an effort made to have the Indians located in a more suitable place. There are very few Indians in the Kwahela Band, and it is my intention to have the children of school age admitted to the Residential School as soon as arrangements can be made. This I feel would provide for the children and in the meantime an effort will be made to have the Band located in a more suitable village on this side of Queen Charlotte Sound.\n\nI would suggest the Department take the matter up with the United Church of Canada with a view to having the Takush School closed entirely until such time as something definite can be worked out more satisfactory than at present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.

My reason for making this request is through the fact that Miss Pennington informed me some time ago she was being sent there temporarily for six months, and was not sure whether the Church would wish the school to continue after that date, and I did not wish to order supplies unless we are sure that the school is going to continue.\n\nIt would also be appreciated if this school could be inspected by Inspector Barry, as I understand it has never been inspected by him since it was opened some years ago. It is in an out of the way place, and difficult to get at, and has always been considered more or less of unimportance. However as the Department have an expenditure each year of a considerable amount, including the teacher's salary, supplies for the school and fuel for the school and Mission, I feel they should have a report from the School Inspector to see if this expenditure is justified, and I would request that the Department ask Inspector Barry to inspect this school sometime between now and the end of the present school term.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S.

She is a graduate of McGill University and holds a British Columbia teacher's certificate. She worked at one time under Dr. G. H. Raley, who recommends her highly. She has a sister who is willing to accompany her to the Reserve so that she may not be too lonely.\n\nAccording to the Superintendent's wire, Miss Pennington is ready to leave immediately, but it seems to us that if she were appointed by the Department and arrived in time to open school on January 4th, it would be quite satisfactory. We understand from your previous letter that the Department will continue grant at the rate of $4.00 per teaching day, as was the case with Miss Potter, - the balance of the salary to be made up by the United Church.\n\nI have learned that all the furniture in the teacherage belonged to Miss Potter, and it seems that her sister when she went up to the funeral removed most of it. It is unfortunate that someone did not make her an offer for it and leave it in the house. Would the Department consider making a small grant for the purchase of a bed, a table and a few chairs, in order that Miss Pennington may carry on until such time as plans for moving the Indians are matured?

Barry,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nJ. D. Sutherland, Esq.,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDuring the month this office was shocked to hear of the sudden death of Miss Winnifred Potter, Missionary-teacher at Smiths Inlet. I received a communication from Dr. Barner previous to her death stating he had gone to Smiths Inlet and there found Miss Potter had been ill in bed for three weeks. He stated he was able to persuade her to return with him to the hospital at Bella Bella. In the passing of Miss Potter I would like to pay tribute to her memory. For many years she lived alone most of the time at the Smiths Inlet Mission, with no white person for many miles. It was a desolate and isolated location with no conveniences or home comforts and a great debt is due Miss Potter for her unfailing love and interest in the Indian people which prompted her to give her life to this work.\n\nI have recommended that the Smith Inlet Day School be closed permanently, and instructions have already been received from the Department to remove all Government property to Alert Bay for safe storage.\n\nM. S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 13, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, regarding the closing of the Smith Inlet Indian Day School, at Takush. I have noted your protest, on behalf of the United Church of Canada, as to the discontinuance of the teaching services at this point.\n\nMr. Agent Tedd, Alert Bay, was, upon receipt of your letter, wired and informed that he was to defer action in removing any government property to Alert Bay, as the matter of re-opening the school was receiving consideration.\n\nThe Department will have no objection to continuing payment of teacher's salary and furnishing the usual supplies, although the attendance hardly warrants the cost involved in payment of salary, fuel and classroom supplies. If the Church authorities will nominate the services of a teacher, the Department would be pleased to open the school and continue payment of salary, at the same rate as was previously allowed. I would therefore request that the Department be advised of the name and qualifications of the teacher nominated. The local Indian Agent will then be informed accordingly and requested to assist in any way he can in making the work as successful as possible.\n\nThe Department is unable to give any assurance as to when this group of Indians will be moved from Takush and settled elsewhere. The local Indian Agent has recommended that action along this line be taken in the establishment of the Indians at another point.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth J.

F. MacKENZIE.\n\nChg. Dept.\nI. A.\nNovember 5th,\n1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of November 5th, in which you announce the decision of the Department not to re-open the school at Takush. I think it might be well, before accepting Mr. Indian Agent Todd's advice too hastily, for the Department of Indian Affairs to recall the circumstances which led to the opening of this school. While it is true that the group of Indians is comparatively small, ten years ago they were as untouched by Christianity and almost as unchanged in their habits of life and thought as when the Pacific was discovered. In that decade, Miss Potter has worked a miracle in the village. The very fact that the Agent can state that he is able to get all the children to go to Residential School (a fact which remains to be proven) is an evidence of the influence she has exerted upon the people.\n\nAs a matter of fact, this school has been carried on at a minimum of expense to the Department of Indian Affairs, because during the whole period that it has been in operation, the major portion of Miss Potter's salary has been guaranteed and paid by The United Church of Canada; and the property which the Agent talks about moving consists of a few school desks and a little equipment in the way of maps, charts, &c., and is a bagatelle compared with the investment that we have in the building, residence, and furnishings.\n\nI would like to remind the Department of Indian Affairs that almost forty years ago the Methodist Church withdrew from a group of Indians at the head of Rivers Inlet on representations from Ottawa that the band was to be moved to a more suitable site, provided with houses for individual families in place of the long houses in which they were living, and given a school. Nothing has ever been done for them. They are as pagan to-day as they were a hundred years ago, - a disgrace to both the Government of Canada and the Church.\n\nWill the Department of Indian Affairs give us some assurance that they really intend to move this group of Indians from Takush and settle them somewhere else? I do not question Mr. Todd's sincerity, nor is there any possible argument in regard to the advisability of what he recommends. I am not so sure that he will get the official support that he must have in order to carry out his plan. In the meantime, we cannot help protesting against this sum-\nmary dismissal of a piece of co-operation, in which the Church, at least, has made such a large investment.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKJB.MLT\nAlert Bay, B. C.,\nNovember 4, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter No. 156-46-1 dated October 23rd, 1936 in connection with the recent death of Miss W. Potter, late missionary-teacher at Takush Indian village, Smiths Inlet, I beg to advise Miss Potter had not submitted any quarterly returns after March 31st, 1936. From my knowledge of the whereabouts of the Indians from that time, I do not believe many days of school were held during the following quarter, otherwise Miss Potter would have forwarded her quarterly returns in the regular way. However, this can only be determined by obtaining the school register which I will do at my earliest convenience.\n\nAs the Department boat is out of commission, it is difficult for me to get to Takush village as it is a long distance from here and necessitates crossing Queen Charlotte Sound which is always very treacherous at this time of year. However I am planning on making arrangements with the Rev. Peter Kelly of the United Church at Ocean Falls to meet me shortly if possible with a view to obtaining the information the Department requests as well as making arrangements for the safe storage of Departmental property located at the school. I am wiring the Department by night letter tonight requesting to know if they intend to continue this school at Takush. My own personal opinion is it would be unwise and would recommend that the Department close the school at this point and have all Government property put in storage for safe keeping at an early date. I am satisfied if it is left there with no one looking after it, it will soon be gone, and it is with this in mind I am communicating with Mr. Kelly to make some arrangements for the Government property and that belonging to the Church.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\n(M.

C.\nOttawa, November 5, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, regarding payment of the salary due to Miss Winnifred Potter as teacher of the Smith Inlet Indian Day School. The local Indian Agent will forward a statement showing the number of days Miss Potter taught since April first last. When we are definitely aware of the amount due, further consideration will be given to the manner in which the cheque covering the amount will be made payable. The matter will be taken up with the Treasury Branch, with a view to carrying out your suggestion, that the cheque be drawn in favour of the Treasurer of the United Church.\n\nA telegram was received this morning from Mr. Agent Todd, who recommends that the school be permanently closed, as the location is isolated, with no one now in charge. He states that the government property may be stolen or destroyed and it is urgent that it be removed to Alert Bay for safe storage.\n\nIn view of the attendance and the cost involved in the operation of the school, the Department considers that it will not be necessary to obtain the services of another teacher and that the school should be definitely closed. The Agent states that arrangements can be made to have the children at this point admitted to residential schools. Mr. Todd is being wired to have the government property safely stored.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth J.

H. S. TODD,\nINDIAN AGENT, ALERT BAY, B.C., DATED SEPTEMBER\n10, 1936, REGARDING THE SMITH'S INLET DAY SCHOOL.\n\nIn regard to the Smith's Inlet Day School, I wish to particularly mention this school is now conducted very unsatisfactorily. To date we have not received returns for the last quarter ended June 30th, and we are of the opinion this school should be closed entirely. If the Department would be good enough to look up the attendance report and cost which we have been put to for supplies and fuel allowance, I think they will agree with me it is not very satisfactory, and as there are very few Indians who remain there at any time, I would recommend to the Department that this school be closed and arrangements made for the children to be admitted to the residential school.\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nOctober 28th,\n1936.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nI am rather worried about your communication concerning the salary which may still be due to Miss Winnifred Potter. So far as I know, she died without a Will. If you make her cheque out to \"The Estate of Miss Winnifred Potter,\" it will mean a good deal of expense in getting it cashed\u2014probably almost as much as it is worth, according to our information. Would it not be possible to have it made out to \"The Treasurer of The United Church, for services rendered.\" If it is made out to the Treasurer of The United Church, we could easily have an affidavit signed, absolving the Department of Indian Affairs from any further responsibility and accepting the amount as a complete settlement of any amount due for Miss Potter's services.\n\nI am writing this to you personally, because I know something about the difficulties under which you work with the Treasury Board. I should hope, however, that the new man might be reasonable in regard to a difficult situation like this.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKJB.MT\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, October 23rd, 1936\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 8th instant, the Department has just been informed, by the Associate Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada of the death of Miss W. Potter.\n\nThe last payment made to Miss Potter was for the quarter ended March 31st, 1936.\n\nPlease let me know as soon as possible the number of days this school has been in operation since that time in order that the amount due may be paid to Miss Potter's Estate.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nM.S. Todd, Esq.\nIndian Agent\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nOttawa,-October 23rd, 1936\n\nReverend Sir,-\n\nThe Department regrets to learn from your letter of the 20th of the death of Miss W. Potter teacher of the Smith's Inlet day school.\n\nMiss Potter was allowed $4.00 a day for each day the school was in operation and the last payment made to her was for the quarter ended March 31st, 1936. Mr. Agent is being written in order to ascertain the number of days the school has been open since that date. When his reply cheque will be issued in favor of \"Estate of Miss Winnfrid Potter\" and will be sent to your office.\n\nRegarding the last paragraph of your letter the Department will await reply to our letter of the 20th instant before making a final decision.\n\nYours truly\n\nA.F. MacKenzie\nSecretary\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B.A.\nAssociate Secretary\nBoard of Home Missions\nUnited Church of Canada\n299 Queen St. West\nToronto, Ont.\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nOctober 20th,\n1936.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nIt is my sad duty to inform you that Miss Winnifred Potter, the teacher at Takush, died of cancer a few days ago in the Bella Bella Hospital. She had evidently been quite ill most of the summer but failed to report her illness to the doctor on the \"Thomas Crosby.\" Her real condition was discovered almost by accident. Dr. Barner made a special trip from the Hospital and took her back with him. She lived only three or four days, and during the greater part of the time after she arrived at the Hospital was unconscious.\n\nI am not sure whether or not the Department owed Miss Potter any money. If so, I wonder if it would be possible to have the cheque drawn in favor of the Board of Home Missions - or the Treasurer of the United Church. So far as we know, she has only one living relative - a sister, and our Superintendent in British Columbia will take responsibility for seeing that the money gets to her.\n\nI would like to know whether or not it is the wish of the Department that we should appoint another teacher to Takush on the same terms. You will remember that a few years ago we fixed up the school and the house, so that the living conditions are now very comfortable, except for the extreme isolation of the place. I am under the impression, however, that both Captain Barry and Mr. Indian Agent Todd have been rather dubious about the value of the school work there. It would look as if we have a chance at the present time to do either one of two things: abandon the village entirely, or send in a new teacher, with the understanding that between now and the end of June the whole situation is to be reviewed. It is our conviction that the latter course would be desirable. It would seem too bad to sacrifice the results of the seven or eight years of sacrificial service which Miss Potter gave to this group of very needy Indians.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKJB.MT\n\nKenneth J.

If Mr. Gillett can arrange this for me, and I would ask the Indian Affairs Branch to give him the necessary authority to co-operate with me in the inspection of this School, it will save the expense of chartering a special boat, which would cost between $100 and $200.\n\nIn conclusion, I may say that I have tentatively arranged for the inspection of Smith's Inlet Indian Day School during the week commencing June 6th; my time being very fully occupied until then.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H.

The Department trusts that you will give Inspector Barry every possible assistance. He has set the tentative date for the inspection of the Smith's Inlet School for the week commencing June 6th.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJas. Gillett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nREPORT ON KWANKEWLTH AGENCY FOR MONTH OF MARCH 1937.\n\nThe Smiths Inlet Day School - The Mission started at this point by the United Church of Canada several years ago later started a day school. The Department assisted them financially for the building and furniture, etc. School is held when two or three children are in the village and the Department pays the Missionary $4.00 per teaching day when school is held. I have reported adversely on the continuation of this school. I should like to see this tribe move to a more desirable location but so long as the Mission continues I am afraid the Indians will not wish to go elsewhere. Their living conditions are beyond description.\n\nGenerally speaking, the Indians of the agency are provided with adequate educational facilities. There are some small villages where no day school is available, but these children are placed in the Residential school with the exception of those who cannot pass the medical examination.\n\nI would like to say during the time I have been Agent I have noticed steady progress being made, and this is due to a great extent to the splendid co-operation between the teachers and the Department's school Inspector, Mr. Barry, who undoubtedly is an outstanding man in his profession.\n\nM. S. Todd.\nIndian Agent.\nThe day schools at Campbell River, Cape Mudge, and Alert Bay are in splendid shape and a real credit to the Department, while the Missionary schools at Village Island, Kingcome Inlet, Quatsino and Smiths Inlet which were built by various Missions with assistance from the Department are in fair state of repair, they are difficult to administrate. I feel the Department should own these schools and have full administrative powers as the buildings are on reserves. I would recommend if and when funds are available the Department should purchase any equity the Missions may have in these buildings to avoid any future complications which may arise between the Indians and interested parties.\n\nM.S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 20, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have just been advised by Indian Agent Todd that the teacher of the Smith Inlet Day School is ill and has been obliged to go to the hospital at Bella Bella.\n\nThe December quarter return received from this school shows that, during that quarter, there were only three children present. During the September quarter the names of five children were shown on the roll and the school was only open for six days.\n\nThe Indian Agent again strongly recommends the advisability of closing this school. In this connection I would refer you to official letter of November 5, 1936, addressed to Rev. K.J. Beaton, B.A., also to Mr. Beaton's letters of November 5th and December 7th, 1936.\n\nI would appreciate your reviewing the correspondence mentioned above and advising me whether or not you consider this school should be kept in operation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Dorey,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed please find Smiths Inlet Indian Day School Return.\n\nI have just been advised the Teacher is ill in Hospital at Bella Bella under the care of Dr. Darby. I am further advised no one is at the Mission in charge of the Government Property as her Sister accompanied her to Bella Bella.\n\nI am again strongly recommending to the Department the advisability of closing this school as I can see no reason for continuing same in view of the enclosed return.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S.

You will also please note the teacher reports in connection with Flora Walkus and Winnie Walkus that \"drunken home conditions are against them\".\n\nFor some considerable time I have recommended to the Department that this school be permanently closed. I can see no justification for keeping the school open, particularly when there are only three children going to school part time and with a condition in the village such as reported by Miss Pennington.\n\nTakush village is very isolated and there is no way in which proper supervision may be given it. The Provincial Police are located at Ocean Falls, and can only make the occasional visit there. I have been aware for a considerable time that much drinking has been going on amongst this band, and owing to my inability to give these Indians proper supervision I have suggested closing the school and moving the village elsewhere.\n\nThere is also enclosed a Requisition for School Material and I would kindly ask that this be held up until the Department decides what should be done in connection with this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOctober 22, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have recently had an opportunity to discuss with Capt. G.H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for B.C., and Mr. Indian Agent Todd the subject matter of your letter of September 28th.\n\nFollowing the inspection of the Takush School on May 30th, 1937, Capt. Barry reported as follows, \"From an educational point of view the paying of any sort of teacher here is a complete waste of money. I am forced to recommend that the school as such be closed at the end of June 1937 and not reopened.\" On receipt of this report I discussed the matter with Capt. Barry and concluded that an expenditure of any money on such a school, except possibly for a few school books to be used by the Missionaries could not be justified and in forwarding the report to the Department I concurred in the recommendations made therein. I should mention however, that Capt. Barry suggested that a fair degree of success might be achieved by the missionaries as welfare workers and that the Department might consider a small grant for this purpose. The Department, however, did not favorably entertain this suggestion. While in the north I met Capt. Barry by arrangement at Prince Rupert and, in view of the suggestions made in your letter, reviewed again the situation at Takush with him. The Inspector, however, could not for the reasons already stated and also that conditions had not changed at Takush, recommend that the school be continued.\n\nOn the 19th instant I met Mr. Todd at Alert Bay and also discussed the matter with him. Mr. Todd informed me that not more than two families were resident at Takush at the same time and then only for short periods. Further, that not more than four children were available to attend school and for a large part of the time the attendance would be down to two. Under these circumstances any social work would be so restricted that the grant suggested the Department should make could hardly be justified. I may say that I am inclined to agree with the views of the Agent in this respect.\n\nThe Department to my knowledge does not provide funds to carry out welfare work in the way suggested and I am satisfied would not consider the appointment of a field worker for such a small number of Indians. Should the Department have funds for social effort along the lines suggested we have other villages in the Province where the Indian Affairs Branch and the United Church could better establish such Welfare Missions.\n\nUnder the circumstances I regret I cannot recommend the grant suggested, but in order that the Department shall have an opportunity to consider the matter, I am forwarding to Mr. Hoey a copy of your letter to me of September 28th together with a copy of this letter for his information and whatever action the Branch wishes to take.\n\nRev.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have a letter from Miss Margaret Pennington, B.A., who has been in charge of the little mission at Takush in Mr. Todd's Agency. Miss Pennington has had a Gall Bladder operation but is recovering and hopes to be ready for service by the end of October; she wishes to know if the Government is willing to continue its grant for the support of that work on the same basis as previously, which grant has been supplemented by our Board of Home Missions. The Government grant has been based on $4.00 a day per teaching day, in addition to supplying the teacher with fuel, and the Board of Missions paid at the rate of $40 a month throughout the year and assisted the Government in furnishing the teacherage.\n\nWhile the report from the school would not seem to justify the continuance of that work because of the very low and irregular attendance at the school, nevertheless Miss Pennington has done a valuable piece of social service work in correcting irregular marriages and other unhealthy conditions in the community, the prevalent consumption of home brewed intoxicants, and we feel, at least I do personally, that that work should be continued until the amalgamation can be made between that small tribe and some other, preferably the O-we-kee-no tribe at the head of River's Inlet where there is a beautiful location for an Indian village with ample soil for gardens and a beautiful stream of pure water, whereas at Takush there is neither of these advantages. To close the school at Yakush and leave them at the mercy of human influences about them in the uninitiated would seem to be a very narrow-minded policy in dealing with the problem of the native people. It would save a small grant no doubt but at the same time it would result in the loss of the influence that we now have over this seriously decimated tribe of Indians who for many years were neglected by the Church if not the State.\n\nI should be glad of a reply from you indicating your recommendation in the matter.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nSSO/AM\n\n\"S.S.Osterhout.\"\n\nP.S. Your Inspector, Capt. Barry, intimated when in conversation with me on a former occasion that while the school itself does not justify the Government Grant made, nevertheless he would recommend a small sum say $250 or $300 for the service rendered by Miss Pennington, along moral and social lines.\n\nIf the grant is to be continued, Miss Pennington is anxious that some firewood should be provided at an early date as it is usually done earlier in the year than this.\nShe also complains about the condition of the cookstove, that it is rusted so badly that it is no longer usable for baking. I presume the lining of the oven has rusted out or the firebox burned out beyond her ability to repair.\nDear Sir:\n\nI should like to direct the attention of the Department to Captain Barry's Report of June 4th, 1937, on the Takush Indian Day School, Kwawkewlth Agency. In this report the Inspector definitely recommended the School be closed as such at the end of June, 1937, and not reopened.\n\nDr. S. S. Osterhout, Superintendent of Home and Indian Missions, Prince Rupert Presbytery, United Church of Canada, has written suggesting that the School be continued and that a small grant be provided to continue the social service work among the few Indians resident at Takush by Miss Pennington.\n\nIn order that the Department shall be familiar with the attitude of this Office with respect to the application for the continuation of the grant, I am forwarding herewith a copy of Dr. Osterhout's letter, together with a copy of my reply thereto.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

I note from the last paragraph of your letter of October 22 to Rev. S.S. Osterhout that the question of the amalgamation of the small Indian population at Takush with the O-we-kee-no or some other tribe is now under consideration. If it is likely that this amalgamation will be effected within the next year I do not consider that it would be advisable to interfere with the present arrangements. If, however, the date of the amalgamation is indefinite I am prepared to advise the Church authorities that we can no longer continue to make any payment at Smith Inlet.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

The matter might be reviewed at the end of June, 1939, but unless the Department can be assured that the attendance will be much larger than it is at present it will not be possible to allow any payment toward the salary of the teacher after that date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

I can only say that I concur most heartily in the conclusion to which your Department has come. As far as I am concerned, I do not expect that the matter will be reconsidered, unless, of course, it should happen that the school population increased.\n\nThis is a band of Indians which is exceedingly small, and just as backward and depraved, and I think that both the Department and the Church is wasting money there.\n\nThere are, however, one or two questions which emerge. The first is regarding the salvaging of certain buildings and equipment, which both the Department and the Church have at Smith's Inlet. The building is really a joint residence and school. I do not suppose that it can be moved. Would the Department consider the purchase of it from whatever funds are available, either of the Band or of the Department, in order to provide better housing, which is certainly needed by those people?\n\nThen, the desks and other property of the Department, and certain furniture which is the property of the Church, might be stored, or moved to some place where they would be of more service.\n\nIn that connection, may I ask if you have received a recommendation from the Commissioner in regard to opening a school at the head of Rivers Inlet? I understand that the Lumber Company has purchased standing timber from the Owe-kee-no Band and that as part of the purchase price they are going to erect a certain number of good houses. I am advised that it would be very much in the interests of these people if a teacher could be appointed. I think we should be prepared to co-operate with the Department if it saw its way clear to erect a school and contribute towards the salary of the teacher, as it has been doing at Smith's Inlet.\n\nPersonally, I think it would be a very much better investment of funds and of personnel. I shall be glad if you will let me know what the Commissioner has in mind for this tribe.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MLT\n\nIndian Affairs.

C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Hoey's letter of December 7th forwarding copy of Dr. Dorey's letter of December 2nd regarding the Takush Indian Day School. The Department's decision with respect to the continuation of this little school for the current academic year is noted.\n\nThe disposal of the equipment belonging to the Department at Takush was discussed with Capt. Barry, who recommends that this might well be moved to Alert Bay for use either in furnishing a second classroom, when this is authorized, or for use in any other school in the Kwawkewlth Agency where it may be required.\n\nIt is true that the Indians of the Owekano Band have arranged to use certain funds received from the sale of timber to build new houses on the Katit Reserve. The arrangements for this construction have been made with the Pacific Mills Limited but, owing to unforeseen circumstances, the work of clearing the land and the construction of the 8 new homes has been postponed until April when the Indians will be available and the weather more suitable to proceed with the work. The question of the erection of a new school at Katit Reserve has been discussed with Capt. Barry and Mr. Indian Agent Gillett, and it was agreed that in the event of the successful establishment of an Indian village at Katit, the matter of a new school could then be brought before the Department for consideration. It is my considered opinion that we would be well advised to await the completion of the proposed construction at Katit and the establishment of the Indian families in their new homes before taking any action with respect to the provision of a school.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 2, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo with reference to the Smith's Inlet Indian day school.\n\nWith reference to the second paragraph of your letter you may transfer the equipment at this school to any other school where you consider it could be used.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nOttawa, August 5th, 1939.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer you to my letter of February 2nd and previous correspondence in connection with the Smith's Inlet Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department has not made any payments of salary to the teacher of this school during the academic year which closed on June 30th, 1938. We have on file returns for the quarter ended March 31st and June 30th, 1938, but apparently have received no returns for the quarters ended September 30th and December 31st, 1938.\n\nPlease let me know if you consider that payment should be made to Miss Pennington for the period September 1st to December 31st, 1938. As soon as we hear from you we will be in a position to pay the amount of salary due her for the academic year 1938-39.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nAs instructed by the department, the Smiths Inlet Indian Say school was closed and I removed all the Government property from this school to the headquarters of the agency and placed it in storage in our warehouse here. This is now available for furnishing another teacherage and classroom, but as the Smiths Inlet School was only small, naturally there is not a large amount available.\n\nM.S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nYour File 156-46-1.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 5th instant re payment of salary to the teacher of Smith's Inlet Indian Day School, I enclose herewith a letter received from Mr. Indian Agent Todd on the subject which is self-explanatory.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

C.\n\nEnclosure\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nAugust 14, 1939.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter No. 15-6-878 of August 11th in connection with the Smiths Inlet Indian Day School, and in reply beg to advise you Miss Pennington did not return to Takush until the beginning of 1939.\n\nDuring the quarter ended March 31st, 1939, school was open 17 days, and during the quarter ended June 30th it was open 18 days, making a total of 35 days for which payment at the rate of $4.00 per teaching day amounting to $140.00 which the Department owe Miss Pennington.\n\nThese quarterly returns were sent to the Department immediately upon receipt, and I cannot understand why she was not paid for the quarter ending March 31st.\n\nIn connection with the school, a report will be made shortly as I have certain recommendations to submit to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S.

It will be noted that the attendance during that quarter was fourteen days, the explanation being given in the margin, so that if you will kindly send Miss Potter a cheque for $56.00 for the fourteen days, as my understanding is that the teacher there is paid at the rate of $4.00 per day for every day that the school is open. (File # 156/46/1)\n\n(August 9, 1928)\n\nI have had a letter from Miss Potter stating that she wanted some cash to pay for wood, but I told her that the account would have to be forwarded in the usual way. They only have a very irregular mail service there, so there will be considerable time both in getting the account from her and in getting the money back for the Indian who is getting the wood.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

We have had correspondence with Rev. Arthur Barner in connection with the establishment of this school, the engagement of the services of a teacher and the salary that would be allowed.\n\nMr. Barner informed the Department that Miss Winnifred Potter was engaged as teacher and we agreed to allow her salary at the rate of $4. per day for each day the school is in operation. This grant will be paid upon receipt of the usual quarterly returns showing the attendance and the number of days the school was open during the quarter. These returns should be forwarded through your office and certified by you. We note that Miss Potter is ready to proceed to the school, also, that the desks which were being transferred from the Alberni Indian Residential School have arrived and that, therefore, Miss Potter can commence teaching activities as soon as she reaches the school.\n\nWhen a requisition for school material is received, it will be given consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It is quite true that it is not her fault that school was not open some days, but the Indians were not there, and in my estimation, the zeal of the missionaries in establishing a school there outran their judgment. I visited Takush Harbor, where the school is situated, but as it was in the evening, no school was in session, but I saw the work that was being done by the children, and the progress was indeed wonderful.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

It now appears from a letter which Rev. Arthur Hamer, our Superintendent of Indian Missions, has received from Miss Potter that the Department has been sending cheques direct to the latter. Would you be good enough to let us have a statement of amount remitted to Miss Potter, so that we may be able to straighten out her salary account.\n\nI would suggest that future payments on account of the salary of the teacher of the Indian Day School at Tahush be sent to the Treasurer of The United Church of Canada, this being in conformity with the method adopted in other similar cases.\n\nYours most faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6415, File 846-3, part 1)\nOttawa, August 13th, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir,-\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 9th instant, it is regretted that, through oversight, payments made for the teaching services at the Smith's Inlet Indian Day School have been sent direct to the teacher instead of to your Treasurer.

She is a graduate of McGill University and holds a B.C. teacher's certificate. She worked at one time under Dr. G. H. Raley at Coqualeetza, who recommends her highly. She has a sister who is willing to accompany her to the Reserve so that she may not be too lonely.\n\nMiss Pennington will be allowed salary at the rate of $4 a teaching day, and the Board of Home Missions is arranging to have her at Smith's Inlet in time to reopen the school on January 4, 1937. Please inform the Indians at once that school will be open on that date and give Miss Pennington every assistance in her work.\n\nI enclose Staff Questionnaire which you should have Miss Pennington complete and return as soon as she begins duties.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

S.S. Osterhout, Superintendent of Home and Indian Missions, Vancouver, an itemized list of the articles so purchased, which amounts to $45.75.\n\nWe are enclosing herewith a voucher covering same, and would appreciate if you would kindly have a cheque made out in the name of Miss Potter, (sister of the late teacher), and forwarded in care of Rev. S.S. Osterhout, 411 Dominion Bank Building, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S. Tedd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nSeptember 11th, 1935.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL:\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT some years ago in cooperation with the United Church of Canada, the Department of Indian Affairs renovated a school building and teachers' quarters, the property of the said church, at Smith Inlet in the province of British Columbia;\n\nTHAT the buildings are no longer required for school purposes and a recommendation has been received from the Indian Commissioner for that Province to the effect that the Department reimburse the United Church of Canada to the extent of One Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($150.00) in payment of their equity therein;\n\nTHAT the said Commissioner has also recommended that these buildings be placed at the disposal of Chief George Wallis and another destitute Indian family for residential purposes;\n\nTHAT it is the opinion of the Officers of the Indian Affairs Branch that the proposal should be adopted, and that the price quoted is fair and just.\n\nTHE UNDERSIGNED, therefore, recommends that authority be granted to make payment of the sum of One Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($150.00) to the United Church of Canada, Vancouver, B.C., from Vote number One Hundred and Sixty-one (161) on receipt from that institution of an unconditional surrender of any right, title or equity which they may hold in the buildings hereinbefore described.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith an application by Mr. Indian Agent Todd of the Kwawkewlth Agency for authority to offer $150.00 to the United Church for their equity in the Indian Day School and teacherage at Smith's Inlet, and turn them over to two homeless Indians of the Kwashela Band, the expenditure to be a charge against the housing appropriation, Vote No.75.\n\nI would recommend approval of the application and that Mr. Todd be authorized to negotiate with the Church authorities to purchase their equity at a cost not exceeding $150.00.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nAugust 26, 1939.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs instructed in your letter of February 11th last, No. 15-6-7924, I proceeded to Smiths Inlet Indian Day School at the end of the current school year and removed all the Government property to the warehouse at the Agency, Alert Bay.\n\nIt was necessary to pay freight on these goods from Margaret Bay to Bone Bay; this I paid for out of my Travelling Expense Account and put through Voucher No.123 in favour of myself covering this amount. A complete inventory of everything in the school was made, including all school supplies and equipment as well as the furniture, etc., in the teacherage. There was a small amount of drugs on hand and as the teacher had left previous to my arrival, it was not considered safe that certain of these drugs be left in the teacherage, and anything which might be used by the Indians detrimental to their health was destroyed, as it was not considered worth while moving these small quantities in a few bottles.\n\nAnything that was safe to leave in the teacherage and which could be used again was left there and the key to the teacherage was turned over to the Rev. Peter Kelly of the United Church Mission Boat \"Thomas Crosby\", who is keeping same until he can remove certain articles belonging to the Church and the building is disposed of.\n\nSince the school has been closed I have had some correspondence with the Rev. W.P. Bunt, B.A., B.D., Superintendent of Missions for the United Church at Vancouver at the request of the Rev. Peter Kelly with a view to disposing of the Church's equity in the school and teacherage at Smiths Inlet. Mr. Bunt has informed me he is under the impression the United Church of Canada would accept $150.00 for their equity in the buildings rather than try and tear them down and move them elsewhere.\n\nAs the Department are aware, the teacherage was built some years ago jointly by the Department and the Church, and in my opinion the value of the buildings at the present time would be upwards of $700.00, particularly as the freight costs so much as they are located in such an isolated place. The Church has spent quite a lot of money at different times which the Department know nothing about, and now that they are willing to accept $150.00 cash for their equity rather than attempt to move it away, I would recommend that the Department pay the United Church of Canada the amount of $150.00 for their equity, and the funds to be taken from the \"Housing Appropriation\" as allotted to this Agency.\n\nInsofar as the Department's equity is concerned, I would recommend that they transfer it to Chief George Walkus of the Kwashela Band to be used for a home for his family. In this connection I would like to point out the Chief's home was burned about a year ago and he is badly in need of a residence.\nFor the Department's information, the teacherage and school are joined together but are in reality two separate buildings, and it is my intention that the school should be given to another Indian family who have no home, with the understanding that they move it on to another lot in the village site.\n\nI hope the Department will agree to this arrangement as it will permit me to help these Indians who have no homes to live in. If the Department approves of this, would you kindly forward me a cheque in the amount of $150.00 so that I may conclude the deal with the United Church of Canada, and at the same time advise me if you are prepared to release the Department's equity in favour of the Indians of the Kwashela Band to be used for housing accommodation. An early reply would be appreciated.\n\nIn regard to the equipment, it is my intention to use all the school supplies that are suitable for the second classroom which we are now establishing at Alert Bay. The furniture for the teacherage is being kept intact for the moment but it is possible some of it can be used elsewhere, but before doing anything the Department will be consulted further.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa, September 12th, 1939.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\n- Deputy Minister -\n\nAttached hereto is a memorandum to the Council requesting authority to purchase from the United Church of Canada their equity in the school building and tenchorage at British Islet, B.C. for the sum of $150.00. These buildings are to be used for the purpose of housing two homeless Indian families.\n\nThe school has been abandoned because of the small attendance. Mr. H.M. Todd, Indian Agent of Nanaimo estimates the present value of the buildings at $700.00, and states that the United Church will dispose of them for $150.00. Mr. D. H. Smith, Indian Commissioner of British Columbia recommends that these buildings be purchased and be made available to house two destitute Indian families.\n\nThe school and tenchorage are in good repair and would make very comfortable living quarters which could only be replaced at a cost much in excess of $150.00. An Order in Council is required to enable us to make this purchase. I would therefore recommend that the Minister's signature be obtained.\n\nDirector of Indian Affairs.\n\nJ.B.H.\nSeptember 12th, 1939.\n\nThe school and teacherage at Nattika Inlet, B.C., which is owned by the United Church of Canada has been abandoned at the end of the last school term, because of the small attendance. These buildings were built by the United Church of Canada.\n\nIn the summer of 1938 the Department of Indian Affairs agreed in conjunction with the United Church to remove the buildings on a fifty-fifty basis, the Department's share not to exceed $500.00. The total cost of these alterations amounted to $600.00. However, the Department paid no more than the agreed amount of $500.00. Since then the sum of $100.00 has been expended in further repairs. The present valuation of these buildings estimated by our Indian Agent is $700.00.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner of British Columbia recommends that the buildings be purchased from the United Church of Canada at a cost of $150.00 and that they be made available to homeless Indian families and charged against our Housing Appropriation.\n\nThe accompanying memorandum to the Council recommends that authority be granted to purchase the equity of the United Church for the stated sum of $150.00.\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Treasury Board, approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the\n\nMINES AND RESOURCES\n\nThe Board had under consideration a memorandum from the Honourable the Minister of Mines and Resources reporting:\n\n\"That some years ago in co-operation with the United Church of Canada, the Department of Indian Affairs renovated a school building and teacherage, the property of the said church, at Smiths Inlet in the province of British Columbia;\n\nThat the buildings are no longer required for school purposes and a recommendation has been received from the Indian Commissioner for the Province to the effect that the Department reimburse the United Church of Canada to the extent of One Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($150.00) in payment of their equity therein;\n\nThat the said Commissioner has also recommended that these buildings be placed at the disposal of Chief George Walkus and another destitute Indian family for residential purposes;\n\nThat it is the opinion of the Officers of the Indian Affairs Branch that the proposal should be adopted, and that the price quoted is fair and just.\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, recommends that authority be granted to make payment of the sum of One Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($150.00) to the United Church of Canada, Vancouver, B.C., from Vote number One Hundred and Sixty-one (161) on receipt from that institution of an unconditional surrender of any right, title or equity which they may hold in the buildings hereinbefore described.\"\n\nThe Board concur in the above report and recommendation, and submit the same for favourable consideration.\n\nAsst.

Quigley of Extension Rd. She is a qualified teacher by the Board of Education, Whitehall, London, England and has taught with success for 5 years in the Senior Department of All Saints' School, Barton-upon-Twistle, Eccles, near Manchester.\n\nThat Miss Rose A. Quigley has proved to be an efficient teacher and has given complete satisfaction to the school board in England may be seen from the enclosed copies of certificates given to her by the Rev. Jno. A. Carson Burke of Tolington, Blackburn, England and William C. Wade Esq., Head Master of All Saints' School Barton upon Twistle near Manchester.\nAlthough she has never taught Indian children, her qualifications and her experience as teacher in England will recommend her for this new position.\n\nIn view of these facts I beg to apply through your agency to the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa for the appointment of Miss Rose A. O'neill as teacher of the Squamish day school at Esquimalt B.C.; and that a salary of $50 per month be granted to her\u2014a salary which, as I understand, the Department at Ottawa is ready to pay to a good teacher such as her.\n\nUpon investigation I find that the number of children of school age on the Squamish and Esquimalt Reserves amount to 30, of which number twenty at least will attend regularly.\n\nHoping that this application will find your favorable consideration,\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nW.

It will be noted the applicant has no experience teaching Indian children.\n\nThe number of children of the Esquimalt and Songhees Reserves given by Father Piesser as thirty includes eight or nine children whose parents are working for Indians of the Songhees Band and should not be counted as likely to attend regularly as they may return to their own reserves at any time.

But as I have received no acknowledgment of the letter, I am afraid that it has gone astray, especially as I know that you were very prompt in all such matters. I therefore renew my application via that in view of the good work done by Miss Dugley at the Douglas school, her salary be raised to $600 a year i.e. $500 a month for the straight twelve months.

I believe that the change to a male teacher may possibly bring about a better attendance, not because Mrs Weber has not been most successful with the Indian children, but I believe the novelty would appeal to them.

C.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI am pleased to inform you that Miss Florence Geohegan, 527 Constance Ave, Esquimalt, began teaching at the Songhees school, last Monday and to date the attendance has been satisfactory. Thirteen pupils have been attending and I think that Miss Geohegan will do very well. Mrs R. P. Weber, the late teacher has been very kind and went to the school with her on Monday last to get her into the run of things.\n\nHoping this is satisfactory and with best wishes.\n\nI remain,\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n(Rev. John F. Silver.)\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to mine of the 15th, inst., File No.642-0-2, I now beg to enclose herewith copy of a letter dated the 15th, instant, from Reverend John F. Silver, of Esquimalt, commenting on the favorable start that had been made by Miss Geohegan, as teacher of the Songhees School.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n1343 Esquimalt Rd.\nEsquimalt, B. C. Feb. 6, 1920.\n\nMr. W. R. Robertson,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B. C.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of Feb. 4th, 8-P-2, with reference to Miss Geohegan's appointment to the Songhees School. She understands that her appointment is only temporary, but she is doing very well, and it would be too bad to replace her just now. She is not altogether without qualifications, as her course of studies in England, qualified her as an assistant Teacher there.\n\nThe attendance still keeps up, she likes her work, and the children like her. However, in accordance with your request, I will make an effort to obtain a fully qualified teacher, but as you say this will be difficult to do, at the salary offered. I have spoken to two, since the appointment of Miss Geohegan and both of them turned the proposition down. Should I find one, it is doubtful whether he or she would hold the position permanently. There is danger of them giving it up as soon as something better turned up, which would be bad for the children and for the school.\n\nPersonally I would recommend that no change be made at least for this quarter, and if by that time, her (Miss Geohegan's) success is not satisfactory, then somebody will have to be gotten. At any rate three months gives her a chance to show what she can do. If she makes good, then I think the Department will confirm her permanently. I would therefore ask you to report to the Department.\n\n1. That she is not entirely without qualification.\n2. That at the present she is doing very well.\n3. The difficulty of obtaining a fully qualified teacher just now at the salary offered.\n4. Give her a trial for the quarter.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nI remain,\nSincerely yours,\n(Signed) John F. Silver.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith copy of letter dated the 6th, of February last, from the Rev. Father Silver, Missionary in charge of the Songhees and Esquimalt Indians, in regard to appointment of Miss F. Geoghegan, as teacher pro tem to the Songhees day school.\n\nI may say that we find it difficult to obtain a suitable teacher with a Provincial certificate to take charge of this school for the salary offered, but in consideration of the improved attendance during the last quarter, for which much credit is due to Miss Geoghegan's efforts and interest taken in the pupils, I will recommend that her appointment be made permanent.\n\nIt will be noted in Father Silver's letter that she is not without qualification as a teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 12, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, enclosing copy of a communication from Miss Josephine Hindle, teacher of the Songhees Indian Day School, in which she applies for six months' leave of absence, as from February 1st, next.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of Miss Hindle being granted the leave of absence requested by her. It is noted that you have discussed this matter with Mr. Inspector Barry and that he has a substitute teacher to carry on the work during the absence of Miss Hindle. I would request that you forward the name, qualifications, etc., of the substitute teacher. Salary will be allowed the substitute at the same rate as was paid Miss Hindle, viz., $80 per teaching month. Miss Hindle should prepare a report covering the attendance and days taught by her during the current month and forward same through your office, when payment will be made of the salary due her up to the date she begins her leave of absence. It is hoped that the substitute teacher will be engaged in time to take charge on February 1st, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\nJanuary 4th, 1932.\n\nSir-\n\nI herewith beg to enclose copy of a letter just received from Miss Hindle, teacher of the Songhees Indian Day School, applying for six months leave of absence, due to bereavement in the family.\n\nI would very much like to recommend that this be granted, as Miss Hindle has done very faithful work for the past 6 years, and is very much respected by the Indians.\n\nI have spoken to Mr. School Inspector Barry, about this and he agrees with me that she should be given leave of absence, and he has a suitable substitute to put in her place for the time being.\n\nTrusting that the Department will give this very favorable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n(Copy)\n\nCraigflower P. O.\nVictoria, B.

Finley,\nSept. of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter of February 13th last requested me to advise you if I attended the summer school classes. I fully intended to attend this year had the classes been held here in Victoria. Instead, the School was in Vancouver and I found it would have been expensive and inconvenient for me.\n\nI regret to say I missed this primary course but under present circumstances I was unable to attend.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Miss) Josephine Hindle.\n\nTeacher,\nSonghees Indian Day School\nOttawa, February 13, 1931.\n\nMadam:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the report of Mr. Gerald H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools, regarding his visit to the Songhees Indian Day School on the 6th instant.\n\nThe Department trusts that you will carry out any suggestions made to you by Mr. Barry regarding teaching methods. It is noted from this report that Mr. Barry urged you to take a primary course at the Provincial Summer School. The Department believes that this course would be of considerable assistance to you and, by way of encouragement, I wish to advise that, provided you take this course during the summer of 1931, the Department will be prepared to increase your salary to $85 a teaching month from September 1st, next. Please advise me if you take this course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Josephine Hindle,\nTeacher,\nSonghees Indian Day School,\nCraigflower P.O., B.C.\nOttawa, January 13th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that upon the recommendation of Mr. Inspector Cairns it has been decided to increase the salary of Miss Josephine Hindle, teacher of the Songhees Indian Day School, from $750, the present rate allowed her, to $800 for the ten teaching months in the year. This increase will date from April 1st, 1926. Please inform the teacher accordingly. We are corresponding with Mr. Inspector Cairns relative to this increase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

This will make her salary at the rate of $800 for the ten teaching months in the year. Mr. Agent Lomas has been informed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

This will bring her more in line with the other day schools of the Agency.\"\nOttawa, February 28, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to inform you that on the recommendation of Rev. Father Silver, Esquimalt, B.C., and Mr. Agent Lomas, Duncan, B.C., we have approved of the appointment of Miss Josephine Hindle as teacher of the Songhees Indian Day School to succeed Miss Florence Geoghegan, who resigned December 31st, last.\n\nMiss Hindle has no professional qualifications but has had some previous experience as teacher in the Province of Nova Scotia. The agent has been informed that her retention in the position will depend upon the success with which she meets in the work. Salary allowed her will be at the rate of $600.00 per annum, supplemented by any bonus provided by law.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\n\nRev. R. H. Cairns,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRoom 42, Post Office Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa, February 28, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from Rev. John F. Silver, Esquimalt, nominating Miss Josephine Hindle for the position as teacher at the Songhees Indian Day School to succeed Miss Florence Geoghegan, who resigned December 31st, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is considered that the qualifications which Miss Hindle possesses will be satisfactory and the Department will approve of her appointment. Her retention in the position, however, will depend upon the success with which she meets in the work.\n\nThe salary allowed Miss Hindle will be at the rate of $600.00 per annum, supplemented by any bonus provided by law. You should inform Rev. Father Silver accordingly, and he should arrange to have Miss Hindle take up duties as soon as possible. You will be good enough to inform the Department of the date on which she begins duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nAlfred H. Lomas, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan,\nB.C.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of December 16th, last, in regard to the Songhees Indian Day School, I now beg to enclose for your consideration copy of letter to-day received from Rev. John F. Silver, of St. Joseph's Church, Naquimalt, asking that Miss Josephine Hindle be appointed in place of Miss Geoghegan resigned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Alfred H. Lomas)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSt. Joseph's Church,\nEsquimalt, B. C.\nFeb. 26th, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Lomas:\n\nIn accordance with my promise to you, I have been looking for a teacher who would be willing to take over the duties of teacher to the Songhees Indian school, on April 1st, and after diligent search I am of the opinion that Miss Josephine Hindle, at present living in Victoria, would prove the most satisfactory. While Miss Hindle does not actually hold a teacher's certificate, she could I am sure obtain one without much difficulty. She has completed three years of High School work in the Province of Nova Scotia and on many occasions filled in at the schools in Halifax for Teachers who were off for one reason or another. She is well acquainted with the work that is required at the Songhees school, as often during Miss Geoghegan's term, she went down to the school with her, and saw that was being done. She is acquainted with the children, knows where they live, etc., which to my mind is of great help to the teacher. I would therefore respectfully submit the name of Miss Hindle to you, and if you think fit ask you to recommend her to the Indian Department at Ottawa. If you will send any information to Miss Hindle to my address, I will see that it reaches her. She is a clever girl and I feel that she will make good.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(Rev.) John F. Silver,\n1343 Esquimalt Rd.\nESQUIMALT, B.

The Inspector further recommends that the school remain closed during the months of January, February and March, next.\n\nI have to request that you will obtain the written resignation of Miss Geoghan and forward the same to the Department. You should also take up with the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church the matter of securing the services of a properly qualified teacher to begin duties on the first of April, next. The name, qualifications and experience of any teacher nominated by the Church authorities should be forwarded for the consideration of the Department. During the above mentioned three months the school may remain closed. The salary that we would allow would depend upon the qualifications of the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

She holds a Second Class B.C. Certificate (Interim). She is also in possession of Summer School Certificates for Primary Work, and for Writing, obtained in 1930; and Art, and Indian & Rural Problems obtained at the last Provincial Summer School held this year.\n\nHer experience has been as a substitute teacher in the schools of the Saanich Municipality, and for the past five months as substitute teacher in the Songhees Indian Day School. During her time in the last school she has brought the children on well, and very much improved the general standing of the school. I have no hesitation in recommending her permanent appointment at a salary of $80.00 per teaching month - less 10% for the current financial year, and with $2.50 per teaching month for janitor work.\n\nYou will see from the attached that the question of this girl's appointment has been taken up with the representative of the Right Reverend Gerald Murray, Bishop of Victoria, in whose diocese the Songhees School is located. The Catholic Church authorities are well satisfied with my selection of this girl as successor to Miss Hindle who has resigned, and I have to request that you will forward this letter and the attached correspondence to the Department of Indian Affairs in Ottawa for final approval.\n\nWith reference to the last three paragraphs of the letter from the Bishop of Victoria, and to Departmental letter 164-10-1 dated January 14, 1932, the last paragraph, I wish to draw the attention of the Department to the fact that there are THREE Catholic Dioceses in British Columbia. I know that in the case of vacant teaching positions in the Catholic Indian Schools in Bishop Murray's Diocese, he would like to be consulted after I have made a tentative selection. I am perfectly certain that the same is true with regard to Bishop Bunoaz. I am informed that it is unlikely that Archbishop Duke would wish to interfere in any way with one of the other Catholic Bishops, though he would like to be consulted with regard to appointments in his Diocese.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H.

I understand that the teacher has obtained a leave of absence and that a substitute has been appointed for six months. I might have a very desirable candidate to suggest before the Summer is out, in case the teacher determines not to return. What I am is that you let me know some time before a permanent appointment is contemplated.\n\nWith every kind wish for your good health and happiness\n\nSincerely yours\n\nA. G.

Murray,  \nBishop's House,  \nVictoria, B.C.\n\nMy Lord:\n\nOn the 3rd of February last you requested Mr. Indian Commissioner Ditchburn to give you the opportunity of talking over the matter of the appointment of a teacher at the Songhees Indian Day School previous to the making of a permanent appointment at that point.\n\nIn accordance with your request I am forwarding a copy of correspondence received this morning from the Indian Agent at Duncan with regard to this matter. These letters will explain themselves.\n\nAs you know I am very anxious that we should have a good teacher at this school. The present teacher, Miss Burt, has been substituting during Miss Hindle's absence, and has improved the general standing of the school very greatly. She was appointed in the first instance on the recommendation of her local Priest, Father Woods, and after reference from this office to the Department of Education. I am very much in favour of retaining Miss Burt's services; but previous to recommending this to the Department of Indian Affairs wish to have your views on the matter. Possibly you would care to talk the matter over. If this is so please let me know when I may have the pleasure of calling at Bishop's House.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H. Parry,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF INSPECTOR G. H. BARRY ON HIS\nINSPECTION OF THE SONGHEES INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\nDate of Inspection April 7, 1936.\n\nName of Teacher: Miss Margaret Burt Age 26\n\nMiss Burt was trained at the Victoria Normal School. She holds a B.C. Class Certificate. She also holds a number of certificates from the Provincial Summer School, Victoria. These include Primary Work and two for Indian and Rural Work. She is in her fifth year here. She has had no other experience with the exception of some substitute work in Saanich.\n\nMiss Burt has a good manner with the children. She is certainly very much liked by her pupils. Her attitude towards her work is very good. I have previously reported that Miss Burt is a little weak in the actual presentation of the lesson, in that the aim is not clear enough, and more or less left to chance. Miss Burt taught a lesson in elementary Number Work for me during the present inspection. This lesson was well presented, the Blackboard being particularly well used. She is doing as well now as she is likely to do. I have suggested that she attend the Provincial Summer School again this year, taking Primary Work and some such course as Technique of Teaching.\n\nThe teacher's control of the children is a little weak. She has improved in lesson technique since my last visit.\n\nI am sorry that I am unable to sum up the work being done here as better than when I last inspected just six months ago. The school may be said to be doing fairly satisfactory work in an elementary sort of way. Its general standing may be classed as \"Fairly Satisfactory\".\n\nI am not very satisfied with the work being done at this school, though I know that Miss Burt is doing her best to get the children on. The B.C. Achievement Test results in themselves show very weak teaching.\n\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF INSPECTOR BARRY DATED APRIL 9th, 1936, ACCOMPANYING THE ABOVE REPORT.\n\nThe Department had requested an inspection of this school near to May 1st. I am leaving for Bella Coola and Prince Rupert on April 18th on the close of the Easter vacation. The best possible date as far as the teacher and school was concerned was the one chosen at the very end of the Christmas to Easter period and before the children went on vacation.\n\nThe teacher is a nice girl who is doing her best. Her control is very weak. I have done everything in my power to make her into a successful teacher, but she has not been much of a success here lately. Mr. Indian Agent Graham and I have talked over this matter dozens of times, and the teacher has received every encouragement and advice from us. The attached is the best possible report I could write on the school, and I am just leaving it to the officials at Ottawa. I do not wish to recommend that a new teacher be employed.\nIndian Agent\nDept of Indian Affairs\nFurness B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI hereby make application to rent the day school field on Comoxheo Indian Reserve for the season 1938.

Arrangements have been made with the teacher, to leave all the land she needs for the children to play on, and a cross fence is to be erected.\n\nI might say that Mrs Bell took good care of the grounds last year, and kept the grass cut around the school, so as to eliminate the risk of the grass catching fire, as the grass dries up so quickly it is a tremendous fire hazard, especially as there is no water on the ground.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

Graham,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn June I sent an application for the position of teacher in the Longhees Day School at Esquimalt for the coming school year. I wish to say further that I am now attending Summer School in Victoria, taking a course in Primary Work and one in Industrial Arts, both of which should be a great aid in making my teaching more interesting and more effective during the coming year.\n\nAfter much thought on the reason for the falling-off in the quality of my work during the past ten months, I realize that it might be due to two reasons. Firstly, that I had less interest in the Indians after being with them for five years.\nthan I did at first. But this seems impossible, as I have taken a more personal interest in them as the years have gone by, and I have become more fully acquainted with the Indian natures. In secondly, that without being conscious of it, my interests were too much outside of the school. In the event of this being the reason, I am quite willing to forego other activities and confine myself strictly to educational.\n\nI would greatly appreciate another chance to prove myself, and if, at the end of the coming school year my work should still be unsatisfactory, I would be quite willing to give up teaching in the Indian schools.\n\nYours respectfully,\nCatherine B. Morry.\nOttawa, July 29th, 1936.\n\nDear Madam,-\n\nThe Deputy Provincial Secretary of Nova Scotia has advised us regarding your letter to him in connection with the address of Miss J. M. Hindle.\n\nMiss Hindle was employed as teacher of the Songhees Indian Day School, near Victoria. She gave up duties at the end of June, 1932. In August, 1932, Mr. H. Graham, Indian Agent, Duncan, B. C., advised the Department that he had received a letter from Miss Hindle, dated at Halifax, N. S., stating that she would not return to take charge of the Songhees School in September. Since that time, the Department has no information regarding Miss Hindle's address but it is possible that, if you wrote Mr. Graham, he might have the information.\n\nThe stamped envelope which you forwarded is enclosed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

Caldwell, who requested that arrangements be made in regard to appointing another teacher to take charge at Songhees at the commencement of the fall term.\n\nInspector Barry is anxious that nothing beyond accepting Miss Hughes' resignation be done at the present time, as he expects it will be possible to fill satisfactorily the position left vacant at the Songhees School by the transfer of another teacher.\n\nCapt. Barry feels that it would be well to delay action in regard to the appointment or transfer of Catholic teachers until he has had an opportunity to discuss the whole matter with His Excellency Archbishop Duke. In conclusion, I may say that Archbishop Duke and Bishop Cody, of Victoria, are at present in Quebec attending the Eucharistic Conference but, that on their return, I shall be in a position to make recommendations to the Department with regard to the appointment and transfer of several teachers working in Indian Day Schools under the auspices of the Catholic Church.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nB.M.

Her present address is 1124 May St., Victoria B.C. She holds a second class permanent but will have a first shortly having only one more subject to write off. I have discussed the matter with Captain Barry and he believes my choice is excellent so I trust Miss Keeble will soon be notified of her appointment. If you wish details of her references, same can be supplied at once.\n\nIn regard to the appointment of a nurse for the West Coast where as I explained there is extreme need for a good one, I have as yet not heard from Dr McQuarrie and would therefore be pleased if you would again remind him to pay me a call at his earliest convenience.\n\nWith best regards I remain\n\nYours in Christ,\n\n+ John Eddy\n\nP.S. - I did not think much of Mr Conway's appointment to the new consolidated school but think it best to offer no objection now particularly as he is not the principal type.\nOttawa,\nNovember 24, 1939.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Bishop Cody:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 21st instant Indian Commissioner MacKay is being informed by air mail letter today that the Department approves the appointment of Miss Katherine Keeble as teacher of the Songhees Indian day school. This appointment is being made on the understanding that Miss Hepworth is being married and will give up duties at the end of December. I may say that we have no formal notice of this action on her part as yet although Inspector Barry mentioned it in his last report on the school. However, in view of your letter there is no doubt that Miss Hepworth intends to resign.\n\nWhile we did consider appointing Mr. Conway at the new Cowichan school the matter was reconsidered recently and Indian Commissioner MacKay was instructed last week to advise Mr. Conway that his services would not be required after the end of December. At the same time the Commissioner was instructed to consult the Church authorities with a view to securing a qualified male teacher to teach vocational training to the boys and to assist in other ways around the school such as supervising the boys' play etc.\n\nI am extremely sorry that Dr. McQuarrie has not yet had an opportunity of visiting you but I intend to speak to the Superintendent of Medical Services again today with a view to having him write to Dr. McQuarrie again.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRt.

In the event of Miss Hepworth intending to leave the school at the end of the current quarter the Department approves the appointment of Miss Katherine Keeble at a salary of $80.00 a teaching month.

Miss Keeble, however, failed to act in time, therefore expects to lose one day's pay.\n\nHad I known in time I should have been prepared to recommend to the Department that Miss Keeble be given permission to attend the Eucharistic Congress at Courtenay and I would ask that this be taken into consideration by the Department in deciding whether or not she should lose a day's pay.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSonghees Indian Day School\n\nThis school was last inspected by me on April 11th 1940, when there were 12 children on the school roll. Sixteen children were present on that occasion.\n\nThe school building belongs to the Department.\n\nThe present teacher is Miss Katherine M. Keeble age 32. This teacher has had successful Provincial school experience. The progress of the children has been satisfactory though when the teacher understands Indian schools better the progress will no doubt be much more rapid.\n\n| Average Quarterly Attendance |\n|-----------------------------|\n| 1935-36 | 1936-37 | 1937-38 | 1938-39 | 1939-40 |\n| September | 8.8 | 9.8 | 10.7 | 10.2 | 13.5 |\n| December | 7.9 | 7.9 | 10.2 | 18.7 | 16.0 |\n| March | 9.5 | 5.2 | 6.7 | 15.4 | 15.1 |\n| June | 6.8 | 6.4 | 6.1 | 10.0 | |\n\nSome of the Indians are absent in the hop fields in September and fruit picking in June.\n\nIn my Survey of Small Indian Day Schools dated January 6th 1940 my report on this school will be found on Page 4. I there suggested that it might not be in the best interests of the Indians to close the school in either September or June. Now that it has been decided to close the school in September, it would appear foolish to keep it open in June when there are even fewer pupils than in September.\n\nUnder present regulations the Songhees Indian Day School will reopen on October 1st 1940. I would recommend that the academic year here be one of eight months, from October 1st to May 31st yearly.\n\nReport dated July 8/40\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I enclose copy of a letter addressed to Indian Commissioner MacKay approving this increase.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith an application from Miss Keeble teacher at the Songhees Indian Day School for an increase in salary together with a letter from Mr. Indian Agent Moore, and also a letter from His Excellency Bishop Cody of Victoria in support of this request.\n\nMiss Keeble is regarded as one of the best qualified teachers we have and is well worthy of having her salary brought up to what the Department pays in other Indian Day Schools in this Province. The salary being paid at Tsartlip and also at the Saanich Indian Day School is $90.00 per month and there could hardly be any justification for paying Miss Keeble less than this amount.\n\nMiss Keeble's work has been very satisfactory and we could ill afford to lose her services at this time. I have no hesitation in recommending that she be paid $90.00 per month plus bonus as from April 1st.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. H. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.

Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Moore,\n\nWhen I accepted the position in Jan. 1942 as teacher of the Longhills School, I understood that, due to my inexperience in Indian school teaching, my salary was to be $80 per month for ten months. The previous teacher had been receiving $90 per month for ten months.\n\nI was led to understand that, if I kept up the attendance etc., I should receive a raise. This I have not received, and instead of 10 months work I am allowed only 8 months work.\n\nI have now been at this\nschool two years and feel that a raise is forthcoming especially in view of the fact that I do not get the regular teaching time and also the time I have to teach small a new term.\n\nPrevious to accepting this school I had taught one ten years in the local provincial ungraded schools. I would be very grateful if you could help me in this matter.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Miss) Katherine W. Kuhle.\nDuncan, B. C.,\nApril 2, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to attach herewith for your consideration a letter, in duplicate, received from Miss Keeble, teacher of Songhees Indian Day School, wherein she asks for a raise in salary; also a copy of a letter, in duplicate, in this regard which I received from His Excellency Bishop J. C. Cody.\n\nI would recommend that this request be given favourable consideration as, in my opinion, Miss Keeble is an efficient teacher and has made good progress in the Songhees School.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(R.

Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B. C.\n\nDear Friend:\n\nThis is to draw your attention to a matter pertaining to the Indian School on the Songhees Reserve. So far as I can judge, Miss K. Keeble has obtained better results there than any previous teacher but as she gets only eighty dollars a month for eight months she is finding it so difficult to get along on $640.00 a year that I fear we are going to lose her valuable services unless we can obtain $100 a month for eight months without the cost of living bonus or $90.00 a month with it. I should not like to see her leave at this time when it is particularly difficult to get a good teacher and when her increasing experience with Indian children is enhancing her services to all concerned. Please use your good offices to see what can be done in the matter and oblige.\n\nYours in Christ,\n\nJohn C. Cody\nBishop of Victoria\nOttawa, March 24, 1942.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter dated March 9, 1942, concerning the computation of your salary.

Barton, which will be self explanatory.\n\nIn this regard I might say that Miss Blue has been far from well all winter, but managed to stick it out at school when most girls would have been off on sick leave. Her condition is not serious at all and with a good rest it is quite likely that she will be fully recovered. You will please remember that Miss Blue taught all through the summer holidays last year, which was really too much for her although she didn't realise it at the time. After the Songhees school closed for the summer she went to Christie School and taught there until Sept. 1st. last.\n\nI would recommend that Miss Blue be given the time off she asks for, to take effect from the end of the Easter holidays up to May 8th, which would be three weeks, plus the week's holidays she will have at Easter. I would also like to recommend that the Department pay the salary of the girl Miss Blue mentions, Miss Neave, in her letter, if not for the full period of three weeks then for whatever length of time the Department regulations permit the salary of the substitute. I do not intend by this that Miss Blue's salary should be cut off, as she is really off on sick leave for three weeks and is entitled to her salary for that time, I think.\n\n(R.H.

Because I am very interested in my present position I hope I shall be able to take a month's rest, then come back and carry on teaching here.\n\nEverything favourable I should like to leave as soon as possible. Realizing the difficulty in obtaining a substitute for a full month, I thought perhaps if I could find someone to substitute for me either two and a half weeks immediately preceding, or the two weeks following Easter, it might be easier managed that way.\n\nAt present I have in mind a normalite, Betty Neave, Miss Neave resides at Loretto Hall and has already spoken to her teacher, Dr. Anderson in connection with substituting for me. At present she is ill with flu. Should be recovered soon, perhaps she will be allowed to begin March the twentieth.\n\nIf this arrangement is satisfactory, please advise what a substitute should receive daily.\n\nAny aid you will be able to give me in arranging to have a month's rest, will be very gratefully appreciated.\n\nYesterday we began the Home Nursing Course. Counting the older girls, twenty-six ladies were present. We hope to have a better turn out at the meeting next Tuesday. However it was a very successful beginning.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(\u201csigned\u201d) Bertha Blue.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nYour File 162-21-1\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of April 18th, approving of three weeks' sick leave for Miss Blue of the Songhees School and authorizing the employment of a substitute teacher during her absence.\n\nThe following list of forms in connection with the employment of Miss Mary Domitilla Francis as substitute teacher are attached hereto:\n\nQuestionnaire, in duplicate.\nT.

As the inspector has certified in his report on her work during the period when she was replacing Miss Blue, there can be no doubt that by her intelligence, enthusiasm, cheerfulness and discipline she gets excellent results all along the line.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n-KT\nMarch 22, 1948.\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTo: The Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nFrom: The District School Inspector.\n\nRe: Songhees Indian Day School\n\nFollowing complaints received by Mr. Indian Agent Moore from parents on the Songhees Reserve concerning the lengthy visits of Father Bradley at the above mentioned school, I called on Bishop Hill in Victoria on March 4th and discussed the matter with him. Previous to my visit to His Excellency I called at the Songhees School and examined the register which indicated that the Reverend Father Bradley called at the School on the following dates: January 30, February 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 20th, 24th, 25th, 26th and March 2nd. The register showed that Father Bradley had remained at the school for an hour and one half on February 24th, one half hour on February 25th, one hour and twenty minutes on February 26th and one hour and one half on March 2nd. The length of his visits on the other occasions was not given. The register also indicated that previous to the month of February Father Bradley had visited the school occasionally. Bishop Hill felt the visits of Father Bradley could be less concentrated and said that he would take the matter up and I considered at the time that the matter was satisfactorily concluded.\n\nHowever, Mr. Indian Agent Moore has forwarded to me a copy of the minutes of the Songhees Band meeting held on March 4th from which I quote: \"The teaching of religious Instruction in the Songhees Indian Day School was the subject of discussion by the meeting. The members felt that this Instruction should be limited to the time authorized by the Department and no longer. At present, the Priest calls during school hours and takes the pupils from the class to teach Catechism. It was explained, by the Chief, that the teacher had little or no control over the actions of the Priest and could not, very well, refuse the pupils leaving the class-room to receive Religious Instruction. After considerable talk it was suggested by the Council that a School Board of three members be appointed, which might be of assistance to the teacher in this regard, as well as on other school matters. The agent explained that they must understand that any board elected would have to be approved by the Department which would, no doubt, set out its functions and duties. It was, eventually, decided to nominate three members -- the result of which follows:\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6416, file 847-1, part 1)\n1) Richard Albany\u2014proposed by Chief Percy B. Ross and seconded by Austin Albany.\n\n2) Mrs. Sam Joseph\u2014proposed by George Cooper and seconded by Arthur Albany.\n\n3) Johnny Albany\u2014proposed by Sam Joseph and seconded by Frank George.\n\nIt will noted that this meeting was held prior to my visit to Bishop Hill and it is assumed that the matter has been satisfactorily settled.\n\nHowever, the Band is apparently requesting permission for the formation of a school board of three members to assist the teacher on school matters. Although such a board with limited powers might be advisable at a later date it is felt that in view of the recent dissatisfaction it would only lead to further trouble and it is recommended that if the Department is requested to give permission to form such a board that approval should not be given at the present time.\n\nR.F.

School Inspector.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Songhees Indian Day School\n\nI am enclosing for your information a copy of School Inspector Davey's memorandum of March 22nd regarding the time devoted to religious instruction at the above mentioned school in the past.

You are also aware that the Department of Justice ruled that under the present Indian Act, there was no provision for the establishment of Indian School Boards; therefore, it is not possible to recognize the so-called School Board as elected by the Songhees Council.\n\nBernard F.

The furnace supplies hot air to the schoolroom. There are two toilets with regard to which I have previously reported on a number of occasions. These are being kept in a much better condition. The reason that they require such consistent attention is that there are no dug out pits here. The receptacles are made of galvanized metal and are in fact small round bath tubs. They rest on the cement floor of the toilets. The Department will easily understand why I have asked that they be emptied regularly. I would recommend that these toilet receptacles be emptied ONCE A MONTH during the ten teaching months that the school is in session, AND THAT NOT MORE THAN $2.00 BE PAID MONTHLY FOR THIS SERVICE TO THE INDIAN WHO DOES THE WORK, the contents of the receptacles to be buried in a pit to be dug at a place satisfactory to the Indian Agent. There has been a certain amount of correspondence between the Department and the Indian Agent, Mr. Graham, with regard to this matter. I would ask that such correspondence be reviewed in the light of this report and recommendation, and the necessary authority and instructions issued to Mr. Indian Agent Graham. The $10.00 might well be taken from the fees allowed for Janitor Service to the teacher if there are no other funds available, but this girl could not do the necessary work of course.\n\nThere is a broken gutter in front of the school which certainly needs attention this summer. The buildings belong to the Department. They require painting as soon as there are funds for such purposes. Part of the walls of the schoolroom need kalsomining. The ceiling does not.\nOttawa, May 30, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Barry, in a report on his recent inspection of the Songhees Indian Day School, has drawn attention to the need of the receptacles in the toilets being regularly cleaned out. He recommends that these toilet receptacles be emptied once each month during the ten teaching months that the school is in operation during the year and that not more than One Dollar ($1.00) be paid monthly for this service to the Indian who does the work. The Department will approve of you arranging with an Indian to empty the receptacles in the toilets at least once each month during the next school year. You may forward certified vouchers, in triplicate, at the end of each quarter, for the amount due the Indian who performs this service.\n\nThe Inspector states, further, that there is a broken gutter in front of the school, which needs attention. You may have the necessary repairs carried out, keeping the cost as low as possible.\n\nMr. Barry states, also, that part of the walls of the schoolroom need kalsomining. If this would not involve much expense, the Department will approve of you arranging to have the work done during the coming summer holidays.\n\nYou should forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of repairing the gutter and kalsomining the walls, only, of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Box 5,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe attached application from Indian Agent Graham, for authority to expend $30.00 on a stove for the Songhees Indian Day School, is recommended for favorable consideration.\n\nIt is very doubtful if a furnace should have been installed in this school, which is a one-room building and could be adequately heated by box or drum type of heater. The alternative would be to repair the furnace, which would cost considerably more and would not be as economical on fuel as the type of heater commonly used in the one-room Public Day Schools and some of our Indian Day Schools in this Province.\n\nCapt. G. H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for B.C., is absent on inspection duties, and his recommendation in this matter has, therefore, not been secured. I am reasonably satisfied, however, that he would approve of the purchase of a suitable stove for heating the Songhees Indian Day School instead of repairing the furnace unit now in need of extensive overhaul and repair.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

R. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan's Station, B.C.\nOttawa, October 5, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo in which you advise the Department that the Songhees Indians have voted an expenditure of $2500.00 from their funds for the purpose of erecting a building on the new reserve suitable for school and Church purposes.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department appreciates the attitude of the Indians towards the education of their children and would like to see an up-to-date school with modern improvements erected on the reserve. The sum of money voted by the Indians would be ample to erect a building which would provide accommodation for all the children who at any time should attend, but such a building would not be suitable for church purposes, where it is presumed that accommodation would be needed for at least 75, which is about 50 per cent of the total population. For school purposes I may say that there should be provision in the building building for 250 cubic feet of air space for each child and 16 square feet of floor space and it is thought that accommodation for at least twenty children should be provided.\n\nHaving the above facts in view the Department would like you to confer with the Indians and give this matter further consideration, at the same time stating what kind\n\nW. R. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan's Station, B.C.\nkind of building you think should be erected. I may say that the Department has a plan of a modern building heated with a furnace and with a ventilation system installed which would accommodate 25 pupils and can be erected for about the sum voted by the Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to make application in behalf of the Songhees band of Indians for authority to withdraw the sum of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2500.00) from their funds at credit Account No.51 for the purpose of erecting a building on their new Reserve suitable for a school and Roman Catholic Church.\n\nAt a meeting of the Songhees Indians held on their new reserve at Esquimalt on the 1st, inst., in the presence of Mr. Inspector Bitchburn and Indian Agent Robertson, as Secretary, the following Indians were present, namely,- Chief Michael Cooper; William Robert; Alex Quilquicum; Hoqualook; Sam Quilemule; Jimmy Freezie; Charley Gunion; Charley Karmin; Walter Joseph; Jimmy Gabriel; Jack Tschish; Johnny Albany; Dick Quilquicum; Hibben; Antoine; Johnny Silva; Daniel Joseph; total 17, and being a majority of the band of the full age of 21 years, of the male members.\n\nIt was unanimously resolved that the Indian Department be asked to allow the withdrawal of the sum of two thousand five hundred dollars from their funds at Credit Account No.51 to erect a building suitable for school and Roman Catholic Church on their new reserve.\n\nI will submit the above for the consideration of the Department.\n\nIn the\n\nJ. D. McLean Esq.,\nAss. Deputy & Secretary of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nIn the near future a further sum will be asked for to install water to their new houses, and as nearly all the houses have toilets there will be required about twenty five services, but at present it cannot be stated definitely what this cost will be, as soon as it is known an application will be made to cover expenses of the water supply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa 11th December, 1897.\n\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo enclosing a requisition from Mr. Knappock, Teacher of the Day School on the Songhees Reserve, for stove pipes and other articles required; and in reply I have to inform you that these may be supplied at a cost not exceeding that estimated viz:- $9.25.

Nothing has been heard from you since that time. This is an important matter and the Department desires to take action and have the building erected during the coming summer.\n\nIn official letter to you of October 5th, last, it was stated that a school to accommodate twenty-five pupils, heated with a furnace and with a ventilation system could be erected for about the sum voted by the Indians, viz.- $2500.00. It is thought that, owing to the general advance in the prices of material and labour, this sum might be increased to at least $3,000.

After a discussion by the Council, they decided not to spend as much as $3000.00 on a building to be used as a school only, and thought $1000.00 would pay for a building suitable for this purpose, but they would agree to spend $3000.00 for a Roman Catholic Church and school combined.\n\nIf the Department will send me the plan of the modern building mentioned in your letter dated October 5th, 1911, it might be satisfactory to the Indians and be used also for a Church.\n\nI will wait for plan you have on hand.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nOttawa, Aug. 14, 1912.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nNo school has as yet been erected on the new Songhees Reserve, although the Department has been in communication with the Agent since October of last year. The Indians voted the sum of $2500.00 from their funds for the purpose of erecting a building to be used for school and church purposes. The Department did not look with favour upon the erection of a building for the joint purpose in so much as church accommodation would have to be provided for about 75 people and accommodation for 20 would be ample for school purposes. The matter was again taken up with the Indians with a view to having them come to a decision. The Agent after considerable delay has again reported, stating that the Indians are willing to spend $3000.00 for a Roman Catholic Church and school combined, but for a building to be used for school purposes only they think $1000.00 would be sufficient.\n\nThe residences erected on this reserve are modern and\nand the school-house should be in keeping with them. We have plans of a school-house for 25 or 30 pupils which would be appropriate for this reserve and the erection of a building according to these plans would cost about $3,000.00.\n\nI would recommend that the Department put up the school-house and obtain the authority of His Royal Highness the Governor General In Council to take sufficient funds from the capital of the band to meet the cost of construction. It may be remarked here that these Indians had a good school on the old reserve and they individually obtained the benefit from the money which was received from the sale of the building. I think, therefore, on this account and the need that there is for adequate school accommodation that it would be quite proper to take this course. This is now their second year on the new reserve and during this time the children have been deprived of education.\nOttawa, August 19, 1912.\n\nHis Royal Highness\n\nThe Governor General in Council.\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report that it is desirable in the interests of the Indians on the new Songhees Reserve, British Columbia, to erect a school building for the accommodation of the Indian children, and the Department has had plans of a school building prepared to accommodate 25 or 30 pupils at an estimated cost of $3000.00.\n\nThe undersigned would, therefore, recommend that authority be given for the expenditure of this sum from the Capital funds of the Band (which amounts to $10324.46) in accordance with the provisions of the 59th Section of the Indian Act.\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nNo school has as yet been erected on the new Songhees reserve, although the Department has been in communication with the Agent in the matter since October last year. The Indians voted the sum of $2500.00 from their funds for the purpose of erecting a building to be used for school and church purposes. The Department, however, did not look with favour upon the erection of a building for the joint purpose, as church accommodation would have to be provided for about 75 people, and accommodation for 20 would be ample for school purposes. The matter was again taken up with the Indians with a view of having them come to a decision. The Agent after considerable delay again reported that the Indians were willing to spend $3000.00 for a Roman Catholic church and school combined, but for a building for school purposes only they considered $1000.00 would be sufficient.\n\nThe residences erected on the new reserve are modern and the school-house should be in keeping with them. Plans have accordingly been prepared for a school-house to accommodate 25 or 30 pupils at an estimated cost of $3000.00.\n\nSection 89 of the Indian Act provides that money can be taken from the Capital funds of a band with the sanction of the Governor in Council without the consent of the band.\n\nActing D.S.G.I.A.\nOn a Memorandum dated 19th August, 1912, from the Acting Superintendent General of Indian Affairs submitting, that it is desirable in the interests of the Indians on the new Songhees Reserve, British Columbia, to erect a school building for the accommodation of the Indian children, and the Department of Indian Affairs has had plans of a school building prepared to accommodate 25 or 30 pupils at an estimated cost of $3,000.00.\n\nThe Minister, therefore, recommends that authority be given for the expenditure of this sum from the capital funds of the Band, (which amounts to $10824.46) in accordance with the provisions of the 89th Section of the Indian Act.\n\nThe Committee submit the same for approval.\n\n[Signature]\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\n\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nOFFICE OF THE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL,\nOTTAWA: September 23, 1912.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nThe advertisement in connection with\nthe school-house to be erected on the Songhees reserve\nmay be inserted in the following papers:\n\nThe Vancouver Province,\nThe Victoria Colonist,\nThe Nanaimo Free Press,\nThe New Westminster Columbian.\n\nD.

I have to ask you, therefore, to ascertain the date so that you may visit the reserve with him and lay out the site for the school.\n\nThe site should be high and dry and easily drained and there should be sufficient land in connection therewith for a school garden, should it be decided to conduct one at a later date. The area should not be less than one acre.\n\nPending the appointment of a permanent inspector the Department would like you to visit the work after it is started at least once each week until such time as you receive further word. It is desirable that the foundation walls, which are to be of cement in the proportions of one cement, three of sand and four of gravel instead of stone, as specified, should be well constructed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

You were asked to return these plans to the Department immediately after November 12th and on the 6th of December you were again written to and asked to return them.\n\nThe Department is in need of these plans and it is hoped that it will not be necessary to again ask you to return them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

C.\nFeb. 21, 1913.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nKindly inform me if I can add the following extras to the present specifications of the proposed school on the Songhees Reserve, Esquimalt, B. C.\n\n**WEPPING DRAINS**\n\nI notice no mention of tile weeping drains around the exterior walls of building. Taking into consideration the position of school and the nature of the soil, I think it will be very difficult to keep a dry basement without a weeping drain laid lower than the basement floor. The approximate cost would be $25.\n\n**WATER**\n\nTo run a water supply from the main to the school-house. This is essential, both for toilets and wash basin or sink. The approximate cost would be $30.\n\n**WATER CLOSETS, etc.**\n\nI notice on the plans two (2) water closets crossed off, unless these closets are included, I am afraid it will tend to very unsatisfactory sanitary conditions; but if the water closets are included, I would suggest that the position shown on the plans should be changed so as to keep the plumbing work a little closer and thereby curtail the cost of the same.\n\nThere is no sewer drain in the neighborhood, so if we install the closet fixtures, we will also have to build a septic tank, the approximate cost of fixtures, tank, etc. would be $300.\n\n**WASH-BASIN OR SINK.**\n\nI would recommend a wash-basin or sink in basement for the\nprocuring of water for school purposes (washing hands, etc)\n\nI think a sink would meet the requirements better than a wash-basin. The approximate cost would be $40.88\n\nLIGHT\n\nThere is no provision for electric light, neither is there any electric power in the neighborhood at the present time, though the service of the City of Victoria runs close to the school property, and service may be given at any time to the immediate vicinity.\n\nI would suggest that the school should be wired in readiness to receive the above service, also that by wiring the school new all wires could be concealed in walls, partition, etc.\n\nThe approximate cost would be $150.00\n\nYours obediently,\n\nMr. A. Lockley\nInspector\n\nBox 33 Beaumont P.O.\nVictoria B.C.\nOttawa, March 5, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that on the same date the Department wrote you advising that the contractor had been authorized to substitute cement for stone in the foundation of the Songhees school building.\n\nOn February 3rd the contractor wrote asking permission to put a door into the basement from the outside. This letter was inadvertently overlooked. The price quoted for the door, frame, hardware and labour was $16.00. The Department considers that it would be advisable to have this entrance made and if not too late you may see that this extra work is performed.\n\nWith regard to extras no expenditure should be incurred without the permission of the Department, unless in very minor matters where delay, owing to the distance, would inconvenience the work and then changes should only be made with your approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

I found the contractor working on the concrete walls and foundations.\n\nI asked him the reasons why he was putting in concrete in place of stone, as shown on plans; he said he had received permission from the Department at Ottawa, to make the change. The contractor also informs me, that he has applied for permission to make an extra door-way leading to basement from outside.\n\nThe above items are what have taken place before I took over the inspectorship; I have since notified the contractor that any alterations he wishes to make, must be made through me, as it will be less trouble for the Department, and will also keep me in closer touch with any alteration that may be made, and of course I will sanction no alteration or extra without a written order from the Department.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nM.

In reply beg to say that you may have the tile drains laid, and also have water brought into the school-house, and have a sink installed in the basement. The cost in such case should be kept within your estimates.\n\nThis plan was prepared for schools where there was no room for outdoor closets. It is considered that outdoor closets would be preferable at Songhees. You may submit an estimate of cost of two suitable closets with screened approaches. These closets should be constructed so that the boxes can be removed from the rear to be cleaned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. Lockley, Esq.,\nBox 33,\nBeaumont P. O.,\nVictoria, B. C.\nCorrespondence\n\nVictoria, B.C.\nMarch 7, 1913.\n\nMr. J. Robinson,\nContractor,\nEsquimalt, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nKindly note the following in connection with the school house, now under construction on the Songhees Indian Reserve.\n\nBASEMENT WALLS:\n\nI notice the basement walls are not the specified thickness, viz.: 16 inches, but measure about 14 inches at the bottom with a batter to 10\u00bd\" at the top; if the walls contain the specified parts of one of cement, three of sand, and four of gravel, I am well satisfied that we have ample strength to carry the school above; but some consideration must be given to the fact that you have made a considerable saving in varying the thickness of the wall from the thickness shown on plans (Sheet No. 4 transversal Section) to the present thickness. May I suggest that instead of deducting any money from you on account of the above deviation that you should provide and fix at all eaves of main roof, porches, etc., a stock moulded 4\" x 4\" for gutter with galvanized iron conducting pipes connecting gutters with tile weeping drains.\n\nYou must also excavate as specified around all the ex\nterior of outside walls so as to allow room for thick coating of asphalt cement or roofing pitch, and do not fill in the excavated parts until I have examined the walls below grade level.\n\nBASEMENT WINDOWS.\n\nRemove the basement window frames already in position, and cut out opening in concrete walls large enough to take in new frames of sizes and design shown in detail drawings given to you today by me.\n\nWINDOWS IN CLASS ROOM, etc.\n\nThe windows for class room, etc., which you have under construction at your workshop, are not what are called for in specifications; not only are they made from the wrong material, but are badly constructed, and are not box frames, as called for. I will give you a detail of these windows as soon as possible.\n\nMORTAR.\n\nKindly have the mortar for brick-work in chimneys, piers, etc., run as soon as possible, so as not to delay the building of the same (note the specified time for the mortar to be before using).\n\nIf there is anything else you require any detail for, let me know as early as possible, so that I can have them ready for you without delaying the work.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nInspector.\nOttawa, Ontario, March 31, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 20th instant I beg to say that it is not considered necessary for the Department to furnish details for this small day school. Your suggestion, therefore, to furnish them is approved. The Department would be pleased to have a copy of these details at your convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

The school is so small, that the work would be hampered if I had to wait until I received details from the Department at Ottawa. The details required are very few, and if it is satisfactory to the Department, I would rather furnish them free of cost than have to wait of them coming all the way from Ottawa. I have an extra copy of each detail that I will send to the Department, so that the Department will see the class of work going in the school.\n\nKindly let me know if this is satisfactory, and oblige,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nMr. A.

I condemned the basement windows entirely, on account of them being one foot smaller than shown on plans, and being very badly constructed. I furnished the Contractor with blue printed details of frames and sashes required for basement. He has now got them on the job, but they are not yet in position. I visited the workshop of the Contractor to inspect the main windows, which he had under construction. I am sorry to say that I had to condemn them entirely, both sashes and frames. I then furnished him with blue printed details of main windows and inside trim. The Contractor has sent my details to a well-known factory in Victoria, who will now make the main window frames and sashes for the same.\n\nI paid a visit to the above factory yesterday, and found them assembling the frames together. The material and workmanship being first class. I have not yet sent an official progress certificate to the Department, as I do not want the Contractor to receive a payment until I have his signature to several suggestions I have made to him. Also the price of his contract with an itemized list that he allowed for each branch.\nof trade, such as painting, plastering, carpenter, etc.\n\nEnclosed please find correspondence between me and Contractor.\n\nYours obediently?\n\nMr. A.

I have received nothing but his total contract price, so you can clearly see that to make out my certificates, I have to measure all the material on the job, and keep an approximate time sheet of the men he has on the job. To further complicate matters, Mr. Robinson had to go to the Hospital, and after he came out he was too sick to attend business, and again this week he has returned to the Hos-\npital, and has undergone a serious operation. He has no office, or clerk or books, whereby I could derive any information from, but as soon as I am able to see Mr. Robinson, I will straighten these matters out.\n\nIn the amount of labor and material on the job, I have been careful to keep below the actual cost, also, as you will notice, I have given him less than 90% of the cost.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nMr. A.

I also notified him weeks ago to have the window frames painted (as per specification) but they are not painted yet. Will you see to this at once; also that the roof is creosoted before the shingles all get curled with the sun.\n\nI beg to draw your attention to the time the work has been in progress, also to the \"Progress of Work\" clause in the specifications, which will have to be enforced if better progress is not made with the work. Your foreman asked me today for the blue-prints of the dry closets; they are useless to him until I have got a figure from you as to the cost, and then I will have to submit your price to the Department.\n\nIf there is anything else I can help you in, by giving\nyou details or selecting material etc., let me know and I will do all in my power to help you to rush the work to completion.\n\nYou must also give me the names and addresses of all sub-contractors, so that I can get in touch with them, as your foreman claims that they are holding the work back, which to some extent is true, but I want to see where the fault lies, as on no account can we have any more delay.\n\nKindly instruct your painter to make me samples of colors for approval, viz: light cream for body, reddish brown for the trim, and a light green for the sashes. This is of course for exterior work. The roof to be as specified.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMr. A. Lockley,\nInspector.\n\nP.S.

C., as I am having considerable difficulty in getting the work completed. I have warned the Contractor time after time, and drawn his attention to the progress of work clause, but all to no purpose. I allowed him to stop the work for a few days on account of sickness, but since his recovery, he has done very little to complete the work.\n\nThere is not more than two (2) or three (3) weeks work to do to complete the school, if only the contractor would get reasonable strength of men on to do it, but before I take extreme measures to make the contractor come to time I would like to know what the agreement was between the Contractor and the Department when the contract was let to him; if there was no time limit in the agreement, I am afraid we will have to rely on the \"Progress of Work\" clause in the Specifications.\n\nEnclosed you will a copy of correspondence between me\nand the Contractor on this matter which was sent by registered mail.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nMr. A.

C.\n\nThe School-house is now completed and ready for the opening (with the exception of the furnishing and dry closets, which are mentioned in another letter).\n\nI have had considerable trouble getting the work completed according to the Plans and Specifications, and to my own satisfaction. The contractor Mr. J. Robinson has been in hospital twice during the construction of the school, but even when he was well and able to attend his business, he displayed very little interest in the work. From the very beginning of the work to the completion, I have had reason to make him take out bad work; all the window frames and door frames have been taken out and re-made and re-fixed twice, also the steps (back and front; also back porch).\n\nWhen I saw it was impossible to make him complete the work in a given time, I took what I thought was the next best step in the interest of your Department, and that was to compel him to do the work in the best possible manner.\n\nI am straightening out one or two small claims for\nextras with Mr. Robinson, and when complete, I will send the final certificate to your Department.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nMr. A.

Kindly let me know which one is satisfactory to the Department. Your Department will notice a big difference between the enclosed prices, and the one submitted by Mr. J.

Clarke & Stewart, and Messrs. Anthes-Tait.\n\nFor 2 only, school desks No.2, and 4 only, rear sections No.3, plus Sales Tax and f.o.b. Victoria, the following would appear to be the competitive bids:\n\nMessrs. Clarke & Stewart $41.02\nMessrs. Anthes-Tait $40.92\nMr. Cline $39.74\n\nIt should be noted that the tender of Mr. Cline is the lowest by a small margin but the desks are not the Crown school desks quoted on by the other firms, though Globe desks may be considered just as satisfactory and well up to Government standard.\n\nIt is, of course, quite immaterial to me which firm receives the order, though I should point out that for a number of years Crown desks have been supplied to our schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald H.

I asked the Teacher about it & how it happened and when, and she replied that one of the girls accidently put her elbow through it when getting out of her seat at her desk just the day or so before and that as she was expecting me to call she did not write. As the term was finished two days later, I considered it better to have the glass put it right away rather than apply to the Department for the necessary authority, as the resulting delay might mean further damage or even entry into the school by unauthorized persons. There was no one on the reserve who could put in a pane of glass that size and so I had to have it put in by glazer.\n\nTrusting that my action in this matter will be approved,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\n(R.H.

In view of the limited supply of suitable stoves available, it might be difficult to get one at $45.00. I would recommend approval of the application if funds can be provided. Please let me have a reply by airmail.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nKT\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nDuncan, B.C.\nOctober 15th, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring a recent visit to the Songhees Indian Day School, I found it full to overflowing with eight pupils there more than we have desks. The increase in attendance at that school can be explained by the fact that so many of the Indians from other reserves are working in the shipyards in Victoria and residing on the Songhees Reserve, the result being that their children attend the Songhees School. It will be necessary to get another 8 medium sized desks and I would recommend that we take them from the Saanich School where we have about 10 desks too many for the number of children we have attending, or are liable to attend for some years to come. If authority is granted to move these desks I can have them taken in by the East Saanich Freight Service and delivered to the Songhees School, at an approximate cost of $5.00.\n\nWith the extra desks required for the Songhees School it will naturally mean more crowding and this will mean that we will have to procure the Circulatory Heater which we have spoken about on several occasions for use in this school. By using a heater of this type it will mean that the pupils can sit much closer to it than they can to the ordinary stove which is at present in use, without fear of getting overheated or burned. The greatest advantage however is the fact that the heat is circulated around the room evenly. I would recommend that the necessary authority be granted for this heater at an approximate cost of $45.00.\n\nI would also recommend that the present stove be used in the basement of the school which will have to be used for the boys doing their manual training work. Your early approval for the above services will be appreciated.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(R.H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\n\nD.M. Mackay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nP.O.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, enclosing letter from Indian Agent Moore requesting authority to expend $146.00 for the construction of cupboards and a manual training bench for the Songhees Indian Day School. The amount requested appears large, especially in view of the fact that the quarterly return shows only 12 boys enrolled. The oldest of these is 13 and consequently, in view of their age, very little manual training could be given. The return also shows that there are only 2 girls over 14 years of age. All the others are much younger and have not yet completed Grade 4. Taking everything into consideration, the Department does not see any necessity for spending the amount of money mentioned at the present time. If a small cupboard is needed for the books it should be possible to either build or purchase this for $25.00 to $35.00.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith application received from Mr. Indian Agent Moore for authority to expend $146.00 for the construction of cupboards and a manual training bench for the Songhees Indian Day School, these being necessitated by the considerably increased attendance due to an influx of Indians to the neighbourhood of the Reserve as ship yard workers during the present emergency.\n\nIf funds could be provided for the purpose, I would recommend approval of the application subject to some revision of the construction of the manual training bench, as I consider that two 6 ft benches would be preferable to a 12 ft. bench placed against the wall as intended by the Agent.\n\nKT\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nIndian Commissioner for B. C. P. O. Box. 70. Vancouver, B. C.\n\nPlease refer to your letter above noted and previous correspondence regarding cupboards and work bench for the Songhees Indian Day School.\n\nSince Mr Coleman's inspection of this school on February 10th, last when the matter of these cupboards was brought to his attention, I have not been informed whether or not there is any chance of them being supplied, and as the Teacher is continually asking me if I have heard anything about them, I would be obliged for any information you may be able to give me regarding same.\n\n(R.H.Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nDuncan, B. C.\nNovember 18th, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn response to your above noted letter I beg to submit herewith a sketch of the three cupboards asked for, for the Songhees Indian Day School, which I trust are satisfactory.\n\nRegarding your remarks and suggestions dealing with the type of work bench required in this school, I feel that for the use this bench will be put to in this school the kind asked for in my previous letter will be more suitable. We have also got to take into consideration available room which will not permit benches sitting in the middle of the floor or away from one wall.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[R.H.Moore]\nIndian Agent.\n\nD.M.

Wilkinson\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to the matter of increased attendance at the Songhees Indian Bay School, I wish to advise that to make room for the extra desks it will be necessary to move a make-shift work bench fastened on the south wall of the school and used by the boys for manual training and wood carving.\n\nIt is planned to have a new work bench put up in the basement of the school along one of the walls and below a window which the boys can use for their manual training work; this will be much better than having them do this work in the school room. A new bench will have to be provided, made out of three 2\"X12\"X12' planks plus the material for the stand or legs. A cupboard will also have to be provided in the basement to hold the tools and manual training supplies, and also some general supplies which are piled in corners and on the floor at present.\n\nThen in the school room itself, we will also require two cupboards to store school supplies, and books. At the present time these supplies are piled in the east end of the building where the church altar is, not under lock or key and a temptation to anyone who is subject to lifting things.\n\nThese improvements have been talked about for the past two years, but on account of the war I felt that we could get along for the time being. Now, however, with the increased attendance it has put an entirely different light on the question and something must be done to protect our own supplies and give additional accommodation. I got an estimate of the cost of all (3) cupboards, and work bench complete and installed amounting to $46.00. I would advise that authority for this be granted, and recommend that the work as outlined be approved.\n\nP.M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nP. O. Box. 70.\nVancouver, B.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, enclosing letter from Indian Agent Moore recommending the installation of flush toilets at the Songhees Indian Day School. In view of the information contained in Mr. Moore's letter and also in the second paragraph of your own letter, the Department approves of this installation and you may make the necessary arrangements, keeping the cost as low as possible.\n\nSuch requests as the above place the officials at head office in a very awkward position. The expenditure will probably be reasonably high and yet the matter has been only brought to our attention several months after the estimates for the current fiscal year have been submitted and approved by the Minister. I think you will readily realize our position and I suggest that in preparing their estimates for the fiscal year 1945-46 all Indian agents in British Columbia should be definitely advised that they must anticipate their requirements. In submitting these they should attach detailed information regarding any extraordinary expenditures that they may consider necessary, in order to enable the Department to make an intelligent decision on such requests. In view of the increasing demands on our appropriation it is simply impossible for us to continue indefinitely approving expenditures for which no request has been made when submitting estimates.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Moore's letter of June 5th, in connection with the proposed installation of flush toilets at the Songhees Indian Day School.\n\nIn view of the fact that this school is situated within a densely populated area, I am of the opinion that favourable consideration should be given to this matter; but before proceeding to secure an estimate of the cost I would appreciate receiving the Department's reaction to the proposed installation.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nThe Songhees Band has passed a Resolution asking that the outside toilets be done away with at the Songhees Indian Day School and that flush toilets be installed there. Apparently there is a most offensive odor from the present toilets all through the spring, summer and fall months and also during the winter when the wind blows.\n\nAs this school is situated right in the middle of a Municipality I believe that it would be in the best interest of all concerned if favourable consideration could be given to this request. If it is turned down by the Department I have been informed confidentially that every public body in Esquimalt is going to give it all the publicity possible, which in my opinion should be avoided if at all advisable.\n\nI have not made any effort to get prices on just what the approximate cost of two flush toilets would be installed as I felt that I had better refer the matter to you to see if you think there would be any use in my doing so for if the Department is opposed to toilets of this kind in schools (as was evidenced when they were refused for St. Catherine's) then it would just be a waste of time. However, I would like to state that we have flush toilets in the Nanaimo I.D. school and there has never been any trouble with them since I came to this Agency. Kindly advise in this regard.\n\n(R.H.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nI wish to report that during a recent visit to the Songhees Indian Day School I found that the water pipe was leaking down in the basement and running all over the floor. I was unable to determine the cause of the leak or its exact location and consequently had to get a Plumber to go out and look the situation over and see just what the trouble is.\n\nApparently the stop and waste at the entrance to the property is not functioning at the water main and there is not a stop and water inside the building at all. The drain from the basement needs attention and a thorough cleaning out although the extent of this cannot be determined without doing some digging.\n\nI was unable to get the Plumber to commit himself on just what the job would cost without I authorised him to expose the entire pipe from the main to the building and also the drain pipe. He did say however, that the minimum cost would be $18.75 and if he had to do much digging and install any new pipe it might run to $25.00 or $30.00. I got the impression however, that he felt that with the installation of the two set of stop and waste fixtures that the difficulty would be solved, plus the cleaning of the drain. At all events the matter is quite urgent and I would ask for the necessary authority to have the work which is considered necessary attended to right away.\n\n(R.H.

H. Moore, Esq., Indian agent, Duncan, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of March 5th in connection with the proposed installation of electric light in the Songhees Indian Day School, and would point out that the matter was dropped for the reason that we were awaiting further information from you, some of which has still not been received. It is noted that the school building is more or less a community centre for the reserve, which, to me would indicate that the largest percentage of electricity would be used in the evenings for social gatherings rather than for school purposes, in view of which it is likely that some arrangement would have to be arrived at whereby the Indians of the Band assume responsibility for part of the electricity costs.\n\nPlease let me have your views in this connection and give an estimate of the approximate monthly cost of the electricity for the building. I may say I have been unable to find any information in this office in support of your statement that the building in question is owned by the Department, and as I have always been under the impression that it was owned by the Indians themselves I would appreciate whatever information you have available on this point.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nFurther to my letter of the 5th instant and your reply above noted I would advise that the band has already as per resolution of January 25th, 1945 agreed to an expenditure of $40.00 as part of the cost of the installation of the lights in this school and which I feel is a reasonable proportion of the cost of installation for the band to be called upon to pay in view of the fact that the building is so far as I can determine the property of the Department, and while it is noted that you are unable to find any information to support my statement - which after all, was given to me by the Indians - I would suggest that the matter be referred to the Department and definite information received regarding this debatable point.\n\nI did not intend to give you the impression that the building was used frequently as a Community Centre other than for the holding of entertainments by the school children, nursing classes, and possibly for band meetings of four or five times per year. As it stands at present it is one or two individuals of the band that assume responsibility for the lighting of the building by coal oil lamps or a wire strung from the adjoining house.\n\nIt is difficult to give you an estimate of the approximate monthly cost particularly during the winter months, but from April 1st until the end of October the minimum rates of $2.50 per month should pretty well cover. However I do not expect that the total annual expenditure would exceed $50.00\n\nR. H.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th instant, the Department will allow an amount of $200.00 for installation of electric lights in the Songhees Indian Day School. I presume the Agent will take the necessary steps to make certain that a satisfactory job is done and that there is no fire hazard.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am forwarding herewith Mr. Indian Agent Moore's letter of February 13th, 1945, together with a copy of my reply and subsequent correspondence in connection with the proposed installation of electric lights in the Songhees Indian Day School building.\n\nIt will be noted that the estimated cost of wiring the building, including lights and fixtures, is $200.40, that the Band are prepared to contribute $40.00 towards the cost from their Band funds and that the annual cost would be approximately $50.00.\n\nIn view of the use made of the school building outside of school hours for nursing classes, entertainments for the children, etc., and the resulting fire hazard from the use of coal oil lamps, I consider that it would be advisable to proceed with the installation of electric lights. It is too late to proceed with this matter during the current fiscal year and although no specific provision was made in the 1946-47 estimates, it is hoped that funds can be made available.\n\nD. M.

Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nSonghees Indian Reserve,\n\nJanuary 25th, 1945.\n\nWe, the undersigned, Chief and Councillors of the Songhees Band of Indians owning the Reserve situated at Craigflower, in the Cowichan Indian Agency, in the Province of B.C., at a council summoned for the purpose, according to the rules of the Band, and held on the said Reserve, this 25th day of January, A.D. 1945, in the presence of the Indian Agent for the said Reserve, representing thereat the Minister of Mines and Resources for the Dominion of Canada;\n\nDo hereby for ourselves, and on behalf of the Indian owners of the said Reserve, request that a sum not exceeding $40.00 (forty) Dollars, be paid out of money standing to the credit of this Band, for the purpose of paying a part of the cost of wiring the Songhees Indian Day School, for electric lighting, with four lights in the school room, 1 light on the porch and one in the entrance hall. One light in the basement and one in the turn of the basement stairs, a total of eight light outlets and 4 plug-in outlets. It is estimated that this work will cost approximately $160.00 plus a charge of $10.00 for connecting with the power line.\n\nIn view of the fact that this school building belongs to the Department, we feel that the full cost of this work should be a charge against the Indian Affairs Branch, but to expedite the matter as well as to show our interest in the welfare of the children, we will assist to the amount stated.\n\nSigned and sealed in the presence of:\n\nIndian Agent\n\nForm No. I.A. 514\n\nIndian Affairs.

Moore, Esq., Indian Agent, Duncan, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of February 13th in connection with the proposed installation of electric lights at the Songhees Indian Day School, and note from the Band resolution that the estimated cost of the installation is $130.00. In order that this matter may be properly presented to the Department it is considered advisable that you should show how this estimate is made up or submit a tender covering the installation.\n\nAs information recently received from the Department indicates that funds under the Education Vote are almost exhausted for the current fiscal year, and as an amount of $130.00 will be required in addition to the expenditure from funds of the Band, for which no provision was made in your 1945-46 estimates, I can give no assurance that the Department will approve of this work being done. However, if full information is promptly supplied regarding the need for electric lights at this school, the estimated cost of the electricity and the information above requested, I am prepared to present the matter to the Department on the chance that funds may be available this year.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMr. R. H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe wish to submit an estimate for wiring in Indian School on Admirals Road, Esquimalt.

Campbell\nMajor D. M. MacKay  \nIndian Commissioner for B.C.  \nPost Office Box 70  \nVancouver, B.C.\n\nPlease refer to your letter, date and file number above noted, reference the proposed installation of electric light in the Songhees Indian Day School.\n\nIn this regard I may say that the question appears to have dropped after your last letter, as nothing further was done until a few weeks ago that I happened to notice the stoppage in proceedings.\n\nI wish to attach hereto in duplicate a quotation from a very reliable contractor covering the cost of complete installation as stated in the Band Resolution of January 1945 and consisting of 14 lights in school room, 1 light outside front door, 1 light in hallway, 1 light in basement and 1 light at turn in basement stairs, plus 2 double plug-in outlets in school room.\n\nThe principal reason for lights in this school is to give better lighting to the children. During the dark winter months it is extremely difficult for the pupils to see their work books, except on the row of seats along the window.\n\nFurthermore the school building is more or less the Community Centre for the Reserve; meetings and entertainments being held there with coal oil lamps borrowed from the various Indian houses.\n\nI consider this installation most necessary and would recommend that it be carried out as soon as funds can be provided.\n\nR. H. Moore  \nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDept. of Mines & Resources  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI beg to submit herewith in duplicate two requisitions from the teacher of the Songhees School which I trust may be found in order.\n\nOne of these is for janitors' supplies to a total of $63.22; the other for sewing supplies to an amount of $53.40.

This had cost them $150.00 wholesale - I purchased it for $35.00 and lent it to the Craigflower School as a screen for educational movies.\n\nI also purchased and lent to the school a large cabinet which has a glass top and glass doors. This measures about 6 foot 6 inches in height and approximately 42 inches in width - it has been used for supplies. The cost of the cabinet, at auction, was $20.00.\n\nI would like to sell these to the school if the Department would care to purchase them.\n\nI am enclosing an account, in quadruplicate, which you might care to endorse if the purchase is authorized.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"T.W.A.Gray\"\n\nDr. T.

After I received the authority to make this purchase I was unable to get a heater and it was only yesterday that I managed to get McLennan, McFeely, and Prior, in Victoria, to promise to hold one, which they have in stock, for me until I can get the necessary authority to make the purchase.\n\nYou will notice that the price is considerably more than in my last quotation but this can be credited to the fact that this heater is a little larger than the #10 model -- as well as an increase in prices, all round, along with the necessity of having the oil drum sitting on a steel stand in the basement of the school to conform with Fire Marshall's Regulations.\n\nThis heater, and other articles, may be purchased from McLennan, McFeely and Prior, Victoria, B.C., who will also do the installing and supply the stand for the barrel.\n\nIt would be appreciated if I could have a Purchase Order covering this expenditure, as soon as possible.\n\nA Requisition, in duplicate, is attached, herewith, giving an itemized list of the articles required and their cost.\n\nR.

This work was authorized by this office in order that the work might be completed in time to permit this activity to get under way at the beginning of the present calendar year. This office is aware that the Department favours this type of activity.\n\nThe payment of these vouchers amounting to $68.33 is recommended.\n\nW.A. Maclean\nfor W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nenclos.\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nPost Office Box 70,\nVANCOUVER, B. C.\n\nRe: Sonohes Indian Day School.\n\nPlease refer to previous correspondence regarding the above noted school and use of same for the Boy Scouts as authorized by the Department.\n\nThis authorization has caused a condition in this school which has to be corrected immediately and that is the removal of the oil drum from the basement of the building to a frame or fixture outside the building so that a pipe, for gravity feed, may be connected with the heater direct from the oil drum or tank outside, thereby eliminating - almost entirely - the possibility of fire. This installation is in accordance with Fire Marshall regulations and fire restrictions in the municipality of Esquimalt.\n\nThe installation, including the supplying of the steel stand for the drum, piping and labour, will be forty-eight dollars and five cents ($48.05) and I would ask that authority be given at an early date.\n\nI should have mentioned that the fuel oil has been kept in a 45 gallon drum in the basement up to the time that the Scouts took it over as a meeting place -- which required that the old wood burning stove be set up in the basement.\n\nR. H. Moore\nSuperintendent\nCowichan Agency.\n\nRHM: EL\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nFebruary 3, 1949.\n\n21364\n\nRe: Songhees Indian Day School\n\nI wrote you on January 21st regarding the use of the basement of the above named building by a Boy Scout troop which has been organized in conjunction with the operation of the school. Superintendent Moore has now written (reference his letter of February 8th enclosed) asking that authority be given for the removal of the oil drum from the basement of the building to a frame or fixture outside the building, to eliminate the possibility of fire.\n\nI concur in Mr. Moore's views that this work should be done immediately and an expenditure of $45.05 is therefore recommended, covering the cost of a steel stand for the drum, piping and labour.\n\nYou will note that the installation is in accordance with Fire Marshall regulations and fire restrictions in the municipality of Esquimalt.\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.J.

As you have been informed, these Sisters are in dire financial straits, and I advised Sister Mary Amy to submit a quarterly return for the day school. This report is now to hand, showing an enrolment of 15 with an average attendance of 12.75.\n\nI wish to recommend that we pay a teacher's salary to the principal of the Squamish Boarding School for this day school activity. A similar arrangement has obtained in the past at the Pine Creek Boarding School in Manitoba. Funds can be found from our Vote, as we have closed a few day schools because of lack of attendance.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n**REQUISITION FOR SCHOOL MATERIALS**\n\nFor: Squamish Day School on #1 Squamish Reserve in Vancouver Agency\n\nDate: June 30th, 1932\n\n| ARTICLES            | NO.

The cheque has always been issued in favour of Rev. Mother Mary Amy. Although we were advised by Commissioner MacKay in a letter dated August 12 last that Mother Amy had given up duties we neglected at that time to communicate with you regarding the name of the teacher who was in charge of the day school. As a consequence we have still been carrying Mother Amy's name on our pay roll and the Treasury Branch refuse to pay any more salary due to the fact that she is considerably over 65 years of age at which time all employees are expected to give up duties in Government service.\n\nI feel certain that some other Sister has been in charge of the day school room and consequently I should appreciate it if you would let me know her name immediately. At the same time you should complete and return the attached questionnaire form. As soon as I have this information arrangements will be made to issue a cheque in her favour for the month of January and for subsequent months until we hear further from you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

It really does not matter at all whether the cheque is sent to the Teacher of the Day School directly or to myself, so whatever the Department shall decide in this respect is quite satisfactory; but it should not be issued in favor of Mother Amy any longer.\n\nI was really disappointed, Dear Mr. Phelan, not to have had the pleasure of meeting you again when you visited Vancouver last summer. Mother Amy and myself still recall with happiness the short pleasant moments spent with you on the occasion of your visit to the school.\n\nHoping to have the privilege of renewing our acquaintance in the near future, I am, Dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSister Mary Alix,\nPrincipal.\nEXCERPT from the minutes of a meeting of the Honourable the Treasury Board, held at Ottawa on the 21st day of February, 1940.\n\nMines and Resources\n\nThe Board, in accordance with the provisions of Order in Council of 31st July, 1935, P.C. 1/1561, as amended, direct that the following employees of the Department of Mines and Resources be exempt from the provisions of the above noted Order in Council to the 1st January, 1941.\n\n| NAME                        | RANK                                      |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Minard, L.

(RG 10, Volume 6417, file 848-1, part 1)\nOttawa, October 29, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Director, when reviewing the estimates for the fiscal year 1941-42, was anxious to learn from me if we had at any time canvassed the possibilities of establishing a consolidated school that might serve the purpose now served by the Squamish Indian Residential School.\n\nDr. McGill has himself visited the Squamish district and is reasonably familiar with the location of the school, the Indian homes on the reserve and the distances between these homes and the institution.\n\nIt has been decided to abandon our building program for this year at least and with an annual increase in the Indian school population of approximately 300 pupils it is altogether likely that we shall have demands from a number of Indian residential schools in the outlying sections of the Dominion, asking for increased enrolments. These requests, if granted, would of course mean an increased appropriation for the payment of per capita grants and I am not at all sure that such an increase can be secured.\n\nHowever, if we could establish a day school at Squamish to take the place of the existing residential school, we would be in a position at least to increase our per capita grants at other schools to the extent of the amount saved at Squamish. I appreciate very fully the fact that this is a rather delicate matter and one that may have to be approached cautiously. It might be well, therefore, to discuss the matter with Inspector Barry and probably with the church authorities and the\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nSisters in charge of the school. It would appear, in view of our war effort, that it is going to be increasingly difficult to secure the funds necessary to maintain our present educational program. Such being the case, every effort should be made to effect economies, particularly in districts where economies can be effected without seriously interfering with the educational progress of the Indian pupils.\n\nWould it be possible to secure a sketch map of the reserve served by the Squamish School, indicating the number of homes, the number of children of school age, etc.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 26, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Squamish Indian Day School\nNo. 848\n\nSister Mary Amy who has been the teacher of this school is giving up duties and no further cheque should be issued to her after the end of February, 1940. She will be succeeded on March 1, 1940, by Sister Joan of Arc who will be allowed salary at the same rate as the preceding teacher.\n\nI enclose copy of letter of appointment and staff questionnaire will be forwarded to you when received.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 26, 1940.\n\nReverend Sister:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 17th instant in which you advise that Sister Joan of Arc will be teacher of the Squamish Indian Day School.\n\nHer appointment will be effective from March 1, 1940. She will be allowed the same salary as the previous teacher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Alix,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSquamish, B.C.\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nSome weeks ago you asked me to make a brief survey of the pupilage of the Squamish Indian Residential and Day Schools to determine whether or not the children involved could be accommodated in a Consolidated Day School.\n\nThe attached nominal rolls of the children now attending the Squamish Indian Residential and Day Schools have been prepared for me by the Reverend Sister Mary Alix, Principal of the schools in question. The following are summaries which it is hoped will be of assistance to you and the Department in coming to a decision in this matter.\n\nThe Squamish Day School pupils attend the Residential School classes and as far as academic work is concerned, receive exactly the same education.\n\nAt present there are twelve boys and fourteen girls in attendance at the Squamish Day School, while in the Residential School there are twenty-seven boys and thirty-four girls. The classification of these children by grades is as follows:\n\n| Grades | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |\n|--------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **Day School** |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| Boys   | 0 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n| Girls  | 3 | 1 | 1 | 5 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n| **Residential** |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| Boys   | 10| 2 | 0 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 0 |\n| Girls  | 18| 4 | 1 | 5 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n\nIt will be seen from the above that the children are fairly evenly distributed between the grades, with the majority of the Residential School pupils in the primary grades.\n\nIt is of extreme importance in considering the possibility of the establishment of a Consolidated Day School to take the place of the present Day and Residential Schools to consider the home conditions of the children at present on the roll of the Squamish Indian Residential School. The following tabulation will set forth in a brief manner the information given on the nominal rolls:\n\n|                     | Boys | Girls |\n|---------------------|------|-------|\n| 1. Both parents dead.| 3    | 0     |\n| 2. Father dead.      | 3    | 6     |\n| 3. Mother dead.      | 1    | 1     |\n| 4. Deserted by mother| 2    | 1     |\n| 5. Deserted by father| 1    | 1     |\n| 6. Deserted by both parents | 1 | 0 |\n| 7. Parents separated | 2    | 0     |\n| 8. Mother dead, father deserted | 1 | 1 |\n| 9. T.B. infected home | 0    | 1     |\n| 10 No suitable home  | 0    | 1     |\n| No special remarks   | 13   | 22    |\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6417, file 848-1, part 1)\nFrom the above it will be easily seen that at least half of the boys and about one-third of the girls need Residential School care in any case.\n\nThe following tabulation will give a clear picture of the location of the homes from which the Residential School pupilage is drawn:\n\n| Location          | Boys | Girls |\n|-------------------|------|-------|\n| Burrard #3        | 5    | 7     |\n| Squamish Inlet    | 13   | 19    |\n| Squamish Mission #1 | 1    | 3     |\n| Musqueam          | 6    | 2     |\n\nBriefly, I may say that Burrard #3 Reserve is located in or near the Lynn Valley District, some eight miles from the present Squamish Residential School. There are good roads joining these places. The Musqueam Reserve is located near Point Grey, some fifteen miles from the present Squamish school, on the Vancouver city side of Burrard Inlet. Transportation of the Musqueam children to a Consolidated School at Squamish would involve far too great a distance and also the crossing of the new Lions Gate Suspension Bridge. Squamish River Indian Reserve is located at the head of Howe Sound, some forty miles by water from North Vancouver. Where Squamish is given as the location of the home, it should be understood that this includes the local Reserves in the vicinity of the present Squamish Indian Residential School.\n\nAttached you will find a roll of ten children discharged from the Squamish Residential School during the past year, all these children were fifteen years of age or over. Two were in Grade 4, two in Grade 5, three in Grade 6, and three in Grade 8 at the time of discharge. These children would appear to have received on the average a satisfactory training in the academic subjects.\n\nI regret that it is quite impossible for me to recommend the establishment of a consolidated improved Day School in North Vancouver to take the place of the present Squamish Indian Residential and Day Schools. Two main reasons may be given for this conclusion:\n\n1. It would be practically impossible to arrange for the satisfactory transportation of the children involved when the distance to the Musqueam and Burrard #3 Reserves are taken into account. In no system of consolidation could the children from the Squamish River Reserve be included.\n\n2. A very large proportion of the children at present receiving their education at the Squamish Indian Residential School are exactly those who, from the nature of their home and family conditions, must of necessity receive their education at a Residential School.\n\nI trust that the above information will be of assistance to you and to the Department in coming to a final decision and that the present Squamish Indian Residential and Day Schools may be allowed to continue to function as such.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Hoey's letter of October 29th regarding the suggestion that a consolidated, improved day school be established on the north shore to take the place of the existing Squamish Indian Residential and Day Schools.\n\nThe possibilities in this connection have been carefully considered and the whole question fully discussed with Inspectors Barry and Coleman.\n\nInspector Barry's report, together with a sketch plan of the Reserves served by the existing arrangements, is attached.\n\nOwing to the widely scattered character of the Reserves from which the pupilage is drawn, the proposed consolidation would not be practicable. Moreover, a large percentage of the children would, in any event, require residential school care because of unfavorable home and family conditions.\n\nIt will be recalled that the establishment of a Day School on the Musqueam Reserve to care for those children for whom there is no room in the Squamish Residential School has been provided for in the 1941-42 Estimates on Departmental instructions.\n\nI would recommend that the existing arrangements be continued.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

The police were notified but have been unable to locate the culprits.\n\nI advised the Principal that more effective daytime supervision of the school property was necessary, as it seemed that someone should have been aware that such destruction was occurring in daytime.\n\nTo prevent recurrence of previous continual expense for replacing window panes, it will be necessary to place heavy wire screening of small mesh over the windows.\n\nThe cost for wire will be around $80.00 and if funds are available, I will submit details and quotation.

Calbreath Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nSir:\n\nHaving being informed that the Indian Department are willing to make a grant of $30 a month towards an Indian School if established at Tahltan, could not this grant be made towards the school at this point. Under the Provincial School Act none living in the Indian mode of life are admitted to the schools, but here there are 17 Indian children attending.\n\nThe parents of the children are very anxious that they should secure an education, and nearly all have promised to leave their children in Town during the winter, while they go of hunting.\n\nThe children are bright and intelligent, and are anxious to learn; they readily obey what they are told to do, and are very regular in their attendance.\n\nKindly refer this communication to the Indian Agent and oblige.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nR.H. MacJames.\nBritish Columbia.\n\nIndian Office,\n\nVictoria, June 10th, 1907.\n\nFile No. 300,429.\n\nSir,-\n\nWith reference to my letter to the Department of the 26th of October last, No. 454. A. S., with respect to the urgent request made by the Indian parents living at Telegraph Creek, Cassiar Agency, B. C., for an Indian day school grant, in the usual sum of $300.00 per annum, for the Indian children of the locality, I have the honor to forward herewith a copy of a further communication, of the 20th ultimo, received from the Acting Indian Agent, Mr. Callbreath, asking that steps be taken at the earliest possible date to have provision made for the payment of such a grant in order that the teacher referred to, Mr. R. H. MacInnes, be induced to remain in the district.\n\nIn connection with this request I may state for the Department's information that, as pointed out by Mr. Callbreath, there are only four white children at present school for white children at Telegraph Creek. Were a grant made by the Department\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, Ont.\nDepartment for the Indian children of the locality. Mr. MacInnes could be induced to remain and by drawing the salary allowed by the provincial government for a teacher at Telegraph Creek as well as the grant now asked to be provided by the Department he would thereby be in receipt of sufficient remuneration to provide a living for himself. As the Indians are very anxious to have their children educated and as, if Mr. MacInnes leave the district considerable difficulty may reasonably be expected to be encountered in providing the services of a special teacher for the Indian children, due in a large measure to the remoteness of the locality from the centres of civilization and the difficulty and uncertainty of access and consequent high cost of living, I would strongly recommend that, if at all possible to do so, provision be made immediately for the payment of the salary of a teacher for that point.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B.C.\n(Copy)\n\nCassiar Agency, Telegraph Creek May 20th 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to call your attention to the matter of the Department grant for an Indian school at Telegraph Creek. Mr. McGinnes the teacher informs me he will not remain for the salary paid him by the Provincial Government. I trust this grant will be allowed as there are only four (4) white children attending. I doubt if the school would be reopened if once closed.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"J. Frank Callbreath\"\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nA.W. Vowell Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Affairs, B.C.\nVictoria B.C.\nOttawa, November 5, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ult., inclosing a communication from Mr. Acting Indian Agent Callbreath, covering one from Mr. R. H. MacInnes with reference to the need of an Indian school in the vicinity of Telegraph Creek.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nA. W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a letter, dated the 12th instant, received from Mr. Acting Agent Callbreath, of the Cassiar Agency, B. C., enclosing a communication, of the same date, addressed to him by Mr. R. H. MacInnes, with respect to the need of an Indian day school for the Indian children living at and in the vicinity of Telegraph Creek, the headquarters of the agency. From what is stated in the enclosed correspondence there are 17 children of pure or three quarter resident in the locality. The Acting Agent remarks that the Indian parents are very keen in the matter of having schooling provided by the Department for their children and that they will do whatever they reasonably can to ensure as regular an attendance as possible at the school, when opened. Under the circumstances set forth, I would recommend that provision be made in the usual sum for the payment of the salary of a teacher at an early date.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B. C.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 25, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report for the month of October last, and with regard to that portion in which you deal with the withdrawal of the grant from the school at Telegraph Creek I beg to say that the continuance of the grant to this school will be dependent upon the attendance. The attendance for the past year would not justify the continuance of the grant. The Department will not take any further action till it is seen whether any improvement can be effected.\n\nYour remarks with regard to the establishment of a boarding school are noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. Scott Simpson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to hear from Mr. R. H. Mac, former teacher of the Brown Creek School located at Telegraph Creek, in which he makes application for an additional grant of $30.00 per month towards the support of Indian schools. He also named me a list of his scholars out of a total of 21; there are 17 of them on three families.\n\nThe Indians are very keen about schooling for their children, quite a number have arranged to leave their children here while they are away for their winter hunt.\n\nMr. Mac states further he will be unable to remain here with the Indians as paid by the Provincial Government on account of the high rate of living. It will be impossible to have an\n\nA W O'Connell Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent B.C.\nVictoria\n\nB.C.\nan assisted School at Gillies\nfor the present year.

Frank Callbeck\nActing Indian Agent\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nIn\n\nI beg leave\nto acknowledge receipt of your letter\ndated August 17th Ref. 3004597\nat Telegraph House.\n\nThe School opened on 1st of\nSeptember but as yet very few of the\nIndians have come in as they are still\nat their fishery some 22 miles to the North.\nI expect that by the beginning of the\nnext week there will be a number of\nthem in attendance, I will make it a\npoint to post them and have the children\nsent on as quickly as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant\nW. Scott Simpson\nSir:\n\nI beg leave to submit the following report for the month ending October 31st, 1911. Most of the Indians with the exception of a few of the aged and sick are away to their winter hunting grounds. Only a few were able to leave their children with relatives at the village and at Telegraph Creek, consequently the attendance at both schools has been small, but there is just a possibility that more may attend after Christmas when those of the hunters who have been successful in their fur catch can afford to leave their families in the village for the few months of the remaining winter.\n\nI think it would be a mistake to close the school as was suggested by my predecessor. Those who are fortunate in being able to attend are advancing in a very encouraging manner and both of the teachers are making every effort to bring them forward. In my opinion a boarding school in the village under the management of the Church of England Mission with a married man and his wife to look after the girls would be the only reasonable solution to the problem of educating the rising generation of the Tahltan tribe, the larger percentage of whom are bright and intelligent and quick to adapt themselves to the White man's ways. A technical branch in connection with the school would be of great benefit to them.\n\nI am sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nSgn. W. Scott Simpson.\nAgent,\nOttawa, August 17, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nFor sometime the Department has paid a grant of $300.00 to the school at Telegraph Creek for the tuition of Indian children. Of late the attendance has very much fallen off and unless an effort is made to increase the have attendance and if those children who are in the neighborhood of the school go regularly the Department will have to consider the withdrawal of the grant. In this connection it might be well for you to inform the Indians that they must send their children regularly to the school or that if they do not it will be necessary to enforce the Regulations relating to the Education of Indian Children, a copy of these regulations is being sent you herewith. I shall be glad to hear from you at a later date as to whether any improvements has been effected or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. S. Simpson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nI have the honor to enclose herewith report of the Indian day school at Telegraph Creek for the quarter ended June 30th 1911 and in connection therewith beg to say that the attendance has been falling off considerably even the Indians who reside here permanently will not send their children, and I would not recommend the continuing of the grant towards the teacher's salary, the present teacher does not appear to take much interest in his work, and it seems useless to appeal to the School Board, as none of the members appear to care whether school helps or not.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ. D. McLean Esq.\nActing Deputy Secretary.\n\nOttawa.\nStickim Agency\n\nTelegraph Creek B.C. June 28th\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th inst no 3004291, with reference to the establishment of a night school for the Indians and in reply I beg to say that when I mentioned the matter to the Department before, there were several young men who seemed to be anxious to learn and as that was the only way that I could see of affording them an opportunity of going to school I made that suggestion thinking that possibly arrangements could be made to have the school teacher at Telegraph Creek run a night school for them when they were here as they are always around in the spring time and some of them remain in during the winter, but I certainly would not be in favor of having a school in connection with any religious teaching, the time should be spent entirely on their studies with occasionally a lecture on honest principles and their duty to each other, that is something that they can be made to understand.\nI am thoroughly convinced that it is of little use to try to educate the Indians unless we do something to eradicate their superstition. I find that it is the practice of the missionaries to always treat them as children and depend upon someone to think for them. What right have we to expect any intelligence from them as long as they are treated in that way, it certainly seems to me that it would be much better to let their minds and reason expand as they grow to be men and women so that they could be regarded as such, instead of always being little children.\n\nI find that the Tahltan Indians are getting more obstinate and harder to deal with all the time; this is likely the last time that I shall have a chance to give my views to the Department and I make these remarks through sympathy for them.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nActing Deputy Secretary,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 5, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nIn your annual report on the schools in your Agency you refer to the advisability of establishing a night school but you do not state whether it is at Telegraph Creek or on the Reserve.\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to let the Department have a full report upon this matter, which will be given due consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Do you think they could be persuaded to continue it? Our teacher is leaving this summer, and while I was in Victoria tried to find another, but no success, and without the Indians\ngrant, it will be almost impossible to persuade anyone to go up there, you know the fare is high, and living is so expensive, and there really should be some inducement held out to get a young person to stay there. The Indian Dept. were only paying $25 a month and we allowed all the Indian children to go to the school, and they are getting along splendidly, it is an assisted school, the School Board.\nmap the teachers salary, $100 per month\nwe provide building, light, fire, etc. Surely\nyou would try and have them\ncontinue this grant.\n\nI have never heard anything\nmore of Capt. Bragg. Did he get the\nappointment of Customs Inspector at\nthe boundary?\n\nI will be in Vancouver the last\nof this month on my way north\nand will look you up at the office.\nand in the meantime will be glad to hear if anything can be done about this point.\n\nOur Indian Dick was very glad to get home again.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nWinifred Heyland.\n\nAddress\n\nMrs. Heyland,\n4077-17th St.,\nSan Francisco\nCal.\nVancouver, B.C., July 19, 1912.\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister Indian Affairs,\nHouse of Commons, Ottawa.\n\nMy dear Pedley:\n\nI enclose, herewith, a letter from Mrs. J.

Mr. Hyland is Postmaster at that point. They have always shown a great deal of regard and care for the Indians. The writer of the letter, Mrs. Hyland, brought down a sick Indian boy, of whom I took some interest in, to Victoria for treatment in the early Spring.\n\nIf you can comply with their wishes, I would appreciate it.

Hyland in reference to the grant paid by this Department to the white school at Telegraph Creek.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the grant has not been withdrawn and that for the June quarter was paid just recently. I may say, however, that the Department wrote the Indian Agent on March 25th, last, and told him that the continuance of the grant to this school would be dependent upon the attendance which had become very low. So long as the attendance will warrant it it is not the intention of the Department to withdraw this grant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. D. McLennan\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. S.

Mr Mc Garragle the new Master is giving great satisfaction and the pupils are making steady progress under his management. The Attendance is rather over the average at this season of the year as most of the families move out to hunting grounds, but the season has been unusually bad and wet so that no trapping has been attempted up to the present moment.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek,\nNovember, 1st, 1922,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit Agents monthly School report on the Telegraph Creek Day School for the month ending October, 31st 1922. As most of the Indians with families who were residing in Telegraph Creek have now gone to their trapping grounds the attendance has dropped to three Indian children proper. Two Women with Children now residing in the town have married White Men and their children are in regular attendance.

McGarragle, the former teacher, gave up duties at the close of the June quarter, and the school is now in charge of Mr. R. T. Pollock, who began duties on the 1st of September, last. This is the first intimation the Department has received that there has been a change of teacher at this school. We will be pleased to have full information regarding the qualifications which the new teacher possesses.\n\nThe salary allowed Mr. McGarragle will be the same as was paid the former teacher, vizt $500.00 per annum, plus any bonus provided by law.\n\nIt is noted that the attendance for the month of September was good, and the children are showing a marked improvement in their studies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The School is now in charge of Mr. R.T. Pollock, who opened school on the first of September. He is now sending in a report covering this period.

In reply I beg to state that this School was built by the Provincial Government for the education of White children resident in Telegraph Creek and the masters in charge are nominees of the Minister or Superintendent of Education for the Province. These Masters at the close of the June quarter go out to Victoria or Vancouver for the Summer vacation and we never know who is to take up that duty until the party arrives in the last week in August.\n\nAs the grant allowed by the Provincial Government was too small to support a Teacher, The Department of Indian Affairs gave a grant of $500.00, to assist in the upkeep of the school on the understanding that Indian children would be admitted there being no Indian school in the Agency.\n\nMr Pollock before accepting the appointment, met the retiring master Mr Mc Garragle and was informed by him that the Department had increased the Grant and were now paying $750.00.\n\nOn the arrival of the first winter mail from Atlin on the 17th instant Mr Pollock received a Cheque, #2410, for $47.50, (The September stipend) and asked for an explanation. I informed him that I had not been notified of an increase on the original grant, and owing to the fact that Cheques for this service had been paid direct to recipient in late years I was unable to refute this statement, however I showed him that the Estimates called for $500.00, to cover salary, for the past and present Fiscal years. He will possibly communicate with you on this subject.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nW. Scott Simpson\nOTTAWA, January 13, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th ultimo, regarding the change of teachers at the Telegraph Creek Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your explanation regarding the appointment of teachers at this school is satisfactory.\n\nI may say that the grant this Department allows towards the salary of a teacher is at the rate of $500 per annum. The cheque which was sent Mr. Pollock, the present teacher, to the amount of $47.50 was in payment of his salary for the period he taught school during the month of September, last, at the above rate. Should Mr. Pollock remain as teacher until the 30th of June next, the end of the present school year, and teach the required number of days, he will receive full yearly salary at the above rate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The appointment of the teacher is made by the Provincial Government. Our full share of salary is at the rate of $50 per teaching month. The average attendance of Indian pupils for the past year was only 5, and it is considered that the amount we allow towards salary is all that we can provide. The local Indian Agent, Mr. W. Scott Simpson, has been informed of the salary that this Department will allow for the teaching of the Indian children. Our funds this year are limited, and it will not be possible to provide any higher salary than that mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Scott Simpson, the Indian agent, but understand he is now on his way to Atlin and other interior points and will not return for some time.\n\nIn view of the high cost of living at Telegraph Creek, and necessary heavy transportation charges that one has to meet travelling to that place, I feel that the position of teacher to the Indian children should carry with it a salary of seven hundred dollars ($700.00) per annum.\n\nI hold a First-Class British Columbia teacher's certificate and have had four years of successful teaching experience in the Province. Two years of this were spent in teaching large ungraded schools, in which practically all the pupils were half-breeds.\n\nHoping for a favourable reply to my application, I remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Miss) Clara M.

We have agreed to allow her, as our full share of salary, payment at the rate of $50 per teaching month. She should prepare and forward a report at the end of each quarter on the form for that purpose showing the attendance of the Indian children only. This form she should hand to you, and, if you are satisfied that the same is correct, you should certify and send it to the Department when payment of the salary due at the above rate will be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Agent Reed was advised to ask the Department to authorize the purchase of new desks as may be reasonably required, not exceeding ten in number. Some school books are also wanted for which the Agent will make requisition. It is thought that assistance should be granted in the manner suggested, since no school tax is imposed in the district either upon white or Indians and the school is remotely situated. In a conversation with one of the local school trustees, Mrs. Hyland, I was advised that difficulty is experienced in securing from the Provincial Education Department sufficient equipment for the proper carrying out of school work here. No doubt, lack of school taxation in Telegraph Creek is responsible.\nOctober 29, 1929.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nRev. E. Allard, O. M.

As you have been informed, the salary allowed will be at the rate of $500 per annum ($50 per month for 10 teaching months in the year). Both Mr. Agent Simpson, Telegraph Creek, and Miss Tervo have been informed of the Department's concurrence in her appointment and the amount we will pay towards her salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nFor Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. H. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nThere has been a long standing controversy between the representatives of the Roman Catholic and Protestant Anglican Churches, respectively, as to which church merits an ascendancy in regard to residential school facilities as a result of the advent from time to time of their respective Missionaries. In response to my request, Reverend Father Allard, O.M.I., of the R.C. Church and Reverend Commander Hodgson, Anglican Minister agreed to meet together at the Indian Office with the Agent and myself with a view to going over the Agency census and determining what Indians were reputed to belong to either of these churches, in other words to determine who are considered to be Roman Catholics and who are deemed to be of the Protestant faith. This action was thought necessary as a preliminary step in the direction of deciding what recommendation should be made to the Department with respect to Indian education in this large district; a residential school having been asked for during my visit by the Reverend Father Allard, O.M.I., for the accommodation of 92 children stated by him to have been baptized into the Roman Catholic Church. A list of these children was submitted by Father Allard.\n\nReverend Commander Hodgson of the Anglican Church had also submitted a list of families which embraced many of the children in the R.C. list.\n\nA frank and fair discussion of the matter went to show that Indians baptized many years ago by the Anglicans had been rebaptized later with their children into the Roman Catholic Church and vice versa.\n\nThe Agency official census book was examined, Family by Family, and agreement was reached between the two Church representatives in regard to each subject, of course, to the acceptance of such status by the respective Family heads.\n\nA distressful aspect was the division, through baptism, by the respective clergy, of families. In some cases, the fathers would be pagan, the mothers Catholic and the children Protestant. In other cases the father is Protestant, the mother Catholic, part of the children of one Church and part of another. Many old Indians were baptized by the Anglicans years ago and had lapsed into paganism, some of whom were now claimed by both Catholics and Protestants.\n\nA decision was reached as to the status of\nExtract from Asst. Commissioner Perry's Report (continued)\n\nthe Indians as understood by the clergymen. A subsequent numerical checkup shows as follows:\n\nIn the vicinity of Telegraph Creek, Tahltan and Dease Lake, including Bear Lake migrant visitors, there are,\n\nRoman Catholics 120.\nAnglican 150.\n\nIn the McDames and Liard districts there are claimed by the Roman Catholic clergyman 320 Indians, one-third of these are said to be nomads and are not claimed by the Anglicans. The Roman Catholic Church therefore expects to register these 320 Indians as Roman Catholics.\n\nIn the Atlin and Teslin districts at least two-thirds of the Indians, who in total number 222, are adherents of the Anglican Church. It was admitted that the work of the Anglican Church is increasing there while that of the Roman Catholic Church under Rev. Father Allard, O.M.I., is not extensive. Rev. Father Allard, O.M.I., stated that his Church would be willing to give up any missionary activities that might be prejudicial to the Anglican interests there, especially if the Department would be willing to make provision for a residential school for say 50 of 92 Catholic children of school age at a place called Six-Mile point which is on the right bank of Stikine River about 6 miles below Telegraph Creek. On the other hand, Rev. Commander Hodgson, of the Anglican Church, at Telegraph Creek, has suggested that if the Roman Catholic Church would be willing to vacate their Telegraph Creek Mission (where Rev. Father Allard has recently erected a church for the Indians in what the Anglicans believe to be their territory) the Anglicans might give up any claim they may have to missionary territory around McDames Creek and Dease Lake where however the Anglicans have no established or organized Missions. The Anglicans may offer some objection to the establishment of a residential school for the Roman Catholic Church near Telegraph Creek as they consider the district an Anglican missionary territory even though there is some lack of appreciable Missionary activity along educational lines on the part of the Anglicans in this district, the latter through Rev. Commander Hodgson claiming not to have any funds for such purpose. It should be pointed out that despite the past religious work of the Anglicans at Tahltan (now abandoned) and Telegraph Creek, the Roman Catholic Indians have erected new churches at Telegraph Creek and at McDames whether the Anglicans like it or not and the priest has decided to press for the education of the Indians who identify themselves with the Roman Catholic Faith and hence is asking that a departmental residential school be established under the supervision of the Catholic Church for Catholic children within the territory for which they have established these churches.\n\nThe Department will be aware of a medical\nExtract from Asst. Commissioner Perry's report (cont'd.)\n\nsurvey made in 1928 by Dr. Wride of the Indians in Stikine Agency, in view of which I pointed out to the clergyman concerned that a medical report of the present resident medical officer Dr. Edgellow as to the physical fitness of the 92 R.C. children to enter a residential school would appear to be necessary before consideration could be given to the request for a residential school. This suggestion met with approval, and Dr. Edgellow has promised to make a careful medical examination of the children whose names appear on the list of Rev. Father E. Allard, O.M.I.\n\nShould a medical report on these children prove satisfactory, it would then be desirable that the Department give consideration to the question as to:\n\n1. A residential school should be provided.\n2. Whether such school should be denominational, undenominational or inter-denominational.\n3. Whether or not the Anglicans' view that the Catholics are usurping their recognized Missionary territory or sphere of influence should be endorsed in view of the limited nature of the present Missionary work of the Anglicans and the recent more active work of the Roman Catholics in this district.\n\nIt seems to me that it might be reasonably deduced from the foregoing observation that as the Roman Catholic Church claims adherents numbering 440 and the Anglicans 372 (total population of Stikine Agency is 812) there would appear to be reasonable grounds on the part of the former to ask for separate educational facilities for at least 50 of their 92 children, particularly as the Anglicans have a residential school at Carcross, Y.T., which is near the center of their larger church activities and which has at present some accommodation and which might be extended if necessary in order to accommodate the Anglican children who might in future be found available for admission thereto. It is thought that an extension of educational facilities for the Anglican Church at Carcross by the Department for the accommodation of Anglican children should fully compensate them for any obviously questionable loss they may claim to have sustained by the advent of the Catholics into their Missionary territory which at present is showing very slight signs of either religious or educational activity. The children of the district around Telegraph Creek are attending the Provincial public school, while the Mission at Tahltan is deserted and practically abandoned. Should the Department be inclined to recognize the claims of the Roman Catholics to a\nresidential school for Catholic children, it is recommended that such a school be established at 6-mile Point where acreage of sufficient area might be obtained from the Provincial Government which is understood to have placed a reserve on it for educational purposes. I have examined the site and believe the same to be quite suitable for this purpose. It is further recommended that a special inspection be made at the Carcross Indian Residential School which at present seems to bear an unsavoury reputation in the North, with a view of bringing it to a higher degree of efficiency and in order that the children of Anglican families in the Stikine Agency may be given suitable and satisfactory residential school accommodation and supervision. Of course, this recommendation is made subject to a satisfactory report being made by our medical officer respecting the physical fitness of the applicant pupils.\n\nI should advise you that your suggestion to have a joint undenominational school for Stikine Agency while approved by Reverend Hodgson for the Anglicans, is not received with satisfaction by Reverend E. Allard, O.M.I., of the Catholic Church.\n\nIt should further be pointed out that the erection of a residential school at McDames, or Dease Lake for the Catholics as suggested by Rev. Hodgson would be fraught with great expense; while such a school if erected on the bank of the Stikine at a proper elevation would cost a great deal less as freight could be landed close to the proposed site. Moreover it is believed that the Stikine River will always be a main artery into the Cassiar country even though a public highway may be made into Dease Lake and Alaska from the south in the future. Moreover there is a beautiful creek and splendid fishing right at this proposed school site where fish food could easily be obtained for the use of the pupils.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa,\nOctober 5, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of September 30th, I enclose Mr. Moran's letter authorizing payment of his salary to The Canadian Bank of Commerce, Vanderhoof.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

At least three times as many Indian children should be there. Mr. Hughes, the teacher, appears to be doing very good work, in a very poor schoolroom, though kept clean and tidy. The blackboards are poor and more are required. There is also a shortage of supplies, particulars of which will be furnished by Indian Agent Reed. On examination, the children appeared to be well up to grade, and all were clean and tidy. There are too many of these old double desks.\n\nG. S.

Father Bosse' himself is against the idea, and therefore that matter is considered \"dead\" for the time being, at least.\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\nTelegraph Creek, B.C., Nov. 17, 1933.\n\nI beg to submit hereunder, a report covering the month of October 1933.\n\nPRINCE RUPERT.\n\nA meeting of the local school board took place on the 23rd inst. with the object in view of arranging the School Master's salary for the future. It was found that $300.00 in arrears was his due, and to cover this, the Provincial Authorities were authorized to impose extra taxes on the town property. For the future the school master was assured of not less than $1000.00 per annum from local sources, whilst the Indian Department's allowance through the new arrangement would be that much extra. This assisted Day School is visited regularly twice a month and good work is being found.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nAccording to agreement between this Department and the Minister of Education for the Province of British Columbia, a tuition grant is in future to be paid for the Indian children attending the Telegraph Creek Day School at the same rate as in the case of other Indian children attending white schools in British Columbia, viz., $20 per annum per capita, based on the average attendance. The Department of Education for the Province of British Columbia is to be informed of all payments.\n\nSet file 150-43\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit herewith the Telegraph Day-Assisted School return for quarter ending Dec 18th 1931.\n\nThe school attendance has been rather better this winter than usual, some families staying in town to enable their children to attend school.\n\nThere is some talk amongst the community that for next year a School Mistress will be demanded, and as far as the Indian youngsters requirements are concerned, it would be a good change. There is no reason whatsoever why a School Mistress should not be allowed at this point for there are eight White ladies living in this small community, at the present time.\n\nIt is fair to this Office to state, that in all local school matters, no opinions, one way or another are ever expressed, and the best of terms are held with everybody concerned.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Dept.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C. Vancouver, B.C., in connection with the attendance of Indian children at that school. There is little doubt but what several Indian families were slightly influenced, last fall, to remain around this area, and later on send their children to the local school.\n\nWhilst nothing can be proved to this effect, yet today we have the results of such actions. Other schools are provided which will allow such families to carry on their trapping affairs, and at the same time send their children to school.\n\nThe Authority as to what children should attend this local school, and which should not, ought to rest with the Indian office entirely, otherwise a re-occurrence of this winter's conditions will surely eventuate. This is decidedly wanted by all the merchants of this Town, and by all others who have to live on the old moose now and again; that today have been shot off or driven back into the far bush. A definite ruling on this matter would be much appreciated for future action.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nTelegraph Creek, B.C. April 29, 1939.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON STIKINE AGENCY FOR MARCH 1939.\n\nAlso mention was made last month that His Lordship Bishop Counret, O.M.I. was on an inspection trip of the Interior and that he expected to visit Atlin and go on to Telegraph Creek with your agent, but this could not be arranged, and the Bishop will be interviewed later on in the summer. As Fathers Drein and Poulett had been brought up to Teslin Lake by his Lordship from Liard Post, it was possible to reach them by wireless telephone from Atlin, and so Father Poulett was informed that the Department had kindly allowed a salary for the Liard school over the summer months. He was of course instructed that the school term would be ended on the 15th of September next; that is as far as the Indian families were concerned, and that by then they should be fully ready to resume their winter trapping affairs. This he quite understands.\n\nHarper Reed.\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMarch 27, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your reports of January and February, 1939, in connection with the situation at Telegraph Creek.\n\nIt is noted that several Indian families appear to consider that they have the right to come into Telegraph Creek Townsite for the winter using as an excuse the fact that they can send their children to school. This procedure is not in the best interests of the Indian families and every reasonable step should be taken to prevent it. You may definitely inform the Indians that unless the resident Doctor and yourself approve of any family coming to live in Telegraph Creek Townsite for the winter no relief will be allowed by this Department to such family.\n\nThe winter schools already in operation should provide educational facilities for many of the families who otherwise would move into Telegraph Creek.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B. C.\nStikine Agency,\nAtlin, B.C., March 12, 1939.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit hereunder a report covering the month of February 1939.\n\nThe first half of this month was occupied in giving the usual attention to various matters that arrive for action in and around the Head Office in Telegraph Creek. Nothing of serious account took place that needs special attention, but the old local school question did crop up once more when it was discovered that out of 16 Indian youngsters attending - 12 of them really needed prompt attention given to their tonsils.\n\nOn a special request from the Minister of Health for the Province, which no doubt was sent out to all Provincial Schools the local Doctor 'n every area received instructions to carry out a special inspection, not only of the children but also of the buildings and all connections. Therefore, this was done by Dr. Meyer, M.D. and looking through the Indian Office files on this matter he saw at a glance that no action has been received for many years in regard to our local school and its decent teaching conditions. Therefore a rather drastic report was rendered, which rather shocked our local Government Agent, but which it is hoped by all the people in Telegraph Creek will result in some action by the Province to improve matters generally. The school building was condemned years ago, and since that time the youngsters 'n the Town have greatly increased, so that today it is a matter of overcrowding. This is rather serious in a community where T.B. is known to exist, and the home conditions of the various half-breeds and Indians are not anywhere up to a standard of decent living. The whole matter is the subject of a Report to the Indian Commissioner in Vancouver, B.C. and no doubt now the Province has started to mend conditions, our remote locality will eventually come up for some attention. We have no Revenue in the Cassiar at present and the Tax Payers are today unable to carry the expenses of an entirely new school building - many of which are half-breed families, living in the Townsite, and sometimes on relief.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit hereunder a report covering the month of January 1939.\n\nA matter that came up for attention this month was that of the local Telegraph Creek Provincial Day School and its overcrowding, with the question who should, and who should not decide as to what Indians might attend.\n\nThis school building is very ancient, and has been already condemned, but as we are so remote from Victoria Headquarters, and take with the fact that practically no Provincial Revenue is taken out of the District, little attention is given or for that matter - can be expected, in regard to a new school building - from the Provincial Authorities \"below\". The number of children in this community is out of all proportion to the size of its townsite, and this means much overcrowding in regards to their home living quarters. In fact to state the matter briefly, the unsanitary conditions of Telegraph Creek are well known to the Provincial Authorities in Victoria, and is the subject of ridicule in Wrangel, S.E. Alaska which is at the mouth of the Stikine River. Over many years efforts have been made to clear matters up, and all doctors here have during their residence tried to have matters adjusted, but have met with no help whatsoever.\n\nIt now comes to light that matters in regard to Provincial Schools have not been reported upon as they should have been, which resulted in a Circular Letter from the B.C. Authorities, requesting a more detailed reports from the resident doctors concerned. Dr. Hey's copy arrived just at the time the overcrowding was under review at this point, and he has turned in a very urgent, if drastic report on the whole matter. There are at present 43 children attending this school, 16 of whom are Indians, 3 of which are white children, the rest being half-breeds. Their air space is 118 cubic feet per child, which is not enough especially as most of these children are not clean, wear skin shoes and live in very bad home surroundings. Out of the 16 Indian children 12 have to receive tonsil medical attention, and this is urgent, and the other children are in no better shape.\n\nAs far generally is vanishing the outside Indian families in the near district wish to come into town, send their children to this school, and as they cannot support their families apply for relief, and practically live on store provisions. If these families can send their children to other schools, and have even promised to do so, i.e., to the Thalton reserve summer school and the Klappan winter school, an effort was made to restrict their coming into town, with the excuse of using this local school.\nIt certainly is considered that had this agency a Constable attached to this office, all this could have been prevented but a Provincial Constable, even if he would, could not be asked to stop Indian children attending a Provincial School, which might receive some assistance if it were shown that overcrowding existed.\n\nSome \"ruling\" is really needed, for there are other large Indian families herabouts that even now think they have a right to come into this small Townsite for the winters - go without their natural food of meat and fish etc., and with relief send their children to the local Provincial school. Only an Indian Agent, with the help of the resident doctor, should be allowed to pass on such matters in a nomadic Indian district.\n\nIt is also pointed out, which is not necessary, that if this is allowed to continue, the other schools will be depleted of children and will therefore have to close down.\n\nThe matter has been reported upon at length, as it has been coming to a head over the last two or three years.\n\nThe relief question has not advanced to any extent over the month, and with the arrival of June 1st, all relief will be reduced over the coming summer time.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed.\n\nIndian agent.\n\nThe Secretary.\nOttawa,\nMay 27, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your report for the month of April, 1939.\n\nIn the last paragraph of this report you refer to what children should attend the Telegraph Creek school. Possibly when you wrote the report you had not received a copy of official letter of March 27. However, to make certain I am enclosing for your information a copy of that letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B. C.\nVancouver,\n7th Sept., 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith copy of a letter received from His Excellency Bishop Bunoz, dated August 31st, 1939, nominating the following school teachers:\n\n- Dease Lake Day School - John Moran\n- Cariboo Hide \" \" - James Anglin\n- Iskut Day School - Rev. C. Carpentier, O.M.I.\n\nall of which are season winter schools and are not inspected due to difficulty in reaching the localities when they are in session.\n\nI would recommend confirmation of the nomination.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.) S.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOn the evening of the 20th inst. the affairs of the Telegraph Creek Provincial Day school came up for public attention, by the residents, or tax payers of the town. It had been impossible to obtain sufficient number of Tax Payers in the spring time, so therefore the annual Meeting had been deferred until now. During the last 2 years or more, all affairs of the school had been handled by the local Government Agent, in conjunction with the school's Principal; but more so at the hands of the latter. Due to local conditions etc., matters had arrived in a very bad state as at the Mid-winter term of a year ago; and therefore, to safeguard the Indian children attending, the matter was taken up by this office with the help of the local doctor, Dr. G.W. Meyer, M.D., C.M., now in residence here does not only attend to the requirements of the Indians; but also in the Provincial Medical of Health. Matters were placed in front of him, by this office in a very drastic manner; resulting from complaints laid by the parents of Indian children attending this school. Affairs were found to be in a shocking condition; which eventually resulted in this school house being condemned, as it was. Sanitary matters have since improved, but otherwise matters are to-day as they were.\n\nAt this meeting the Govt. Agent resigned as \"in charge\" of Provincial matters, and a Board of Trustees created. No explanation was given as to why conditions were as they were, nor any information allowed for future improvement. After the meeting, affairs were in the hands of the Tax-Payers, and speaking as at this date, the school is running along - as ever it did.\n\nThe school premises etc. is really no concern of this office except in the case of overcrowding & health matters, and should more Indians live within this Townsite over next winter, overcrowding will be in excess of anything yet achieved- which fact does concern the Indian Office. However, here again, is a very important matter that should receive the consideration of the agency's Inspector upon his visit to these parts during the coming summer, and some very definite rules should be created so that the matter of attendance comes entirely under the authority of the Indian Office; and would not be for the consideration for such local Provincial Authorities as there happens to be. This whole matter has already been reported upon several times; and therefore the following references are given. Ottawa. 150-43-1933. Report to Indian Commissioner, Vancouver, dated November 17th.\n1938. Its reply, with copy of instructions from Gerald H. Barry, Esq., Inspt. of Indian School for B.C., Ottawa 158-5-1. Letter to Ind. Com., Vancouver dated June 22nd, 1939. Dr. Meyer was seen recently regarding the condition of the school, and in so doing, no matter what opinions are expressed in such quarters, he will have to again back up his medical view - point on Health matters, that the school should be enlarged, or less children in attendance. The Affairs of this school will be again reported upon - under, Education - within the Annual Report about to be rendered.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nTELEGRAPH CREEK - need for day school.\n\nAn Indian day school at this point appears urgent as there a number of Indian families in the vicinity whose children receive no schooling. A few children attend the local Public School. This question will be fully investigated and reported on fully at a later date.\n\nR.H.S. Sampson,\nActing Indian Agent.\nTelegraph Creek, Aug. 8th, 1941.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON STIKINE AGENCY FOR MONTH OF JUNE 1941.\n\nOn the 21st inst. Bishop Coudret O.M.I., of the R.C. Missions arrived for his yearly inspection of the Cassiar. All matters were again gone over with him, and the various Seasonal schools were taken in hand and teachers and supplies arranged for. Later these were reported upon, but it is doubtful just at present if it will be possible to have a teacher go out to the Caribou Hide school. However the Department have been good enough to allow the sum of One hundred dollars towards getting the much needed freight out to that point, and the matter is now receiving attention as to the possibility of engaging a plane for such work. During the interview, some mention was made that a lot of local children were living within the Township during the winter, and did not attend the local Provincial school, and that if the local R.C. Mission could start up a small winter school at this point, many children would certainly attend. It was at once pointed out that should this be entertained matters in the Township would certainly become worse than they are at present; and the object of our Bush Winter schools would be entirely nullified. Eventually His Lordship agreed that such was the case, and it is hoped the matter is settled again, for some time to come. Telegraph Creek is certainly no place for an Indian winter school.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian agent.\nStikine, Telegraph Creek, B.C.\nMarch 15th, 1941.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit hereunder, a Report covering the Agency's activities, over the month of January 1941.\n\nAs already reported, we have at this point a new Provincial Government Agent, R.W. Meldram Esq., and being quite up to date, has been looking over antiquated affairs; one of which is the local Provincial School. The building has been condemned as unfit for present usage, but as the district is poverty-stricken, and the Provincial Authorities cannot see their way clear as yet to build a new School-house, it has to be retained in operation for a time yet. The number of children in this community, mostly half-breeds far outnumber the accommodation possible, so that a state of general unrest is prevailing. Some of our Indian children about Town are attending, but mostly are not; and little can be done about the matter at present. Mr Meldram kindly called a meeting in his Office during the month, and taking all details possible is reporting the present state of affairs to his Department, when it is hoped some assistance can be received. This Matter will be further reported upon when the School Reports covering the Agency's various schools, is being submitted.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\nTelegraph Creek, B.C., Aug. 14, 1940.\n\nREPORT ON STIKINE AGENCY FOR MONTH OF JULY.\n\nOn the 13th inst the yearly school board meeting was held, or was to be held, for the local Provincial Day school, but so few local persons took an interest in this affair, that it was impossible to call the meeting to order. The situation in this Townsite is extreme. Most of the children attending this school are halfbreeds, or straight Indians; and therefore the parents cannot take a lively interest. Moreover these half-breeds are living from hand to mouth, even more so than our Indians, whilst many do not live in the Townsite and so do not pay taxes etc. This is certainly one place in British Columbia at which the Provincial School authorities should take the whole matter upon themselves and supply the necessary housing and equipment to carry on their Provincial School education. This community simply cannot shoulder the expenses now necessary to place this school in a sanitary and well running condition. However a report on this school was submitted to the department, pointing out the difficulties encountered in making all our Indian children attend this school regularly, during the winter times when they reside within the townsite.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nTelegraph Creek, Provincial Day School.\n\nAbout a dozen Indians bought lots in the Town of Telegraph Creek and those with children have been taking advantage of the Provincial Public School, there being three children in attendance at the present time, all Anglicans, for whom the usual grant is paid by the province, also two others living in Telegraph Creek not entitled to the grant.\n\nThe children usually in attendance are given by the Teacher as follows:\n\n- Ganga Reserve:\n  - Jonas Nehass - Age 10\n  - Herbert Nehass - Age 10\n  - Joseph Nehass - Age 6\n\n- Telegraph Creek:\n  - Doris Brooks - Age 15\n  - Iris Brooks - Age 13\n  - Alma Brooks - Age 11\n  - Hubert Brooks - Age 10\n\nThe present teacher, Mr. J.W. Hughes, an ordained Anglican is considered by Mr. Inspector Barry to be very competent.\n\nI visited the school on September 30th and find that it consists of a log building 30' x 28' x 8'6 inside walls, with teacher's residence above. It is in very poor condition. There are three windows in each side of the class room, loose for want of caulking around the frames, while the inside of the room is lined with metal sheeting; these conditions make it very draughty and in the very low sub-zero winter temperatures the single box stove is quite inefficient. All the 115 cubic feet air space per pupil in inadequate, likewise the window lighting. The only ventilation is from the wall and window leakages. The roof of the building is corrugated iron and leaks in several places.\n\nFive fires have occurred in the building in recent years. Sanitation consists of two dilapidated latrines. Due to general conditions of the building colds among the pupils are very prevalent, with the usual lowering of resistance of the Indian pupils to pulmonary affections.\n\nDesk accommodation consists of 39 good single desks and 5 old double desks for an average attendance of about 40 pupils but a considerable increase during the winter months.\n\nThe Provincial Government and School Trustees are most anxious to close the school to Indians for the reason that it is not able to accommodate all the local white children, but feel that they are unable to do so legally.\n\nSuggested Indian School.\n\nThe situation existing here of a number of Indians living in a Provincial town, hardly any of which offers a decent building\nsite and only partly supplied with domestic water for half the year, entirely without sanitation, is bound to give rise to strong criticism. The Indians are discouraged from improving their homes as it results in an increase of taxes. Conditions are particularly wretched on the section known as \"Dry Town\" which is without water, except when obtained by clambering up and down an almost sheer rock cliff, probably 200' high, to the Stikine River, which is very muddy. Adjoining the townsite is the Cassco Reserve, a high bench, obtaining far more sunlight in the winter than the town and having excellent possibilities for a well-located domestic water system at a very low cost. The reason that it has not been settled on is undoubtedly due to Mr. Reid's arbitrary refusal to permit Indians to build homes in the vicinity of the town, with the mistaken idea that it would drive them out into the bush in the winter. If they were all trappers with traplines there might have been some reason for this attitude, but even then it is not the wish of every Indian to take his wife and young children out on the trail and often this is not possible or desirable for medical reasons.\n\nThe solution to the problem is to build a school on the Reserve, complete with teacher's residence. This would undoubtedly result in the Indians leaving the townsite, particularly if domestic water were made available (vide report on Cassco Reserve). In addition to the advantages of our own educational system for Indians and many more children being educated, I would expect a considerable improvement in health and eventual reduction of necessity of relief and medical attention.\n\nThe present set up is that we have 35 children, 9 being of school age and 16 under age, all Anglicans, on the Cassco Reserve; 18 of school age and 13 under age, resident in Telegraph Creek Townsite, all Anglicans; and 33 of school age and 35 under age, resident in the summer months on the Reserve on the Stikine River opposite the Townsite. This sums up as 37 Anglicans of school age, now resident practically all the year round and 32 Catholics during the summer.\n\nIt would be practically impossible to get both an Anglican and a Catholic teacher to teach for half a year each, owing to the difficulty of access to the Agency and the high cost of living. I would suggest that the difficulty could be overcome by employing an undenominational teacher for the full year, holding school for the Anglicans from November 1st to April 30th (6 months) and for the Catholics from May 15th to October 31st (5\u00bd months). The Catholics are all from the Klappan area and this proposal would make the present winter school there unnecessary. The respective missionaries could be given full access during their respective periods, for reasonable religious instruction.\n\nSuch a school should provide accommodation for forty pupils as the attendance is likely to increase owing to the number of children now under school age. It should be provided with living quarters as there is no accommodation whatever in the townsite. Due to the high cost of living at this point, the salary should be at least $1000.00 per annum, preferably $1300.00. The absence of a qualified practitioner places us in a very serious position during the winter, Dr. Meyer now having resigned. Even if a doctor can be secured, which is doubtful, he is seriously handicapped in operative work without an assistant. This combination would offset any objections to the undenominational aspects of the school by either religious body.\nThe following is a survey of the churches covered in this review, all being of the Tahltan Band:\n\n**Telegraph Creek School Survey**\n\n| Red Brooks Family | Mrs. Dennis Hyland (widow) |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Doris             | Helen                        |\n| Iris              | Doreen                       |\n| Alma              | Anglican                     |\n| Herbert           | Annie                        |\n| Henry             | Charles                      |\n| Elizabeth         | Mona Etzema                  |\n|                   | Child                        |\n|                   | Anglican                     |\n|                   | 6 months                     |\n\n| John G.

It might be advisable to allow an extra $1,000 on the cost owing to freight; my first figure is based on the fact that it cost the Hudson's Bay Company about $6,000 to erect their residence four or five years ago, the construction being similar to that suggested. The school would not be very much larger. The Pemberton Indian Day School is an excellent layout for this type of school and residence.\nThe provision of a one-room day school with teacher's residence, as recommended by Mr. Coleman, would appear to be necessary to meet requirements at Telegraph Creek. This project should be given consideration as soon as funds can be provided.\n\nThis report indicates a careful investigation by Mr. Coleman of conditions among the Indians of the Stikine Agency and contains a great deal of information which should be most helpful in improving our administration of the Indians in that remote section of British Columbia.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nFebruary 11, 1948.\n\nDear Bishop Coudert:\n\nWe have your letter of the 5th instant with reference to the seasonal schools of Sheshley, Klappan and Telegraph Creek.\n\nWe appreciate your thoughtfulness in forwarding the information contained in your letter. It is noted that Father E. Turenne will be at Sheshley during January, February and March and Father J.

Forget has been teaching in Telegraph Creek from Oct. 16 to Dec. 31, at the request of the local Agent, and has sent a Quarterly Report of his work to your Department; I hope that a salary will be paid to him for that work.\n\nThe situation at Telegraph Creek is not quite clear, and I cannot well see, so far, from communications received whether or not the Seasonal Schools of Klappan and Sheelay can be operated this winter. It appears that the only school reasonable this winter in that Agency would be the one started in Telegraph Creek, at the request of the Agent, by Father Forget. It might be continued under the name of either the Sheelay School or the Klappan School, until the situation clears up; I intend to fly over there in March; meanwhile I would like to have your opinion on the matter, so as to instruct our Fathers what to do; no doubt you must have had extensive communications on this situation from Agent Samson.\n\nThe other schools of Prophet River and Burwash Landing are operating normally thanks to the cooperation of both the local Agents and the population with the local missionaries.\n\nYours sincerely in Christ\n\nJ.L.

Neary\nSupt.of Welfare & Training\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nI am in receipt of your communication re the Seasonal Schools of the Stikine Agency.\n\n1.-Shesley School.-In order to comply with the urgent request of Agent Simpson two years ago, we opened with much difficulty the School at Shesley. As I told you in previous correspondence, our last year experience at that point was indeed very hard and almost disheartening; but our missionaries realized that it was only beginning, and they were fully decided to make of it a success. In view of that, I sent three priests to Telegraph Creek last summer with the intention of getting the Shesley School going properly. As you will know, our plans were all upset last Fall, just as our missionaries were getting ready to start out for Shesley, and the Indian Agent requested permission to open a School at Telegraph Creek.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Indians having now returned to Shesley, after New Year's, our fathers decided to go there; they are now at Shesley, and as communications are almost impossible with that point except through special charter of airplane or dogteam, we shall not know the results of this second attempt until they come back in the spring.\n\nBy that time, the Branch will be in a better position to take a final decision concerning the future of said school. I think that it was only fair both to the Indians concerned and to our missionaries to make this second attempt, after all the expenses already incurred, before deciding to close such a school.\n\n2.-Klappan School at Telegraph Creek.-In regard to the School opened last Fall in Telegraph Creek, also at the urgent request of the Agent, I was surprised at your unfavorable report. Father Forget, the teacher, appeared to have been quite pleased with the results so far, and he stated in his last correspondence that he had 35 Catholic Indian Children around Telegraph Creek who were benefitting by said school.\n\nOf course, if you would know the local conditions in Telegraph Creek, you could not expect the attendance to be as good as in remotest places, where the Indian families live around the school and have no distraction of any kind.-The village of Telegraph Creek is located at the bottom of a canyon, with dwellings scattered in an area of several miles extending as far as the summits of the surrounding hills; with the icy condition of the trails and the darkness prevailing in winter time, many children are bound to miss the morning period. Moreover the many local amusements and other attractions detaining the parents and preventing them from...\nVICARIATE APOSTOLIC OF WHITEHORSE\n\ngoing to bed until late at night do not favor evidently the early rising of the children.\n\nNotwithstanding all that, owing to the expenses we have gone through in transforming our little local church into a school, I advised Father Forget to continue on teaching at Telegraph Creek this winter as long as he would have a reasonable amount of children in attendance.\n\nThe Kluane school being closed for lack of Indians at that place is another reason why I advised to keep the Telegraph Creek school opened.\n\nIn a few weeks I am going to fly into Telegraph Creek, and will by that time be in a better position to report more accurately on the whole situation. I expect to be there until the latter part of March.\n\nOwing to the difficulties of communication with Telegraph Creek, I doubt whether all the children of school age will be able to be recruited for the Teslin School from that area, outside of the orphans and destitute children unless they are brought in Teslin by special chartered plane every summer and fall. Plane communications are indeed the only normal communications with that part of our Vicariate Apostolic. Even if they are sent by boat via Wrangell in Alaska, they will not be able to travel by boat from Wrangell to Skagway\u2014the only passenger boats in that part of the Alaskan panhandle being Canadian steamers, which are forbidden to carry passengers from an American port to an American port. When our missionaries travel this way, they have to fly from Wrangell to Skagway, and then take the train from Skagway to Whitehorse. The only direct communication from Telegraph Creek to Teslin is, therefore, by air, and everything considered, it is the shortest and cheapest way.\n\nThis communication problem between Telegraph Creek and Teslin will have to be thoroughly studied and settled by the Officials of the Branch when the Boarding School at Teslin is in operation next year.\n\nHoping that the above information will prove useful to you and the other Officials of the Branch to enable you to understand the unique situation of that part of the country, I assure you once more of my earnest desire fully to cooperate with the Branch for the welfare of the natives of our Apostolic Vicariate.\n\nYours sincerely in Christ,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop J.L.

The school only lasted three months, and had to be discontinued on account of the Indians returning to their various hunting grounds during the course of the winter.\n\nTo my knowledge, so far as our books are concerned, no rent was as yet collected for the use of our buildings during those three months in Telegraph Creek, B.C. (Stikine Agency).\n\nAs to this winter, our fathers have prevailed upon the Indians to return early to their hunting ground of Klappan, and they accompanied them in the first week of November, so as to be able to teach steadily until next April; they should be able to put in five or six months of schooling at Klappan; I have already included the two months of November and December, wherein the school has been already opened.\n\nN.B.-Father Forget, at the date of Dec.10, complains that he has not yet received the Refund I applied for, when I visited you in Ottawa last October.\n\nFathers Morisset and Drea have not yet received their cheques for their schooling of last summer; I advised them to write to you directly, when sending their Forms T.D.1a for 1949.\n\nKindly have the cheques for the School Rent made out directly to \"The Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Whitehorse\", so that in my absence to Europe, the Secretary of our Corporation may endorse them and put them in our account; right now, our Corporation is in an urgent need of that money to pay the bills of our new Residence here in Whitehorse. I hope, therefore, that there will not be too much delay in the settlement of those accounts.\n\nThanking you again for your kindness, and wishing you a most Happy and successful Year in all your undertakings, I remain, Dear Mr.Phelan,\n\nYours very sincerely in Christ\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.,\nApril 13, 1949.\n\nW.S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Comm'r. for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Telegraph Creek School Board, which operates a two-room elementary school here, the suggestion was made that a combined school for white and Indian children might be operated here to advantage. The Board agreed to take the matter up with the Provincial Education Department to see if they approved of such a step.\n\nThe request for the School Board's opinion on this subject was motivated by the need for providing schooling for some twenty-five to thirty Indian children living in the vicinity of Telegraph Creek. This number is in addition to fifteen Indian children whose parents are tax-payers and who are therefore entitled to attend the provincial school.\n\nThe Province made an attempt to build a school here last year, but through shortage of materials were unable to go through with the project. They realized that the small, unsuitable school here was inadequate to properly take care of the growing needs in the locality. Both class-rooms are presently crowded, and one of the rooms is entirely unsuitable for the purpose. It is therefore going to be necessary to provide increased space for the ever-growing attendance list, or deny schooling to some of the children. Obviously the Indian children will be the first to suffer.\n\nAs it appears the Department is not contemplating establishing an Indian day school here, it is felt they might consider constructing and operating a combined white and Indian school with the Province. If there is any possibility of such a step it is respectfully suggested that the Superintendent of Education at Victoria be contacted directly as the local School Board is placing the matter in his hands for consideration.\n\nR.H.S. Sampson, Indian Supt.\nVictoria, B.C.\nJuly 4, 1949.\n\nDr. F.T. Fairey,\nDeputy minister and\nSuperintendent of education,\nDepartment of education,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs instructed by you, I visited Telegraph Creek to investigate the question of school accommodation at that point. I arrived in Telegraph Creek on the evening of June 22 and remained there until the evening of the twenty-third. As a result of my inspection of the school, followed by a very complete survey of the town-site, an investigation of the probable attendance figures for the next five years, and a meeting with the local School Board, I wish to submit the following report.\n\nPresent School Accommodation.\n\nThe school enrolment in September 1948 was 79 with 77 pupils attending fairly regularly throughout the year. At the time of my visit 71 pupils' names were being carried on the school roll. The variation in school attendance figures is due to the migratory nature of some of the Indian families.\n\nTwo teachers are employed by the board neither of whom have had any teacher training. The work of the grade one teacher is quite commendable. I was not satisfied with the work being accomplished by the teacher of the senior room.\n\nThe school accommodation available is appalling to the degree that it is beyond description. Forty-nine pupils are enrolled in the senior room which occupies the class room space on the ground floor. The dimensions of this class room are 20 ft. by 31 ft. with considerable space taken up in the centre of the room by a chimney and barrel type heater. Pupils are seated in double and triple desks. Lighting is totally inadequate.\n\nThe attic of the school which was formerly used as a teacher's residence is now used to house the grade one pupils who range in age from 6 to 12 years. Access to this room is secured by means of a very steep stairs attached to the rear of the school. The dimensions of this room are 12 ft. by 31 ft. with a ceiling height varying from 5 ft. 6 in. at the sides to 7 ft. 8 in. at the centre. The chimney and barrel type heater located in the centre of the room occupy a great part of the floor space. TWENTY-TWO youngsters are taught in this room. Conditions of sanitation and of fire hazard are unbelievable.\n\nTwo ancient and small privies are available to the school. No washing facilities are available. During summer the children may drink from a small stream of water at the rear of the school.\nThe school grounds measure 100 ft. by 120 ft. with about two-thirds of the area available for the school building and playground. The remainder is extremely steep hillside.\n\n**Estimate of Probable School Attendance.**\n\nThe following probable school attendance figures for the future are based upon information supplied by the teachers as a result of a careful analysis of the population figures for the district made in conjunction with the Indian Agent, Mr. Sampson.\n\n**Estimated School attendance for Sept. 1949.**\n\n| Gr. | No. |\n|-----|-----|\n| 1   | 35  |\n| 2   | 25  |\n| 3   | 15  |\n| 4   | 15  |\n| 5   | 7   |\n| 6   | 3   |\n| 7   | 2   |\n| 8   | 2   |\n| Total | 104 |\n\n**Pre-school age children - Indian.**\n\n| Age | No. |\n|-----|-----|\n| 5 yrs. | 15 |\n| 4 \"    | 6  |\n| 3 \"    | 15 |\n| 2 \"    | 11 |\n| 1 \"    | 13 |\n| Total  | 60 |\n\n**Pre-school age children - White.**\n\nThere are 19 children in this category but their ages were not available without more investigation than time permitted.\n\nIt is difficult to forecast the length of time that the Indian children will remain at school. Estimating the retaining power of the school at a reasonably low rate it is concluded that THREE classrooms will be required for September 1949 and that allowance should be made for a probable extension to four class rooms in 1951 or 1952.\n\n**School Building Program Recommended.**\n\nI would recommend that a three room school be constructed immediately with provision made in the planning for a possible addition of a fourth class room. I am aware that this recommendation raises very considerable problems of (a) suitable site (b) type and method of construction (c) financing. Under these headings I would report as follows:\n(a) Site.\n\nThis is a most difficult problem. The town-site of Telegraph Creek rises abruptly from the river in a series of small benches. Every conceivable method of locating a building on the present site was investigated. It is impossible to find room for three class rooms on the present site.\n\nConsiderable time was spent in covering every available piece of reasonably level ground in the area. I am convinced that there is no satisfactory solution to this problem. Three alternative proposals were suggested to the School Board. The Board unanimously settled on a site immediately above the present school. I am satisfied that this decision is the best that can be made.\n\n(b) Type and method of Construction.\n\nUnder conditions of material supply existing at Telegraph Creek I am convinced that the best type of construction can be secured by using squared timbers. Framing lumber, shiplap, etc., can be cut locally. The owner of the local mill was interviewed and he stated that he would be unable to cut any lumber before August. Cutting should be started immediately. The Public Works own a mill and arrangements might be made to have the work done by the Public Works Department.\n\nI would recommend the following steps be taken:\n\n1. A plan be drawn for a three room school capable of expansion to four rooms. Plumbing cannot be provided but storage facilities for water for drinking and for some fire protection should be included.\n\n2. A capable carpenter-foreman should be employed to go to Telegraph Creek to supervise the building project.\n\n3. The Public Works should be asked to co-operate:\n   (a) To level the grounds.\n   (b) To use their mill to cut the squared timber, dimension, etc.\n\n4. Arrangements should be made to send in material not available in Telegraph Creek.\n\nI am aware that this section of the report is very sketchy. I am prepared to offer more detail regarding construction problems if it is decided to go ahead with this project.\n\n(c) Financing.\n\nBased upon information secured regarding the cost of building the Police Barracks and the Indian Department's Office building I would estimate the cost of building a suitable school might approach $100,000.\n\nAt the present time there are 25 wards of the Indian Department.\nattending school. During the next five years 79 children will enter school of which number 50 will be wards of the Indian Department. It was suggested to me that the number of Indian children might increase when regular and adequate school facilities were available but I have no facts to support this suggestion.\n\nThe figures quoted above would indicate that the Indian Department should be involved in the financing of any school construction undertaken.\n\nIn addition to the problem of school accommodation three other matters were discussed with the Board. These were:\n\n1. Teaching Staff.\n   This school is not receiving good instruction. I suggested the following measures to the Board.\n   (a) That they pay a Northern Living Allowance of at least six hundred dollars per annum.\n   (b) That the present school be used as a teachers residence.\n   (c) That they avail themselves of the offer of Mr. Malziel to fly the teachers from Watson Lake to Telegraph Creek free of charge.\n\n2. Indian Department representation of the School Board.\n   The School Board asked me to transmit to the Department their suggestion that the resident Indian Agent should automatically become a member of the School Board.\n\n3. Payment of a Secretary-Treasurer.\n   The Board wishes to have authority to hire a Secretary-Treasurer at a salary of $30 per month.\n\nThis report has been prepared in the minimum of time. I returned from Telegraph Creek to my home only the day before I had to leave for the Coast. I am submitting the report immediately upon my arrival because of the necessity for an early decision upon the course of action to be taken to meet the situation existing at Telegraph Creek.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nS.J.

(RG 10, Volume 6417, file 849-1, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Telegraph Creek Joint School\n\nFollowing instructions given by Mr. Neary in his letter of July 4th, I approached the Department of Education regarding the establishment of a joint school at Telegraph Creek on July 15th. I attended a meeting with the Deputy Minister of Education and his Executive Assistant. A second meeting, attended by Mr. Superintendent Sampson and myself was held on July 22nd with the Executive Assistant and the Provincial Inspector, Mr. S.J. Graham, who had visited Telegraph Creek with the purpose of inspecting the existing Provincial school and of reporting on the present accommodation and requirements. A copy of his report has been made available to me and I attach it herewith. I shall comment fully on this report at the end of my memorandum, but one point to be noted now is that Mr. Graham has included all Indian children in his figures and has not separated Protestant and Catholic groups. As you are aware, it is the policy of the Provincial Department to admit children to their schools without consideration of \"race, colour or creed\", and its schools operate on non-denominational lines. For a number of years Indian children of both denominations have been attending the\nProvincial school at Telegraph Creek. Now apparently because a new building is to be constructed, a segregation is to take place which will deny the right of attendance of the Catholic group of this Band, which is doubly unfortunate in that it will also segregate part of the Indian population from the white group. This is because the Indian Affairs Branch will not assume the responsibility for the cost of educating the Catholic children in this Provincial school, although it does do so at other points. The reason for this is apparently that at some later date there is likely to be a request for the construction of a separate school for the Catholic children. It will be noted from the attached projection of the school population that the number of white and Protestant Indian children will require a three room school, which can also accommodate the additional number of Catholic children until 1952, when an additional room will be required because of the increase in the Indian population. This addition would have to be financed by our Department. If however the Catholic children were permitted to attend until 1952 and segregated then, the Provincial three room school would be adequate for another five or six years. Since there is little likelihood that our Department will be able to provide separate accommodation for\ntwo or three years it seems that the Indian Affairs Branch should make possible the admission of Catholic children to the Provincial school until such time as it is necessary and possible to provide separate accommodation. Since the Catholic and Protestant Indian children have been attending in past years there does not appear to be any very good reason why such a separation would be any more difficult at that time than at the present. It will be noted that the increase in the school age population is due almost entirely to the increase in the number of Indian children, nor is there any likelihood that this will be changed by enfranchisements as in the past eight years there have been only two or three in the whole of the Stikine Agency. The total school age population represents 55% of the possible enrolment but if the Catholic children are omitted the Indian enrolment will be 44%. It will be noted that the Catholic Indian population is increasing more rapidly than the Protestant group and will in a few years form about one-third of the school population.\n\nIt will be noted from Mr. Inspector Graham's report that his estimate of the school attendance for September 1949 is six higher than my own. This is due to Mr. Graham adopting a more optimistic view of the possible attendance of a family of Indians living at some distance from Telegraph Creek. This\npoint was discussed with the Provincial authorities who are prepared to accept my figures, which were prepared from lists submitted by Mr. Superintendent Sampson and were considered with Mr. Graham on the occasion of our meeting on July 22nd.\n\nSite:\n\nIt will be noted that the Provincial Board has selected a site which they consider most suitable. I might add that I know the location and visited it in June 1948. Both Mr. Sampson and myself are in agreement that this is not only the best possible choice for the white population but is also the most convenient location for serving our Indian population.\n\nType and Method of Construction:\n\nAt our meeting on July 22nd it was decided that the method outlined by Mr. Graham was most suitable. It was decided however that excavation would be made only for the installation of the heating plant. This will reduce the estimated cost of the building.\n\nCost:\n\nIt is not possible to give an accurate estimate of the cost at the present time. However the Provincial authorities expect to be able to give a fairly accurate figure in about two weeks time. It was felt at the meeting with the Provincial authorities that Mr. Graham's estimate of the cost of the building at $100,000 was extremely high in view of the\ntype of construction and the cost of our new Agency building at this point. It will be possible however to check this against the estimate of the architect when the plans are completed.\n\nSummary:\n\nI recommend that our Department make provision for the admission of both denominations of the Indian population in the new Provincial school and if necessary provide a separate school for the Catholic population in about three years time when we would undoubtedly be approached by the Province to bear the cost of an addition made necessary by the increase in the Indian population. This will mean that the Indian Affairs Branch would bear 55% of the cost of construction.\n\nThe Province hopes to begin construction within the next month and for this reason an early reply is required as to whether the Department is agreeable to this basis for an agreement.\n\nR.F. Davey,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools in B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Telegraph Creek School.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of May 25, I am forwarding a self-explanatory memorandum from District School Inspector Davey with the enclosures referred to therein. You will note that the Province intends to commence construction of a 3-room school at Telegraph Creek in about a month's time, and that this building will provide adequate accommodation for the white pupils and the Indian pupils, both Protestant and Catholic, and that the three rooms will probably be adequate for another five or six years.\n\nSince the Catholic and Protestant Indian children have been attending the same schools for the past years, there would appear to be no reason why the arrangement should not be continued on the understanding that in a few years time, when the available pupilage necessitates additional accommodation, a separate school will be provided for Catholic Indian pupils.\n\nWith regard to the cost of the Provincial School building, there can be no doubt that Inspector Graham's estimate is out of all reason, having in mind the type of construction proposed and the cost of the modern framebuilding erected by this department last year for use as an office and clerk's quarters. It is hoped that a definite figure covering cost of the building will be available in a few weeks so that the department's share\u2014based on 55% of the enrollment if the Catholic children are included, or 44% if they are excluded\u2014may be calculated.\nIn closing, I might mention that it was not until this matter was discussed with Mr. Sampson that we realized that Indian children of both religious denominations had been attending the Provincial School for some years, and further that the operation of the proposed 3-room Provincial School is not expected to effect attendance at the Klappan seasonal school.\n\nW.S.

The construction of the proposed new school at Telegraph Creek is to be undertaken by the Provincial Department on a day labour basis. It will be noted that the estimated cost, if labour can be secured in the vicinity of Telegraph Creek, is $50,169. However, if it is impossible to engage labour in the locality the cost may run as high as $65,000. It would seem then that we should make provision in the supplementary estimates for an amount of approximately $35,750, which is 55% of $65,000.\n\nIt will be noted that the Provincial Department does not anticipate that the cost will run as high as $65,000 but wishes to provide for any contingency that might arise.

C.\n\nDear Mr. Davey:\n\nI received a telegram today from Mr. Marr, our Building Supervisor, who is in Telegraph Creek and our closest estimate of the cost of the proposed building and equipment is $50,169. However, the labour situation is not entirely firm and if it became necessary to use Vancouver labour, the cost would be somewhat higher. To be on the safe side, I would suggest that we allow $65,000 for the project and if there is any saving, that would be all to the good.\n\nAs you know, this amount is considerably less than the preliminary estimate that was made in my office several weeks ago.\n\nNaturally, we would prefer to have the Indian Affairs Branch assume 55% of the cost but I understand very well that this will depend upon the decision which will be made from Ottawa.\n\nIf anything can be done to expedite the approval of your Government's share of the total cost, it will be much appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nExecutive Assistant to the Deputy Minister.\n\nreg: sy\nc.c.

Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nExtract from Superintendent Clerk's Quarterly Report dated October 1st.\n\nTelegraph Creek Public School:\n\nDuring the first part of August, construction was started on a new three room modern Public School at Telegraph Creek. The new school will easily accommodate all local white and native pupils. The site of the new school is located adjacent to Telegraph Creek I.R. 6. It is expected that the building will be completed by November 1st. As the local School Board welcomes the attendance of native pupils, it will now be possible to offer an elementary education to all available native children in the surrounding Telegraph Creek area, this coming term.\nW.S. Arneil Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nRE: Telegraph Creek Public School\n\nDuring a recent conversation with the Chairman of the Telegraph Creek School Board this office was informed that it was the understanding of Inspector Graham, Provincial Department of Education that due to the number of native pupils expected to attend the new school together with the fact the Branch was incurring one half of the building costs in this undertaking, a representative should be permanently appointed as trustee on the local School Board, from this office.\n\nThis office has to date received no instructions as to whether or not the Department has made any financial arrangements as suggested by Inspector Graham and the Board has been so notified. However, at the Board's request the undersigned has accepted the appointment with the understanding that upon the appointment of an Indian Superintendent the position of trustee on the Board will automatically be assumed by him.\n\nThe new school is nearing completion and it is expected that within the next two weeks it will be ready to occupy.\n\nMay this office be advised if the Department has any arrangement with the Province in the operation of the new Telegraph Creek Elementary School?\n\nF.M.

If the Provincial Department of Education is anxious to have Indian Superintendents as members of local School Boards I can see no objection but would appreciate the Department's views.\n\nIncidentally we should appreciate being advised at as early a date as possible the extent to which the Department is prepared to participate in meeting the cost of the Telegraph Creek school.\n\n-W.S.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Harper Reed,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nSir,\n\nRe:- Telegraph Creek Provincial Day School,\nDecember Report.\n\nI beg to submit herewith the above report covering\nthe quarter ending December 31st 1940.\n\nAt the end of December there were 14 children in\nattendance at this school. Most of these were from\nHomes within the Townsite, and which parents were\npaying the Town School Tax, and therefore do not\nshow on the submitted Report. The four children\nmarked in red (R) do reside on the near by Casca\nReserve, and were passed as correct to appear on\nthis School Report.\n\nThe 4 Etzerza Children came to Town this Fall and\nreside just outside the Town's Limits, but not on\nthe Indian Reserve. Therefore they do not pay the\nlocal school taxes, and so the Schoolmaster has placed\nthem on his Report, with the hope that they will be\nallowed to pass as Reserve Children.\n\nThe above facts are submitted for the Departments con-\nsideration, but if payment is allowed for children\nof Indian families who will not live on the Reserve,\nthen any indian family could come to Town for the\nwinter, send their youngsters to school, and live\noff the Reserve. This of course, it is considered,\nwould lead to much trouble.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept Mines & Resources\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\nDAY SCHOOL RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Telegraph Creek School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1940.\n\nTeacher: J.

Ferrier dated January 31st, #158-5-3, acknowledging receipt of the December Quarter returns of the Telegraph Creek Assisted Day School and stating that the September Quarter returns had not been received.\n\nI received by the same Mail a second letter Dated February 5th, 1924, Acknowledging the receipt of a Telegram I sent on February 2nd, and stating that Salary and Bonus Totaling $225.00, had been sent on the 29th of January. Mr Pollock by same Mail received Salary #5227, Cheque for the December Quarter, Dated, February 5th, for $150.00, and a Bonus Cheque for same quarter, #2264, $45.00, this latter is based on Instructions contained in your Letter of September 17th, 1923, (#1-1-3) of IO teaching month in the School Year.\n\nThe Salary and Bonus Cheque for the September Quarter as stated in the Letter from Superintendent of Education (February 5th, #158-5-3), amounts to $225.00, is based on a rate equivalent to $60.00, a Quarter, and Mr Pollock maintains that this is the regular salary, despite Instructions received in reply to my letter of December 18th, 1922, File #300429-I., January 13th, 1923.\n\nIn looking over the Annual report of the Department of Indian Affairs for the year ending March 31st, 1923, I note that the only School mentioned...\nmentioned on the statement of combined Public and Indian Schools in British Columbia, is that at Westbank, Okanagan, and the Assisted Day School at Telegraph Creek, is listed as an Indian Day School receiving no support from the Provincial Government.\n\nMr Pollock claims that he is getting $50,00, a quarter under the old rule or $600,00 a Year and he thinks that I am trying to reduce his salary by $100,00. I would be thankful if you would explain the situation to his satisfaction in your reply to this communication.\n\nThe Cheques for the September Quarter have not arrived as yet,\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

The payment of both salary and bonus is made on a basis of ten months in the academic year.\n\nThe December quarter return was received on January 29th, last, and cheques were issued as follows:\n\n| Salary December quarter (3 months) | $150.00 |\n| Bonus \" \" \" (3 \" ) | $45.00 |\n\nThe total amount of salary and bonus, therefore, for the December quarter was $195.00 and net $225.00 as inadvertently stated in my letter of February 5th.\n\nAs you were informed in official letters of January 31st and February 5th, the Department has not yet received any return from this school for the September quarter. If the school was open during that quarter the usual form should be prepared and forwarded through your office. On receipt of this return the teacher would be entitled to one-tenth of his yearly salary, or $50.00. The bonus vote for the fiscal year 1923-24 has lapsed and there may be some difficulty in paying him bonus for the month of September, last, but if a return is forwarded, as stated above, the Department will endeavour to secure for Mr. Pellock the one month's bonus, or $15.00, in addition to the salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

The salary for this school, at least since 1917, has been $600 per annum and I was paid at that rate with bonus for 1922-23. The unfortunate disappearance of last September's Quarterly Report has probably given rise to this mistake which I trust you will see fully adjusted as early as possible.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nR. T. Pollock.\nStikine Agency, B.C.\n\nTelegraph Creek,\nApril 4th, 1924,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of February 5th, #158-5-3, I beg to state that the Salary and Bonus Cheques totaling $225.00, which were directed on January 29th, have not come to hand. The last outgoing mail leaves tomorrow, and there will be no further mail communication until opening of Navigation on Stikine in May. There is one Mail now on the way between Atlin and here, which may arrive on or about the 8th, and the Mail leaving tomorrow will probably reach Atlin on or about April 14th, and return here on the 24th. Possibly these cheques may turn up within the month.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Scott Simpson\nIndian Agent,\nOttawa, April 29, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 4th instant, I beg to say that in a letter dated the 23rd instant, the Department gave Mr. Agent Simpson full information with reference to the salary payment made you for the December quarter. He was also informed in that letter that no return was received from your school for the quarter ending September 30th.\n\nI would point out that the payment made you for the quarter ending December 31st, was in accordance with circular letter of September 17, 1923.\n\nYour salary is at the rate of $500.00 and, on a basis of ten teaching months in the school year, the amount due you for the December quarter was 3/10 of $500.00, or, $150.00, which amount was sent you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nR. T. Pollock, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nIndian Day School,\nTelegraph Creek,\nB. C.\nSchoolhouse,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\n11 April 1924.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMy September Quarterly Report was mailed from here on Oct. 3, but the salary and bonus cheques for that period have not, up to the present, reached me. I reported the matter to the Indian Agent, Mr. W. Scott Simpson, who wired you and had a reply by mail stating that the report had just come to hand and that cheques totalling $375.00 had been forwarded.\n\nThere has been a mix-up somewhere as the report referred to was evidently the December one as the cheques received were clearly marked December Quarter and were for $150 and $45 respectively and these even were not in accordance with the new salary regulations issued in the communication of Sept. 17, 1923.\n\nI trust that you will make the necessary enquiries as I am now afraid the cheques have been miscarried in the mails.\n\nI am, Yours faithfully,\n\nR. T. Pollock\nOttawa, October 13th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, addressed to Mr. Sutherland of this Department, regarding the amount of salary which you received as teacher of the Telegraph Creek combined white and Indian school for the school years 1922-23 and 1923-24.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department's share of salary paid to the teacher of this school is at the rate of $500, only, per annum. I find that for the school year 1922-23 (Sept. 1, 1922, to June 30, 1923) you were paid a total of $497.50, a deduction of $2.50 being made on account of the school having been open during the September quarter (1923) a period of only 19 days out of 20 teaching days. As the day lost was Labour Day no deduction should have been made. You are, therefore, entitled to the amount withheld, viz: $2.50, and a cheque for this amount will be sent you under separate cover. This payment will complete the full salary of $500 provided for the school year ending June 30, 1923.\n\nFor the school year, September 1, 1923, to June 30, 1924, you were paid the full salary allowed, viz: $500.\n\nYou are in error in assuming that the Department's share of salary is at the rate of $600 per year. As stated, only $500 per year is provided.\n\nA cheque for $15, being the bonus due for the quarter ended September 30, 1923, was sent you in care of Mr. Agent Simpson, on the 9th ultimo. As previously explained, the bonus was discontinued in the case of teachers in combined schools from the 1st of April, 1924, the beginning of the present fiscal year.\n\nYou completed to June 30, 1924, 2 full years' teaching service, and the payment of $2.50 referred to above will complete your full salary at the rate of $500 per annum for each of these years.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. T. Pollock, Esq.,\nTelegraph Creek,\nB.C.\nSchoolhouse,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\n25 Sept. 1924\n\nJ. D. Sutherland Esq.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt from Mr. Dilleyburn, Victoria, of a copy of your letter dated Aug. 15, 1924 with reference to his no. 15/3283 of Aug. 8 regarding complaint about my salary.\n\nIn the latter part of the second paragraph you state that previous to Sept. 1, 1923 I was \"paid in quarterly instalments of $125.00 each quarter.\" That statement I emphatically deny as the undernoted figures clearly indicate.\n\n| Year | Month       | Salary Cheque No. | Bonus Cheque No. |\n|------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| 1922 | Sept (one month) | $47.50            | 2410             |\n|      | Dec.

(RG 10, Volume 6417, file 849-3A, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nI am duty here at the usual time specified in the Manual of B.C. School Law and for your information quote from the Rules and Regulations, page 54, art. 2 clause 2 (a).\n\n\"In all schools throughout the Province the summer vacation shall cover the period between the last Friday in June and the Tuesday immediately following the first Monday in September\". The first Monday in Sept. being Labor Day is, of course a legal holiday; there were 19 school days in that month of 1922 and School was held on each occasion. You will notice I was paid $47.50 for this month, a deduction, evidently, of $2.50 being made for some reason.\n\n$47.50 + ($2.50) x 12 = $600.00\n\nAgain your attention is directed to the Dec. March and June quarters following at $150.00 per quarter.\n\n$150.00 x 4 = $600.00.\n\nAnd further as I happen to be rather a keen follower of Federal Affairs in general and political issues in particular I find that on consulting the Auditor-General's Report for 1922-23, part I, Indian Affairs Dept., sessional paper on Indian Education, page I-89, there is a statement of the salary paid me for 4 months to December 31, and the figures given are $147.50 and which tally exactly with my own. The same page also gives the bonus for 7 months to March 31, as $105.00 which is likewise correct. Therefore on the Department's own evidence...\nIt is very clear that for the school year 1922-23 I was paid at the rate of $600.00 per annum.\n\nFor the past two years at the rate of $600 p.a. I should have been paid up to the present a total of $1200.00 salary but only received $447.50 leaving a balance still due me of $202.50 plus the unpaid bonus.\n\nI did not receive a number of letters regarding the forwarding of a duplicate copy of my Sept. (1913) Report supposed to have gone astray in the mail.\n\nThe first intimation of the report being missing came from Mr Scott Simpson, who rushed up to the schoolhouse to inform me of this and I immediately sat down and in his presence made out a duplicate as requested. That same afternoon on receiving my mail at the P.O. I found a letter from Mr Russell T. Ferrier containing a similar request but his letter was dated April 24 whereas Mr Scott Simpson's bore a date six days previous. Both letters were received by the same mail and the duplicate report was promptly sent off by the first available mail this probably reaching you about June 6, as stated in your letter; the second letter I had was dated June 5 and again asked for a duplicate report but as that had already gone forward I ignored this letter for that and other reasons. This missing report seems to be a mystery and it is almost impossible to conceive that in a well regulated office it should take over six months to\nmake the discovery whilst in the interval another quarterly report had been received and the salary paid; it appears to me that there has been gross laxity in some quarters. The bonus statement in this paragraph is paltry in its pecuniary and why should I be, in any case, the victim of the vagaries of the mail service.\n\nYour final paragraph would appear to be a reflection on my powers of understanding but although I have been engaged in the scholastic profession for over 30 years I do not think that my faculties have yet become so impaired as to unfit me for doing a simple mental calculation in multiplication.\n\nBefore taking any further steps I shall await, with interest, your reply which ought to reach me about the third week in December (first winter mail).\n\nI am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. J. Pollock,\nTeacher\nOttawa, September 9, 1924.\n\nWITH CHEQUE.\n\nSir,-\n\nIn official letter of April 23rd, last, you were advised that the Department would be unable to pay bonus to Mr. R. T. Pellock, teacher of the Telegraph Creek Day School, for the quarter ending September 30th, 1923.\n\nThe Department has just secured an Order-in-Council authorizing the payment of this amount for the quarter mentioned and a cheque for $15.00 is enclosed. Please forward same to Mr. Pellock.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Davies,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. S. Simpson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek,\nB.
